gb932e,1,2020-04-30,How To Handle My College Choice?,FlourSpice,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gb932e/how_to_handle_my_college_choice/,"Hi all! Sorry this is so long- I started typing and all this came pouring out. There's a tl;dr at the bottom. 

So I decided to go to my state school to study plant science in hopes of having a career in the urban ag industry someday (think aerofarms- it's really quite interesting!). I chose this school for three (main) reasons:

1. The internship opportunities and research. This school is one of two (the other being cornell, which i got a transfer option from after my first year) doing research with this huge hydroponic grower. I was able to meet and talk with a super receptive professor and he said they've had lots of students (grad and undergrad) being able to intern/work/research with them. The whole point of college is to get a job, right? And this seemed like a pretty clear path to that! Also, most of the start-ups for urban ag and already established companies are super close to here. 
2. It's my state school, so I get to be close to home and I already know some people there. It was the only school I got to attend accepted students day for, and I also had a friend invite me down to spend two days with her there. We ate lunch, got to see a great play, and looked around the campus and the general area, including their community gardens. I  felt like I could see myself really living there. I've been away from home before, and for the most part it was fine, BUT there was this one intensive summer program I did and guys, shit hit the fan at week two! I don't know why, but I became really depressed and anxious. I stayed in bed, gained like five pounds, and moped a lot. I've attended therapy and I know how to handle myself now, but I'm still a little worried. My state school? I could see myself being really comfortable there. Worst case scenario, my home is 45 minutes away. 
3. I spoke to some of my program's students, and they all said they had a great experience. In addition, I'm in the honors program for this college, which means I get more access to major-specific research and such. 

Some more minor reasons: it's diverse, it has off-campus housing that I'm interested in, I can come and see my extended family whenever they come to visit with relative ease, and if there's ever an emergency (global pandemic, cough cough) I can be home within the hour. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Kerfuffle: At first, I was happy with my choice. I made plenty of pros/cons lists and emailed several professors. My parents said they were too, but my mom seems a little taken aback. She keeps bringing up all these ""great"" schools my classmates are going to, and every time I mention roommates or something, she looks like she bit a lemon. When I announced it was where I was going, there was no celebration. Just ""okay, card's on the table for the enrollment fee."" Fine, my friends hyped me up just great, anyway. 

Also, this happens to be the school my boyfriend is attending. But it's not like that! We've literally only been dating for a couple of months. We applied before we even started dating, we're on completely different campuses, and we had a talk about us attending. We just agreed it be a little weird, but we'd see how it went. I'm pretty logical, and he knows that. No hard feelings.

It's a state school. It's not very prestigious, the professors are known to work the kids, and it's in ""the armpit of america."" I was offered admission to other universities, the best being Purdue Honors College, but to be honest- I didn't apply to Purdue. My mom did. The questions were the same as Penn State, she changed the name, I wrote a lil blurb, and it was on its way. But Purdue is 15 hours away and also quite far from any major cities. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I figured, I can always go there or to Cornell for grad. Hell, I could even transfer. Why not just save the money and go state?

But now I'm worried. My mom hasn't really come around. I see all of my classmates getting into these really great schools and my mom being happy for them, and I'm honestly a little jealous. I worked really hard throughout high school and I ended up exactly where my classmates, some of who worked not-quite-as-hard, ended up. My boyfriend jokingly mentioned that our mutual friend told him that ""I was going there just for him"" (my bf assured him that wasn't the case), and at first I was like ""oh haha, but no."" But I've gotten questions from other friends just like that. 

Today, I met one of my new coworkers. He went to the university I'm planning on attending and he's working almost the same job I am. My mom keeps sending me these things about the college's strict grading policies and how about the other colleges I could have gone to are letting things slide and lowering tuition. 

I didn't regret my decision, I still don't, I think. But it's hard not to let snide comments and worries worm their way under my skin. I get more anxious- was this just my comfort choice? Did I subconsciously do it for my relationship (doubtful, but still!)? Am I just some dumb kid who fucked their life over? 

**tl;dr:  I went with my state college. I'm feeling a little paranoid about my college choice and would like some advice about how to a. feel more secure or b. fix my mistake. Or you can just be like ""stop over-analyzing! Jfc! It's not that deep!"" (but if you want to say it a lil nicer, that'd be cool)**

Any comments are appreciated. Sorry this is so long. Hope y'all are doin alright."

I’m pretty new to this subreddit so I hope I’m posting this in the right place, but let me know if I’m not so I can take it down. 

I’m a CS student in my junior year of college. So far my strengths are in C programming and Java as that’s what I’ve learned in school, I also have an internship where I do iOS development in Swift and Objective-C. 

The only other language I’ve been learning is Python but I know I need to start building up my resume for when I graduate so I wanted to know from all you programmers what I should probably look into if I want to become a software engineer. Any recommendations would be great and if you know the best place to learn it that would be appreciated as well. 

And as bonus, I’ve also been interested in learning more about robotics so any advice there would be cool too. 

Thanks so much!"

Hi everyone — 

Unfortunately I was laid off from my company due to the impact of COVID-19, along with almost 30% of the company. Scary times, but I am motivated to keep pushing forward. 

My company I was working at was a SaaS based company that sold a low-code web development tool and also a live streaming tool. When I was initially hired, my title was “IT Support Specialist” and I did everything from providing internal support to the employees and being the “IT” guy. After about 5 months of learning the IT processes - they approached me and asked if I wanted to be a part of their Customer Software Support team, which would entail helping customers with their questions about the product. Since the IT was sort of slow, I figured I would take the opportunity. 

I had a training period where I learned the ins-and-outs of their SaaS product and master it. Master it enough to answer customer tickets, be on live chat support, hop on phone calls with the sales team. I REALLY enjoyed this. I enjoyed working with customers and representing the brand, helping different companies achieve their goals with their products. I also liked being pulled into calls with the Sales/Customer Success team as a “technical contact” to explain or demo the product. I wrote technical documentation for the software. Maintained relationships with customers on projects. 

I was able to collaborate with Engineering team and Development team when certain bugs came up on the software and pick up some basic HTML and CSS tricks along the way. I learned that the software was hosted on AWS and I really wanted to get AWS certifications to see if I can branch out and maybe help on the backend side.... but this all came to an end when I was laid off. 

My resume is very Desktop Support / IT Support heavy due to all the internships and part time stuff I did while I was in college. Once I got my degree in Computer Information Systems - I started at that SaaS company and began to realize that my love for IT Support wasn’t there anymore. 

I am trying to find a new role and getting contacted by recruiters, but they are for Help Desk positions. I am trying to break away from Help Desk and hopefully stay in the SaaS space. I was thinking about getting the AWS Cloud Practitioner and Azure Cloud Fundamentals certifications (I have a lot of downtime to study for these) to sort of beef up my resume. 

Here is my resume to get an idea of my experience: https://imgur.com/gallery/oDUYFRg

Does anyone have any advice? I can PM you my LinkedIn

Any help is appreciated... I’m going through a rough time right now."

Student !,zoro_458,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/gbaw9x/advice_needed_please_help_student/,", there everyone I am new to the Forumn. A bit about me. I am living and studying in London currently at a target business school called CASS business school and my degree is in Investment and financial risk management. I have just completed my first year of studies however my final exams got canceled due to corona. I decided to post this because I have 0 ideas of what to do career-wise. our university teaches us a lot of stuff but does not delve too much into the different types of sectors etc (i assume they were going to do that this term lol)

So essentially I have 3 main questions to ask you guys today, as I am sure you're much more knowledgeable than me. So essentially the idea of IB / PE / HF / VC all appeal to me actually and all seem interesting in their own rights, however, private equity seems to interest me the most. Unfortunately, I have heard it is very very very very x10^27 difficult to get into and so usually they don't hire from undergraduate but rather just recruit from people who have done the IB analyst program. Since my business school and course, in particular, are quite good at churning out graduates that land roles at IB analysts especially banks like GS, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, etc, I was aiming to go to one of these.

My first question is how do I go about getting an internship next summer? I already jotted down some ideas such as do insight days, insight weeks, show them my track record for trading as I do some trading on the side as a hobby. I also just done a few excel/python courses online. However, I still feel these are not enough for the IB internship at a BB IB. any suggestions to land that second-year internship at either a PE or IB firm - should I do a course in LBO models?

My second question is regarding what to do after my undergraduate. do I pursue an MBA and do a CFA as well. or should I do something that's more in 'modern' such as a computational finance masters /data science masters that incorporate algorithmic trading / R as well as stochastic financial modeling methods and do this with a CFA? I know I'm young and stupid so what I might say next is controversial but MBAs seem overrated to me. it's literally just the first-year content of a management/finance/accounting/econ degree stuck into one year but banks and PE and Hedge funds seem to love them a lot.... so TLDR MBA + CFA or data science/data analytics + CFA.

My last question is, what if it all goes to shit... say I don't do as well as I have been doing and something terrible happens to my grades and I get a 2:2 in the future. is there a way to get into IB from a different job? what other types of jobs are out there that are not PE / HF / IB that are lesser paid but can be a 'springboard' so to speak to eventually get into IB etc. I know someone that got into Goldman after working for a long time at Deloitte. is this common?

Sorry for the long post, but thanks for reading it all"

So as you all can guess from the title of this thread, I am wondering if I can get any ideas from other people regarding what I should or can do for a career. Here is some personal background:

\- I'm 27F living in Australia. I consider myself to be an empathetic and social introvert; depending on the topic of the discussion, I generally like talking with and learning from others, especially if it's about an intellectual topic

\- I have a pharmacy undergraduate degree, and completed the internship and got registered as a pharmacist, worked on and off casually for a couple of years.

\- ended up hating retail pharmacy (because of how monotonous, uncreative it was, plus other reasons) so went back to USYD this year for a bachelor of science degree math major and possibly computer science major (haven't decided on my second major entirely yet)

\- I've always had some form of mathematical aptitude in my life; maths carried me through high school, and I'm currently getting distinction minimums for my maths subjects at the moment

\- my hobbies have always been artistic somewhat; have done past 8th grade piano, liked drawing and writing. Have considered the arts for a career, but decided against it for obvious reasons

\- am trying to make learning programming for 5-10minutes a day into a habit in my schedule at the moment using habit tracker apps to see if I like it in the long run

I have considered teaching, programming, software+other engineering roles, analyst roles, government graduate programs (e.g. department of health, etc). I am just wondering, from what I have revealed to you guys about myself, what else can I do with maths that is suitable for my personality and strengths/weaknesses? Or how should I go about discovering my strengths and weaknesses/learn more about myself to make a career decision?

My problem is career indecision and paralysis; I keep switching back and forth between career choices, and it is not helping my focus at university. I think I am afraid of making the same mistakes that I did with choosing pharmacy.

P.S. Please note, I am not trying to make this into a debate on whether maths is useless or not. I am only wondering what opportunities and possibilities and pathways that maths can give me because I find it all very vague.

Thanks in advance for reading and posting."

We'll be giving students an amazing platform to learn how to do real life projects, master advanced programming concepts, and work under experienced mentors to take projects from ideas to deployment.

We have a team of mentors consisting of college students from the likes of Princeton and UPenn, and professional developers and programmers who will mentor high school student teams. In addition to their guidance, there will also be a fully dedicated tech help team that will be willing to help you out with technical help or fill any communication gaps.

Our hackathon has 8 tracks, each of which can be found on our website, and 1 beginner category where people who are new to programming can test out their skills in a competitive environment over a week. The winner of the hackathon will be offered an internship at [InfoObjects](http://www.infoobjects.com/), a Big Data and IoT based firm operating in the Bay Area.

It would be amazing if you registered as well, and used your current skill level in python to do a real-life projects.

gbeysi,1,2020-05-01,Need advice on degree/career,Tasty-Sample,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gbeysi/need_advice_on_degreecareer/,"Hi. Although it seems like this is a ""which school should I go to?"" question, it's not, and I am interested in how my choice will affect my future career. As some background information, I want to become a software engineer, and I have approx. 5 years of programming experience already.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently have the choice between two schools and I have a few questions for especially hiring managers. One school is T50, the other T100 (both internationally). However, at the national level, both have the same ranking/rating.  T50 has a reputation as an engineering school, but they are mainly known for masters and research, and I will be doing a BSc. Both offer internship opportunities (which I want to take), but T100 seems to have partners at larger international firms, whereas T50 is more of a ""find something yourself"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, I have the following questions, I'm sorry that they are so generalised, and I understand if you can't give concrete answers:

1. I read on reddit somewhere (I cannot find the source, sorry) that employers/hiring managers often like seeing this particular T50 uni on CVs and immediately give them an interview (this was not specific to any level of study/degree, but a general statement). Does the university play a large role when finding a job in software engineering, or is it mainly the experience that matters?
2. Is there anything that hiring managers look out for when it comes to internships at universities? Do they prefer large, well known firms? 
3. The T50 appears to be more intense and stressful. If I went for the T100, and spent the extra time working on pet projects (some things I enjoy personally, as well as maybe freelancing) and of course continuing to learn and improve my skills, would this boost my portfolio in any way?

Thank you for reading and have a nice day."
gbfhng,208,2020-05-01,I found the journal of a Church pastor from the 1200s. The Pied Piper is real.,potato_on_puberty,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gbfhng/i_found_the_journal_of_a_church_pastor_from_the/,"The stories we hear as children, the ones that cross ethnic and geographical boundaries, that jump ship and swim to the nearest lands searching for vivid imagination to survive on - are the ones that stay with us. They scratch and claw and batter their way to the top, reigning unforgettable in some oft irrelevant corner of our minds. The story of Alice lost in Wonderland, of Pinocchio and his wooden nose, of the Pied Piper and his entrancing melodies.

But there is truth to absurdity, a single kernel awaiting a jolt of curiosity-fed flames to burst open; to throw away its pale veneer of fiction, and bask in the sodden sunlight of reality. 

And so it was with the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin. That strange, motley-donned figure that traipsed up to the country of plague-stricken Germany and rid an entire village of its rats. When his payment was refused, he lifted his magic flute and played a tune that enchanted the minds of the children of the town - and lead them to their end. A fitting story that tells of the perils of reneging on a promise.

But the Pied Piper was real. It was no man, nor friendly magician that brought Hameln to its knees, and there were no friendly tunes played on flutes past gabled tithe houses and cattle barns. What it was, I can only assume, and I hope that no man tries more than that.

What I am about to tell you is information I only know through happenstance. Studying history at grade school had given me access to the Archaeological Museum in my city, which just so happened to have a cultural exchange with one of the largest centres of Religious conservation in the world- based out of Berlin. An internship there had brought me in touch with the book I am about to quote to you from - a journal maintained by a man of faith in the Church of St.John's, in what used to be lower Saxony in 1284 AD. It was a mouldy, near-illegible mess of rot and flaky parchment. The once vivid emerald green linen that covered the pages was now a dirty, withering rag, with a single word sewn into it in flowery script.

Bungelosenstrasse.

The Street Without Drums.

It was this that caught my attention, a storybook-like title inscribed onto the cover of a church pastor's journal. I decided to make transcriptions of the text, translate it, and look into it further. If there was ever a mistake I had made in academia before, it paled before this one.

I will now write down what I read there, skipping over the numerous dronings on virtue, sin and hope. Father Adam, as he signed the journal, was a true devout - a man of religious passion tempered with what seemed to be innate human understanding. I am only apologetic for what he had to endure. Faith will save many from a lot, but what is faith in the jaws of that which eludes human comprehension and law? That exists notwithstanding every edict of science and religion?

 There is none that can stand the terror of that which is beyond the realm of mortal comprehension.

-----

Father Adam, 12th June, 1284

"" St. John and Paul's festival draws ever so close, and the parish is festive. The orchards are in their last bloom before autumn, and the skies seem as spun cotton laid out on untouched seas. The tithe hold is full to bursting, but the year has been good and the smallfolk have enough to live by for the season. Winter will not be kind, but the Lord will watch his flock, and they'll receive His Providence as strongly as will the King in his regal robes.

The Mayor has approached me today for confession, and I will hear him. He bears a great burden and I can hope to help him. Edgar and Greta have both sought forgiveness for their elopement and I can only hope that they find it. ""

-----------

Father Adam, 17th June, 1284

""The skies today are plum coloured in the night, like the heavens are bloodied with War. A storm is on the horizon, they say, by the docks over the lowlands. The peasant children have been playing outside less as the chill winds blow. This is strange so early on in the year. The Gythh farm has been completely threshed, and the church waived its cess for the year - the peasants have taken to love their Lord when they are given plenty.

The Mayor's confession was naught more damning than any old lord's. Women and wine, frivolity, and the occasional man in the old townhouse guesthalls. My place is not to judge, but this is a man of too many vices to lead so virtuous a town.

But his next words were what trouble me. He spoke of of a sea of black coming down from the mountains and unto our houses, washing away the wattle, chipping at the stone mills, tearing the flesh from bone in the living. 

'It was a vision in green, Father. Like watching paintings spring to life in polished green stone, striated and striped with darker shades of the same damned strokes. I felt as if I was standing before it, and it's light was darkness and it's shadow was light and nothing was as it should be. But all through this that damned sea ate and ate and there was nothing there but the bones of children and the wood of churlish little houses, standing like naked skeletons in the dark. '

He had turned to me, opened the booth door, and sprang out. When I came out of mine, he looked frightened.

'This is the dream of an overworked mind son. Not a vision of heaven or hell. There is nothing you need to think at length about.'

The Mayor scuttled off after this, and my thoughts since then have been beset with unrest. ""


-----------

Father Adam, 27th June, 1284

"" The storm seems to have let up after almost two weeks. There is still rain, and thunder rings from ashen skies in the west but it seems to be lessening.

The Lady Bowden came down from the keep to see us today. She did not want to give confession, but paid generously unto our coffers. Instead, she asked me for advice with one of her dreams. When she told me of it, I admit having to grasp at my hands to stop them suddenly shaking ; it bore a venomous resemblance to the Mayor's unholy vision.

'I dreamt of being consumed in a shadow Father. Of being eaten whole from the toes up. There was but grief and despair throughout the land, and a writhing, squirming mass of whatever it was that feasted on our flesh and ate of our crops and  turned the very soil thick and viscous. And green, an accursed veneer that clung to the shadows like wet silk on the wrist.'

I told her of the Lord and that it may have been but a vivid imagination roused after stories of war and famine in the heartland. She did not seem satisfied, but bid her farewells and left, her carriage rattling across the rain, lightning framing it by the grey sky. ""

Father Adam, 13th July, 1284

""The rain has not let up. I have asked for the records of the Hall scribes from decades before, and looked through them - no year has seen almost a month of rain in the last half century. Hameln has prospered on the backs of its farms and the fields are beaten down and overrun, nary able to grow more than a tenth of the wheat they are able to. No one is starving yet, and the tithe vault has yet to be open - but I pray that it stays that way.

Heinrich the blacksmith has asked to be baptized again. I will not turn him down, but he's an honest man who lives by the sweat of his brow and I see no need for him to want to turn a new leaf. ""



-----------

Father Adam, 14th July, 1284

""Some strange evil has beset this town. I am not alone in the church, and my minsters live in the quarters on the ground - yet I shake as I write these. My quill is broken and jagged, and the ink has spilled into my sheets for the night.

When I was casting young Heinrich into the basin he told me he was glad to get a second life, because the Devil had had him in his last. When I pushed him to elaborate, he told me what I wish I would never have to hear again.

'I have been having these dreams for a month, Father. Wicked, wicked dreams. The place is Hameln, but it is not now. The trees are dead and grey, the blossoms that would litter the streets are dead and dismal. But I am running up those paths, one among a thronging mass of tens of thousands. I am as a beast, I hunger for flesh to feed me and feed my kindred, and I tear apart the children and women before me with my jaws. We are as one, a flood, the very machination of Hell itself. And we sought only to devour that accursed green-clad world.  '

I had only barely managed to keep from retching until he and his kin left the pews. ""



-----------

Father Adam, 22nd July, 1284

""The rain has carried on now for two score days. The fields are left to the elements, drowning. The streets are now slush and carriages dare not come this way. The tax collectors sent word to say they would collect in the province later. The tithe vault has been opened, the lords have taken nine-tenths of the grain and left the rest for the peasants. The world has fallen so far in a month.

Skies like stone, oh how I wish they could part for the sun just once. ""


-----------

Father Adam, 29th July, 1284

""Seven more of the smallfolk have had the same dreams now. I daresay a lot more have had it too, but are unwilling to step forward and ask for the Lord to help with a nightmare. Every confession I hear makes me want to walk away, from my station, from my parish. 

It's the same everytime. A green-tinted dream of a dark sea of pestilence devouring all we hold dear. I know not how to explain this to the Holy Father in my prayer. How can I put into words the horror of this? What do I pray for? That they not dream? That this infernal rain lets up? That the world goes back to normal? ""


-----------

Father Adam,  4th August, 1284

""Heinrich turned up at the church at midnight. He was in a daze, eyes glazed over like the pierced doe in a royal hunt. He knocked thrice, and when my minsters opened the door he walked in and climbed the crucifix, soiling the collections with his bare feet. On the stained glass window near the ceiling he kept a single piece of green stone, shaped into something.

It was a skilfully crafted sculpture of a throne, on a bed of green carved out to represent undulating waves. The stone itself looked old, like nothing I had seen in the town itself, even in the houses of the Lords. It was cool to the touch, and covered in dark striations that sprang from within like the offshoots of some irreverent creeper. 

'God help us,' said Heinrich.

We gathered around him, his glazed eyes now furtive, awake, scanning the room. He shivered, drenched and cold.

'It walks before him. It walks these lands, and it always has.' 

He passed out after this. The town physic was awakened and carted to him through the slush and sludge, but medicine could not return to him what he had lost. There was no reason, or rationale in him anywhere - they were gone as strawmen in a storm.""



-----------

Father Adam,  9th August, 1284

""The villagers now know of the shared dreams. I do not know who chose to speak of it first, but it has spread like wildfire across the town. The Mayor himself has convened a meet of the peoples, and counsel had been sought from the Church. The Baron had not been alerted yet, but it was only a matter of time. 

The town hall was a sussurus of whispers, reflective and pensive, bound by the minds of men and the marbled walls. One by one the smallfolk told of their dreams, and the mood in the room grew more and more terse. Green worlds, throngs of devilish creatures, a sea that swallowed you and left clanging, clattering bones in its frenzied wake. Twenty people talked. Then fifty, then a hundred.

By sundown two hundred and twenty four people had confessed to having the same dream, while outside the rain pattered against the gables and dripped past the red roofing tiles.

I could see the Mayor's hands shaking as he discussed with his aides. He called me into the circle and asked me about what I thought.

' Is this Devilry father? Are we lost from the gates of heaven, and left on this earth to be tortured in fitful sleep and waking nightmares? '

I shook my head.

' There are God-fearing men here. Men with wives and families that have never raised a weapon in war, or a voice in violence. They are penitent, and there is no more sin in them than in me. I can abide no thought of the demonry of Hell afflicting my parish.'

And I couldn't. What this was, this unholy weather, these accursed dreams were of something Else - some woeful creation that Man was never meant to truly comprehend. ""


-----------

Father Adam,  20th August, 1284

"" Everyone has had this dream but me. Everyone. My minsters, the tailors, farmers, tax collectors. All save me. I have now had to pretend twice that I too have dreamt of the same. I have lied in the House of the Lord, and I know not else I could have done.

Perhaps I am the source of all this. Perhaps I've displeased Him and this is my punishment, the suffering of my flock. I do not understand it. I wish to get away from here, from the rain and these cursed nightmares. 

Food has run out almost completely, and bread and water are all that remains. The cattle have been butchered for they cannot be fed any longer, and the lords have kept the meat for themselves. I've seen two men die of starvation to make sure their families could see the end of the month. At night, if you listen past the din of the downpour, you can hear the cries of a hundred hungry children. ""


-----------

Father Adam,   9th August, 1284

"" Forty people have died. Mostly men, their wives and children left in the sludge and muck of the incessant rain. They died from the cold and the wet and the hunger that bites at my bones harder than the cold winds when flow into my robes.

The bread is gone. The dreams have only gotten worse in everyone, and people are frightened to sleep. They are haggard, bedraggled - all in the span of a few months. Several attempts have been made to reach the nearby villages; the mayor sent one of his aides himself with a letter to the Baron begging for aid, but it never reached him. The aide came back a few hours later, confused and hysterical, talking about how he had walked away from the town for half a day only to find himself suddenly back at its limits like he had never left. The rain made everything beyond the town gates nigh invisible, like shadows behind a thick sheet of silk.

I pray now for a quick end, to His servant who has looked over his flock for ever so long. ""

-----------

Father Adam,   17th August, 1284

""Oh woe is us!
He lies in his Palace of Green, 
His Servants seven 
Unknown, untold, unfound, unheeded, untamed

Yaskar! Yaskar comes
He Heralds the King
He Heralds the King

The Pantheon rises ""


-----------

Father Adam,   18th August, 1284

"" My mind is no longer my own. What I wrote last day was not of my making, and I cannot recall it. I fear this is our undoing. I tried running into the woods today, but after almost an hour I found myself on the church's front porch again. 

This is witchery that will have us all. I have no family and none to share these last moments with. I am alone, as the lone bird in winter skies. 

Old man Gerb by the barn has died today, after speaking the terrors of his newest dreams. 

'He comes! He is here ! He who lays the Way, and He whom he serves! The malachite quakes and rises, and the tides shall wash man from the earth as we would kill fish on the sea-shredded rock! '

Something is coming. The skies are darker in the east, almost as night. The winds blowing from within there are fell, evil. I can smell it. ""


-----------

Father Adam,   29th August, 1284

""What I might write down here, I write only in the hope that the future knows what happened. I know not if this will ever be read, but I can only hope. For the sum total of the learning of Man can not spawn enough comprehension for what passed in Hameln - and what will come to pass. The stars in the sky may one day, be charted, the seas conquered, and the minds of men enlightened- yet nothing will grasp what we saw.

Last night, well after moonrise, the rain stopped. It did not dissipate, or slow down. It stopped, the way you may stop the river with an embankment built high and wide, suddenly and out of thin air. There are those who swear they saw drops of water suspended in the air, like pearls glistening in the moonlight.

While the townsfolk came outside their homes, drawing in their threadbare, soaked hides closer - something came in from the East.

I do not know how to truly describe that which should not exist, that vies against creation. It was tall, taller than me by many heads. Taller than any man I had ever seen. There was no skin to be seen, only dark shadow across its body, as if shrouded in some ever-moving, ever-shifting cloak. I could not see its legs, nor its face, if it had one. On its back I could see what seemed like a horn, carved from green stone that sparkled in the night. It glided across the wet mud like varnish on wooden pallets. In the distance, I could hear deep, rumbling drums - like thunder striking the hearts of old mountains.

Every single onlooker stood in silence, either frozen with fear or rapt with curiousity. It moved slowly, deliberately, until it reached me. Then it stooped over me, a shadow thrice my size, blotting out the moon. The world was deathly still, and I closed my eyes for what felt like eternity.

When I opened them again, it had moved past me. The whole town seemed to be in a daze, the whites of their eyes bulging out of their sockets, mouths open - the same as Heinrich on that fateful night. My terror had finally taken the better of my reason, and I knelt and threw up, and cried in my own sick until the rain splashed down again and washed it away. I came to my senses with the Mayor slapping me awake. 

The whole town, all the adults it seemed, were there. They pulled me to my feet, and I saw that they were in tears, stricken with fear and grief.

"" What happened? What did you see!"" I cried.

""He showed us what is to happen. The Herald showed us the way that is yet to come. We stand at its very center!""

""The center of what! What do you speak of?"" I was crying again, my mind adrift with thoughts of hell and heaven and things of neither domain. 

The Mayor's voice grew deeper, quieter.

"" He is almost upon the land. The Accursed King! The herald told us that the world would run amok, overburdened by a sea of devils and derogation, that would kill us all. None would stay alive! Not a single Saxon soul would stay alive!""

""Varddyathohet! The Accursed King! The Accursed King! "" screamed one of the villagers, and he knelt down and spread the wet mud on his face and neck.

""He will be the end of us all! Unless, unless- ""

The Mayor completed his delirious words with a desperate plea in his eyes.

""Unless we pay his tribute. ""

A mother from the back pushed her way past the mayor. I knew her. She had lost her suckling babe only a week ago, and her young son stayed sleeping in her home. ""Only you can choose whether we should do it Father. You didn't dream, he said. Only you can make the choice free from knowing the nightmare that might follow if you choose wrong. Those were his words. ""

""But what does he want? What does he want, this cursed thing! "" I cried out, wringing my hands in despair.

""Our future,"" she said, her voice like cold forged iron.

And with that, I knew what tribute was needed.

I wanted to run again. Past the woods, past the old oak and into the bear pits. To end myself, to end my fear and my deepest horrors. But I simply couldn't bring myself to. I looked at them - mothers, fathers. Distraught, devastated - changed forever, yet aware of what was to be done.

They said I had to decide on my own. If any of them were to aid me, nothing would change. 

And decided, I have. ""

-----------

Father Adam,   26th August, 1284

"" The last three weeks have had no rain. The clouds lifted the day I made my decision, and whispered it into the green stone throne that Heinrich had brought into the church. The sun shone down, and the waters receded suddenly, as if pulled away like puppets on strings. I paid no mind to the supernatural anymore - I have witnessed more of it than many men can dream of in their most intimately disturbing nightmares.

Today is St. John and Paul's Day. One of the happiest days of the year, marked off by many, months before it rolled around. The church's stained glass window would have been adorned with decorations. It was a day of celebration, but there was none to be seen now. Only mothers crying , only fathers stifling their tears. Only the ending of a hundred bonds over the command of something that creation had little say over. 

Only the wailing of those who would lose the last iotas of light that kept them alive through months of absolute, unutterable despair.

As the promised hour came to a close, I heard drums beating in the East. A fell wind blew in, and in the distance something entered the twilight shadows, playing a green horn that sounded at once like heaving waves, rustling leaves and the roaring rush of an avalanche. Like war, like the rumbling of a wound-up catapult. 

Like death. And a hundred little feet pattered behind it, entranced.""



--------------------

The logs end here. I checked up on my facts again before committing the story to be transcribed- and found a lot that seemed to match up.

The tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin came about in 1284 AD. It told of the Piper leading away rats - an evident, inescapable reference to the Great Plague. But what has always been considered odd in the European folklore community, is that the Black Death didn't start till almost fifty years later - in 1328. Yet the story originated when it did; infact there was even a stained glass window in the erstwhile town church of Hamelin, depicting the events of the story. None of which would have been possible if the Plague had not even started yet.

However, after reading the Father's journal, I believe I may have an answer. You see, the story of the Piper ends with a very specific little detail. It says that there were two children who were saved, because they could not follow him like the other children did. One was a little girl who was deaf and could not hear the music, the other was a boy with deformed legs who could not keep up with the group. 

The Piper never did get all the children like he had wanted to. And maybe, because of that, what should have happened instead only became a temporary reprieve. Instead of removing the Black Death from the annals of history, all they could do was postpone it by half a century. Whatever the Herald was, his loyalty lay with something else. And Its wrath is what the world felt when the Plague killed a third of all who were alive then.

To this day, there is a street in Hamelin associated with the Pied Piper. It is said to be where the children were last seen, rushing happily into the west, enchanted by an otherworldly melody. That street is, and always has been called - Bungelosenstrasse."

But I've done some awful things that she doesn't know about. I want to tell her but I'm afraid it's going to crush her more than it does to me. She's had some friends in the past who betrayed her and I'm one of her only friends and I just feel so awful that I want to die. There was one incidence that I won't go into detail, but basically she made a mistake that she still feels guilty for and I mentioned it to someone because I was very upset and needed to talk about it with someone because I didn't know what to do. That person ended up cutting that friendship and my friend was a mess for couple months. I didn't know she was going to react that way, I was too emotionally upset to think rationally. Another incidence was when my friend was applying for jobs and she happened to apply to my store. I felt like if we worked together we would get nothing done so I recommended against hiring her. She ended up getting a job a couple months after that she liked better, but I still feel guilty because I knew she was trying really hard to get a job and kept getting rejections. 

And then finally this happened yesterday. She's been seeing a counselor on campus and she was actually the one who referred me when I was having a really bad time. She's been really supportive even when I was suicidal just after the quarantine started and always tells me that I can come live with them if I need to. So the counselor she's been seeing is an intern and she's leaving because it's end of the school year. She said she would connect her with my counselor, who's a great person and has helped me a lot. He wanted to make sure I was fine with it and I said I was fine at first. But I don't entirely feel comfortable now not because I have anything negative to say about her but because I feel like I need to keep some things separate. We live together on campus and even work same campus jobs so I just need some space even if it's not a physical one. And I just feel horrible for doing this to her because he's a great counselor and I want her to get the help she needs. 

She's always been there for me and gives me unconditional love but I feel like I'm betraying her over and over again. I love her, she's like a family I've never had with all the childhood abuse but my gut feeling keeps telling me I need to do this. I've emailed him but now I feel really awful and just want to die so that I can get away from this mess and not care about anything."

gbo02v,3,2020-05-01,Which online coding courses are worth the money?,imhavingadonut,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gbo02v/which_online_coding_courses_are_worth_the_money/,"I recently experienced a windfall. And I’m wondering which paid online coding courses I should look into.

My husband has been taking free coding classes online on and off for a few months. He really likes the work, and he seems to be a good fit for it as well. The best part is, a friend of ours has lined him up with an internship once he’s done with his studies. = )

My husband has issues with depression and ADHD. And on top of that, he is working as a tutor. Also, I am six months pregnant and working outside the home (essential worker), so he’s been (wonderfully) picking up slack on the cooking and cleaning at home (yes, I am very grateful!). I mention all this to say that the coding classes seem to be taking a back burner in his life. If you know anything about ADHD, then you will understand that even though he enjoys doing the coding, and is good at it once he gets going,  actually getting down to finishing the classes can be a struggle. With the baby coming, him working from home, and this whole pandemic crisis, you can understand why he’s been a little distracted.

I recently got a substantial monetary gift. It’s not a lot but with it we could definitely afford a paid coding Boot Camp or classes. **So I’m wondering what would be the best options?**

I’m thinking if he pays into it, he’ll have that extra little motivation to actually finish it. I believe this to be the case because he already finished his bachelors, in an unrelated field. And even though he got a partial scholarship at a state school, it still cost a bit of money. Personally for me, when I pay into something it gives me extra motivation to actually do it.

He’s not happy in his current job, but with the depression he can suffer a kind of inertia. I’ve asked him about this and it seems like he really does want to finish the coding. But there’s just too many distractions right now.

**So what do you think? Do you have any advice, and most of all, do you know which classes might be worth the money?**

Thank you!"

I have an interest in changing careers. I'll list my situation and I'd like to hear your thoughts on a desirable path to reach my goals. 

\-30 yrs old w/ B.S. in unrelated field.

\-No computer science or programming experience, however math was something that was a little easier for me than other courses.

\-Live near a ""tech"" city.

\-Given my situation, I would possibly need to go to school part time.

\-I'm much better at learning things in person. It would be difficult for me to do an online course in something I have no experience in. 

**With that being said, here are my questions:** 

\- There are several schools  in my area that offer graduate-level transition courses/certificates that are designed for individuals with a B.S. in something unrelated so that they can attain a Masters in Computer Science - I feel like because I have no background at all, even a ""transition"" course would not provide enough skills and tools for me to become competitive for a job. **Am I wrong? Would having a B.S. in Environmental Science and a Masters in Computer Science with no real world experience be beneficial?** 

\-Lets say I apply to a school with the hopes of attaining a B.S. in Computer Science.. Lets also say that my start date is within the next 3-6 months. I would have not had much time to build projects or get my feet wet before courses start. **Is this an issue?** 

\-I have read that a number of individuals don't actually learn to program in school. I'm also assuming that because I would be knee-deep in courses, I wouldn't have much time to learn more on the side. **When I graduate, will I have enough school-directed projects to be competitive for a job?** 

**-**A number of people go to boot camps to get their feet wet prior to changing careers. I understand that this can be a desirable way to get there, but I'm willing to put in the extra time in another degree if it's the best way to become a quality professional in this field. **Is a four year degree the most quality way to enter the field, given my experience level?** 

\-Throughout the course of my current career, I've managed people, budgets, projects, conflicts, etc. **Even though my degree and job experience isn't directly applicable, how much emphasis are companies putting on your social/ project and people management/problem-solving skills?** 

\-I do not have a specific type of position that I am interested in. **What is that easiest/most efficient way to figure that out? Internship, taking courses at school, online resources, job shadowing, etc. ?**

\-**Also, can anyone share their experience in getting job prospects or offers while in school?  How does that work exactly? What do most C.S. schools do to get you a job post graduation?**

Thanks all,"

Note: The Asus ROG Strix X570-F Gaming ATX AM4 Motherboard has an additional 4-pin ATX power connector but the Corsair CXM V2 (2017) 750 W 80+ Bronze Certified Semi-modular ATX Power Supply does not. This connector is used to supply additional 12V current to the motherboard.

It was difficult and tiring after quite a few rejections. I am not a genius AT ALL. I have mediocre programming skills but I do have a passion for algorithms and scripts.

 To give some detail:

I arrived back to the USA February 18, 2020 and began applying the day I arrived. So it took a little over two months. I applied to about 100 positions and had a whole lot of phone screen that led to some second round technical interviews and some coding interviews.

I went to college in the Philippines for Computer Engineering and had my degree evaluated by WES. I had a shitty internship that where I didn't learn much and a side project where I made some trading algorithm robots to read charts and execute trades. **Before you even begin to apply make sure your resume properly formatted and has relevant and well organized information. The resume advice thread helped me so much.** My first resume here freaking sucked and I wasn't getting any callbacks. After getting some feedback I made some major changes and then the calls started to come in big time.

I only had one company that had me do leetcode type problems where the most optimal solution was using hashmaps but since I solved them not using hashmaps I got rejected. There was another company I was very interested about a month applying where I aced the coding interview but the technical questions I didn't do so well. 

My resume has about 5 projects but most of them are small and I only made them to make my resume look nice but to be honest its better to have one project that you love, understand inside and out and can explain in simple terms. **What got me the job was my ability to understand the work the company does and how my project directly relates to their work.**

Take away:

* **Make sure your resume is good and clean. You are only wasting your time and wont even get a call back if your resume isn't clean and relevant. Once your resume looks clean then the calls will come in.**
* **Make sure to have at least one legit project that you love/passionate about. This will allow you to discuss about it and relate it to the role you are applying for.**
* **There is only so much you can know out of University. I am weak in in front end and back end technologies. I would have interviews where I know exactly the answer and others where I had no idea what they were talking about.**
* **Leetcode and Hackerrank are great to practice and keep your skills sharp but they are difficult to master and take time.**

**Job details:**

**Location:** New Jersey

**Role:** Software Engineer/Embedded System Engineer

**Pay:** 63k"

I am currently a CC student looking to transfer this coming fall as a junior! I have been accepted into UCD and UCSD for their CS program and am trying to pick between the two colleges, but I know virtually nothing about how each campus is like. Thus I thought the best way to find out was to ask the students themselves! I'm really curious as to how smooth (or rough) the transition was from a CC to UCSD was, and how campus life is like in general. I also have a few specific questions.

* Do the rumors of UCSD being socially dead hold any merit? (I'm really excited to join clubs and make new friends and hoping this isn't the case)
* How is the faculty at UCSD? (at my CC I loved how I could come in for office hours everyday and was wondering if at UCSD the faculty are as available)
* How tough are the upper div CS classes? Is it hard to get the classes you want?  (I really want to graduate in 2 years, is this realistic?)
* Are there a lot of career opportunities at UCSD for a CS major? (How hard is it to get an internship?)
* What is the CS student culture like? Is it super competitive where everyone is doing their own thing? Or is it more of a friendly collaboration climate?
* I've been accepted into Roosevelt college, what are the people and culture like in Roosevelt?
* Besides the questions above, is there some aspect I'm not considering that I really should?

Sorry for the sudden barrage of questions, I'm just super excited about what UCSD is like. If anyone wants to talk please feel free to reach out to me! (disc username: Electro Impact#8115)

I actually learned programming backwards. Started in x86 assembly, using Ollydbg in order to reverse engineer base address and offsets for a particular game. I had a budget laptop, and you were enable to disable features in-game that affected performance like grass, shadows, buildings, etc. by reading and writing into memory. So in a nutshell, I was game hacking. As I dove deeper, I came across ""cdecl"" in the instruction window a whole lot, so then I taught myself C/C++. Once I got things rolling, the game's anti-cheat system was flagging my public releases consistently. So then I taught myself about signature detection, packing, and obfuscation. By the end of it, this thing had so many dead code branches, was blocking any debuggers or dissemblers from opening it, and had dynamic self-modifying code.  


Anyways, I think it's a relatively cool story if I was pursuing a job in the security realm, but I'm majoring in artificial intelligence. My GPA is pretty low, and so I'm needing experience/projects to balance that out. I have some pretty run-of-the-mill machine learning projects that have been seen a million times over, but nothing like having thousands of people found what I built to be useful. Should I keep it on there and frame it ""nicely,"" at least until I graduate with several internships under my belt? Or should I avoid the possibility of the company actually pulling up the program (it still exists on the internet) and my subsequent ""warez"" forum account and posts from so many years ago?"

My alarm going off at exactly 9:00 am. I live in New Orleans as one of the most important people. Yep, you guessed it! I'm a Carpenter. We were doing a demolition job, and our only rule was ""don't check the basement"". This might have been my weirdest job yet.

As our boss wanted this done before deadline, we all had to work overtime, and I heard a few interns on their break saying ""hey, we should check the basement"" for ""supplies"" for some ""blaster"" or whatever. I told them not to and that not even us men go down there because we follow rules. They all blew me off and told me to go screw myself because somehow they were supposed to be better than me, so I flipped them off and kept working. Little did I know this was going to be one of the worst nights of my life.

It was getting close to midnight when we all got to go home, but I stayed incase those kids actually wanted to go down there. It turns out they did and I tried my best to deter them, until I got roped into their plans. It started out okay, if by okay you mean finding a bunch of musty smelly jars of god knows what. Slowly it got worse and worse. It went from jars to dolls to scrap machines that still worked and used sensors. I was scared to go into the next room because of the smell and smell alone. The kids began to take some of the machines and duck out, but I surprisingly found a way to bring them into the back room. We did not find a dead cat. It was much, much worse...

It was a man and a woman in the dark... With cuts and bruises on both of them, and they were both dead, with another man eating a rat in the corner and babbling to himself. It was the worst thing ever. One kid ran as quiet as he could and threw up outside. After being paralyzed, I hadn't noticed that he had come back, and he accidentally knocked into a table, making a large clang. I knew we were fucked. He turned and started making a top speed beeline at us, and we all scattered. I've been hiding in a machine that was hollowed out by the kids for a few hours now, and can't see anything, but can hear they're nearby screams... Oh god not Louis...

Its gotten worse. My legs are getting cramped and im too scared to move because I fear the clanking of the metal would alert him to me. I cant hear any more screams, and I can only hope at least one made it out alive.

I moved a tiny bit and found out i can peek out if I shift myself against the table and peek out through a slit in the metal. 

I can hear his footsteps. He's probably searching for me. How does he know im still here? Was his first objective to lock the door? That's the only logical explanation to this... Also its really starting to smell in here...

Its 11 am and all I smell is decay, death, abd the overpowering stench of rust. I don't hear or see him anymore, and i know there is a window just above me. Im gonna make a run for it.

Writing to check if anyone is interested in an AMA with a few of my friends.

2. Business Major, Y4, second upper. Upcoming summer at Bulge Bracket (Goldman / JPM / CS) - sales and trading
3. Business and Econs DDP Y3, First class. Did 6 months NOC, now working on a consulting internship.

Not to come off as a flex for the above but sharing just to get whoever is interested. It's just like how you won't take study advice from someone that scored 50 rank points. (Life in a nutshell)

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I am doing this?**

Hoping for a social leveller. People in the top JCs have a huge network and resource to tap on while it's an uphill battle for 'lesser' JCs. Hoping to capture the speciific people that are driven but have little info or support. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How good are they?**

Definitely not top-top tier. It's not like they're doing full-on IB or consulting at the top firms. I would say on the spectrum, an estimate (assuming com/biz faculties only) maybe top 25-10 percentile. I won't assume to know enough for the estimate to be accurate. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What's in it for you?**

Maybe get to know wtf is investment banking, why people pursue it. (hint: very profitable and exit is good). 

What sort of trajectory to aim for, companies to apply to and the interview process. What's the day-to-day like for an intern.

I feel like none of my friends care about me. I’ve known them since high school and throughout college. We were the outcasts. I was more social then them but I stayed with them because I felt like they knew me and understood me the best. Everything was fine between us until recently. I really want to be an orthopedic trauma surgeon by the time I’m 28 so I finished my BA in two years. Even tho I’m busy I’m always supportive of them. I encourage them even when I don’t think they’re doing what’s best for themselves. I help them schedule doctor appointments and even help them network in their individual fields if I can (if I can’t I try to find other sources) I help them research their reports and thesis and help them with their studies anyway I can. I look out for them a ton. I listen to their problems and try to help no matter what. And I know I do because they’ll acknowledge it when I’m upset with them. 


Lately I’ve been struggling. The love of my life left me, I had a miscarriage, I left the church, some of my family disowned me (came out as BI) and my cousin killed himself. Everything that could go wrong did. I really needed emotional support and my friends but they weren’t answering (the day my ex left) so I went and got hammered to suppress my feelings bit. I called my best friend and he answered laughing. We chatted for a few moments when I heard the rest of the friend group talking about me. Saying what a drag I’ve become (miscarriage happened about two weeks prior) I immediately hung up. I played it off as if I didn’t hear it. 7 months past by and things are just different. I can’t tell them anything or I get told I’m too emotional (I’m not) or attention seeking (I’m not). I still want to be apart of their lives but it’s difficult for me because of school and my internship so I send articles to the group chat for them to enjoy and give support. 

About a month ago I started sleeping around and I’ve been getting more support by these people I’ve known for less then a day then my friends I’ve known for YEARS. I recently found out that two of these friends were engaged. It’s making me realize that I’m not important to anyone that’s important to me. And it’s really hard on me. It’s making me want to drop out of their lives suddenly. I cut my hair short from stress and they didn’t notice. I really want to change my name, delete socials, and even consider plastic surgery (probably won’t go that far) 

I recently got accepted in a med school across my country but I also got accepted to one near my friends. I really want to go to the one far away because I’m learning to hate my friends but I don’t want to let them go. They remind me of a happier version of myself but also make me sad. I know I’m supposed to outgrow friends and all that but it’s just complicated. I have told them how I felt but that has ended in silence on their end. I also have tried to make more time for them but it just doesn’t work out. The worse part is I don’t know what I did. They say I didn’t do anything but clearly I did. I don’t know what to do. Do I stay in this funk or do I basically leave everything behind? (It’s hard for me to makes friends, I’m cold and distant for awhile but especially with everything going on I’m more cut off) 

Basically I feel under appreciated and I want to pack everything up and leave. Delete social media, change my name and just start over."

(SQL/Programmer/Some Security Experience),sam_the_scripter,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gc3dgn/is_my_experience_enough_to_get_into_security/,"Long story short, I've been at my current job for 1 year, it was my first offer after graduating with my B.S., now I've been trying to get ""back"" into a Security role before I pigoen hole myself as a SQL developer with some python experience for ever. Idealy, I would like to leverage my skills for Incident Response (I'm very good at parsing data, string manipulation, data validation, dealing with huge datasets), Data Engineering for a Cyber Sec department, or Forensics (I know how to use FTK/EnCase), but I'm at a point where I'll be happy with any Security Analyst or SOC position.

Here's a quick breakdown of my education/experience:

\- B.S. Degree in CIS - Info Sec/Forensics specialty from a well known state tech school

\- 1 year as a SQL developer, some python, mostly data generation/reporting at a well known health company.

\- 1 year as a paid intern at the above company developing javascript/NOSQL with a fullstack web framework. - while in school

\- 1-2 years combined volunteer experience at my university’s data center building SSO and 2FA using Active Directory, some linux boxes, and web apps + participated as a Linux player for my school’s cyber defense team. - while in school

\- few months doing IT Audit as a paid intern at some company. - while in school

\- 2.5 years as a computer tech doing everything a desktop support person can do for customers (virus removals, OS installs, data recover, diagnosing, repairs, everything) - while in school

No certs. I don't have my ports/network topologies/and or security methodologies with fancy security framework acronyms memorized but I can understand putting together switches, routers into a whole environment with active directory, other boxes, and configuring a firewall and lock it all down + I don't hate programming as you can tell by my last two rolls + I've played with most penetration testing tools and understand mostly HOW they work not just running them mindelessly, and I'm hungry to learn everything and I show it in interviews.

I do have all this on my resume and I roughly maybe get 10% calls back. I have gotten two offers last year for SOC positions but I took my current role instead and now slightly regret it... the only thing keeping me at my current job is that they pay me well and treat me well, but at this point it doesn't matter I want to do what I really enjoy, I'm easily board now and love to keep exploring and learning as most Security minded people are. I've started applying again but I think the current virus pandemic is affecting finding a security job since I've gotten back emails from two positions saying the position was closed/frozen.

Is my skills and experience enough? Is certs really the last thing holding me back from getting an entry level security job that pays at least 80k? (I'm from an expensive city/state to live in, would probably a paycut \]: )

Sorry if my grammar is all over the place, I typed this out real fast, I promise my security reports will be written alot better, part of my current job is (ironically) making professional reports..."

gc44nx,5,2020-05-02,URM internships are insanely unfair,goooperhj1098,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gc44nx/urm_internships_are_insanely_unfair/,"Reflecting on my professional experience as a senior CS student at Cornell, I will have to say that there is one particular job category that I find to be abysmally discriminatory - the underrepresented minority internship program.

If you don't know what an underrepresented minority internship program in a major tech company looks like, check out [Facebook University](https://www.facebook.com/careers/students-and-grads/students) or [Twitter Academy](https://twitterudiversity.splashthat.com). Essentially, they're internships ""specifically designed for historically underrepresented second-year computer science students"".

Before you cry foul, saying that I'm probably some privileged, non-minority student, I have to say that I'm actually all for diversity -- I'm a huge proponent of Affirmative Action, I believe strongly in a diverse campus and in a diverse workforce, and I agree that tech needs more diversity in terms of gender identity as well as ethnicity.

I think that URM internships, like Affirmative Action, are great in theory. Affirmative action results in equality of opportunity, where minorities have the option to study at universities accounting for certain economic and cultural predispositions, resulting in upwards economic mobility. That sounds great to me, as AA is based on the principle that every student deserves an equal opportunity to study at the greatest universities in the country.

However, I would say URM internships do not embody equality of opportunity. Once you're at college, the playing field becomes much more equal. I won't claim that everyone's equal, because Student A who drives a Range Rover at Apple Pie doesn't face the same stresses that Student B who works 2 part time jobs and took out student loans faces. However, I would say it is much fairer on campus, as is the purpose of higher education, at least when it comes to taking the same courses, having equal access to the career center, research opportunities, etc.

Now, URM internships are designed for historically underrepresented minorities -- including but not limited to LatinX, African-American, Native American, students. As an Asian student, I am decidedly not in this, which feels unfair but I struggle with this because Asians are arguably overrepresented in tech. Still, the fact that these classes of URM internships are overwhelmingly LatinX, etc. (looking at the class photos, not just the brochure photos), infuriates me, because I don't have the same ability to get an internship in a URM position. The degree of so-called ""positive"" discrimination is much higher than affirmative action policies, to the point where Twitter's ""specifically designed ---"" line essentially claims to exclude all non-URMs.

Now, you could say to me, ""so what?"". Internships after this URM program don't have this ethnicity qualifier, and are race-blind, right? Well, internships for computer science, especially the summer after freshman year, are notoriously sparse. To have a tech-related freshman year position, at a FANG company, is an undeniably incredible resume booster. You can find URM students from Cornell, usually with a trendy ""encouraging diversity in tech"" LinkedIn header, who did these URM internships, who then went on to become summer interns at the same or similar FANG companies, that then led into full time offers. I have yet to find a student who participated in a URM program who did not attain a full-time software engineer position (or similar PM position) in a prestigious bay-area company.

The truth is, these URM internships really set up students for life. The URMs who get into these programs are very lucky, and for a lower-middle class asian student with two immigrant parents, I do not believe for one second that I have a racial, economic, or cultural advantage over the URMs at my school who got into these programs. Although I am headed for a less lucrative, but still good career in computer science, I feel cheated out of this particular program. I wasn't born rich, so I worked excruciatingly hard to get myself into Cornell, only to find that I wasn't underrep-ethnic enough to gain my dream career either."

But i am not good at solving algorithmic problems.,onceuponacoffeee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gc49r5/went_through_4_years_of_computational_engineering/,"I am 22, about to graduate college and with a computational engineering degree. Graduating from a college which is a mix of Computer Science + Computational Engineering and Design, which itself is quite a wierd combo altogether. I took the degree because computers fascinated me( had a basic knowledge of coding) ( also everything fascinated me and i couldn't decide well).

Through the 4 years of the degree, i have understood that i am not really good and thoughtful in problem solving and definately not very fast and efficient. I am about to clear my degree with a good score because it's easy hack through tests in the educational setup i am in, they are about memorization and cramming helps, also coffee. Hacking through it i got good grades and was reinforced that i am a hood learner/student (which was a big misunderstanding on my part). But now looking back through the years i feel i am lost.

I see i am not fast or efficient in problem solving. I can code. Read code. Understand code. Understand a language fast. I know how computers work internally. ( I am especially bad at compilers and automata). I can get a server up and running. I can read through error logs. I understand how everything connects (can set up my own system from scratch). But this is basic IT knowledge. I thought that was computer science or that was the most essential bit for the Industry ( actually, i learned it because it felt fun creating an own system from scratch and connecting all the blocks to understand the system too) but in the end what i learned was what an IT engineer or sys admin would learn.

I think i can work in SDE environment (Have an sde job at hand). But looking at the tons of other people out there who would actually know this stuff. Or possess good problem solving skills. I can't really tell that SDE would be a good *long term* choice for me. (And feel not being confident itself is not a good sign). My first internship was also hectic. I took a lot of time to understand the system. Reading code was easy. Relating it to the real world was a bit difficult. ( The software facilitated a part of the SCM chain - so it can also be expected to be such )

Now i am at this juncture of what should I do with my life. I was depressed and anxious. Not happy with myself. Now i am stable, but i still think of the future and the consequences of my choices. Still feel u comfortable about my choices. 

Any advice for this lost soul ? Thank you guys!

TLDR: Almost through 4 years of computer engineering degree ( not computer science ) but with bad problem solving skills. Decent sys admin skills. Pressure to become an SDE. Don't know the path ahead. Need help. 

Thank you in advance."

This has caused my parents to force me to study more than ever before which is causing me serious stress. 

The fact is I was a dumb kid and wanted to have a high paying job and after googling it I found surgeon to be at the top spot so I thought hey let's try that. 

I took it seriously up until my final semester of my high school and then it hit me.........

So the point is that in order to start earning anything as a doctor in my country you have to study for at least 12-15 years after 18 years of age. I couldn't imagine being in my parents care up until I am 30 freaking years old ! Only my father works in my family and I also have a bro in his final year of middle school. I would receive a certain amount of stipend while I am doing my internship or residency but in my country its not worth anything. 

Here comes the difficult part.....

I WOULD have been the 1st doctor in my family line. When I had told my decision about being a doc my mother was almost at the verge of tears and they believed me that I could do it. I clearly am destroying everyone's expectations by changing my career. Whenever I try to approach my parents about this my stomach just crunches up , mouth begins to dry up and I cannot put it into words seeing how everyone is expecting so much from me. Also my dad has a short temper and always shouts at his phone every now and then.

So HOW do I approach them ?"

- Reach out to your manager if you haven't already, say hi, introduce yourself and share the excitement about the internship. Don't overcomplicate it; they're just individuals like you and me. Getting to know people before starting to work with them is a great start.

- Ask for a project-specific tech stack and look for stuff that you might not be familiar with. One month is enough to cover the basics of anything you didn't learn at University and will save you lots of time (and stress) once the internship starts. (eg. for my last internship that was RxJS as whole application state management was done using Reactive observables)

- Define with your team when you should ask for help. You'll run into obstacles every day. Some might take 30 minutes to solve, and others might take forever. Find a balance - You don't want to interrupt the whole team every 30 minutes, but don't let one problem turn your internship into an unpleasant experience.

- Practice [rubber duck debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/). You don't want to schedule a 30-minute meeting with your team and 2 minutes into explaining the problem you get to the _aha!_ moment where you figure out the solution to the problem.

  - In a nutshell, before asking for help, try to explain the problem you're having to a random object. Most of the time, during this process, you'll get new ideas and solve a problem by yourself without needing somebody's help.


- Most likely, you won't be micromanaged, but it's a good idea to keep everybody updated on your progress. Doing this, your team might offer some useful advice based on your progress or prepare you for upcoming obstacles in the task.

- If time allows it, plan virtual pair-programming sessions with your teammates. Once a week, pick a short task and try to solve it together. Doing this, you will pick up domain-specific knowledge faster, learn how to navigate new codebase efficiently, and improve your problem-solving skills.

- Socialize with other team members on Slack channels like _#random_ and _#watercooler_. Just because you're new to the team doesn't mean you shouldn't participate in casual conversations with other employees. They are social beings too and are probably looking forward to getting to know better new colleagues.

Anyways, I've been watching a lot of videos on working in IT and trying to learn more about it, and I'm just a little concerned about the work/life balance. While I am very passionate about technology, I am a firm believer that you should leave your work at work once you're done for the day if possible. Is this hard to do in IT, is it something you personally struggle with? Thanks for the help!"

im a doctor working in NYC right now. I'm not in the ICU or the ER but I am seeing COVID patients daily. Last year when I was depressed and suicidal, on meds, in therapy. In intern year I saw some terrible stuff that gave me PTSD.  I  recently started to feel like I was getting better, healing, feeling supported and then this hit. 

In March I restarted medications anticipating I'd struggle with what is happening, and upped the frequency of therapy. I am not quite back to the level of depression I'd previously had, and my schedule at work is much more humane than it was at my last training location but I am still really suffering. I feel moral injury over the fact that so many people in power are just OK with me dying if it means the economy recovers - and there is no real expectation for support other than bullshit jet flyovers, cheering and pizza parties. I hate it when people call me a ""hero"" - I feel very small, insignificant, and pathetic right now. Even more I hate the people protesting lockdown, clamoring for ""natural immunity"" to take it s course and our politicians urging reopening while we still are this under-resourced. And I feel hopeless about things being okay again. I am already planning to take leave from work over the summer.  I dont feel like I can yet. I don't know. I worry I may not be able to actually practice medicine at all after this, and having spent so many years of my life and so much money trying to pursue it. 

Ive started to think about how I wish I'd actually killed myself last year, so I wouldn't have to suffer through this. Im not sure that Ive had enough good in the last 2 years to outweigh the bad and I am adding to my trauma and now having body pain that I am afraid will become chronic pain like I see in many of my patients. last night, I started trying to calculate if I had enough of certain medications in my home to kill myself.  I took some pills to just help me sleep and then went to bed, and I dont want to kill myself right now but.. it's so hard. 

I just need to say this somewhere so I dont lose my shit. Im too scared to tell my therapist about it yet or my husband or my other close friends because it's scaring me. I know I need to.

An aside from having seen suicide victims/attempted suicide patients:  this is why I don't own a firearm. And why I dont think depressed people should own firearms.  If I had one, I'd probably not be here."

Would this be a worthy time investment? Also, I know that you need hands-on experience and Linux academy has been recommended a lot. Would you guys recommend it?

Also, I have access to the GitHub student developer pack. So I have access to two main cloud company programs, AWS education which means I get up to $110 in bonus AWS credits for a total of $75-$150, and I get another 150 dollars on top of that. I also have access to Microsoft Azure so I get Free access to 25+ Microsoft Azure cloud services plus $100 in Azure credit and educational resources. Should I do the certifications for any of those companies?

I have read the wiki, but couldn't find anything on where to start, because I don't know how to use AWS free and start up a server, as recommended.

In the internship section on the wiki, I couldn't find info on how to get internships while in high school. So any advice or information on that would be greatly appreciated. Also, I know that in the r/itcareerquestions rules it states ""Screen out personal information!"" However, in this post, I would like to ask the moderators if it's ok for me to post my general location since I live in a moderately sized tech hub, which is Washington DC. I know that Amazon HQ2 is coming here so do you guys think that will bring more internships for high schoolers?

My main question is what are some things I can do this summer that will help me out in filling this gap in my professional marketing plus my skills in technology?

I know that's a very general question so I'll try to narrow it down with some more background information. I am going to be a senior next year in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Security. I have really taken a liking to working with SQL and databases, so right now I like the idea of doing database admin. I feel as though I have a huge gap in programming knowledge as I've only done rudimentary C# and Python. I also have a previous IT internship and a help desk position under my belt.

However, due to the whole situation that has escalated, it’s unlikely that the lab is going to reopen, so me and the prof seem to be agreeing to lean towards a bioinformatics or data analysis project for the summer.

My coding experience is limited to pretty much Java, and basic Python knowledge, so I’m not sure how substantial of a project I’d be able to produce with my current knowledge. However, I have a lot of time during the summer, and would be more than happy to learn new coding languages before I take more CS courses.

My question is what suggestions or recommend actions do you guys have for shifting the project towards a bioinformatics oriented one, and how I can be successful with it.

I’m no where close to retirement age and happened into this crap-tech because the town I lived in had no technology work except a gig doing this stuff years ago (graduated BS in the last recession plus town was just small and limited and no money to move anywhere better at the time). Saved money, started grad school, moved across the country to a better market to find myself stuck. Soft skills count for jack shit, nothing I’ve done is transferable, no management or supervisory experience and I’ll never have any as why would any smart CTO scale a section of their department that’s working in a dead technology? I’m just the unfortunate maintenance crew until they can phase it out. Started a masters to get out and it’s looking as if it’s not going to be worth the paper it’s printed on. No time for side projects until I graduate. Too high of a YOE number to be taken seriously for junior roles, no mention of working in relevant technology providing tangible value on my resume to be taken seriously for anything else. Current employer is worse than the last. It’s just pure busy work and the job description was a complete fabrication to get a warm body at my desk (Java, SQL - plus I was too naive coming form a small town to really pressure them during the interview about specifics. Summer child syndrome). And no, there are no other roles in my company to move to that are doing anything better or that provide more employable skills. I’ve also exhausted myself and any social capital I have there trying to convince them on how to modernize my role, the tools I use,  and my set of duties and general work.

That’s really it, I have no idea how to get out of a pigeon holed career. Personal projects will take too long to be worth anything with my current schedule. It’s probably the only thing left besides a bootcamp I could try. Although, personal projects were my stars they before grad school and they didn’t help - but I was still in the small town so that may have had something to do with it. All that or I can just start lying and alter my previous job titles and exaggerate my responsibilities. I have significant debts and no family support so internships that pay less than $80k annual and that last less than 2-3 years are off the table (I know that eliminates all internships). Volunteering in spare time is off the table - I have literally no spare time until I graduate, and even then between my 3 hours in the car each day and working I have very little time or energy left to devote."

**To preface: I do not care about working at a FAANG and would be happy at any type of company.** I would actually not want to work at most of those big companies for personal reasons anyway.

Most  of the posts I see in this subreddit are either 1. FAANG focused or 2.  either self taught entirely or coming from a CS degree. So I'm writing  this to try and get general advice from my category that doesn't really  fall into either.

So  basically, I am a rising junior at a big state school that has an  outstanding CS program. Problem is, I did not come here as a CS major, I  came as a political science major and by the time I discovered  programming, I was too far behind to change and afford it (CS here falls  under engineering, so I'd have to take 2 semesters of chemistry and  physics before I could even apply to switch). So I'm settling for a  minor that covers:

* 2 semesters of Java with a heavy emphasis on software engineering
* Discrete math
* C/Software  Tools (title of the class, not sure what software tools refers to but  I've heard it's a general systems programming class)
* Data Structures
* Operating systems
* Assembly/Computer organization

I have an internship this summer as a Data Analyst at a well respected tech company in NC. I  also code on the side but lately have hit a wall of sorts. I have a few  decent projects but nothing at a real large scale and I currently am  having a hard time finding ideas or motivation. [Here's a link to my GitHub.](https://github.com/John123Allison) I also participate in CTF competitions with my school's security club and do pentesting in my free time on HackTheBox.

Anyway,  finally, I guess what I'm asking is given my situation, how does it  look in terms of getting a general dev job OR cybersecurity? I don't  care about FAANG and would be glad to work anywhere, but what should I  be doing and focusing my attention, or is my situation unrealistic? And,  how can I regain my motivation to do side projects and get over the  hump I've hit"

Now, time is running out, and I’ve entered a really difficult period of applying for full time or internship roles. I’ve been grinding the past 6 months to line something up for graduation, each time ends the same. I make it to the end of interview processes to be turned away due to other candidates having more experience. I’ve tried asking for help from school advisors, but their only advice has been to reach out to alumni at companies (who then turn me away due to lack of experience). 

At this point, I feel depressed and exhausted damn near daily. Interview rejections have gotten harder to handle, as they always end due to lack of experience, but I never had the chance to build this experience due to my late switch.  I feel like I let my family down.

Is there any advice for somebody who switched so late in the game, and worries that they made a mistake?  I just want to know that graduating with no job and no internship isn’t the end of the world, and that there are chances for somebody like me."

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

I think I'm going to get fired from an internship that's kind of crappy anyway so I'm not too concerned.  But i'm very confused and would like an honest opinion if this is my fault or not.  Sorry it's kind of long.

So around 6 months ago I got hired as an intern for a super small company.  They pay me minimum wage and give me part time hours while in school and there's no end date to this internship.  More like a part time job I guess.  Since starting I was given almost nothing to do, and I asked on multiple occasions.  There were days my manager would give me nothing and then I'd try to look busy if the owner walked past as if it was somehow my fault I was sitting there texting with a blank computer screen.  Needless to say I was learning absolutely nothing at this internship.

Back in March we were notified via email we'd be WFH due to covid.  I had never worked from home before and had no task assigned to me so I logged into my work laptop and emailed my manager asking what to do.  He said he would get back to me and never did.  So for the next few days I would just leave my work email open in the background waiting for my manager to get back to me, while doing nothing.  When it came to log my hours to be paid it was extremely awkward, because I either had to lie or write that I needed to be paid for doing homework and watching Netflix.  I wrote very vague bs and then sent a followup email to my manager once again reminding him that I had nothing to do and asked if I should be working on anything.  He said he would get back to me and of course never did.  At this point my ""work days"" consisted of checking my email and since I had that on my phone I didn't even bother to log into my work laptop.  I was truly doing nothing at all and thought forget this I'm gonna focus on school, I won't try to make them pay me for this, and I'll wait for an email.

An entire month goes by and I don't hear a peep until I get an email from the owner asking if I quit.  I let him know I've been here the whole time but no one has given me anything to do.   He writes back with an email that clearly shows he's upset with me.  Shortly thereafter he calls me on the phone and we have a brief back and forth where he's clearly not happy with me and at one point calls me immature.  He then says he's going to talk to my manager and see what they're going to do and we hang up.

I go back to the email where he wrote that it's not good I haven't responded to emails and I should have asked for a task.  I replied asking him to please show me which email I never responded to (there haven't been any).  I then told him that I did ask for a task on two separate occasions and forwarded him both email chains with my manager to prove it.  Since it's the weekend I'm sure I won't hear back until Monday so I'm not sure what his response will be."

Tldr is that im am trying to find out if it is viable to seek a career
As well as what kinds of careers I could realistically hope for if I A) Tried to change majors right now or B) worked to build competencies at some point in the future. 


CS is a very broad field that
Computer science is in engineering,  without which no computing would be possible,  followed by those fields that involve applications .

I believed ( and to ectent still di)Conpetency in CS something built actually developing...competency (!!) in CS as a whole,  as well as whatever specialty. I believed that success required you to have solid conceptial knowledge of progamming,  in QA, in what you wish to with your skills, and then the degree work abd internships neccesary to enter the field.

My old adolescent has been to enter on the programming end in someway, either in Web coding/web development,  security,  or BIS/MIS  

However,  reality hit,  and I was motivated to choose my current major instead, because "" versatility""


My educated hunch for several years has been that without years of skill, there would basically no jobs for anyone without a full bachelor's degree and the years 

Given the current world economic collapse being accelerated by the virus ""pandemic"", it seems that is inderd the case. see that the jobs will most likely go to those who have developed their competencies in 5-40 years ago"

After time became an issue, I ended getting a regular job to make ends meet and pay down my student loans. The job I'm at is good pay, but it wears me down so much that my off days I have no energy to work on tech projects. There for a while I felt like I had coder burnout and just stepped away from studying and working on things. Now, my interest has peaked again.

I'm getting back into reviewing data structures and algorithm analysis and seeing what interests me most in the tech field. Lately, I've been into cyber security (offensive and malware analysis), operating systems implementation, and web development. Sadly, I didn't get a lot of internship experience in college like my peers (I had one internship). They had more and ended up with something lined up after graduation. I've been trying to get touch with them to expand my networking. I'm wondering what my options are to get into the tech world at this point because I am getting older (just hit 30), and I don't want to waste my education. My current job has opportunities (I tried for Data Analyst, but didn't have python experience), they're just hard to get a foot in the door. Corporate branch offers internships, but they still are picky on experience and most of their full time positions want 3-5 years experience. 

My strongest skill is Java. I've known it since 2009. I used it in competition at the high school level nationally, all though college,  and some in my internship. I can still easily pick it up and do what is needed I just need to learn Java8, Hibernate, and Spring. My other language  interests are PHP, Python, C, Rust, JS, x86, and SQL. Any advice is welcomed."
gcl0rt,0,2020-05-03,Internship dilemma,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gcl0rt/internship_dilemma/,"So I've intra viewed (don't wanna say the actual word or my post will be auto-removed) at a few places for paid internships (remote cuz of the virus). I won't hear back from those companies with my offer again until it's close to June. However, I also have an unpaid offer which starts next week (once my exams are over). I've heard some people here in other posts to say that we should take the unpaid offer and then quit as soon as we get a paid offer. I know unpaid internships are generally looked down upon but the consensus seems to be that given the pandemic, unpaid internship &gt; no internship.

Since I don't know if I'll get the paid internship offer yet, I feel the safe thing to do would be to accept the unpaid offer so if all else fails I at least have an internship for the summer.

But I can't help but feel like I'd be the asshole if I get the paid internship offer while I've accepted and started working on the unpaid one. To just say ""bye"" out of nowhere would feel wrong, my manager would think less of me, and I would've burned Bridges with that company.  It would be like taking up a commitment and not following through with it. Nobody likes those kinds of people and I don't want to be that guy.

So what do you guys think I should do?"

I've learnt Python throughout high-school and have used it in small coding competitions.

However, I don't feel like these activities are solid enough to put on a resume if I were to apply for an internship.

One thing I'm lacking is experience. I've never worked on a large-scale project before - only small pieces of code for coding competitions. I've tried contributing to open-source projects on Github, but I simply do not know where to begin. Even browsing 'first timer only' projects, like those listed [here](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/filters?tags=python) and [here](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/), I simply cannot think of a solution to any of the issues.

So, I can think of me at an intermediate level of it.
The thing that I'm not able to know is, what's the path from here onwards?
I mean, how someone become an expert programmer. When I look on internet, the whole internet is filled with beginner level courses and advices but I could not find a pathway that starts from intermediate and ends at expert.

My experience: rn I'm in my final semester(delayed a bit b/c of covid19) of Mechanical engineering. Self taught Python programmer. Already done with a 4-month internship in Machine learning.

TL,DR: How someone become an expert at programming from intermediate level."

interesting field. I also happen to be quite passionate about math as well.

I now have to declare my major, and I'm quite lost. I don't know if I should major
in math or computer science.

Fields that interest me the most are data science, machine learning,
artificial intelligence, algorithms, computational bio, etc.

I've considered the following:

* Double major: 
	* People IRL warn me that it eats up all your free time for pursing personal projects or internships
	* University is free where I live, so money is no issue

* Major in CS and minor in math 
	* My university doesn't offer a minor for CS

* Major in math and fill my elective with CS and get a masters in CS 
	* AFAIK, it's easier to self-study CS than self-studying math, especially when you have a strong background in math. 
	* My fields of interest (mentioned above) all require a strong background in math
	* I'm a little emotionally attached to math since I discovered my passion for it before CS (emotional attachment is supposedly a bad thing)"

I am dumber than a freshman.,Sanfraniceman,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gcv82m/tifu_by_not_locking_my_front_door_or_using_the/,"This happened in late March. I will never forget this day. I traumatized a Freshman, a French teacher, and myself. 

(all names are placeholders)

Background : (feel free to skip)

This all started last April when I was flying connection out of LHR to return to University in the states following spring break. You see it’d been just my luck that my airline upgraded me to first class, only to cancel my flight due to a malfunctioning door. Needless to say, I was delayed for many hours. 

This is where I met Émeline, it turns out she was on the same flight as me and had also gone to complain to our airline’s concierge. She appeared to be about my age or a year younger, so I decided to talk to her and practice some of my mediocre French. We waited about an hour for the flight, in which time we commiserated and bought tea. I was rather comfortable at first, but I was taken aback by her intelligence, wittiness, charm and beauty. I learned she had recently graduated with a degree in English and was moving overseas for work in the same city as where my university is located. We ended up exchanging numbers with the promise that I’d invite her out sometime soon. Unfortunately, that never happened, between me double majoring in French and International Relations and my summer internships.

Cut to July, past my internship, past my 21st birthday, and a new apartment with my best friend’s younger brother, named Greg. Greg and I were able to find a semi-luxurious high rise apartment in the city center with a pool and all the amenities. Unfortunately we learn that its also home to university staff and professors, and realize we can’t nonchalantly have parties, but we decide the pad’s worth it. 

So August comes around and there I am at the grocery store a block away from my apartment. I run into Émeline. I don’t waste the chance to invite her to dinner—apologizing for failing to get in touch. We go out the following weekend and she’s extremely flirty, I know it’s a French cultural thing, but it’s still irresistible. I attempted being accommodating of her space, but one thing little touch lead to another and by the time our Lyft’s had arrived, we were hanging on to each other. I still didn’t want to jump on her immediately, so I arranged for a second date. Note, I’m back at the apartment and I swear I see Émiline in the lobby, maybe I’m just in love. 

We do start to fall in love over the next few dates, but we never are able to go back to our apartments because of our roommates. Unfortunately school rolls around at this time and I let her know that I’ll be busy.

Now one thing that stupidly shot over both of our heads during this time, was where I was attending university, and where she had just begun teaching, nobody wants to talk about work and school I guess... We don’t spend much time talking about serious things anyways, we are both very playful. But God, it would have been helpful if we had shared that information. 

3rd week on campus, fall 2019, I’m walking between classes amongst the crowd, when I see what looks like Émeline walking towards me, I get an awful wave of cringe and shock, that can only be surmised with, “Ohhh... FUCK!” She notices me: “We’ll talk later.” 

It turns out talk really meant talk. She was rightfully worried about our relationship pertaining to her career. Luckily, It’s not against university rules to have student-faculty relationships, and our case happens to meet parameters in which it is allowed. What worries us most is the possible publication of our relationship if it is found out. So, we decided to keep it private while on campus. 

Also, as it turns out, Émeline is an intermediate II French teacher, my roommate was an intermediate I French student in fall 2019. This only leads to exacerbate the following situation in March.

March : (main part)

After 6 months of semi-secret dating, Émeline and I, haven’t had full shaft, 100% committed sex. Thanks to our roommates, the furthest we were able to go was a few heated sessions in our cars. Just as I convinced my roommate to join a club—in order to give me and Émeline time to be alone in my apartment—she tells me of the potential school shutdown and quarantine. We realize if we don’t take the opportunity to get time for ourselves now, we won’t be able to later. My roommate Greg lets me know that if there’s a quarantine, he will most likely be staying in our apartment. This adds urgency to the need for Émeline and I to fornicate like wild animals. 

It’s late-March, and Greg has informed me that he’ll be getting fast food for dinner because he’ll be attending a club meeting. 

*Yes, I’m home alone for a couple hours, I’ll call Émeline!* 

For whatever reason we sit in my living room as if we are repenting for the lustful sins that we are about to commit. We do this for about half an hour—if only we had started sooner. 

Greg has arrived on campus and is currently heading to his club meeting. Back at the apartment, things are still warming up at a painstakingly slow crawl. Unbeknownst to me, Greg is back on campus at his club’s meeting location, but something is wrong—no one is there. He checks his phone, the quarantine has begun, all club meetings are canceled. “Fuck, what a waste of time,” says Greg.

Greg drives back to our apartment. Note that our apartment is about 10 minutes away from the university, leaving Émeline and I just enough time to transfer from a slow warm up to the beginning of the heated throws of passion. Now here is Greg, silently walking up to our apartment he notes that the door is dead-bolted ajar, he also hears what appears to be the sounds of struggling coming from the living room. Me and Émeline are approaching the limits of love. Greg runs in with a golf club raised high in one hand, phone dialing 911 in the other, ready to start screaming, possibly fencing. 

Greg freezes. I freeze, Émeline freezes. All of us simultaneously, “Oh Fuck,” “Shit,” “Putain,”

I assume this is what the operator heard before Greg hung up.

Oh why Greg, why did you have to run in! I will forever see your war face when I make love to my beloved girlfriend. 

Greg stands there, does a double take, and in awkward shock, “Uhm... Mlle. Blanc, what are you doing here?”

Émeline, in French, with a righteous might, “Ta gueule! Out! We are going to have a talk about this later!”

Greg stands there confused.

Me, annoyed, “Greg... For fucks sake. Get out.”

Now here is where I exacerbate my fuck up. Still shocked I presume, Greg walks out of the apartment to get dinner and to explain the situation to 911, who I hear calls him back. Now, understand that I’m currently in a rage at my idiotic roommate for interrupting, what was then going to be, my only time with Émeline for a long while. I lock him out and tell him to fuck off when he returns. This happens right after Quarantine commenced, and he ends up banging on the door a few times before deciding to sleep in his car. I presume he calls his brother, who in turn calls me multiple times, probably to get me to open the door. Greg is locked out for a day, almost two. The word eventually gets back to our parents, who are both strict Catholics and close friends. Now nothing need be said here; my allowance is cut. 

Émeline eventually talked to Greg a couple days after, I didn’t ask about their conversation, but she is a very nice girl, and I think she bought him a flight home and bribed him a bit so he wouldn’t tell other freshman. Unfortunately, our relationship became public knowledge thanks to other, but still related, means.

Now my best friend from high school and his brother are pissed at me, likewise, Émeline is very embarrassed. I’ve since had some patchwork to do, but that’s not all. My year now knows me as the guy that fucks the freshman French teacher, and I think Émeline and I will carry that to the grave. The memes are rampant, gossip is high, and I’m decently sure, if we break up, I will not have a chance at dating anyone who knows. I also regret next year when I’ll once again share an apartment with Greg. Why Greg! Please don’t be awkward! *Cries* 😩😭😭😭

Remember, to always use the sock signal, and to lock your door. And if you date a teacher, someone’s going to find out.

TLDR; My best friend’s little brother who’s my college roommate walked in on me and his 24 year old professor having passionate sex.

I got a couple of rejections and a few more emails informing me the positions were cancelled. I have since expanded my search out of state since my classes are online. I know 30 isn't that many but here's what bothers me:

When I apply though LinkedIn I see the number of applicants. If the position is 1 week old it is not uncommon to see close to 100 applicants already. For some this happens in a matter of days. It's likely that more qualified people than me apply, putting me nowhere near the top of the list.

In addition, I do not have work experience in the field (hence looking for internships.) I am in Grad school IT program (1 year left) and pay tuition out of pocket unless I can get a GRA - also doubt I can get one for the Summer. Even then only the fees are waived.

Also, it is common knowledge that most positions (I've heard about 80%?)  aren't posted, and hire internally or through personal reference. Is a better strategy simply to reach out to companies asking if they would be able to hire an intern or an entry-level employee?"

Hi All,

Hope y'all are safe and doing well.I graduated in 2018 and had been since working in a MNC till the november of 2019 and in between along with my job i was also preping and applying to unis for my Masters as i had plans to go for the fall 2020 term.Due to some unavoidable circumstances I was asked to resign from the job in november 2019,i wasn't that devastated as I knew what my future goal was(to go for MS in fall 20) and I didn't care much to search for a new job or internship.So after that I was pretty chill got busy in applying to unis and all.Fast-forward to feb 2020,I started pre prepping for Masters like revising some Java and the basic computer science stuff and would explore new things like learning photoshop and illustrator.Also spent time with family.Now due to this grave pandemic and the things is USA are chaotic its uncertain that Fall 2020 would happen in person.Even if it happens in person theres a chance of this Covid19 relapsing.So personally I am starting to feel like not going this fall amidst this chaos.Also now I am quite nervous and worried regarding employment as well since I wasn't actively searching since the past 6 months and I am worried that this gap would affect my future employment. Although i have started applying to internships via internshala and jobs as well I am quite nervous,anxious and stressed out thinking that many in future will stop hiring,and then mu resume gap would increase to an year causing a dent in my career hence I need your help and guidance.I would be more than glad for it.

I'm a 25 Y/O Male btw. Tldr; Everything is fucked up due to the COVID and I feel like im going to lose my mind. 

1.) I am a first year law student (my courses are currently pass/fail) but I'm still freaking out over my classes

2.) my godmother's mother just died the other day (I'm very close to their family) and it's just made this whole virus hit very close to home 

3.) My family may have to move out of state, all the way to the east coast, due to issues regarding my dads job, he might lose it due to the economic impact of COVID-19

4.) My girlfriend has been frustrated with me over apparently not giving her enough time, despite the fact that I text nearly every day and our phone calls can last up to three hours. (I haven't seen her in person since quarantine started for obvious reasons, and we don't live together)

5.) I'm getting kicked out of my university house, the university is shutting down all graduate housing due to the virus, and I will be forced to head back home to my parents who are a 6 hour drive away.
6.) I'm scared to quarantine with my dad because he is immuno-compromised due to type 1 diabetes.

7.) my summer internship is on indefinite leave due to the virus, big problem for law students and very irritating as I would have loved the extra money.

8.) I have Tourette's syndrome and anxiety issues

Having gotten all that out of the way, I can't explain to you guys how frustrating these last few weeks have been. I'm desperately trying to stay positive, but I feel so stretched thin and drained. I've spoken to my parents about my feelings, but they're dealing with their own issues right now, and I don't feel like those conversations have helped. I barely have the motivation, let alone the ability to concentrate long enough to study for my final exams. I'm constantly feeling anxious and I have this sense of impending doom just hovering over me, and I'm so tired of feeling like this. Do you guys have any advice or tips you can give me? I would greatly appreciate it."

(Don't know the right term),GlitzyWorm,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gcy8iv/how_do_i_18m_stop_being_overprotectingcontrolling/,"We've been together for 1.5 years now, and this has always been a big problem for me and I hate it. It happens everytime I catch feelings for someone and it has already ruined old friendships.

I think my self-esteem is really low and it's making me really insecure about everything related to my gf.
Everytime she texts with a boy, I start asking 5000 questions and only after realize that I'm nervous about if she likes that guy more than me or something along those lines.
I fully trust her and she has given me no reason to doubt her love for me, yet I always act the same way.
This also happens whenever she talks or does anything when I'm around, I'm always right by her side. (School, parties, etc.)

Whenever we do school projects I subconsciously try everything I can to be with her in fear of missing out of something that'll become an intern joke.

I really hate myself for doing this and I know it's starting to hurt our relationship, but I really don't know what to do about it. Whenever I'm in the situation, I just act instinctively and only after realize how dumb I am.

I've tried searching for an answer for a long time, but I don't know what to do, yet I know this is bad behavior of me.
I'm really scared that I'm going to lose her if I don't change soon. I hope someone can help me..."

Since then I've worked mostly with python and functional programming languages like Elixir. 

Given my prior java knowledge, I think I just need to rejog my memory before I start work. 

**The problem**: most tutorial online are very simple and cover stuff I already know or they are too long to watch and are building an entire application. Do you guys know of any resources I can use to rejog my memory and get back into the flow of writing Java code and just overall become a better Java developer."

I am going to be taking my colleges computer architecture and data structures courses over summer along with doing leetcode questions to prepare for internships for next summer. Since I am graduating pretty quickly I need to work on my resume a lot as I will be competing with students who are much more experienced than me. I am taking up the machine intelligence track and am also interested in data science and cloud computing. Other than taking these summer courses and general coding problem prep for interviews. What else would you recommend I do to prepare myself to be a competitive applicant for internships and even jobs in the coming future?

I went to high school and graduated in the engineering program, fostering a preference for robotics. I was still young and unsure what to do with my career so I chose ""Engineering Science"" as my major in my first community college. I took programs on Solidworks and AutoDesk. I did try to branch out into different engineering fields (for example I did a class on Hardware Engineering but I did not care much for it so I opted out of that class). I ended up moving away from there after taking the most central engineering classes I could (design programs, AC/DC, circuits). Then I moved to colorado. Still unsure of what to do I stuck to Engineering Science or ""applied science - transfer to 4 year university."" I took courses but took a fancy to Physics because it was the most interesting (based on my instructor) and I had an interest in Space (it was a hobby-like interest but it fueled my Physics learning). When I got to my 4 year university I quickly got into the Physics program. I took mostly different variants of Physics; I liked Astrophysics most of all. I also took a class on Java Programming, which I disliked heavily and didn't really understand (so my programming language options came to an end). I took 2 classes on MATLAB as well (which I indifferently cared for). Aside from Astrophysics, my favorite class was by far AC/DC circuits. Unfortunately, studying Physics (just at the Bachelors level) pushed me to my limit and I graduated with almost a 3.0, so it would've been very difficult, probably highly unlikely, to go into a Physics program at a University at an even higher level. So I called it quits on School and tried to get a job.
--jump back in time for jobs real quick to give you insight on what I have done up until this moment--
My first job was not until I started in college, and even then I was a library Assistant only. I never had any internships, not in high school or any colleges beyond this. I took a job as a Tim Hortons employee for a short time before I moved. I was then working as a kitchen assistant at Chuck E Cheese and then a kitchen Assistant at my college, always with aspirations of moving up, so I did not care for being at the lowest level of employment very long. Both were decent at best. Then I had the best job of my life so far. I was a math Tutor. I worked directly with people and fostered their education, but only for a short time each so I constantly had to change my teaching method. Also, major thing: I was always able to keep my brain working so I ""normal for college graduate"" math and science knowledge.
Also notable. Between these jobs I never fostered any technical skills, so I have 0 years experience in all programming languages except for the 6 months java experience and 1 year MATLAB experience. 
--Now back to post-graduation. Even though I enjoyed my time as a math Tutor, it was part time and now I need a full time job. So I left my job to be a quality Assurance technician for 2 months (VERY SHORT contract). Then I was lucky and entered a job as a wafer production technician for 2.5 years (you know, cleanroom stuff). Partly because of the level of job it was, the time of day I worked (d shift, 7pm-7am), and where I worked (cleanroom) I didnt care for that job, but held onto it for as long as I can because I needed income. Towards the end, there were layoffs and I had to choose between keeping my job for 3 months and then being laid off or risk losing the job when the layoffs began. I was scared for my job so I chose to keep the job for a bit longer even if I was forced to lose it. Throughout that job I did get basic knowledge of Python because I think it is one of the easiest programming languages to learn. Also, since the job was 12hrs in the evening of just brain-less processing I did not get to stretch my brain much so I am much less intelligent than I was. But now here we are. I am jobless, and I need to get a job soon. But I dont know what to do!
I have no clearances, no certificates, no experience in programming languages aside from basic knowledge in Python, the 6 meh months in Java and the 1 ok year in MATLAB, 2 years in SolidWORKS and 6 months in AutoDeak.
I have a high interest in Space-Phenomena.
I have a bachelors degree in Physics (which I hope would get me into a job but I don't know where to go).
I loved Robotics in High School.  I also love circuitry.
I liked tutoring but I dont think I could teach. I am much less intelligent than I was when I graduated as well.

Sorry for the long post, but with this knowledge is there anything someone could recommend? I cant possibly go into the military because I do not have the physical or mental capabilities of going down that path. I dont know if I have skills that would get me into a job that utilizes my education. I guess that means I either go into private tutoring or going back to school, but I dont know if with the state of the world would hold me back from pursuing something in school.

Again, sorry for the long post but I have had a very bumpy many years since graduating high school. Please provide some helpful advice! Thank you!"

I've recently received admission letters from both schools for concentration on Computer Engineering track of the ECE program and had a hard time deciding on which to attend. Frankly, I'm more apt to UCSB personally, but there are some factors in reality that I can not completely neglect. Therefore I'm hoping to seek advice from a much more ""local"" perspective. Suggestions from current ECE students are even more welcome!

Here are a few pros &amp; cons of what I think:

* UC Davis
   * Pros:
      * Lower living expenses
      * Accessibility (20min from Sacramento, 1hr from SF)
      * Portability: I've heard that Davis is a bike town so cars aren't really necessary to get around
      * Internship opportunities: I've been hoping to have the chance to work in the States during/after my graduate studies. I know there are a few tech companies such as Intel, located in Sacramento. Plus, UCD is much more closer to the SV, indicating more job/intern opportunities. But I'm curious about how UCD students are favored among the employers?
   * Cons:
      * UCD is known for agricultural and environmental studies more in comparison w/ engineering
      * Countryside scenery: don't get me wrong I love the countryside as well (been to Napa a few times during the previous summer vacays), but the seaside view of UCSB seems much more fascinating
      * Lower overall ranking
* UCSB
   * Pros:
      * Higher academic reputation in the fields of engineering
      * Better ranking overall
      * More diverse CE course offerings, more accessible to professors
      * Better living conditions and campus environment (what beats having a beach right by the campus?)
      * I have never been to SoCal, plus I have a few friends studying in LA already
   * Cons:
      * Smaller CoE/career fairs(?)
      * Higher room &amp; board (housing prices in IV are surprisingly unfriendly)
      * Accessibility (2hr ride from LAX)
      * Internship opportunities: Since UCSB is located in a comparatively suburban area, Idk what the chances are getting internships opportunities from tech companies nearby.
      * Party school: not a party guy lol

Any sort of help or suggestion is greatly appreciated! Thx"

My parents believe that I'll never find a job bc no one seems to want me (I've had interviews but never final call backs and no prior internships except for research) but I have told them about a security clearance job that I have been offered. For anyone who doesn't know, it takes at least a year to get this clearance bc its top secret and requires more in depth background checking. So basically I've been spending the past few months looking for a full time job in my field till I would get my clearance and work for this company. 

Moving on, my father has been home the past month bc of the pandemic (worked out of state and thus had his own place out of state) and has noticed my lifestyle so far: eating, sleeping, and sitting in front of the computer. Seeing this, he believes that I'm doing nothing for myself and feels that I'm wasting time because I'm not getting call backs. He recently told me to think about going to the army: they give 40k straight up and will give you a job after the required service (idk if 40k is true or not but its what he said). There are many pros to going into the army, but I've told him that I did not want to go.

My reason was simple: I don't want to and I honestly believe that I would hate the whole experience. But despite my constant explanations for why I do not want to go to the army, he has since then kept mentioning it to me and has told me things like ""if I were you I would be ashamed. There's a solution for all your needs in front of you but you wont take it.""

My father did serve in the Army in South Korea a long time ago, back when 3 years was the required service. He was a lieutenant and had quite a big group of soldiers under him. He told me how it was life changing and taught him many things about life. Honestly, I can understand how he really enjoyed his experience but in 2020 I don't think I'll experience something amazing during military training and I don't wish to find out by going through it.

Am i selfish for thinking this way?"

I have been emailing back and forth with a professor about potentially joining the team and pursuing an MS at their institution.  The email exchange started off with an intro and expressing interest in the research he and his team have conducted. After a handful of emails he asked to send him a Resume/CV to see if I would be a good academic fit. 

This is my first time getting my feet wet with the whole graduate school thing and I am a little nervous and feel unprepared. I am not a traditional student, it’s taken me a little longer to get to this point (graduate in December). Working and going to school part time to graduate without mountains of student loans. Some people say it will hurt me in the long run, others say it shows discipline, effort, responsibility and a passion to achieve personal/professional/academic goals. Only time will tell. 

My predicament is I don’t know where to begin writing this Resume/CV. I didn’t have opportunities to join undergrad research teams at my university, and my job didn’t allow the flexibility to pursue internships. Do I just emphasize on coursework and research projects or papers related to the research they’re conducting? 

All tips and feedback appreciated!"

In this spring semester I developed an interest for neural networks using PyTorch and specifically in the field of NLP. I'd love to explore more and I'd like to ask everyone for suggestions on resources like books, blogs, etc. to help me with that. 

Besides that, I want to learn following technologies in the summer: TensorFlow, PySpark, and Advanced SQL. I already know Python, and R very well but if there are other languages that I should know then please let me know about that as well. Also, if there are use cases that I should read then I'd love suggestions on that too. Thanks in advance!"

Any ways, Here are my thoughts on the degree I just finished.

Computer Science at concordia:

From the time spent here, compsci is really what you make of it. I dont know many people that are full time in compsci and have part time jobs, during the semesters (that actually graduate on time), internships are extremely normal. so keep that in mind when i'm talking about my exp. Find an extracurricular, getting your degree in compsci is cool and all but all your classmates are doing the same so you need to find a way to really stand out, in my case i joined a research project which was how i got my internship company to give me an interview, and then I was the reason i got the job. But in reality it can be anything: clubs, personal project, anything that shows you do this in your free time, learning web dev will land you a job faster (so like angular, react, spring, sql.. etc ) but its not for everyone. I Gave it a shot and did not like it. 

As you can see i'm not actually talking about the classes and profs. Because in reality no matter where you go you are going to have a mixed bag of these things. Some profs you are going to love and others you're going to wish they would stop breathing the same air as you. So just get over that as soon as possible and try your best to deal. The classes are the same way you'll take amazing classes like data structures and algorithms or computer networking, where you really feel like you're learning something but you will also take classes like ENCS 393 (ethics) where the curriculum was designed for high schoolers who never had a critical thought in their life, there's a lot of, “yah, no shit” moments in that class (what do you mean AI has negative consequences? golly-g batman, i could have never seen that coming).

The option I chose.

Cons:

Hindsight 2020 i would have not chosen information systems. Its a cluster fuck. Information systems is like taking a minor in business (33 credits on 90) most of the classes you have to take are not at all relevant to tech in business. The only really useful ones you get to take are the 400 level business classes because that's pretty much the only tech related ones that weren't designed for people that don't say: “omg i suck at computers” (like 400 level btm classes) besides that the classes you take will genuinely feel trivial next to your compsci classes. “Oh your taking  computer vision? Lets pair this with an intro to marketing to really balance that out.” They take a fraction of the time you need to study for in comparison to comp sci classes. The skills you learn aren't that useful and you could spend your time learning something more valuable, like the math option.

Registering for your jmsb class is awful because you have to do it in person and after all the jmsb students register for the classes (so some time in april when they are open in march). 

Pros:

The” information system” option does make some companies perk up when they see it on your cv (because they have no clue how bs it is). I got a job a year before I graduated at a major accounting firm, as a developer due in some part to this. One of the reasons was because i had SAP ERP on my cv, ( btm 430, which btw is also a joke of a class. I did it next to comp 335 in summer and studied a total of 8 hours for that class while i was drowning in Shiri’s class). But as mentioned before If you want easy classes to pass then jmsb is for you.

Having a disability:

I am also a student with a disability which means i took all my exams in a different place, got extra time as well. Some profs are totally understanding of this and others will bitch you out and say you don't need the extra time because xyz. But ACSD (Access Centre for Students with Disabilities) usually has your back and will make sure you can take your exam with them if push comes to shove. If you know you have a learning disability or any type of disability, I highly recommend you make the steps to get diagnosed, it helped me so much getting 50% more time in exams. I'm pretty sure there were classes I would have to retake if I didn't have the extra time.

In conclusion,  like anything school is what you make of it, I spent countless hours working towards this degree. Computer science was really hard for me but i didn't give up and I don't regret it. I love what I do and couldn't be happier with my choice. The school was what got me my internship and my job and where I went to meet new people and make friends. I definitely cried over hard exams or bad grades, when I worked my ass off  to see a C as my final grade after spending weeks studying  (or programming) from 9 in the morning till 2 in the morning. But I am ok with that and i was and still willing to pay that price to continue to work in something I love. 

If you have any specific questions, feel free to ask."

My school allows us to be pretty flexible in courses and we can have up to two concentrations. Currently I have three areas that I'm considering: Machine Learning, Cloud/Distributed System, and Core Computer Science (advanced algorithms, web development, etc). 

&amp;#x200B;

My reasons for considering each are:

* Machine Learning: I find the topics covered very interesting and it seems like machine learning is being integrated everywhere and that is where the market is moving
* Cloud/Distributed Systems: So many projects are based on cloud platforms now and that there are still a lot of things to be solved in the cloud like security
* Core CS: I have had a few internships as a SWE and I really enjoyed them. Learning more of these core principles and at a higher level seems like it would be extremely beneficial long term especially since I'd like to move up to a leadership/management role eventually

&amp;#x200B;

Between these topics or even others if you have suggestions, is there a combo of two topics that best seem to compliment each other? Thank you!"

I’m about to graduate with a bachelors in urban planning and minors in GIS and Environmental Studies. Unfortunately I struggled with career path for a while in college until I found out about GIS, and at that point the best I could do was continue with my major and get these extra minors. 

I have a few GIS internships but the majority are with government entities doing basic data management and digitizing. I’m hoping to focus more towards the environmental side of GIS but am not sure where to start. Most of my GIS classes haven’t really covered the ways GIS can be used for that sector, as the minor is housed under the Urban Planning department. 

What jobs should I be looking for? I’ve just been searching “GIS jobs” in my area, but are there more specific titles I could look for? I just don’t know how to narrow my search to find these types of jobs over utilities or government GIS jobs.

Are there any skills I need to stand out? What ways do you use GIS in this area? I have coding skills in python, JavaScript, and html."

For you guys/gals that are the youngest at your organization, do you feel like your advice is overlooked or not taken seriously because of your years of experience or age?

For example I’m currently 28 (colleagues are 34-60) started my career as an intern and after 4.5 years I’m developing/managing our tools &amp; automation in the tech industry. There’s a lot of shit that goes on in this field and you primarily learn by exposure, experience, and time. So of course I’m not as experienced as someone that’s been doing it for 10+ years but what I do know is that I make logical decisions and recommendations based on my experience, understanding of our operations, and procedures. 

Management often asks for my opinion but I swear the final decision is always the opposite of what I recommended and it leads to them failing their goal. The best part is they don’t ever admit that my recommendation would have been the right decision. So I’m wondering how do you deal with this in your work place?

It’s only in my best interest to improve and bring value to the company so I don’t really understand people that are like this. 

Is this toxic and I need to go?"

My mentally handicapped uncle is living with my parents and I. He has been here for the past 9 months. 

He has been dealing with a chemical imbalance since he was young and he's almost 60 now. A few years ago he was evaluated in a mental institution and he was diagnosed with being bi polar, hypochondriac, and a schizophrenic. The institution didn't keep him because he has no medical insurance and refuses to get medical insurance. This is in the state of New Jersey. 

He was prescribed prescriptions for which he never filled or took because he thinks there is nothing wrong with him. Since he has moved in with us he has been nothing but a nuisance for my parents and I. He refuses to go on disability or unemployment so he has no income and he refuses to not give any money that he has to my parents for food, bills, etc. 

He constantly says inappropriate things such as he's allowed to date girls even if they're underage, how he's executed a bunch of people, he was in the military and secret service, and how our family members are really clones and undercover. He's also a big racist and we have neighbors that are african american that live next door to us. I should also mention I am 22 M. 

He's also fought with my mom (his sister) and has almost physically assaulted her at one point as well as almost physically assaulting my dad. He's also told me he will kill them if they disrespect him but I wouldn't be harmed. I honestly don't know how he's still here at this point after openly threatening my parents. My mom refuses to kick him out because he has nowhere else to go yet they fight on a daily basis and i'm getting really sick of it. He has also threatened to either let our dog go, or kill it because he thinks it's sick. He's 10 but he's almost as energetic as he was when he was a puppy.

My friends have told me that i've been different lately. Like i'm not myself and I can imagine it has something to do with this whole situation. I get angry every day I wake up and when I go to bed because he's there, eating our food,refusing to pay any money, and openly threatening my parents. My only escape was the gym and I'd spend as much time on campus at my college as possible so I didn't have to be home with him but since both of them are closed and i'm stuck to live with Mr. Wonderful over here i've been feeling angrier every day to the point where if it does boil over I know something physical is going to happen.

My mother doesn't work and I had an internship but was laid off due to COVID-19 and would help out my dad with the bills sometimes as he's the only one who works so money is very tight. My mom has brothers who refuse to help out and couldn't give a shit about the whole situation so they're both dead to me as well. 

I'd just like if there's any way that we can have him committed against his will because we've tried and he's refused to go. If you've read this far then i greatly appreciate it and you can clearly see he is not normal and needs to be in some sort of mental hospital. I'm not sure how everything exactly works as i've never had to deal with something like this before and my parent's are basically useless sorry to say. If someone who's living with you and is mentally unstable openly threatens your life I don't know what else would cause you to throw that person out of the house. 

If there's any advice out there i'd greatly appreciate it. I want him out of my house as I fear for my parent's safety. He's said that I wouldn't be touched but if he lays a hand on my parent's im jumping in. I'm also an only child so I don't really have any other family as the rest of our family doesn't give a shit.

I thank anyone who takes the time to read this mess and offer any advice they may have. I'd just like him gone. That's all.

I'm having a hard time making a decision and honestly also stressed.

A little about myself - I graduated August 2019 with a CS degree a small internship and a few projects on my resume (with one solid project I can talk about in depth). I consider myself competent and willing to put in hard work to learn but have little to no industry experience.

Recently I received two different offers - an internship with Ondot and a program through the Insight Fellows program. I need to choose one due to schedule conflicts and the fact that Insight prohibits me from engaging in any other work during their program.

This is what I know about both:

&amp;#x200B;

||Ondot internship|Insight fellowship|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Start date|May 11th|May 26th|
|Duration|15 weeks|7 weeks|
|Pay|$16-$20/hr|Free training/unpaid (if hired in &lt; 6 months AND salary &gt; $100,000, asks for 7% of salary for 2 yrs)|
|Location|Remote (based in Santa Clara)|Remote (local office available)|
|Pros|\- Actual industry experience|\- Hands on, self directed learning with mentorship and specialized recruitment workshops|
||\- Looks better on resume|\- Good project building|
||\- Job security: Likely to transition into full-time|\- Strong networking: Direct scouting from tech companies|
|Skills to be used/gained|AWS tools, Java|Any; involves Blockchain|
|Comments||Insight claims: Median time to hire: 8 weeks, 88% job offer acceptance rate after program and $119,000 average base salary.|

&amp;#x200B;

I'm leaning towards Insight but my biggest concern is that if I don't do well or come out of it without good hiring prospects, I'll have shot myself in the foot by declining the Ondot internship that probably would've secured me a full time.

If you have any thoughts and tips on helping me choose, I'd highly appreciate it !"

gdnlb4,1,2020-05-04,Should I start telling people about my autism?,qtc30,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gdnlb4/should_i_start_telling_people_about_my_autism/,"(TLDR is at the bottom)

So I'm in my early 20s and my life is going nowhere. I live with my parents. Every day I wake up and graduation gets further. I watch Youtubers with jobs and friends and vacation plans and places in New York or London or LA. A creeping suspicion comes over me that I'll never have what they do. Nearly any disability can be accepted and overcome...unless it's autism. A large subset of the population probably believes I'm better off dead. Maybe they're right.

I've never had a group of friends. The closest I've come was 3 friends, and that only lasted a single summer. It was one of the best summers of my life. I was identified in the 99th percentile of IQ as a child and got good grades in high school, which got me into a top 20 university. Everyone thought I was going to make it. Unfortunately, the day I stepped onto campus ushered in the beginning of the end. I guess I thought that my lifelong alienation, loneliness, and misery was a fluke- a product of the suburban American milieu. Now I'd be around people who were \*different\*, people who were intuitive and intellectual. I'd find my people, start my career, continue getting wonderful grades, and the rest would be history. Unfortunately it didn't work that way.

Freshman fall I didn't make friends like I expected. I was rejected by a guy I had pseudo-dated for a few months and was really starting to like. I stopped going to class and didn't know why. After my birthday passed I tried to kill myself and everyone talked about it. I became even more of an outcast, and it never ended. I constantly got in trouble with professors for my inconsistency and lack of decorum. I also faced frequent disciplinary action from the school for expressing suicidal thoughts that my roommates would report. I was moved into my own dorm eventually but I'd already checked out. I'd waited my whole life for things to ""click"" and thought college would be my shangri-la. When it wasn't I started giving up. And as I grew up, social blunders that used to be overlooked due to my other qualities started landing me in the hot seat. I no longer was teacher's pet. Almost everybody I encountered was eventually pissed off by me, and as the damage compiled it got harder and harder for me to maintain any sort of reputation.

Either due to stress, lifelong fatigue, or the heightened consciousness that comes with growing older, my sensory issues got worse. Fluorescent lights became unbearable, often causing me to skip class or get up and leave in the middle. My circadian rhythm became nocturnal and I stopped being able to wake up in the morning. Cold temperatures, hunger, and professional clothing often made 9-5 internships hell. Every obligation I had started to be a minefield, and I became a quitter. I lost my reputation for excellence and became someone instead seen as a flightly slacker, graduating with a shit GPA. I wasn't diagnosed at the time but I knew what the problem was. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to change the fact that my life was tanking.

After graduation I spent almost a year whacked out on drugs and supplements trying out different concoctions to rewire my brain. I developed derealization and amnesia, going to the darkest psychological prison I've ever encountered in my life. I got off of all of it 2 months ago, just as quarantine was starting, and returned to equilibrium. Now I'm a year post-grad and have terrible grades, no references academic or professional, no savings, and a history of fuck-ups. I'm also bitter, and that never helps.

I have a hunch that I can't survive doing what others do. I can't play by the rules and get a 9-5 and impress people. I'll always need to do things from the sidelines, and on my own terms, if I'm going to do anything at all. But it's taken me a long time to even be definitively sure of my autism, let alone identify with it. I want to start telling people, including my former professors and colleagues, so that they understand. But I don't want autism to become my identity, and because it's such a rogue trait I suspect that whoever I tell will just see me as ""the autistic girl"". Even if they see me positively and push me into a savant role, I'll never get to be cool or intriguing. I'll be a stereotype, more of a spectacle and enigma confronted from a psychological distance than someone valued for who they are as an individual.

**TLDR:** I need to get the hell out of here and salvage my life. I'm messed up and people need to know that I'm not like them and can't do what they do, but that doesn't mean I can't do anything. I want to vindicate myself to my old professors especially, as I probably loved my major more than anyone despite the fact that my attendance and performance were so bad. But I don't know if they'd want to hear anything from me anyway, especially this. And neurotypicals seem to hate excuses and self-indulgence as well as people categorized in groups designated as weak/inferior, so maybe I'm better off not mentioning autism even if I have to keep looking like an ass. Should I make autism part of my public identity, or not? Is there any middle ground?"

gdodsz,2,2020-05-04,A+ Cert and advice request: Help me help my brother,CSBrotherHelp,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gdodsz/a_cert_and_advice_request_help_me_help_my_brother/," Hey Reddit,

I’ve come looking for some help on behalf of my brother (or advice for how I can help him).

Situation: Brother just graduated with his associates in computer science (and another in electrical engineering I think). He is interested in IT, but open to other things (QA, and I don’t know what else, overall he’s rather unsure). He mentioned this CompTIA A+ exam and I’ve seen it mentioned so a current goal I am going to work on with him is getting that certification because as it is now his resume is less than impressive. We’ve also tried setting up a Github portfolio but I’m not able to give much help there. He was also applying to internships, but stopped with COVID stuff.

I bought this book “CompTIA A+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, Tenth Edition (Exams 220-1001 &amp; 220-1002).” My plan was to approach him with doing a section six days a week and then on the seventh I’d proctor an exam. 

I have some questions, both specific to the exam and in general. Hopefully you folks can provide some insight.

1. What is the difference between the 1001 and 1002? My understanding via google is 1001 is more hardwareish while the 1002 is more software/IT troubleshooting. Is one better than the other? Should he get both?
2. What other certs should he look into? Or are they unimportant and the actual projects on the resume matter more?
3. Is it possible to get some type of computer related job (IT, QA, software engineer) with only an associates? What are some good entry points? (Even internship entry points.)
4. Is it unprofessional to not have your full name as your Github ID? 
5. Any general advice you can give?"
gdofou,8,2020-05-04,From wasteful youth and major hopping to Cloud/DevOps,Chompy_99,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gdofou/from_wasteful_youth_and_major_hopping_to/,"*I've had a whiskey, so this is going to be a long post down memory lane*

I could have a Masters degree, I tend to think about all the time i've wasted. I thought i'd share my story of not figuring out my career path until later in life.

TLDR

* Born in Toronto Ontario Canada
* Attended highschool, was fascinated with computers, building them, troubleshooting etc.
* Attended College, jumped 3 majors
* Graduated University
* IT rotational program
* Cloud / DevOps Role

**College:**

I never really knew what I wanted to in Community College. I was told from a young age that I had ADD and would never graduate University, to which my immigrant parents did not believe and transferred me out of my elementary school to another school. I have a feeling a lot of 90s kids were mis-diagnosed, but that's another conversation, I don't take any related drugs or have been tested again. In College, i accepted a marketing program. I then dropped out and transferred to supply chain after a month. I ended up taking Supply Chain Management, as end-to-end production of finished goods and products was fascinating to me, however as the program become technically more complex, I lost interest. There's only so many bill of materials, ERP systems, queue optimization I can handle. I was at a pivotal point in my life: accepting a co-op at a distinguished electrical firm as a Junior Buyer and graduate in 6 months or transferring the program into something general, piggy-backing into university. I chose the later. I transferred into Business Administration, added 1 extra year, and graduated with a fairly useless diploma. It did, all things considered, provide me with a strong business background which proved useful later on. I was able to use the grades and transfer into a Business Technology Management (similar to a MIS program).

**University:**

I had finally made it to university which was a life-long dream, and re-started my education at 24. I was able to write-off a majority of my electives through the transfer and adhered to the core courses such as software development, database management, systems design etc. Being mature and older in University was definitely a drag down for me, a lot of my friends were starting their professional lives, getting jobs, or settling down. I had not figured out my life yet, but I knew, my career was tech and this time, i wouldn't alter from my passion as a high school kid. I did fairly decent in University, however, a lot of my pressure was internal competing with my past self, I had a deep feeling that I was losing time and I needed to try harder, work harder and get the BETTER internships then my peers. This led me down to mild depression, playing catch up with my younger self who failed and did not understand his life's purpose or direction, a bit existentialist. I lucked out and got 2 fantastic internships. One internship was working for a Government Crown Hydro corporation and the other was a top 5 finance company in Canada.

**1st internship:**

Once again, the slow depressing feeling of not being adequate crept in. I WAS HIRED, so i have to know everything right?! They hired me for a reason, so as soon as i started, I become annoyed with my lack of competency and not understanding technical systems fully such as MS Access, Excel, SQL. The frustration showcased on my boss who had hired me and I'll always recall a conversation I was not meant to here: ""I need someone more CompSci, he's not CompSci, what can we do about this?."" Moving 1.5hrs away from home to a new city where i knew no one and now the constant pressure of my boss weighed me down. In retrospect, it was a fuel to do the best I can at this job, get the experience, and get out. A lot my exposure was first to Excel / PowerPoint where I prepared 100 slides a week about Excel graphs, tables, PivotTables etc. This led my hunger to improve and be the best by learning VB Coding. I was able to automate a lot of the menial boring tasks and conduct different analytics on business processes for teams. Albeit, understanding supply chain processes was extremely confusing and still is. This led me down to managing my first senior management level meeting where we tracked workgroups, teams, production issues and I prepared a deck for each week. My business acumen was developed through a lot of these interactions. The real stickler was coding and automation which lit a giant fire for having a passion to develop effective, seamless workflows.

**2nd internship:**

I had regained a lot of confidence after going back to university, being in the workplace and developing automated solutions. This led me to my 2nd internship and also current employer. I worked as a business systems analyst who reported on various IT project metrics + excel guinea pig. Once again, i supported a company-wide Windows10 migration with a lot of senior management exposure. I also brought my love for VB/Macro scripting to this role and found different ways to automate a lot of the in-efficient Excel oriented tasks that teams do. There is a lot of technical debt in large Corporations even at a basic level of really understanding how to effectively use and build Excel. Let's just say there are tons of bad business practices and one of them is tracking hundreds of projects in Excel Workbooks. 

This internship was short - 4 months, but the big takeaway from here is networking. Networking with your managers, directors, and senior level staff helps build paths into opportunities. I heavily networked with my Director who had suggested I sign-up for a ""IT rotational management program."" I decided to throw my hat in the ring and apply. I eventually went through 3 interviews, Director level, then VP level for the final round. I met with the previous Director for a coffee chat and advised her I was in final rounds and would truly appreciate a recommendation. She provided the recommendation and I can say without a doubt, she is probably what led me down the path to pursuing my IT career further, albeit, with a lot of mixed feelings.


**IT Rotational Program:**

**Salary**: $60k + 8% salary increase (every 6 months for 2 years) + 5% annual bonus

I was provided a offer letter 1 year ahead of graduation which was pretty amazing. If you've made it this far, you're thinking that's a golden ticket and he's set? Nope, once again a bit of anxiety and 2nd guessing comes into play. Rotational programs are awesome, you can land good programs and get 6-10% increases every 6 months or when a rotation ends. In my case, it was like this, however a large majority of programs are not structured this way. The real downside for me personally was I was trading of ""hard"" experience for a ""soft"" rotational exposure into many different IT related roles. My roles were broken down into Solution Architect, CyberSecurity, and Big Data. Looking back, it seemed like this type of exposure is a jack of all trades, but master in none. The exposure across the organization into different faucets is something that proved highly valuable for me as i ended the program. I learned a lot of python, VBA, SQL, Hadoop domain knowledge, AWS, and general/ Cloud IT architecture. A lot of these roles had straight lines of sight in Directors, AVPs, and VP level meetings that I was apart of. Once again, I was able to build credibility and network through this exposure into my future roles. I knew I wanted to be involved in either Data Analytics or AWS Cloud. I setup my LinkedIn with job posting notifications daily for my current company, and hounded internal job postings every.single.day.

Any job posting I saw, I had a DIRECT line of sight into the org structure, teams, and management. A lot of postings I saw, i researched the team. Looked up team members LinkedIn Profiles, gauged there experiences, to understand what I was getting into and how I can develop professionally alongside my peers. The finance company I am in had a mature crowd, being strategic and finding a good team with a good fit is important. As job postings came, I coffee chatted with managers and directors for best-fits. I got turned down from a few internal jobs. Hell, I interviewed externally as well! Biggest disappointment -- interviewed at a finance company competitor for a data position, i bombed the interview and received a rejection notice as i stepped foot into my car. That one stung. Perseverance is critical, I have been through disappointment, depression, and anxiety before. This is not stopping me this time! I eventually found a AWS Cloud Administrator position.

Cloud Administrator position was a bit of a stretch given my domain knowledge is beginner/mid level around networking, databases, and security. However, after multiple coffee chats with the Director (5 in total), he had finally extended a offer. I had finally landed my dream job at 29.



**Current Role - Cloud Infrastructure / DevOps**
**Salary: 96k**

Through a long path, I finally had gotten my dream career. In my current role, we're a liason between development teams, business, and infrastructure. We manage, deploy, configure our data/analytics AWS Services (EMR, Glue, SageMaker, EC2s, Lambdas, ETL, etc.). The beginning of the role was tough as my AWS knowledge was very limited, but I had a hunger to learn about architecture and automation which married my 2 passions from earlier experiences. I studied for the SAA cert, failed by 5 questions, planning to re-write again. I now am a Solution Architect on the business side and DevOps engineer on the Infra side. We are Canada's largest institutions leveraging the AWS SageMaker  ML/AI platform. I get to steer executive meetings and automate using tools such as Jenkins, Ansible, Artifactory, Boto3, Python, Linux, Bash etc. Prior to this, i barely knew any Linux or Bash. It's been a long path, but I finally feel comfortable in my own skin. Cloud is a interesting space, as innovations happen monthly, and what's new today, is outdated within months. There's rapid advancements in the technological innovation and companies are adapting as fast as they can. Enterprise work has been fun, albeit, i do hate the red-tape. Organizational Silos, processes management, sign-offs etc. it can be very annoying. Although, being a publicly traded company, i digress. 

I did attempt to escape Enterprise culture and red-tape by interviewing at FAANG / Amazon and another Series C startup. I made it to final rounds for both companies and received a Amazon offer for a Solution Architect, but ended up turning it down.

**After-thoughts:**

You'll notice that I did not focus a lot on what Certs do I have (because i have none) or my technical skills acquired over my short professional tenure. There's a reason for that and it was alluded to in a another post. Soft skills, networking, business management, and understanding how to combine all of this with your technical knowledge is what makes a great candidate. Going the extra mile to network is a truly dying skill imho. Being a millennial (hate this term, born in 90), I see a lot of my generation forgetting the soft aspect that comes to business, the soft skills that close the deals, create change, push management in certain directions. That is something that is needed more in IT. Understanding that we only make it as far as our comfort zone allows. Pushing outside of the bubble and doing new things such as networking, coffee chats, and learning a new skill you might not need now, but in the future will pay off. As someone who still tends to think about all the time I feel like i've wasted closing my 30s, remember, it's about the experience and what you build out of it. A lot of the wasted time, no sense of direction are all seeds being planted to build out success later on in life. I hope this post helps those find solace during these difficult times and helps others with providing a sense of direction."

I did have some times where I struggled but it was brief. Although, next semester, I'll be taking the Data Structures course and feel like I do not know too much about some data structures. I'm good with arrays, arraylists, bsts, and maps. I'm having a hard time really understanding heaps, linkedlists, and all. Stacks and Queues, I have an okay understand of but in the end, it's just ""okay"". I don't have any in-depth understanding of many data structures and would like some advice on where exactly to start.

I do not have any projects in my portfolio either, other than one we made in our java class. It was console based but I suppose it was a bit complicated, but the only structures we used were maps and arraylists. 

I really want to get some projects under my belt, especially those that involve high use of data structures so I can learn and understand them. And of course so I can start preparing for internships next year, although, they aren't my priority right now. 

Also, I've tried a few leetcodes as well but I am doing them without using any data structures, only for loops and all, just basic things that come with Java. I only realize that I can do the leetcode using data structures after I see the solution, what could I do for this? I am guessing I should just code and code more but is there anything else you all recommend?

Sorry for the long post. Thanks in advance."

I am currently about to become a new grad graduating from computer science and last summer i did my internship as a janitor. I really enjoyed it and learned about cs stuff. I was thinking about going full time as a janitor after I graduate so when I knew I was graduating, I asked my boss if I could go full time but it turns out that they arent hiring and laid off all their interns cus of the pandemic . This absolutely sucked because a janitor was the only software position I qualified for and now I dont know what to do. Im thinking about getting a job at McDonalds but I will need beg in front of the manager to get the job. Any thoughts as to what I should do?"

So I am currently 3 credits shy of finishing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and plan to have it by this July. My plan originally was to just immediately hop into the job market and see what I liked or what was available. I believe I have a solid resume (Internship with huge company, solid GPA, etc.), so I figured that even though competition would be fierce and I know i'm not the best at what I do, I could find I job I could like/tolerate. However, due to COVID-19 and a recent e-mail, things have changed a bit.

I got an email from a higher-up in the university congratulating me on being so close to graduation, and that the chair of my department had recommended me for the graduate program, a scholarship, and a GA position. They also said due to the circumstances of COVID-19, they would waive the GRE and application fee. I do realize this is an incredible opportunity, but I also feel conflicted. My family is heavily pressuring me to go after it, even though I'm not sure which major to choose of which I am eligible for(Comp sci/Data sci, Comp sci/Comp sci, Mechanical Engineering/Engineering Management), or if I even want to go after it at all.

I recently moved in with long time friends of mine about an hour away from the university, due to the COVID-19 mandate in my state making remote learning for all students mandatory. This was something I had planned to do for a while, but not expecting to move in so early. I was really excited to move in, because for me, it seems like this was going to be the first time in my life I thought I really had some stability. I've never really had a solid friend group, as I've moved every year or two for my entire life. I've always wanted some place I can lie my head with people I trust and not worry about whether or not i'm going to have to say goodbye, pack up, and move hours or states away again.

I do understand the tremendous opportunity here, and I don't take that lightly. But I just feel extremely conflicted and don't know what to do. The prospect of leaving the one place I have stability and friends and going back to the stressful life that is school + work terrifies me, even more so than not knowing which major to go for. However, I know I won't have this chance again. Any advice?"
gdsaki,2,2020-05-05,I just feel so overwhelmed...,AvailableAnnual,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/gdsaki/i_just_feel_so_overwhelmed/,"\*\*As I'm wrapping up, I'm sorta hoping that no one actually reads this. I know it's just a mess of whiny complaints and emotions, but I feel like I gotta get this outta my system somehow. Sorry guys\*\*

I'm using a semi throw away because truthfully, I think that's what I feel about my emotions of late. With this pandemic going on, I can't help but revisit some feelings and thoughts in the back of my mind that I've tried to keep hidden for so long now. It's an amalgam of anxiety, shame, embarrassment, and stupid pride. I'm so ashamed of it, but it's hard to just let these things go.

When I was in high school, I got rejected to so many colleges and to this day, I think that's had such a draining impact on my emotional health. All this pressure around me from my family and environment just came crashing down when I couldn't get into most of the schools I wanted and had to end up at one of my lower safeties. It was embarrassing, and I felt like I was a complete failure. I wanted to blame people; that's always the easiest thing to do I guess when you're hurting. I wanted to blame my parents for transferring me out of my childhood hundreds of miles away in the middle of my high school years. I wanted to blame my teachers for  being so unhelpful, lazy, and just bad educators at times. 

As I want to go into finance, going into this ""second-rate"" school seemed like a huge thorn in my side I couldn't seem to get out. When I walked outside, I couldn't get rid of this searing pain. My parents saw it too, and that was one of the worst parts. They tried everything they could to make me feel better (offering to pay for transferring to another school), but we're obviously not rich enough to make the impossible happen. Even when I got to school, it was hard to shake that off. Reading online about how recruiting at my school was basically nonexistent put me into a deeper and deeper hole each day. It was sad to wake up to those thoughts some mornings. 

Still, I had goals along the way to get me motivated to move. For example, I told myself that if I were to get an internship with a really good company this summer, then I'd be great! But even though I got one, I didn't get the answers I wanted. I still felt empty inside. That thorn that had been in my abdomen for so long was still sitting there, bleeding me out and infecting the flesh of my soul. I realized that I might never get over the fact that I'm stuck in this school I didn't want to go to and that I was never going to be happy. These steps I could make along the way seemed pointless, and no matter how hard I tried, my fuckups in high school were going to destroy my entire life. Getting one internship or a good GPA didn't actually make me feel that much better after a few days. I felt a part of my happiness was ripped away, and no matter how hard I tried, I was NEVER going to get it back. 

I think that was the problem though. Life isn't just about the achievements you make at small, incremental points in your life. It's about the long-term marathon that brings you to the endgame. Sure, I didn't get into the schools I wanted, and I'm at a college that will make it very hard to get the job I want in the future. But that's the thing. These small individual events in our lives aren't what make the experience what it is. It's about how we move on and grow from them as part of ourselves. Our path. I believe that everything that happens in our lives really does come for a reason. They're all just a piece of a grand, larger, beautiful puzzle. Often times, you won't be able to see the big picture, and that's ok. You just have to have *faith* that the only thing important than the ""right now"" is what you do with it, not being happy or depressed as I was. Being rejected and going somewhere I didn't want to be is always going to be a part of me, no matter how hard I pretend that I'm cool with it. The truth is though, that even though I may think that I knew what was best for me in the past, it's not always going to be what I was meant to learn. I just don't know the big picture yet, and that's ok. You're not supposed to know where you'll be in 10, 20 years. Because even though things may not go according to plan, there's an entire universe of possibilities that you yourself have control over. It's not just your past that makes you who you are, but what you do with it after that will determine your path in the long run. These events, whether they be rejections or offers, are part of a marathon, not a sprint.

Moving forward, I now realize that the only person truly responsible for my destiny is myself. Putting it on others was a selfish thing to do, and ""carpe diem"" sounds more true to my realizations every passing day. I like to think that this changed after my fall semester in college. Looking back, I've look inside myself and realized that the only thing holding me back was my attitude. Being with new people and just having fun eventually hanged my mindset. I've even lost 20 pounds in a year (sort of a side goal that has helped maintain my emotional health)!

Overall, this message has no true purpose. You can take it however you want. Maybe you'll scoff at my childless. Maybe you'll find some truth to your own experiences. But it's all really been about myself. After all, even without my parents and friends, there'd be no me without well...me."
gdsec7,2,2020-05-05,How to word/explain this on linnkedin/resume,dgxnil,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/gdsec7/how_to_wordexplain_this_on_linnkedinresume/,"Hello Everyone,

I just finished up an internship at an engineering firm that makes embedded devices. Because of Covid this internship was cut one month early. Anyways i'm starting to update my linked in and resume and i was wondering how to properly word/write some of the stuff i did there, it was a small mom and pop company so things werent always very clear in terms of what i was doing, it was more of ""hey OP, we need this product to do this using this protocol, can you get a prototype working"".

one of the clients was an elevator company that commissioned us in the past to build their entire control network for their elevators and now wants to add a voice annunciator (a device that announces the current floor). This device had to read the data bits that are being sent up and down the data bus, make a decision and send a serial command to a mp3 Player. Now i wrote the SW to do this, strip the data bits, compute the floor and then send a serial command to the speaker device to play a specific track. Now, the tricky part was that the MCU that was used only had 1 uart which was being used for something else. so my boss tasked me with setting up the sw interrupts to go off at 9600 interrupts/s and sort of bit bang(i dont know if im using the term bit bang correctly) the correct serial commands to the mp3 player. I wrote functions for checksums, and insertion functions, interrupt handler, tested and debugged this with their current system. I designed the hardware, sourced parts on digikey, made the schematic, footprints/symbols, testing.  

This was a very fun project for me to work on and i learned a lot in the process and it took me a while to get it all working smoothly. I'm just wondering how to word this in 1-2 sentences for my linkedin/resume. Would you call this board bring up or software development life cycle? Or is this something that you guys wouldnt even mention? any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated."
gdset8,1,2020-05-05,"I am trying to be a supportive sister, but I think my brother needs more than my advice to help him. How should I go about getting him to go to a therapist?",tryingmybestjk,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gdset8/i_am_trying_to_be_a_supportive_sister_but_i_think/,"Hi! I am new to Reddit and posting on this platform, so sorry for any formatting errors. Please let me know if I am overlooking certain Reddit etiquette!

The story:

My older brother (20M) and me(18F) are decently close, and he has been going through a lot of emotional turmoil. He is on the spectrum of autism and has issues socializing or picking up on body language. He is also fairly introverted. This makes forming friendships very difficult for him. He is a sophomore in college, and I am a freshman. I was very fortunate to form some great friendships and am enjoying the experience (that was until quarantine lol). I am someone my brother confides in, and I love and support him but I think he needs more. My parents are very loving, though of course they are human and have their flaws. They are very Christian and wanted my brother and me to be the same way, and neither of us is. This pressure, as well as them trying to push my brother to be more social, has created tension in their relationship and he does not confide in him as he used too. I think I am his sole confidant and the only one he is somewhat touching on these emotions with.

He is looking to me for advice on how to make friends, how to get people to like him, how to socialize, etc. I cannot give him the help he is looking for. I can give him pointers, but honestly, he is experiencing something I haven't. I am a very sociable girl, and though I have guy friends, I am not sure how those relationships are formed or maintained by guys. I've reassured him that people like him because they do. He can be somewhat awkward times, but he is still a very nice person and people enjoy interacting with him. He believes because people don't ask him to hang out, they don't like him, or that if people do ask him to hang out he is an afterthought. I don't know how to help him build up his confidence or get himself out of this cycle of self-rejection. Also, he has never dated and is convinced he is never going to get married because he cannot see how a woman could love him, but he is wrong so! Girls in high school asked him out, but he said no! (Why he did this is a whole other can of worms, but I digress). Girls were interested in him, but I think he is too blinded by his perception of himself to understand why. I think a therapist would be more equipped to give him tools to navigate social situations better.

Another issue is the stress he puts on himself to be successful. Additionally, he is terrified of entering the job market, because he thinks that since he is unable to socialize like his peers, employers will not want to hire him. (But he is an incredibly smart, and talented individual). The problem is he is now comparing him and me in this regard too. I was able to land a research position as a freshman in exactly the field I want to go in (Coding in Astrophysics if anyone was curious lol). He has not been able to get an internship, but that's mostly because he hasn't really been pushing towards it until this year, and with quarantine, all opportunities he might have had evaporated. Whatever career aspirations he has, he now sees as improbable. I think it is because he sees me, his sister who is more socially inclined but with worse grades, immediately be offered a position at a lab. Keep in mind he has a near a 4.0, and though I do not get all A's I get mostly B's and A's, so it is not like there was a huge disparity between the two of us. Also, they didn't even ask for my GPA??

This is really starting to break him down emotionally and he just at a low in his life. He is constantly talking to himself and I can hear him, though he doesn't know (his room and bathroom or near me/my room so I can't really escape it). I try to tune it out to give him privacy, but I could hear him through my headphones. He was talking about how he thinks the last time he was truly happy was elementary school, how he hates everything he is doing in university (that it feels meaningless), and so on. He was being self-deprecating to himself in the third person, which I found very concerning. I am worried that if my brother continues down this path he will become depressed or suicidal. I am terrified of losing him.

I have suggested the idea of therapy to him, but he has a warped perception of seeking professional help. Essentially, he sees this as being weak. He thinks that he has to struggle through everything to become stronger, but this is not the case for two reasons.

(1) Everyone needs help sometimes, and your friends and loved ones are meant to be a safety net and be strong when you cannot.

(2) I am helping him; I am the safety net. I love my brother, but this is a lot of pressure to put on me. I am not able to get him the help he needs and I feel as if something happens to him, it will be my fault. I feel like I am not doing enough. He isn't making me feel like this, but in order for him to improve things need to change.

He is lonely, and maybe just talking his feeling through with another trusted person could really help him. I  just don't know how to help him.

I think therapy would really help my brother. He is so young and has his whole life ahead of him. Money is not an issue, and my parents would be more than willing to provide this service if he asked for it. How should I broach the subject of therapy with him again? Should I discuss this with my parents? I do not want to go into detail about his personal issues, but I think maybe if my parents approached them with the idea to go to therapy he'd feel more inclined to try it? How should I go about discussing this with my parents? Is it even my place to try to get my brother to get therapy?

I don't know at this point, and sorry for the word vomit that is my post. If you managed to slog your way through it, thank you! Sorry that this is super long but I think writing down the situation was cathartic for me."

I've created this throwaway account to ask for advice without reservations, and because I urgently need to get this off my chest.

I am a 22 year-old male currently living with my mother and siblings in Spain. I have a steady job which provides for the household (as extra income) as well as myself and my younger sister for those little things that we couldn't otherwise afford. All in all, I have it pretty good in that regard, which I appreciate.

I am a web developer and I also deal with technical translation, both of which happen to be hobbies of mine. I used to love my job -- I spent years building up my résumé, dedicating hours and hours to ensuring that I would grow up to be productive.  I got an internship with the company four years ago and have been working full-time ever since. I am completely indifferent towards it now.

I have considered quitting my job. Whenever I think about it I realise that it is not a good idea, particularly so with the current situation, but at the same time it is chipping away at my mental health. It could very well be exhaustion, but it is hard to endure.

On a personal level, I feel empty. Just dead. I don't have the motivation to do anything anymore. My life doesn't really have direction and I am completely unable to envision a future for myself.

A few months ago, I wanted to move out and rent someplace to be by myself. My sister would be moving in with me, as we are very close. Today, I don't think I can bear the thought of living mostly alone.

Outside of my immediate family, I have no one. I used to have a close friend with whom I could talk for days on end -- however, life put some distance between the two of us and there is no contact anymore. I realise, in a way, that this closeness also isolated me socially to the extent that I cared very little to socialise with anyone else. That is entirely my fault and I can see that now.

This lack of an actual social circle has also become quite crippling. I have many acquaintances, but none I feel really comfortable with. I am not an introverted person by nature, and I am rather sociable, but because of all the aforementioned issues I find it very hard to get close to other people. It might be that I don't pay enough attention, or that I don't try hard enough -- the outcome is the same in any case. I feel extremely lonely.

It has become so overwhelming that I have considered moving abroad and starting anew. I have always wanted to move to the United Kingdom, but I also feel that I would be unable to take root and make a living for myself, and in failing would be forced to move back sooner or later. And of course, in any case, the quarantine situation has frustrated any plans I might have otherwise had for the near future.

The result is that I find myself daydreaming often and feel like I am too much in my head. It is becoming maddening and I often go entire days where I don't feel like myself at all -- like I am in a haze. I would best describe this as a mental fog of sorts which clouds external stimuli to the point where I barely even notice the passing of time. No matter what I'm doing, it all feels essentially the same. I dissociate to the fullest extent.

Whenever I am not living in my head, I feel dissatisfied and extremely apathetic. I get too little sleep and am unable to perform adequately during the day. I feel like a zombie, and it's slowly killing whatever little joy I derive from the few hobbies I have. I feel lost, broken and I am having strong negative thoughts more and more often as of late.

I need counselling. I know not all is lost and I am not one to give up. But the truth is, I am constantly looking backward and inward, instead of forward. I am either replaying the same damn memories over and over again in my head or fantasising new ones because I just can't seem to create any actual ones that feel real enough.

It used to be that this only happened occasionally and I would be able to focus again. Nowadays it happens most of the time. I snap out of it every so often and feel like I wasn't even here, everything feels... unreal, and I feel ashamed, too. I try my best to rationalise all of this but even in the most lucid of moments, I can feel this mental fog creeping in, just waiting for me to zone out again.

It is mentally exhausting, and I don't know that it is going to get much better, if at all.

Thank you for hearing me out."

What should I do?,CrypticUniversalMave,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gdu3ya/22_year_old_advice_for_universitygeneral_life/,"Life is so confusing, especially when you're looking for your purpose..or at least something you enjoy, while simultaneously making enough money to cover your cost of living/interests. 

**Skip to Present or TL;DR at the bottom, if you don't want to read this fluff :(**

A little (lot) about me: I'm from Barbados, currently 22, turning 23 November.

***Past - How it all started for me/habits***

Throughout most of my regular school life (Primary/Secondary (Highschool)), I wasn't the over-achiever, I wasn't the failing every class, he needs to repeat everything. I was the, not interested in anything being taught, not failing, average scores mixed with high scores sometimes, never revising or doing homework, I either genuinely forgot, or was more enticed to gaming/tv.

I never knew what I wanted to do, whereas people my age especially during secondary school knew what they wanted and continued on that path, even some who changed their path kept it in the general area. As for me? Everything just felt overdone and nothing appealed to me. I was simply at school because, well that was law. I ended school at 16, and was home for months playing games until my aunt brought me to Virginia to scope out a university she chose for me, I was to go there or anywhere my SATS allowed me to go.

 I was up there for 6 months, I didn't revise a single book, anything. My sleep schedule was so bad, I woke up at 6/8 p.m (missing all my university tours). My head was so far from more education. Anyway, my six months was up, I came back home and for the next few months I played games once again, I was 17 at this point. November rolled around, I did my SATS, decided to revise the math portion, Monday, the test was Saturday. Anyway, I did the test, and let the college board do the work, I got something like 1490. 

My father got me a warehouse job for Christmas, work was fun, not the actual job it was mind-numbing. Moving boxes bla bla. That ended, they called me back sometime later, at this point no universities called or mailed so I went to a technical institute and did Computer Repair/Maintenance. It was fun in terms of, oh that's how it works. In terms of doing it for a job? Nope. I honestly took it because I wanted to learn how to build my own gaming computer. Boom, 5 universities mailed back, I didn't. I believed it didn't make sense to go to a whole other country, go to an expensive university and do a course I had no interest in. 

So I settled for a Community College and did an Associates in Accounts &amp; Management because I believed that's where the money is. Accounts have to be the most boring subject I've ever come across, how people can sit down and do it boggles me. It's the easiest thing I've ever seen, did I mention boring? Management was good, it was basically reading and applying common sense. At this point, my GPA went from 3.8 to 3.4 at the end of my time here. I skipped lots of classes, especially accounts. I only revised the day before the exams.

That ended, I did an internship which was horrible, (the organization lied and used me as a cashier instead of marketing) After I left, however, a different department kept me in contact to create posters for them graphically and other things, which I hated the process of but loved the end result. (I created that!) Anyway, I got a job at a hotel, a crappy houseman job which is basically janitor/cleaning rooms and occasional bar porter work, I hate it. It's easy and it's 8 hours a day, I hate stretching work when there's none. I also decided during this time to go to an open campus and work on a certificate.

***Present***

So during Corona, I decided, this isn't going to work, I want better. I started reading a Jack Canfield book and started writing goals, trying to find more about myself. I decided I'd go for a Bachelors's in pursuit of becoming a Therapist, from my attitude at work, trying to help everyone, helping my friends with their own life issues, trying to give an unbiased, sensible answer.

 While supporting myself in trading, one of my ultimate goals is to work from home.  However, Therapy involves a lot of listening, understanding, and patience. Two of which I struggle with and one which annoys me, even with friends. Sometimes, it's a struggle to get someone to understand another point of view, why theirs is hurting themselves (or others), sometimes I'm not one for conversation, I'm not one for long social activities or long periods of listening to issues, especially when minuscule.

Even when I'm giving advice, I wish they would stop talking, at some point, my personality becomes fake when I have to be nice and understanding. So now, I'm once again at a loss of what to do at university. I'm struggling when teaching myself how to trade, the info is there, it's just hard for me to commit to reading it online. What can I do to find what I can do? I do like photography and tried to buy a Nikon D3500 to take photos but with my situation, my mother takes my funds. (I've been trying to build a computer for years).

I just don't want to end up working minimum wage working 9-5 for the rest of my life to make ends meet. I like to be free, travelling and just creative with my time. (hence why I want to learn to trade, my friends are very good at it, however, not good enough to teach)

I’m a Mechanical Engineering major and I’m highly considering double majoring in CS. I’m currently minoring in CS and just need the upper level to finish it. I have talked to an advisor and if I choose to double major I would have to take an extra year and would graduate in Spring 2022, otherwise I would graduate in Spring 2021 (I’ll be a senior in the fall).

Unfortunately, I did not receive any internship offers this summer and it was a real eye opener for me. I have a low-mid 3s GPA which is by no means bad but even before summer programs were cancelled due to COVID I had no offers. A lot of my friends got jobs in software and I have read a lot about the high demand for CS students. 

So I guess my questions are the following: ME majors, did any of you struggle to find employment after graduation/was it a job you desired? For fifth years, what was your social life like since most of not all of your friends graduated? For those who double majored, did you find that it was easier to find desired employment or do you think it wouldn’t have made a difference?

Thanks for any help/advice!"

I’m a recent graduate in Mechanical Engineering one year out from getting my masters in Mechanical, as well. I had no clue what sort of work I’d be interested in pursuing in the field until recently reading up on what Control Systems/automation Engineers do. It really caught my attention and seems very exciting to me. And seeing as this subreddit is often very helpful and I’m seeking some advice.

What can I do start doing now to effectively pursue potential internships or jobs as a Control Systems engineer?

I understand I should be looking more into PLC and DCS. Are there any specific resources or books you guys recommend for a mechanical like me to begin getting a basic understanding or grasp of these? I know PLC can vary somewhat from company to company and I’m trying to get a general understanding. Something that will give me a good basis without being too overwhelming. I’m willing to put in the time and effort to learn I’m just a slow learner. The most experience I have in something related would be a course called Modeling of Physical Systems. At the end of it we made some basic automatic control systems in Matlab/Simulink which I really enjoyed. I’m taking another course this summer specifically in Modern Control Systems as well. I’m planning to continue working with Simulink and learning it’s ins and out.

I’ve also seen some folks mention that some of the smaller companies (external integrators and automation distribution) aside from bigger companies like Emerson or Rockwell, are good about hiring entry levels and helping them get their hands dirty when it comes to learning on the job. Are there any specific companies you might recommend looking into.

All advice is very helpful even if it’s just where to start.

Thanks!"

1) Take 1 or 2 summer class this summer. In that case, i will have to find an internship for Fall 2020 or I will have to take classes and graduate by December 2020. 

2) No summer classes. As I need to take only 2 classes per semester and currently 3 left. I am still going to be able to do an internship in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021.

My issue is I am going to turn 25 and I already took a semester off for a family issue last year. I am not sure how hard it would be to find a full time in January 2021 if I start to look right now.

- Geographic project (team project, can’t five much details but it’s currently available on the web), i mostly worked with spring boot testing and the user service (OAuth2). 

- Plagiarism detector (team project - full stack). Was working on one of the algorithms (java) 


Projects (personal)
- designed, builded and deployed a job search platform for a start up (they paid me 1500€). This is a full stack project, the back end is pretty big.
- designed, builded and deployed a very basic (with minimal design) website for my uncle’s clothes shop. It’s only front end right now, i added all articles manually (we didn’t want to have a back end).

- GPA 3.25/4.00

Here is the tenth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

\--Nick

First project is revamping their website, making it mobile friendly and moving off Shopify to something cheaper. Second part is doing some backend/operations stuff: for example, figure out a way to automatically print shipping labels when an order is received etc. 

So before I went into the project, I was thinking I’d be building the website from scratch (using things like JS, Vue and other technologies I know). I’m confident in my skills and know I’m capable of building what I want with a database and all. But the more I Iook into the project, the more I realize everything I want to do is already built. Like instead of building the site, I think I’m just going to go with WordPress for a basic structure, add a WooCommerce plugin for the selling &amp; shipping stuff, then if I feel like I need anything else I could either code it up myself or find another plugin.

I don’t have anyone to guide me since I’m the only tech savvy one in the startup, so my question is: is this how things are normally built? Am I doing something wrong or being lazy because I’m choosing not to rebuild the wheel? 

Any guidance/opinions are appreciated!!!"

I might have heard the term once or twice, but it didn’t really interest me because there wasn’t a whole lot of information on Internet of what an infrastructure software engineer does.

A lot of other students I know from my college CS club and hackathons did full-stack development, and so for the longest time, I did full-stack too. It never really crossed my mind to do an infrastructure-related internship, until I got the chance to this past December.

For the past 4 months though, I've been working as a SWE intern on the backend infra team at Flexport. It's been a really fun and exciting experience, and I wanted to share it with y'all!

I spent the last two weeks writing this post that talks about:

\- the work and responsibilities of an infrastructure engineer  
\- projects I worked on during my internship  
\- technologies I used  
\- differences I found, between working on the infra vs. product side

If you’re a student or developer who’s even had a slight interest in infrastructure software engineering, this post is really targeted towards you. Also if you just want to learn about my internship experience at Flexport as well :P

Let me know if you found this to be helpful, thanks!

ge11ya,2,2020-05-05,Why We Overthink Networking and How We Can Change,dmclubowner,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/ge11ya/why_we_overthink_networking_and_how_we_can_change/,"This was a short essay that I originally posted on my subreddit ""theartofDM.""

I wrote it in response to my general observations on how people view networking nowadays:

that it's something that has to have an ulterior motive, which brings about a fear of being ""found out.""

**Hence all the false bubbliness and positivity that you usually see at networking events.**

It's shame, to be quite honest, to have networking be perceived this way.

I get it - we've all been there. I've been there - hundreds of applications in, 50+ rejections, and still waiting for that one offer.

**But then again, you're not automatically entitled to a job.**

What do you bring to the table? What do you have to bring to the table? These questions only you can answer and to find out the answers to these questions for the industry you want to join, you must ask people who currently in that industry what they brought to the table that got them their job and what is now currently valued in the industry.

And then why should people pick you? Why should someone trust you to do the job? Hence why referrals work - because we're being told by someone we trust that so and so is someone we should trust.

Here's the essay:

TLDR:

1. Hiring managers, professional contacts - they're just people like you and me. Talk to them like normal people.
2. People will talk to you if you seem **interesting** and **interested**. You don't have to give anything in return. Networking is not as transactional as you think it is.
3. Kindness is everywhere. You just have to go look for it.
4. Overthinking when networking and job-hunting is probably just a response to fear. A fear of not getting something that you're expecting to get. How do you remove that fear? Stop focusing so much on what you'll be getting out of each and every conversation. Start to think in macro terms - how do I join this industry (community)? And once I join, how can I make it better? Build. BUILD!
5. Be of the community, not simply in the community.

Sometimes, we overthink.

When you're looking for a job and/or networking, remember that you're talking to real people.

Why would they hire me? Why would they talk to me? Should I just randomly start talking to people?

Look - sometimes, people are just nice.

They'll respond to your DM even if they don't think they have anything to gain.

They'll accept your connection request because of some shared commonality (or even when there is none) even if they've never met you.

They'll even give you advice that they wish they got out of genuine interest in your career.

There's a lot of kindness out there.

Seriously.

For the cynics out there, here's a story:

Six months before I was set to graduate from college, I found myself not liking finance and not really getting anywhere in my interviews and job applications. I realized that I needed to focus on a different field, but which one?

One day, I came across an alumni careers event. I did not sign up for the event, but walked right in. Apparently, there were extra spots available because of all the people who didn't turn up. I sat down at the nearest table (there were tables set up in this hall - one for each industry field).

There were only two people at that table. A man who looked to be in his 50s and I. We didn't know each other so out of the blue, I just started talking. I had no idea which field he was in - only that he was the only person there and seemed nice. I remember quickly glancing at the sign that was supposed to mark the industry field for each table.

I saw the word ""law.""

So I started chatting with him about law, asking the typical questions like ""what's it like?"" and so on. Somehow, we got carried away and started talking about Italian Opera, which was a class that I was taking at the time for fun. We talked about Verdi, Mozart, the differences between Italian and German opera.

It was an odd but fun conversation.

At the end of the conversation, he invited me to an event for lawyers and I readily accepted. One event led to another (the first event was probably one of the weirdest experiences of my life), and the more lawyers I met, the more introductions I got to even more lawyers.

He also introduced me to one of my other close lawyer friends, who introduced me to lawyer after lawyer.

And just like that, my network grew from knowing one person in law to knowing 100+.

Funnily enough, even as my network reached 100+ lawyers, I still didn't really consider law as a career option.

So whenever I would speak with someone, I never mentioned that I was looking for a job (I should've done this more often in retrospect, but at the time, I had not even considered law as an option).

They were the first to bring up hiring.

What eventually got me interested in law as a profession was getting hired as an intern for a lawyers' association even without asking for an internship. The conversation literally went like this:

Hiring manager for internship - ""Hey - I see you at these events all the time. Want an internship?""

Me - ""Sure""

That internship led me to 20+ interviews at some of the top corporate law firms in NY, which was how I went from not knowing anything about law to working at a top 5 corporate law firm in NYC.

A job that I think got 100+ applications.

Point is, networking and job-hunting is not a transactional and linear process.

To switch gears, what is an industry?

An industry functions like a community of people giving value to each other in exchange for value.

Want to join the community? Great! Provide value. Give your time, offer your skills, offer to help.

Build up the community, which is what I did by interning at a lawyers' association and helping out at 3-4 evening events every single week during that internship. Even now, I volunteer at events from time to time, simply because I enjoy being around people in that community.

I'll do all I can to help each and every one of those people even though I'm not in law anymore.

Be of the community, not just in the community."

I started as an intern at a software company. I’m currently working remotely and it’s been 20 days into this 6 month internship. All of the communication happens through WhatsApp, Zoom and Emails. I have worked at full time positions before, and I have just realized how much stuff communicated in office is through casual conversations and small talk. Little things like adjustments to presentation, aspects like who should see what, when to email what were always easy to know or judge when physically present with other coworkers.

Now, working remotely with so many new people, I seem to be running into issues, which though not big are making me nervous, and I’m starting to feel that I might be one or two gaffs away from being turned away from full time position. My question to you reddit, is that, how do I impress my boss and coworkers, and make sure I land this job? Considering the fact that we are working remotely, I can’t have water cooler conversations and understand what they are thinking, or talk casually with them considering everyone is on call most of the time."
ge2y3e,5,2020-05-05,Advice on emailing,Minute_Boot,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/ge2y3e/advice_on_emailing/,"So I guess I have been socially anxious when sending some emails to employers I have been in contact for a few years. I'm in college, and these connections are important, and we've known each other for a few years.

They've always answered most of my emails whether its within an hour or 2 months of sending, which is really good since they've insanely busy with their work. Although, there's a part of me that doesn't want to email them because I don't want to sidetrack them from their work and I guess their positions and knowledge are something like role models since I was a kid so it's kinda like emailing Elon Musk in your spare time, and another part that wants to stay in contact for an eventual internship or job in the future.

My gut says that since they're answering my emails (not half assed answered but full fledged paragraphs sometimes) and seem happy to see me email them, they're in contact with me because they want to not because they feel like they have to.

Another part of me says that they're just in contact with me so they don't hurt my feelings or have a bad image of their company, and I just feel anxious in general when I'm drafting an email because it feels daunting to talk them...Any advice on this?"

The reason for the switch is that I have always been more interested in the software side of my course compared to the hardware. The internship I completed last year was all scripting and designing applications for the employees to use to automate their jobs. The project I undertook this year did have hardware elements however the most enjoyable part I found was programming a control loop with Python, working with the SQL database and then analysing and optimising the results of the control loop. The projects I do outside of college involve a lot of playing with the datasets on kaggle and seeing what I can do with them. 

Has anyone on here made the switch to computer science/data science? If so how did you find it? Did you regret anything?"

ge6vsv,1,2020-05-05,I was offered a job on one team but started without notice on another. Fired a year later,GrainObtain,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ge6vsv/i_was_offered_a_job_on_one_team_but_started/,"After graduating college, I was offered an internship with this firm who ultimately decided to bring me on full time as a business analyst within their IT department. Like the title suggests, they offered me to start on (we'll call him John) **John'**s team but when I started, I was advised I would be placed on another team instead and report to (we'll call him Mark) **Mark**.

***This is important for later.***

As a forewarning, I'm also a first generation college student and the first to get a job in corporate america so I realize now how naive I was in all of these corporate interactions but I'm still not familiar with how things work. 

As a recent grad, I'm  part of this *""accelerated development program""* so my actual program manager that I report to is (we'll call her Evelyn). Evelyn and I have a very strong relationship. Or so I think. Who knows at this point.

***This is important for later too.***

I asked my program manager, Evelyn, why i was being placed on a different team and her response was that it was because John's project hasn't kicked off yet and so they wanted to prepare me on another team. Looking back now I feel like this was inaccurate and just a result of poor management decisions because I finally did make it out to John's project, the project had already kicked off and I missed a lot of crucial details. Other new hires were able to start in their team during project inception and it seems like I was the only one stiffed. 

 Well Mark's team certainly had **a lot** of issues and seemed like they didn't need or even want a business analyst. Lots of gossiping and the team in in an open space and didn't like working with each other. I was the youngest among a group of parents which I thought would initially be the ideal environment because I expected them to be more mature and me basically be their ""little grasshopper. Well,  I was **clearly naive**. The manager had been there for a year and had been unable to lessen the tension. Initially this didn't phase me but I overheard **and** one of my friends in another department overheard my ""mentor"" gossiping about me saying I was a recent graduate and I didn't know what I was doing and having trouble catching on. Mind you this is a month later and she's a high school graduate with no college background and always liked to flaunt that she piqued in high school and was very popular. I could tell she was very snooty back in the day but I digress and this is not meant to be about her.

 I asked my program manager Evelyn to place me into the team that I was supposed to start on and so after a month, she did. I started on this team and things were going well until my boss resigned and left the company. After this, I was placed into another team. 

Long story short, this team possessed communication barriers as I was the only one who spoke full on English and several developers had trouble understanding me as I was the only ""American"" one of the team. The new mentor allocated to me lost her temper and started yelling at me during one of our meetings and said ""it wasn't rocket science"" when trying to catch up to speed on the new project. She clearly didn't want to be training anyone. My then and new boss (we'll call him **Bob**) flat out told me he didnt want to train anyone and expected me to be a seasoned BA from all my prior experience and I should know what Im doing. Bob and I clearly didn't mesh because he saw me as a barrier. 

Fast forward to the end of my program and graduating, I had to provide a presentation on my experience. In my presentation I shared that I had the ""honor"" of working on three different teams. No one else in my hire-class had this experience so I viewed it as a good thing. It apparently was not regardless of the contributions Ive made. No one from my previous teams showed up to support me graduating which only further emphasized how much they didn't care. 

After graduating, my then manager Evelyn was getting ready to retire and place me in the care of 100% reporting to Bob and then tried to make it seem like it was my fault for being the only one not succeeding. Bob eventually  placed me on a PIP plan and fired me after a month. Somewhere in-between that I filed a complaint with HR for discrimination so I suspect that may have had something to do with it. 

In conclusion, I've had 4 bosses in the last year and was moved roughly every 3 or 4 months. I was absolutely depressed and devastated and wanted to file a lawsuit for improper termination, mental damages and discrimination. I live in an at-will state so apparently thats not possible. 

&amp;#x200B;

**For those of you who have had experience in a conservative corporate environment, what's your take on the situation? Do you think I was doomed from the start and this was a result from poor management and I need to stop feeling bad? Or is it possible I was the one in error and it just wasn't for me. I need to know how to process these events.

I want to learn from this experience and avoid experiencing the same thing again. I don’t want to write off IT from one experience but I’m considering going back to school at this point. **

.

.

.

TLDR; I started a full time job as a business analyst and was moved onto 3 different teams every 4 months and then placed on a PIP and fired. I was depressed for a year after and continued job searching and I just came to an epiphany now 3 years later that maybe it was bigger than me. Please advise."

I just did a HackerRank test today for a company that I applied to for a remote internship, and I was supposed to complete it by a certain deadline (this Sunday). I personally believe that if I had just the deadline and HackerRank allowed me to take the test without the timer, I would have done better. 2 out of the 5 questions answered passed all the test cases, one of them passed just over half of them, and I couldn’t answer the other 2."
ge8wvt,8,2020-05-05,Why We Overthink Networking,dmclubowner,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/ge8wvt/why_we_overthink_networking/,"This was a short essay that I originally posted on my subreddit ""theartofDM.""

I wrote it in response to my general observations on how people view networking nowadays:

that it's something that has to have an ulterior motive, which brings about a fear of being ""found out.""

**Hence all the false bubbliness and positivity that you usually see at networking events.**

It's shame, to be quite honest, to have networking be perceived this way.

I get it - we've all been there. I've been there - hundreds of applications in, 50+ rejections, and still waiting for that one offer.

**But then again, you're not automatically entitled to a job.**

What do you bring to the table? What do you have to bring to the table? These questions only you can answer and to find out the answers to these questions for the industry you want to join, you must ask people who currently in that industry what they brought to the table that got them their job and what is now currently valued in the industry.

And then why should people pick you? Why should someone trust you to do the job? Hence why referrals work - because we're being told by someone we trust that so and so is someone we should trust.

Here's the essay:

TLDR:

1. Hiring managers, professional contacts - they're just people like you and me. Talk to them like normal people.
2. People will talk to you if you seem **interesting** and **interested**. You don't have to give anything in return. Networking is not as transactional as you think it is.
3. Kindness is everywhere. You just have to go look for it.
4. Overthinking when networking and job-hunting is probably just a response to fear. A fear of not getting something that you're expecting to get. How do you remove that fear? Stop focusing so much on what you'll be getting out of each and every conversation. Start to think in macro terms - how do I join this industry (community)? And once I join, how can I make it better? Build. BUILD!
5. Be of the community, not simply in the community.

Sometimes, we overthink.

When you're looking for a job and/or networking, remember that you're talking to real people.

Why would they hire me? Why would they talk to me? Should I just randomly start talking to people?

Look - sometimes, people are just nice.

They'll respond to your DM even if they don't think they have anything to gain.

They'll accept your connection request because of some shared commonality (or even when there is none) even if they've never met you.

They'll even give you advice that they wish they got out of genuine interest in your career.

There's a lot of kindness out there.

Seriously.

For the cynics out there, here's a story:

Six months before I was set to graduate from college, I found myself not liking finance and not really getting anywhere in my interviews and job applications. I realized that I needed to focus on a different field, but which one?

One day, I came across an alumni careers event. I did not sign up for the event, but walked right in. Apparently, there were extra spots available because of all the people who didn't turn up. I sat down at the nearest table (there were tables set up in this hall - one for each industry field).

There were only two people at that table. A man who looked to be in his 50s and I. We didn't know each other so out of the blue, I just started talking. I had no idea which field he was in - only that he was the only person there and seemed nice. I remember quickly glancing at the sign that was supposed to mark the industry field for each table.

I saw the word ""law.""

So I started chatting with him about law, asking the typical questions like ""what's it like?"" and so on. Somehow, we got carried away and started talking about Italian Opera, which was a class that I was taking at the time for fun. We talked about Verdi, Mozart, the differences between Italian and German opera.

It was an odd but fun conversation.

At the end of the conversation, he invited me to an event for lawyers and I readily accepted. One event led to another (the first event was probably one of the weirdest experiences of my life), and the more lawyers I met, the more introductions I got to even more lawyers.

He also introduced me to one of my other close lawyer friends, who introduced me to lawyer after lawyer.

And just like that, my network grew from knowing one person in law to knowing 100+.

Funnily enough, even as my network reached 100+ lawyers, I still didn't really consider law as a career option.

So whenever I would speak with someone, I never mentioned that I was looking for a job (I should've done this more often in retrospect, but at the time, I had not even considered law as an option).

They were the first to bring up hiring.

What eventually got me interested in law as a profession was getting hired as an intern for a lawyers' association even without asking for an internship. The conversation literally went like this:

Hiring manager for internship - ""Hey - I see you at these events all the time. Want an internship?""

Me - ""Sure""

That internship led me to 20+ interviews at some of the top corporate law firms in NY, which was how I went from not knowing anything about law to working at a top 5 corporate law firm in NYC.

A job that I think got 100+ applications.

Point is, networking and job-hunting is not a transactional and linear process.

To switch gears, what is an industry?

An industry functions like a community of people giving value to each other in exchange for value.

Want to join the community? Great! Provide value. Give your time, offer your skills, offer to help.

Build up the community, which is what I did by interning at a lawyers' association and helping out at 3-4 evening events every single week during that internship. Even now, I volunteer at events from time to time, simply because I enjoy being around people in that community.

I'll do all I can to help each and every one of those people even though I'm not in law anymore.

Be of the community, not just in the community."

I recently got contacted by an Indeed recruiter asking if I'm interested in a GIS programming specialist position where the client would be with Apple. 

Has anyone had experience with this position? I went through the phone screen interview with the Indeed recruiter yesterday  and I submitted their pre-assessment questions asking about Python and SQL. She told me the team is looking for someone with software developer capabilities and data collection.

Can anyone tell me how their experience went with this position and their interviewing process? How difficult is it to land this position? Are the interview questions anything technical?

 **My background:** 

\- Recently graduated in December 2019 with a B.S in Computer Engineering from the Bay Area

\- Been applying for jobs and getting rejections for 4+ months

\- No prior technical internship experience

As a new graduate, I want to weigh out my options before making my final decision before committing and see if it'll be a benefit in going along with this position.

Thank you!

**Update more info from Recruiter**: This is for Apple’s Ingest Team (not really focus on using GIS software but more in data collection and validation)"

I will also  be taking 8 electives and precalc genuinely for fun.  I do debate, creative writing club (we do a seasonal literary magazine for winter and spring) and (once we get enough sign ups) Spanish honors society too.  And if the student government agrees, the news committee will start back up and we will be doing a newspaper which, as a lover of writing, I will be all over.  I may also be doing mock trial, moot Court, and FIRST Robotics depending on if my school decides to start those up next year.  I am also an indie game dev.  Also, I might be doing and an internship with INKSpire and/or Girl Genius Magazine, and/or MyOCDFighter depending on my schedule.

And will be taking CLEP exams.  And will be working on a third school newspaper through one of the 8 electives.  And will be learning Mandarin through one my electives.

So.  I want to take AP Chemistry (love it love it love it it is my baby for real Chem is awesome), AP Music Theory (we have so much darn fun in class with Music Theory II, which is an elective I am in right now), AP Computer Science A (I told ya, I love game programming and coding in general and I already have another elective class with the teacher, who is great), and AP Literature and Composition (once again I love to write, and I love me some Sophocles (one of the books we will be reading is Oedipus Rex!!)).

I want to Major in computer science and will probably transfer to a local 4 year from the community college I do dual enrollment at now.  Although MIT or UPENN would be nice.  I am also poor and a black female

Btw I may not be able to do dual enrollment anymore because my family can't pay for it.  Which means I won't be able to sign a transfer agreement and my community college creds will just have to ""wing it"" to whatever college will accept most of them (I don't want to do community college after high school, I was hoping to earn my associates degree while in high school but...some things have changed over the past year).  That is why I am focusing on general education credits this summer for summer school.  

Also, I really really REALLY need to pass my chem, computer science, and lit AP exams because I can't pay for the equivalent courses at community college and this is like my only chance so I REALLY need those credits.

I also want time to play and make video games with my friends, along with time to submit my poetry to newspapers/magazines.  

If I could pick any job it would be an astronaut for the first mission to Mars.

Thanks in advance for the advice.

Edit:. I realize how I might sound like a troll but everything I wrote is completely genuine.  I love love love to learn.  I just sort of have this insecurity where if I am not overachieving then that means (to me) that I am not doing my best which means I am failing / settling.  I am sure I am not the only one on the sub who has this.  My family also sort of fell apart last year and I live in the hood now so I feel like I need to prove that I can still do anything even though I am literally sleeping on couches and living out of bags ATM.  My biological ""mom"" is also evading child support payments because she doesn't love me/can't control me anymore (I refused to be her source of narcissistic supply) and is taking advantage of the judicial court shutdown due to coronavirus.

Advice?  Reassurance?  I just want to have the kinda fun the the other kids get, with their competitions and awards--and not even to do it for the awards but to have fun and be the person I dreamed of being before my family went up in flames.  I feel like my potential is being blocked / curtailed.

Edit2: I go to cyber school (not due to corona, an actual cyber school that was already virtual), and kids from all over my entire state attend it"

Would employers prefer someone who has a lot of experience, like me, or someone with much less experience, but with many technical skills such as VBA, SQL, Python, etc?

I have tried to learn some of these technical skills, but I'll admit that I get bored extremely quick and I have the attention span of a 5 year old, so I always give up after a few days (or minutes).

You need personal projects, grinding leetcode and internships just to get an entry level job in CS. Almost every other career doesn't require this much competition to get a job.

I see posts here that you have to apply to 100s of job postings just to get 2 interviews.

Am I wrong for resenting my parents?",bri1113,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/geeci7/i_go_to_school_on_the_other_side_of_the_country/,"First, let me apologize for how many components there are to this story. I F21 (before the virus) attend school in NYC but am originally from 1000 miles away. In addition to going to school there, I also worked multiple jobs in NY. When the virus hit, school was made virtual and I was kicked out of my dorm. I wanted to try to stay in NY for work (one of my jobs is in a hospital so I knew I would still have that at least.) However, I soon found out that my father was diagnosed with esophageal cancer after being in remission for a brain tumor. I quickly made the decision to go home to my family. Since then, I have been able to do my jobs remotely, which is great. I was offered a remote internship for the summer, and it conflicts with the hours that can be worked remotely for my job. So, I’m pretty sure I want to return to NY.

Given my father is sick and not doing so well, I feel horrible for leaving. However, since being home, my resentment for my parents has increased greatly. I had some issues with them prior but still respected them and maintained a healthy relationship. Over about the past year, I have finally processed something that happened to me because of my parents, and it’s led to my resentment that has only escalated since being home. My last year or so of high school, my parents’ friend emotionally and mentally abused me and sexually harassed me. It got so bad that the last three months I was home before moving to college, I was scared for my life because he was so crazy, volatile, and violent. I tried endlessly to get my parents to intervene in the situation or support me in some way. However, they did absolutely nothing. At the time, I was mad but I didn’t realize how bad what they did was. More recently, I’ve realized how much trauma this has caused me and how much my parents couldn’t have cared less. For this reason, I resent my parents and don’t think it’s the worst idea to go back to my life in NY. 

I need some guidance in terms of what to do, and processing my feelings toward my parents. 

TLDR: I might go back to NY for my job. Even though my dad is sick, I don’t feel that bad for leaving because I virtually lost my relationship with my parents after they allowed their friend to abuse me. 1) Should I go back to NY? And 2) Am I wrong for resenting my parents?"

My former supervisors, two female academics, have always been very supportive of me and engaged in my academic life. We are also friends - we have enjoyed many lunches, dinners, etc together. I was initially a research intern with them, and then they offered me a role as a research assistant. From there, I undertook my honours year with them as my supervisors. We always got along very well.

I then began planning for a PhD, with them as my supervisors. Unfortunately, however, I was forced to take some time off due to chronic health problems and lost contact with them for a short period. I then initiated contact again, and they were still supportive.

I am now at the tail-end of a masters degree, and am hoping to begin a PhD. They are no longer academics at large universities, because one of them is semi-retired, and the other is expanding her horizons in other roles. They still expressed, in person, however, that they would like to be involved.

I have found a primary supervisor at another university, and they are able to be involved, but they seem hesitant. I sent an email the other night, and received no reply. When I prompted them, one of them said she would be happy to assist with the systematic review (her specialty).

In my email, I also gave them an out by saying that I understand if they do not have the capacity to be involved at the moment, but they didn't respond to that. They asked me to update them after a recent meeting with the supervisors. I sent them an update last night, but again, I have not heard from them.

What should I do? It seems that they are no longer interested in collaborating, but I don't want to end our professional or personal relationship via indirect, passive means, like ignoring emails - it seems immature. I would prefer to have a direct conversation, and settle things.

Thank you for any input!"

geik8x,1,2020-05-06,Can anyone offer advice to a student?,dcstewart1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/geik8x/can_anyone_offer_advice_to_a_student/,"I’m in a pretty serious dilemma rn! Advice appreciated!

I started a Human Resources internship last year in May and stayed with the company for the last year. I have LOVED it so much in every way. I learned so much and loved all the work I was responsible for and didn’t want to leave yet, but I am graduating next week with my BS in Business so I felt it was time to move on to my first full-time role. 

I accepted a job as a Human Resources Coordinator. Truth be told this wasn’t really my first choice, there were a lot of undesirable characteristics about the job I didn’t like before I even accepted, however, I just took it for the title. 

After just 7 days on the job, I could not hate it more. (The work is nothing that I thought I would be doing) I called up my internship (they offered to extend my internship before I even left) and asked if I could come back. They said yes. 

Now, I’m not sure on 1. What to even do and 2. If I do decide to go back to my internship, how do I tell the new employer I already want to leave? 3. Will I still be able to land other entry-level HR jobs in a few months? (Assuming I leave HR Coordinator role off of resume)"
geiolw,13,2020-05-06,I was an intern on a late-night Japanese game show in the late '90s,AwkwardWeeaboo,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/geiolw/i_was_an_intern_on_a_latenight_japanese_game_show/,"I was an eager kid fresh out of film school when this happened. I'm half-Japanese and grew up in Japan for most of my life.  My father held a seat on the board of executives for Nippon TV at the time and thus after much begging, I was able to get him to secure me an entry-level internship working on the set of a game show airing at the time.  The outline of the show was very simple. It was called  ""その ドア "" Or translated to English simply, The Door.  The contestants on the show were all put into an abandoned apartment complex and given simple directions throughout the show in the form of riddles and logic puzzles to find the correct apartment.  Each apartment in the show had a theme, there were clue apartments which contestants could use to help narrow down which apartment was the correct one, prize apartments which held as the name implies prizes for the guests and Batsu apartments or punishment.  Now the goal of the show was incredibly simple. All you had to do was solve the puzzles and navigate your way to ""The door"" which was the moniker of the apartment that held the grand prize of a whopping one million yen. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a twist though, the show ran late-night because all of the punishment apartments were really risque and oftentimes downright morbid. For example on one episode I helped out with filming we had one of our female contestants enter a punishment apartment where a rather large tattoed man flashed his genitals at her.  Another punishment I remember vividly that got reused a lot was a man who would stick a gun loaded with blanks out the door of the room and fire at the contestants when they got ready to open the room to his apartment.  

&amp;#x200B;

My job on the set was to follow around the contestants and film their reactions and progress. It was very enjoyable and I've made a lot of longlasting friendships that I still have to this day from my time working.  There is one thing from my time working on ""The door""  that I have been trying to erase from my memory for a long time now though. The events that got the show canceled.   I remember that day very vividly. I came into the studio at about 8:00Am about three hours right before the taping began I was also the first to arrive besides the director. I remember it being particularly odd because upon my arrival the door leading outside to the actual gated in complex we filmed in had been wedged open. Now, normally this wouldn't be too strange of an occurrence as we often kept the door open so that we could have the crew move from the set to the office with more ease, but I was the only one there at the moment besides our director, and we didn't prop the door open until we were ready to start filming. So with my curiosity getting the better of me, I made my way down the hall to K-san our director's office. 

&amp;#x200B;

After a brief chat, K-san politely informed me that it hadn't been him who'd propped the door open. He chalked it up to one of the other interns leaving the door propped open overnight after forgetting to remove the stop. Since I had no further reason to pursue the question of why the door was propped open I resigned myself for waiting for the show to start and getting the camera equipment ready. The hours ticked by and the crew along with our contestant for the night finally arrived on the scene.  I remember A-Chan our contestant very vividly and I still have kept contact with her since the events. A-chan was a very sweet girl, she had introduced herself to me as an art student who held a part-time job at a convenience store. She was planning on using whatever money she won during the show to further her studies.

&amp;#x200B;

After the introductions had finished I took my place behind A-chan at the entrance to the complex and waited for the go-ahead cue before following her inside. Filming, for the most part, went by pretty uneventfully A-chan stumbled into a few punishment apartments and I would get closeup shots of her spooked reactions.  I got her happy reactions and giggles when she'd solve a puzzle or successfully uncover a clue. I almost found myself just as happy as her whenever she made more progress, there was really something about her that just made you instantly like her.  It wasn't until we got to the final punishment room, the one beside the titular ""Door"" that lead to the grand prize that the horror started. The ""incident"" as it came to be referred to that got the show canceled.  


I don't think I'll ever be able to forget the scream A-chan made when she opened the door leading into that apartment. You always hear actors portraying grief or shock in movies, but nothing really prepares you for the horror of the real thing. I didn't break script at first and move to see what made A-chan react like she did as I didn't want to lose my job, but upon glancing into the room with the camera I had to do a doubletake. The room was barren save for a chair in the center and a projector playing a graphic video on loop of someone being shot in the head. There was a large banner in the room above the chair that read ""Try to cheat me now"" after reading the kanji on the banner my eyes were drawn to a figure in the chair. Through the darkness of the room, all I could make out was that they were limp and not breathing. A-chan recognized the man in both the video being played and the figure in the chair which was made evident by her screams and sobs. I remember she kept repeating ""No"" and ""Not possible"" the whole scene was haunting. 

&amp;#x200B;

The crew back in the office in panicked tones told me to ""Get A-chan out of there"" and ""This is not part of the show, police are on the way, please stay calm"" My body kind of went into autopilot after I heard those two words. I remember grabbing A-chan by the arm and escorting her off set as she shook like a leaf in my grip. The whole thing was a mess and everyone was deeply shaken by the events. Because the show was broadcast live the feed was cut just after I had swiveled the camera into the room. Police eventually arrived and took statements from everyone along with footage from the security cams and the unedited broadcast footage. The station our studio broadcasted under promptly released a public statement the very next day stating the reason our show was canceled was ""Due to tragic and unforeseen circumstances we no longer have access to our filming location.""   


Everything after the incident is still very much a blur to me. The police investigation hit a dead end, the only suspect found was a masked man caught on the security footage exiting the set a few minutes after I had went into K-sans office to talk to him about the door being left open. The man, of course, was never found.  I later also found out that the corpse in the punishment room was A-chans boyfriend at the time. I still find myself wondering if maybe I had just taken the time to investigate the door myself instead of talking to K-san about it, if A-chan could have the justice she deserved."

I've been job hunting for over a year now since getting my master's degree. I had an internship at the end of 2019 and now they have offered me a job. It's in my field but it's not exactly the position I'm looking for. It's a small company, 4 people in total. And from what I've heard, 2 have been fired (1 being my old direct boss).

So, apparently my boss has been fired for putting human values above work. Meaning he was fired for treating the interns like humans and not like slaves. And if I accept the offer, I would have his old job.

From my short time at the company, I remember it being very toxic. My boss was often yelled at by the CEO and we would hear it from the other side of the office. Not to mention that my boss would bend over backwards for the CEO. Many other very toxic events happened where I remember leaving the office so mad and upset.

Now I'm just stressed and confused about what to do because I don't want to work in a toxic environment and sacrifice my mental health but turning down a job offer seems crazy after job hunting for over a year.

I'd love to know if anyone has ever been in this position and I'd love any advice you have to give!!

I am currently a history major with a minor in Spanish but I’m pretty worried and concerned about what the hell im gonna do after graduation. I came into college as a business major and did great my freshman year, however I did pretty bad in some of my classes first semester sophomore years and panicked and switched to a major I genuinely do enjoy and know I’m good at in History. However while I have enjoyed it and my grades are fine I believe I’m paying the price for it as I genuinely don’t have a desire to do anything with History after college. My one saving grace is that I was able to land a business internship last summer in HR that gave me experience in marketing,benefits and communication. With that experience I was able to levy that into another internship this summer with the same company that will be in Business Operations. However the problem is that IF I’m unable to land a full-time job with this company I feel like I’m screwed without a business major. What business jobs will hire a History major? Even though I do have some experience. My plan is to pursue an MBA but that won’t be for another 2 years as pursuing an MBA directly after undergrad won’t really be an option due to my lack of real work experience. What advice can anyone give me to landing a decent job in the business world before gearing up for graduate school in a few years?"
geo9zp,9,2020-05-06,Highest salary you've heard of for a postdoc?,confusedan1,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/geo9zp/highest_salary_youve_heard_of_for_a_postdoc/,"x-posted from another subreddit:

I have a friend who got one of these very selective postdoc fellowships (that gives you full freedom to work on whatever you want), and while I knew it was a very competitive and good fellowship, I was still surprised to find out that the salary (including a bonus) was something like $170-180k. That is by far the highest salary I've heard of for a ""postdoc"" position, though the details of this position do sound more like a starter faculty position in terms of research freedom.

What's the highest salary you've heard of for a postdoc? It seems like these ""super postdocs"" are not bad at all salary wise.

EDIT: 

More details: My friend is in computer science and had industry offers that are $200k+, so I think that played a role in them getting a much larger bonus for this position. Also, I am not 100% sure on this, but I think some of the money for their fellowship comes from the tech industry. They have in the past done internships at the top tech companies, so it's possible that the collaborations there could continue."

Hope you guys are doing well. So I'm a CS grad at a top 30 school and I lost internship opportunity  because of this pandemic situation. Now I'm really worried that I won’t get an opportunity as we are 6 days already in May. I've accepted this and I've decided that I will gain new skills over summer. I researched and realized that lots of people end up doing personal projects over summer and that adds a lot to the resume. My goal is to land a co-op opportunity or/and a full time offer after I graduate next summer. But I have a few questions :

1. IS there any resource where we can collaborate for projects? Say something where like minded people come together to work on an idea? 
2. Also is it true that projects done in collaboration with any org or prof will have more weightage over a similar individually done project?
3. Can someone also point out resources which may have links to good hackathons and competitive coding competitions  which will add weight to my resume?
4. What are the level of projects which will add value or catch the eye of recruiter when applying for big n's. ex : I saw a video about a guy who listed out his projects which landed him an interview at google. Those projects were well executed but not innovative. I'm really unable to put my finger on the complexity of projects that should be listed on resume for big n's.

I'm really grateful in advance for all the answers and IF someone knows about a good opportunity for a project over the summer, I would be more than happy to discuss that.

Cheers everyone and STAY SAFE!"

I have a few computer science questions, I'm taking CS1 with Tanvir Ahmed and OOP with Gerald Hensel this summer. And planning to take CDA 3103 either this summer or fall, and CS 2 in fall. 

1. Does anyone have any input/advice about Ahmed's CS 1 or Hensel's OOP? Like any tips to help in passing their class/learning well? Any youtube channels/online resources that you found particularly useful? 
   1. a. any topics I should review before the semester starts for CS 1 or OOP? i took intro to C two years ago with a shitty online prof and don't remember shit.
2. Is CDA3103 manageable with CS1 and OOP this summer along with an easy IDS online course and a part time internship? I wanna have as much free time in fall as its my last semester and I'm sure CS 2 will be a doozy, but if 3 CS classes this summer is a lot i'll take CDA in fall.
3. I heard from a friend that in order to be somewhat prepared for CS 2, its more important to really learn the material in OOP well, and not as much the CS 1 material. How true is this? I don't really care about being an expert in C programming for my future career but do need good grades and want to finish my CS minor.

geq9el,15,2020-05-06,"Premed Advice at Berkeley, and yes I have read every single other post through the searchbar.",laz62972arulian,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/geq9el/premed_advice_at_berkeley_and_yes_i_have_read/,"First and foremost, thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to open this thread, it means a lot. Hope you all are having a great day. I was recently admitted of the waitlist for UCLA and have already committed to Berkeley and was wondering whether UCLA would be the best choice. A little bit about myself, I am a student hopefully on the premed track and would be studying Psychobiology at UCLA and Public Health at UC Berkeley. Here is a pros and cons list. I know this can be tedious so let me just put the TL;DR at the top lmao.

**Conclusion (To Save you Time)**:

I really love Public health more than Psychobiology at UCLA but I would be crushed if choosing Berkeley for the vibe of the college and slightly liking the major more will ruin my dream of going to medical school as that's a real possibility. 

Would splitting up these difficult premed weeder courses so that I only have to take 1 / semester help with maintaining a stronger GPA? This is a tough question I know and it's completely fine if you don't answer it. 

**UC Berkeley**: **(Public Health / Data Science Minor)**

Pros:

* Really love my major and it has lots of resources dedicated to it since it has its own school.
* College of Letters and Science has a great variety of interesting minors that I can declare.  (CS /DS).
* Stadium within walking distance of school.
* Love the location. The city of Berkeley feels like a college town and has amazing public transportation available.
* Great on campus research (not-clinical).
* Lots of hospitals nearby for volunteering.
* Semester System (really prefer this because I usually study through Spaced Repetition and having this extra time is really useful)
* 55% of premeds go to medical school (2019) \~ 700 applicants / year (2019) \~ 350 / year accepted.
* Major allows me to split courses so that I only need to take 1 premed req / semester which can allow me to focus all of my time on it. (Already made 4 year plan for this as well).

Cons:

* The one con to rule them all: Grade Deflation, most of the premed reqs are set so that only 20% of the kids can get an A. This is not speculation, departments claim this and berkeleytime shows this lol.
* No associated medical school / hospital for opportunities although I haven't really heard this was a problem.
* Less safe.

Honestly, not as many cons, it's just that grade deflation can potentially fuck up my entire future.

&amp;#x200B;

**UCLA (Psychobiology)**

Pros:

* Laid out my four year plan including the premed requirements and the percentages for A+ to A-'s was around 40% for all of the premed requirements. (Bruinwalk Grade Distributions).
* Great food and dining halls.
* Guaranteed housing for three years at my stay.
* Ronald Reagan hospital for some volunteering (heard it is highly restricted though).
* Confident on finding on campus research as a freshman.
* Although there is not grade inflation, there is little to no grade deflation whatsoever.
* No GPA caps to declare major.
* Great night life around Santa Monica.
* Great sports culture.
* \~53% of applicants go to medical school (2013 STAT) \~1000+ applicants / year (2019) so around \~500 acceptances / year.

Cons:

* 1000+ premed applicants / year suggests that it will be highly competitive to seek opportunities whether it be volunteering, research, or internships.
* Quarter system is tough especially when midterms could stack up so that I have one for consecutive weeks.
* Don't really like Westwood and feel like I won't be leaving campus much.
   * Sort of because of the okay public transport system here.
* School of engineering is separate so minoring in CS / Data Science is not an option.
* Psychobiology lower division courses are the premed requirements so I will have to take two reqs in the same quarter for sure.
   * Could Potentially lead to having worse grades.

If you got to here, THANK you so much I appreciate you greatly."

Here's my breakdown of pros and cons, but I'm trying to get a bigger perspective so please let me know what you think:

**NYU**

Pros:

* Way more prestigious!
* Very highly ranked PoliSci program
* Closer to home
* In NYC, which I love
* Probably more potential for opportunities (jobs, internships) given that I'd be in NYC for four years
* It was my first choice and dream school, I got good vibes from it at one point but struggle to remember them
* I saw ""myname@nyu.edu"" and it felt really good
* Their portal is actually usable

Cons:

* Doesn't seem to have the super social vibe Pitt does, but I could be wrong, it's been a while since I visited
* Can only pay maybe $60k a year out of the $78k (so I'd be in anywhere from $30k to $60k of debt when I graduate, of which $22k would be federal unsubsidized), would have to hope for PLUS loans to come through (because I got no fin aid)
* Although it was my first choice and dream school, after being waitlisted for so long I have kind of forgotten why.
* Admitted to the Liberal Studies Core Curriculum instead of CAS (not sure if this is a pro or con—since I'm still trying to figure out what I want to do with my life, maybe dabbling in everything the LSC provides could be good). I am guaranteed a transfer to wherever I want afterwards, so I could do the sampling platter and then go to double major in polisci and CS/major in polisci and minor in CS.
* PoliSci doesn't really pay money so unless I got a CS job that debt would probably hurt
* Given that NYC is the worst place to be right now for the pandemic, I might not be able to go for the entire freshman year. But given that Pitt's a big city it could be that way for Pitt too.

**Pitt**

Pros:

* I very much want to be packed into litchfield towers like a sardine
* The area is really pretty, lots of green and Cathy is beautiful
* I get a really good vibe, feel like I could make lots of friends
* Would have zero debt at graduation
* Pretty good PoliSci program, not nearly as good as NYU's though
* One of the best public universities

Cons:

* 9 hour drive, but I'd probably fly
* Not in NYC
* Pittsburgh doesn't really come to mind when I think ""political science hub""
* Not nearly as prestigious as NYU
* Communal bathrooms 😳
* Unusable student portal, and apparently the freshman advisors don't really know what they're doing.

I think that sums up my current thoughts. I have 3 days to decide so I gotta let this marinate. If you have any other pros/cons please let me know. What would you do?"

I am currently a history major with a minor in Spanish but I’m pretty worried and concerned about what the hell im gonna do after graduation. I came into college as a business major and did great my freshman year, however I did pretty bad in some of my classes first semester sophomore years and panicked and switched to a major I genuinely do enjoy and know I’m good at in History. However while I have enjoyed it and my grades are fine I believe I’m paying the price for it as I genuinely don’t have a desire to do anything with History after college. My one saving grace is that I was able to land a business internship last summer in HR that gave me experience in marketing,benefits and communication. With that experience I was able to levy that into another internship this summer with the same company that will be in Business Operations. However the problem is that IF I’m unable to land a full-time job with this company I feel like I’m screwed without a business major. What business jobs will hire a History major? Even though I do have some experience. My plan is to pursue an MBA but that won’t be for another 2 years as pursuing an MBA directly after undergrad won’t really be an option due to my lack of real work experience. What advice can anyone give me to landing a decent job in the business world before gearing up for graduate school in a few years?"

I know this has been asked many times here, but I'm hoping to get some insight/advice for my situation.

To give you some context...

I'm currently in my senior year for my bachelor degree in the US (not graduating..yet). Last summer, I was very fortunate to get a internship position in a well-known company in Taiwan. They rarely have interns there, and with some inside connections, I was able to skip the interview process completely. I had a wonderful time there; enjoyed the pace, environment, people, and definitely learned a ton about my career.

I'm planning moving to Taiwan after graduation, and having work experiences there prior to moving is definitely desirable. Taking into account the scale and reputation of the company, having this experience on my resume is also desirable. I doubt I'll be able to land another internship in Taiwan, especially while I'm in the US. Plus, with my city in lock-down due to the virus, and Taiwan being fully functional; going there seems more productive than sitting at home over the summer.

The thing is, they didn't give me a returning offer. They don't have a internship program, so people there are either full-time/in training. It was weird enough that I was the only intern there; although nobody asked, but I felt horrible that I got in using my connections. I am pretty sure they will find me something to do with just a call, but I am hesitant to ask.

That said, should I ask for returning internship opportunity? What are your thoughts?

Edit: Thank you everyone for the quick reply!"

A bit of background - I don't have any certifications in this field .. I did well on the interview and got the offer, but I feel they asked easy/medium questions during the interview. I only took 1 Computer Security course in University, in which we covered topics ranging from CIA triad to Cryptography, ACLs, Infrastructure Security, etc... and I think I was able to answer a lot of interview questions because of that course, thankfully, and they really liked that.

gf2qvs,7,2020-05-07,I am so frustrated because I don't know what is wrong with me and my zoom therapist said I don't have ADHD,KtheCamel,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/gf2qvs/i_am_so_frustrated_because_i_dont_know_what_is/,"I am really frustrated right now. I finally convinced myself to go to therapy because I have had a lot of bad days lately. During this time I was looking into potential reasons I am experiencing what I am, and a lot of what people said about ADHD resonated with me, however I have always done really well in school. In my third appointment, I asked if it was even a possibility that I had ADHD, not if it was confirmed. I just wanted to know if it should be something to be looked into at a later point when Corona is over and I can go to a psychiatrist, and she told me that because I have no family history, good grades, and it isn’t immediately obvious, then there is no way I have ADHD. This is so invalidating. Like it isn’t even a possibility. Like everything I am experiencing is just fake? Just me being lazy? It is so frustrating, and I keep reading other people who have very similar experiences and how getting diagnosed helped them and I just feel completely stuck. Like I can never be better because I don’t have it, and can’t get medicated for it.

As for the actual symptoms. My entire life I was always the really weird energetic kid. Like I had no impulse control. If I wanted to say something I did, and this mixed with my incredible need for attention made me just say weird things and act really weird just to get attention. Also in conversations, I am constantly blurting things out. I feel like I am a bad friend because I can’t help myself, and then I stop paying attention to people and have to just like nod or pretend I was listening and say yes. However, I always got good grades in school, so no teachers or anything ever said anything. I also have such a hard time starting things and staying on task. Literally everything distracts me. The only thing I have been able to get done in life was school work because I would have only like 1 hour after school and it was something I was interested in, but now in college I have hours of work and while I am able to get it done, I just feel constantly overwhelmed and stressed. Like, I spend my entire day or even days just doing nothing and dreading doing assignments and not starting it, when if I just started it, it would be easy for me to do. This is much, much worse for anything not school related. I can’t get ANYTHING done. I just make pages of to-lists and then put them off because it is so hard for me to actually do anything or make choices about anything. I just push it off and feel bad about it, and don’t know why I can’t do it. Like I put off getting a haircut for months or I didn’t buy underwear for a year. Like It shouldn’t take me months/years to do really simple chores because I just can’t get myself to do it if it is even a little difficult or requires any amount of decision making or any amount of effort. There are a lot of other small things I relate to, but poor conversation skills and executive function are probably the big two.

I just hate feeling like I am broken. Nothing in my life outside of school works. I can’t motivate myself to apply to research or internships. I can’t motivate myself to stick to basic routines. Like I have no hobbies. Like why can’t I just spend my day doing something rewarding, instead of mind numbing things like reddit or youtube all day. Like it shouldn’t be hard to spend like 1 hour a day doing something for myself like learning to code, or to to do a dance. It shouldn’t be hard for me to buy clothing or to do basic routine tasks. I hate wanting to do things, and then just feeling bad about it every day. Like every day I say the same thing “I am going to get this done and sleep early” and every day I get almost nothing done and sleep at like 3AM. I just have no control.

I guess I just wanted to rant, and I am so lost because if it is not ADHD (which it might not be because I don’t have family history, and I do do well in school), then what is it? Why do I have such horrible executive function? Why do I have such horrible impulse control? Am I just lazy, unmotivated, and a bad friend then?

TL;DR Zoom therapist says because I don't have family history, I got good grades, and it isn't obvious, then I don't have ADHD. I can't get shit done in my life other than school, and I am very impulsive while talking, among other things, so I feel frustrated because idk whats wrong with me then."

Right now I’m home from college in a house of eight people. I’m doing a software development internship this summer and every day I have a video meeting at 10. 

Today I attempted to join the video meeting but got kicked out after my computer’s connection timed out. For 20 minutes I tried multiple browsers, closing applications, and even just audio. Nothing worked. I finally gave up in frustration and went to see what my family was doing. Zoom meeting. Zoom meeting. Zoom meeting. Netflix. Hulu. Netflix and a Zoom meeting. Now, I understand that some meetings can’t be rescheduled. My younger siblings have classes at a certain time and I can’t change the meeting time for my internship. That being said... Is anybody really enjoying the constant buffering and dropped calls? I really would appreciate it if we could prioritize bandwidth for important Internet activities and not have three TVs streaming at once.

I'm from an academic family and I'm the only one who dropped out of college.

(my story, skippable)

I was so glad when I was done with school, initially wanted to work and travel a bit. I had so many interests and I finally felt free to explore them for a while. But I got myself talked into going to college. Through connections I got hired at really good firm right after school, I learned and worked a lot during that time. But after a year and a half I gave in, quit my full time job, applied for univ and since I had good grades in school everyone thought this would be cakewalk for me. Instead of choosing the univ which was close to my company and continue working there (part time when I didn't have classes) I choose to move to another city because the university was more prestigious and became a full time student. Finally making my family proud, so I hoped. I was always told college would be the best time of my life. But It wasn't. So I started taking one class after the other, took internships, worked as a freelancer and had a million hobbies and socialized too.. I felt rushed since there was so much I wanted to do but I had so little time. I never had a study group and even the same group of friends also because I could never decide on a class or major and I would change things mid way and did other things that sabotaged my success. So after a while, for different reasons that I know now can be mostly attributed to my Adhd (hyperactive type) I dropped out. Disappointing everyone incl myself. The feeling of defeat was intense back then and I felt lost for quite a while. It didn't only kill my momentum but also my confidence. Having no degree wasn't the big issue. If it weren't for my family and all my friends who all have college degrees, I wouldn't have cared about it. Some of them were not interested in their majors but pulled through anyway because they wanted to finish it and they also had people taking classes and studying with them. It seems that everyone else is able to pull through but me. Once they decided on sth they stick with it. And they focus on this one thing alone til it's done. I wish I could do that to. I know I shouldn't compare myself to others but this experience always made me feel dumb and I felt like a loser compared to others. I'm scared of starting something and not finishing it again. By this time in my life it has become a self fulfilling prophecy. Doing this with private projects is one thing but doing it with college is another.

(my situation now)

I have the possibility to take another shot at it, go back to college and get a degree (in whatever i honestly don't care). Just to say I finished it and hopefully that will make me feel better about myself. I'm on medication now, not as forgetful and calmer than I am without, not as easily distracted too but they're not the wonder drug people make them seem they are. I'm scared of making the same mistakes again. I'm scared of failing the classes and If I drop out again It will be even worse for my self image because now I'm older and I should've known better.

(question)

How did you do it? And what changed the second time around? What made you believe you could do it now? Do the reasons matter? And can you do it on your own without other students help? And what made it worth it?"

I am going to be a freshman at Maryland next semester studying CS. My goal is to get into a top Masters program (Stanford, Cal, MIT, CMU) for CS in 4 years. To any former UMD students who went on to a top grad school, I wanted to get some advice as to how I can gear the next 4 years of undergrad towards achieving this goal.

From what I've researched so far, it seems that admissions into masters programs are based on mostly 3 things: GPA, Professor Recs, and GRE scores. Is there anything else I should focus on during my undergrad? (such as internships, side projects, being the president of a cs club).

Any advice or guidance from Maryland grads who went on to grad school would be much appreciated."

Both are on the table but obviously a BSc would be a much bigger time investment (money isn't really a limiting factor). Would the additional skills gained be worth it? Would employers look more favourably on a BSc?

The BSc also presents the opportunity to do summer internships. Are these as crucial to landing a good job as I've been led to believe?

So I'll preface this by saying I have a pretty solid portfolio/good resume and decent internship experience. The tech stack I'm working with is one I've used several times in the past, so all is good there.

Unfortunately, the company that hired me is a startup with very, very noticeable growing pains. They outsourced most of their dev work early on, and it's clearly come back to bite them. One of the co-founders is essentially also the guy responsible for interfacing with customers and reporting bugs to the devs in a Slack channel. There's next to no workflow in place. Lots of things were hardcoded in the most obscure and idiotic ways possible.

They hired me to be their ""UI/UX person."" I have experience creating beautiful front-end designs. What I don't have experience with is taking a very broken web app—a train wreck without any trace of trains, so to speak—and making it better.

For some context, I also suffer from imposter syndrome and have lots of self doubt, even in the face of compliments about me and my resume. So when I'm handed a steaming heap of shit like this and expected to make it better, the negative thoughts start to abound: Did I trick these guys into hiring me? What if I'm not the right fit for the role?

I accepted this job because of COVID and I'm desperate. But it's so depressing that I'm very tempted to quit and try to find something else. Financially, I can afford to do so.

Am I overreacting?"

And, because it's the trendy thing to do here, I made a Sankey diagram in Python using pandas and Plotly.

***TL;DR:*** 
[Results overview: 79 tracked apps, 2 offers, 1 accepted and 1 rejected](https://imgur.com/a/fIDh7f9)

**Background**

Bit of background, I'm a rising senior CS/MechE double major at a relatively large and growing state university on the east coast, &gt; 3.9 GPA. I have two prior software engineering internships with a medium-sized software company, but no mechanical engineering work experience outside of school. I've been applying to various companies around the country since November searching for a Summer 2020 internship, but haven't had much luck until recently. I didn't submit as many as some of the people in this sub but when Covid became more relevant and internships started dropping, I just backed off and let whatever happen, happen. (mad respect for the &gt; 300 apps crowd though, I don't know how you guys sleep).

**Overview**

The prettiest result from the analysis is the [Sankey diagram.](https://i.imgur.com/soC1EAK.png) I have another version without the aggregated ""Applied"" stage for a little more information but it's much harder to parse on first glance. Let me know if you're interested in that.

I was hoping that my GPA and internships (although not necessarily too relevant to all of the positions) would at least get me enough interest for phone interviews, but... I was wrong on that front. I only started tracking after about February, so anything I couldn't find in my email records or just missed was left out. In total, I applied to over 80 positions at &gt; 25 different companies (79 of which were tracked), and only two of them actually resulted in person-to-person contact (both phone interviews). Any info I give is gonna be mainly about those tracked, for obvious reasons.

Note: The only organization I applied to that I wasn't really sure how to include in the data was NASA. For NASA's summer (non-Pathways) internships, you answer questions and add a resume as usual, but select up to 15 preferred projects to work on. As time goes on and these positions are filled, you can remove them from your 15 and add new projects from the list of several hundred. In total, about 30 of these were on my 'selected projects' list at one point or another, but I only counted one of these points in my data. The other 78 data points were individual reqs which I submitted independent applications for. 

**Position breakdowns**

As I've been going through university, I've come to realize that I'd probably find a (non-software) engineering position a little more fulfilling, so really wanted a mechanical engineering-related internship to get that experience before graduating. As such, my numbers suggest that bias a little:

Internship Discipline*| Breakdown
---|---
Computer Science | 21 (26.58%)
MechE | 49 (62.03%)
Materials | 8 (10.13%)
MechE/EE** | 1 (1.27%)

\* Most closely related. I threw industrial &amp; manufacturing positions (along with some unclear ones) in with MechE.

\*\* Features some of both in the job description.

**Approach**

Tailoring resumes: Especially earlier in the season, I tried to tailor my resumes per position. The way I found most useful was to have a ""master resume"" with literally everything I could possibly fit on it (about 2-2.5 pages) and then use only the parts I felt relevant to trim down to 1 page. After doing more than a dozen applications like this, I found newer positions were pretty close to at least one of them and I would use those instead.

On location: Many of the positions I applied to were in my general area, but the single most common state was California (other side of the country from me). This is mainly because a large amount of tech companies are headquartered there, and it was largely the software positions on that side. I figure this only hurt me, since it's probably not a good look to see someone from the east coast applying to the west (despite my 'willing to relocate' on resume, I wager it looks more like a 'shotgunning' approach than an identical resume that's geographically close). Anyway, here's the [heatmap](https://i.imgur.com/146Z8PW.png).

On cover letters: Of the &gt; 35 positions which allowed for cover letters, I probably only filled in maybe 15-20. There were probably 3 or 4 personalized ones that I made minor changes to in order to adapt for really similar positions.

**Other thoughts**

The most fun interview process I had is probably Amazon's. I applied there last year as well (denied) but got an upgrade to the waitlist for this year which I've been on since February. The process was: applied -&gt; take simple debugging/problem solving challenge -&gt; take more in-depth coding challenge a la HackerRank but on their platform -&gt; take virtual ""day in the life"" questionnaire and playthrough -&gt; video interview. The day in the life section was new this year where you ""receive emails"" and ""instant messages"" from ""coworkers"" as you try to figure out the right way to navigate office life. Weird and 3 hours long, but interesting. All of these are spread out over several days/weeks (you have a few days to do the current section before proceeding).

If you wondered about the 1 declined offer, it was for a company about an hour away from me that I received an offer for directly after the Fall career fair. The position was close to a QA tester in software. The reason I declined was because it was in a HCOL area which I would realistically need to move to based on the hours and it wasn't really something I was interested in. I figured 6-ish months would be plenty to get at least one more offer but I really came close to being wrong as can be.

My biggest pain point with this process is probably the lack of responses. I get that it doesn't make financial sense to manually respond to the many hundreds or thousands of applications these companies get, but it's really frustrating when a website makes it as painful as possible to reenter all of my data into fields just to literally never hear back. Just under 70% (55/79) of my (recorded) applications ended with no response and the real number is probably closer to 80%. I don't think it's asking for much to say if you fill a req, have it automatically close and notify the remaining applicants. At least a dozen of these visibly changed from ""applied"" to ""under consideration"" before going radio silent, which was especially evident on the Brassring-based websites.

Anyway, that's all I've got for now. If you guys have any thoughts or questions I'm all ears :)"

I went back and forth a lot during *and* after college about what sort of engineering I wanted to do. I've been out of college for almost a year, and even took a pretty long break from job hunting while I tried to figure out what I actually wanted to use my degree for, I tried a number of different personal engineering projects to rule things out. 

I've decided I want to do DSP on embedded platforms (my engineering concentration was embedded systems). However my junior year internship was an unpaid, low-stress, lab research assistant position where I did a lot of very high-level Python and Tensorflow. 

I've still been applying to full-time jobs, but I feel *severely* limited by the fact that not only was my internship in a vastly different field and using very different skills and technologies, but also that it was a significantly different environment from most tech industry work.

I honestly think an embedded internship would be a good ""reset button"" for me. But I guess this isn't the norm. Most internships I see advertised ""require"" that the candidate either be finishing college or still in college. While I don't think this will keep me from applying, would employers legitimately look at my resume and go ""hm, nah, this guy already graduated. Pass.""?

Has anyone here gotten an internship after graduating? How did it go for you? Are there steps I can take to filter out the ""back-to-school summer internships"" from the internships that lead into full-time positions? Would it help my case to include a lot of what I talked about here in a cover letter when I apply? Am I just going to be wasting my time if I try applying to internships?"

I am a CS graduate from a reputable college in India, but during my college time I wasn't much into programming and I hated it. I didn't code that much in my 4 years of college and was even on verge of dropping out, but somehow finished it.

During college, I never applied for any internship or sat for campus placements, as I was adamant at that time not to be in this field.

After graduation(May 2019), I didn't find any other passion, so with some advice from my friend, I started back learning programming. I knew python, so spent some time learning to code in python and used to solve problems on Leetcode (Sept-Oct).

Then I started a course on CS50(Web Programming with Python and JS), where I learnt basics of Flask, Django, Git and other tools from that course and also built some static websites from scratch, which were part of the projects.(Nov-Jan 2020 (first week)).

After this, I started applying for jobs( I don't know whether this was enough for a fresher or not). I appeared for around 5 interviews during (Jan to Feb), and was even offered a job verbally from one of them, but later they ghosted me. Rest of them interviews were not that great, kind of average and honestly they were quite demotivating

Then I wanted to improve my static websites, so started learning Angular from course and learned its basics and concepts.(March-April)

Currently during lockdown, I'm rebuilding one of my previous project using Angular and Django REST Framework.


Now I don't know whether I'm underestimating myself or something else, I need some advice that am I heading in correct direction, as since graduation, I've been out of touch from most of my friends and been home learning, wasting time, and all.

Should I start applying again?"

The thing is, I’m planning on moving states to a bigger city for several reasons; more job opportunity (the city I live in now has a little over 100k people, the one I plan to move to has over 1.6M), more room for growth and family is there as well.

As with everyone else, this pandemic has pushed back my plans on moving and finding a job but it is still something I want and plan to do.

So my question is, do I let my boss know now I plan to leave the state by the end of the year? Do I not say anything until I actually start applying for jobs once things start to get somewhat back to normal?
Or do I not say anything at all until I actually have a couple interviews lined up?

Don’t think I’m a terrible engineer but just want a code review that’s concise so I can make my changes and get on with my life. How do I ask my teammates to do that?

Basically I just started this new job as a new grad and I was given a pretty complicated story but I managed to finish it without much guidance. The story was a pretty vague one to start with but I didn’t complain much, I just clarified along the way. Anyway, I got done, I did a demo and everyone was impressed and told me I’ve set high expectations during the demo. 

Now I’m just trying to merge in my code to master and these two devs keep nitpicking the SIMPLEST things and it’s getting SUPER annoying having to “fix” these issues when in the grand scheme of things it doesn’t matter much. Some of the stuff they’re complaining about I provide explanations as to why it needs to stay the way it is but some stuff I guess makes some sort of sense to change. So I change them, push again and they make MORE suggestions. I’d be totally fine if they told me all that was wrong in 3 or 4 cycles where they comment, I make the changes and push again but this has been going on for a whole week. All I want from them is to tell me what’s wrong and I’ll fix it and get on with other tasks.

I’ve had other internships before and I don’t think I’m THAT terrible of a programmer that I’m spending a whole week in code review. I’ve tested my code multiple times with multiple edge cases and it works! I’ve tried my best to follow good design practices as well and I’ve also modeled it based on other services that the team already built so I’m not introducing anything new either.

Am I being unreasonable? Is this how this is supposed to go? How can I tell the dev’s to make my life easier and just tell me what’s wrong with the code in 1-2 code reviews? 

I’m actually dreading going into work tomorrow."

I was recently offered a position for ASR Digital Risk Solutions Associate at PwC for fall 2021 and have a few questions regarding the position. The offer is for a large office in California. I was originally supposed to intern in this position this summer but am now unable to because of COVID-19.

\- I have read that this position is essentially IT Audit, is this correct?

\- What would be the typical hours (busy season and non-busy season) for this position?

\- I am an Information Systems major and have no desire to pursue my CPA, would that be an issue?

\- The offer did not include a salary (due to COVID-19) and I will receive more information on the salary in the fall. Due to the office being located in an extremely high cost of living area, would the starting salary be feasible for comfortable living?

\- Any other general advice regarding the position?

Thank you!!"

I'm 26 years old currently working as an tech support analyst, I have an graduation in System Analysis and Development (not a great college, but not terrible) . Due to some personal circumstances, I was not able to pursue a career in programming when I was younger and fresh out of college (never made an internship in programming, for example) and i feel that what I learned in college is a kind of outdated. 

The point is, I have some good base in programming logic (it was particurlaly the subject I was best at) and right now I am able to pursue a career in the area and dedicate time for learning, I have some base knowledge in Java ( made a few programs in college) so I feel it would be a good language to learn,  and it seems that, at least in my country, it is one with most job opportunities, and I wanted to get a job as a junior programmer before i get any older. What would you suggest that I learn to land a job? I tried to use job requisites as an example of what I should learn, but i got a little overwhelmed. ( I mean, some junior positions require to know 6 languages, plus 3 db, some gui, web development, databases, etc... some job requirements look too much like HR bullshit)

 (  Also, I don't really care for front end or back end, whatever you guys think is best/ easier for a beginner)

Today I was driving my yellow Hyundai in the right hand lane on a main road where I live. A red kia soul was a little infront of me in the left lane. All of a sudden the red kia decided to cut in front of me and turn right to a side road. I inevitably hit him on his right side, he continued driving and stopped a block away. He got out to look the damage. I got out to ask him to come back. He started freaking out and was seriously angry and I felt threatened. About 10 peoples from the surrounding houses, cars, and businesses all came out to my 'rescue' and this guy got back in his kia and drove off. I had the cops come and me and my 2 passengers gave statements, and 2 witnesses idle at the red light of the intersection who saw the whole thing gave statements. The whole event was on multiple cameras, and the police officer pulled up the video and told me that the red kia was at 100% liability. My car had to get towed as it was not able to be driven. After the whole event I get home and about an hour after the impact, I start getting neck pain and one of my passengers is dizzy with a headache. We both go to urgent care, I cat x-rays and cat scans and am told that I have pretty bad whiplash in my neck and back, and that my muscle strain is equivalent to someone days into whiplash, so it'll get bad. The doctor told me not to work for 4 days at least, and if I do go back be very careful (I'm a cashier). My passenger has a mild concussion and is told to rest for a week and avoid mental strain. They are scheduled to start a new job at a children's orphanage home as an intern next week. I call the police to update my report with our injuries, they inform that a woman called about how they were involved in a hit and run. They said that a yellow car hit them dead on and drove off. They also said this occurred on the opposite side of town from where the accident actually happened, AND they are trying to blame me for all of it. She also said she was driving her red kia, with her boyfriend and her mother as passengers. That wasn't even true, the boyfriend was driving the car, and the mother was the only passenger. The police officer told me they knew that they were blatantly lying, and that the hit and runners would be coming into the station and be charged with hit and run from personal injury and submitting a false police claim. He also told me that they are clearly at 100% fault. This whole ordeal took up atleast 7 to 8 hours. This all took place on camera and the red kia is obviously at fault. This is also during the middle of me and my passenger's finals week at school, and we can't think straight. We're scared to drive or even ride in a car, it was both of our first accidents and it was very traumatic. We are both very anxious in general and this is the last thing we needed. 

Phew... that was the story. Hopefully you're still with me. My question is, what are my next steps? Should I sue them? I emailed a personal injury lawyer, but I'd hate to have to spend money on all of their work or time and then find out I have no claim to anything. I don't really know how suing works and I would hate to get in trouble, or reverse sued or something like that. I mostly want justice for the whole ordeal, this guy looked very scaring and threatening and I'm honestly worried of retaliation if I pursue legal action. What do I need in order to sue him? Is it worth it usually? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Hopefully I managed to make it a somewhat interesting read.

Thank you so much for anything.

Edit: forgot to mention, not sure how important this is. But my dad said since she called the police that likely means they have insurance, and the reason they want to file an accident report is for their insurance claim, and that they probably didn't expect me to call the police since I was such a young kid."

I have seen a lot of people in this  stress out about their internship having been canceled.

As an experienced Software Engineer, I started wondering ""how can I help?"". I have been managing teams, including many interns, for a decade now. I also have been very involved in the hiring committee for the our tech department at a Fortune 10 company. I read and ranked hundreds of resumes a year, and interviewed and helped hire about 40 interns per year.

So in a nutshell, I know *what kind of projects recruiters like to see on resumes*, and I also know *how to create and grow teams of interns to actually _build_ them*.

So if your internship has been canceled, and you want to code for the summer and create your own internship, join me at r/HackYourOwn. Let's see what we can do.

This is an experiment. I don't know how this is going to turn out. But even if it helps out a couple people, I feel that it would be worth it to try.

I am a CS graduate from a reputable college in India, but during my college time I wasn't much into programming and I hated it. I didn't code that much in my 4 years of college and was even on verge of dropping out, but somehow finished it.

During college, I never applied for any internship or sat for campus placements, as I was adamant at that time not to be in this field.

After graduation(May 2019), I didn't find any other passion, so with some advice from my friend, I started back learning programming. I knew python, so spent some time learning to code in python and used to solve problems on Leetcode (Sept-Oct).

Then I started a course on CS50(Web Programming with Python and JS), where I learnt basics of Flask, Django, Git and other tools from that course and also built some static websites from scratch, which were part of the projects.(Nov-Jan 2020 (first week)).

After this, I started applying for jobs( I don't know whether this was enough for a fresher or not). I appeared for around 5 interviews during (Jan to Feb), and was even offered a job verbally from one of them, but later they ghosted me. Rest of them interviews were not that great, kind of average and honestly they were quite demotivating

Then I wanted to improve my static websites, so started learning Angular from course and learned its basics and concepts.(March-April)

Currently during lockdown, I'm rebuilding one of my previous project using Angular and Django REST Framework.


Now I don't know whether I'm underestimating myself or something else, I need some advice that am I heading in correct direction, as since graduation, I've been out of touch from most of my friends and been home learning, wasting time, and all.

Should I start applying again?"

Although, I want to be productive this summer and learn some skills and get a few certifications if possible since my #1 goal right now is to be able to secure an internship for next summer (Summer 2021). Ultimately, my goal is to obtain an internship in the areas of cyber security, information security or similar. I am also interested in cloud computing, stuff like AWS, etc.

Overall I just want to use these 3 months to expand my skills as much as possible and add them to my resume. Which certifications/skills/languages should I focus on obtaining if cybersec and infosec are my career goal?

I live in San Diego, CA and am interested in staying here to work in the future. As a side question, do any of you know how the job market is here in San Diego for cybersec?

I have even participated in a couple of game jams and have made some cool projects with my teammates.

I have at least basic experience with C++, C#, Java, Javascript and Python. C# is my main language.

I still have no interview opportunity, let alone, a job offer after looking for almost a year.

Some of my friends who graduated and were comp-sci majors got internships and jobs already (with some of them being related to game dev) and they barely had anything in their portfolio.

What is you guys advice?"

Spring). Before I've learnt a little bit of C (as ""fundamentals"") and not too long ago some JavaScript (to be able to kick off with Angular) + of course some basic HTML and CSS.

I plan to study somewhere in Europe CS (or some fields that will be hot then), but until then I've got 3 full years left in high school (haven't failed or something like that). My idea was to get into web development and get some (probably real life internship type) experience. I'm lucky enough to be relatively close to the Bratislava-Vienna-Budapest triangle and to speak either English and German.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I guess that'd help me to get into some good university (even scholarship?), I could get to know people in the field and of course I'd have some experience compared to others.

Many people wish they had done X and Y earlier and that would have increased their chances or whatever. My question is, what are these things that I could do this ""early"" (maybe some programs focusing on youngers etc.)to gain some advantage later? With web development (Angular + Spring seems like a hot tech among companies) do I have the chance to have something like an internship or I'll need to accept sticking to own projects?

EDIT: Needless to say I don't want to stick to Angular/Java at any costs in the future, but now they seemed like a good choice. I'm also interested in later trying out mobile development with Ionic/NativeScript etc. And the tech/field I'll work with/on later probably doesn't exist yet."

I’ll very likely be enrolling into REP so it would be awesome if you could share anything about NTU REP. 

Additionally, a few questions below:
- Are there significant differences (in terms of employability etc.) between a Bachelor of Engineering Science with specialisation in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science?

- Are NTU REP students allowed to take up a second minor or major?

- Do most REP students get the chance to intern overseas or only an exceptional few get to do so?

- Since less time is spent on the course of specialisation, is the depth lacking as compared to other non-REP students, or do REP students simply have a tighter schedule to complete the same number of modules in a shorter timeline?

- Any recommendations on laptop (storage, RAM, OS etc) to get for REP, assuming I will be specialising in likely Computer Science (or Computer Engineering or EEE)?
Wonder if NTU courses/projects involve much of developing iOS apps or Windows app which might determine the laptop OS I probably should get. I heard that MacBooks would be good for coding since it’s based on Unix but I’m not too sure how significant that will be.

- How does NTU REP compare to NUS CS + USP + minor in Stats

gft11o,0,2020-05-08,Not sure I want to pursue IT/Help desk work anymore. Instead I want to do Web Dev,[deleted],webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/gft11o/not_sure_i_want_to_pursue_ithelp_desk_work/,"TLDR:   
Graduated with B.S. in IT 2019  and have 6  months total in help desk experience between my internship  and first  job. First job was cut due to COVID-19. I considered doing  Web dev  throughout my degree and I've decided I want to pursue it. I had already  built simple websites with html and css and dabbled in JS.   I’m 3/4  done with TOP web dev 101(doing etch-a-sketch project atm).   I have no interest in Helpdesk,  Networking  or System Admin. I dont know if there is a point  to pursue  entry level  IT roles anymore. Thinking maybe I should just get  something to pay the  bills and focus on Web Dev. I didnt like help desk  and dont see the  point of focusing on it.  Advice?  


My LinkedIn, Indeed, resume, summary/statments are all built around looking for IT work. I want to change it all over to pursuing Web dev work, but I dont know if it's too soon. Maybe I should wait until I have a solid portfolio? But until I make it clear what I am looking for, I will have people contacting me about help desk positions and not web dev. 

More  details…  
 (can skim/skip if too long, I mainly want advice on  whether  entry level IT is really worth my time if I want to pursue web dev)

I  moved to Raleigh for a help desk specialist position that got cut  two  months into my contract due to COVID-19 . Competition has  skyrocketed  and I can’t find work in IT. I  have enough  saved for 3-4 months plus I am receiving unemployment. Not dept, went to cheaper state college for my BS.

Before  I went for my degree I was already interested in Web dev. I  learned  some HTML and CSS and created some very simple websites. Then I  decided  to get the degree in IT. I took two classes in web development  that  covered html and css and some JavaScript in my first two years.  Since  then I have been consumed with my classes and other areas in IT. I  graduated and moved to Raleigh for the help desk job thinking I was  going to pursue something in IT. I honestly have not enjoyed my help desk role and have no interest in Networking or System Admin.

After working in IT for a little bit I couldnt stop thinking about  webdev.  Being let go from work has given me a lot of time to think  about  things. I really want to get back into it. I really want to pursue  this  as a career.

So…

I  am expecting it to be at least 6 months before I can start applying  to web dev jobs. I want to build a portfolio and get a good grasp on  html,  css, and javascript.

Raleigh is a  great place to look for  work. However, I am concerned  about the  economy. The virus is going to make an impact for a long time.   Competition for jobs are up and I know even before that its always high for entry web dev jobs. So I am concerned that I may struggle to find work in what looks to be a recession.

I  have no job currently and my experience points to me trying to find  a new help desk job. But I want to change my career focus and I am not sure that I should be focused on that if I want to do web dev? I dont want to divide my attention. So maybe its ok if I choose alternative work while I work on getting a web dev job?

So I really want to make the move to Web Dev and I see it taking me  at  least 6 months to get a decent portfolio. Not sure If I should just  get  any job in the meantime or focus on getting an entry level IT job.  The  problem is that If I wanted to pursue IT still I should be getting certs and working on a home lab. Instead I’m learning how to code.

I  am thinking about applying for Starbucks (I worked there before in   college), Target, etc and just sitting on that until I land an Web dev position. I could work part-time to have extra time to spend on   learning, but that will only last for so long until I’ll need full-time.

The other options is to just keep looking for entry level IT jobs. The pro would be more money the con would be my attention divided.  Because I have money saved I am inclined to work a job like Starbucks  for 6  months to a year until I land a web dev job. The con of that is  the possibility that I struggle to find work for over a year and get really tired of earning a low wage.

Thoughts?  would more help desk benefit me at all? Another thought is  that it  would be harder to do interviews in a Monday-Friday help desk job."

gfwd8n,0,2020-05-08,Seeking Advice in Finding a Career Mentor. Is it okay to ask a Co-worker?,Kahako,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gfwd8n/seeking_advice_in_finding_a_career_mentor_is_it/,"Hi all! So, back in January, I started my first full-time job as a SWE for an amazing company while finishing out my last semester. I've been wanting to find a career mentor, but with balancing work and school I knew I couldn't really dedicate the time to it until I graduated. Now that I've finished, I'm ready to readdress this, but I'm not sure on how to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that my next goal is to be a full-stack engineer and right now I'm a jr. automation test engineer. I know that I need a LOT more education on unit and integration testing to get better at my current position (I'm mostly doing UI testing at work) along with a stronger handle on programming that just comes with experience over time. I really would like to find a mentor who has had a similar career path as mine, but like... how does one ask?

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of suggestions I've gotten is to ask in some of the professional groups I attend if anyone is looking for a mentor. However, I'd personally prefer my relationship with a potential mentor to happen more organically. There are two people I work with in particular who I am stuck in deciding on asking. One of them used to be on my team when I started as an intern, but has since moved to a different position within the company. This person is the one who inspired me to become a test engineer in the first place. The other person is my coworker who is a level higher than me, who has been mentoring me work-wise ever since I moved onto the same squad as him. We work really well together, and he's also someone I deeply respect. I would ask my current coworker, but I'm not sure if that's considered okay? Because we're on the same squad, I do have a small concern that asking him could potentially disrupt our teamwork. I'm worried the dynamism may change in our day-to-day work, but then I wonder if maybe I'm just being too much in my head worrying about this since he already is mentoring me at work.

&amp;#x200B;

Which leads me to ask y'all's advice on how I could best navigate this. I know where I want to go, but I am kind of stalled on where to start. What other questions should I be asking myself when I'm looking for a mentor? What other things should I be looking for IN a mentor? Am I relying too much on getting along with the person? Should I consider demographics, because I am considered a minority group in the field and they are not? *IS* it a faux pas to ask someone who you work with closely?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I recognize that imposter syndrome is a reality at all levels, and some people might think they're not at a level to be a good mentor. When I make my decision, how would I ask so I don't accidentally freak the person out? I'm really quite awful at reading a room until the damage is already done.  


  
TLDR: I want to find a career mentor and be a good mentee, but where do I start? Is it a faux pas to ask someone I get along well with who is on the same squad? What about someone who was a coworker, but has since moved to a different position within the company?"

Why am I even here?,Nikylebisnath,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gfwmnv/hard_work_and_dedication_isnt_enough_why_am_i/,"Work has been bad because of the coronavirus stuff forcing our country into lockdown. Our company is essential business with only limited staff allowed and I am essential staff and need to work every weekday. My boss is friendly so far, but I'm not dealing with him. I'm dealing with someone else in charge of me. She is supposed to train me and she is to an extent, most of the training is done by other people as she is a lazy bitch who doesn't like getting her fat ass of her seat. Now this week was hard since   most employees are not there. I'm busting my ass off working twice as hard and making big sacrifices to my well being both physically and mentally. But it means nothing when this bitch is around.

She is essential staff and is pretty much needed for the business to run. I get that business and work is important, mistakes can be made on occasions, but there is a limit to how much disrespect and abuse one can take. She finds anything to make me look like an asshole, since I'm an intern. She has apparently been doing this to interns for the past 5 years, about 20 of them before me. All but 1 left, and 1 was in severe depression and abused so much, that next morning that employee had a heart attack and died. 

My boss can't do anything about this, because he needs her for the business to run. She even treats her own husband anyhow from what I'm hearing. She is an outright bully, who is in control over me and is in a much higher position than me. Because I'm an intern, she has the power to do whatever the fuck she wants to do, and I can't do anything to stop it.

My hard work means nothing, every other employee feels sorry for me, but I'm dealing with this abuse every time I go to work. I can't apply for new jobs because of this virus, and I feel like there is no point living anymore if I'm not appreciated as a hard working human being!"

A few months ago my parents found out about my korean girlfriend (now ex) and they freaked out, went through all my personal belongings, my journals, took pictures and blackmailed me constantly to either follow the religion or we're going to take everything away from you and throw you to the street. 

They knew they have power over me financially so they pretty much forced me to remove all the ""haram"" stuff from my life or they threatened to take literally all my belongings and kick me out. This led to me being depressed, constantly paranoid and anxious and just had a lot of negative energy in my life. I would have nightmares almost every night of my parents and live in constant fear.

My GF broke up with me, and quarantine has been terrible so far, constantly being forced to pray and acknowledge a god that I don't believe in.  If I stand up for myself in the slightest like i don't feel like praying this non-mandatory prayers they gaslight me saying how can you say that when god was the one who created you blah blah and they get angry. 

They treat my little sister poorly and my mom ""trains"" her like a dog to just be a future head of a house, and want to get her married ASAP and is trying to force her to become a doctor, when she wants to be a teacher. 

But sometimes I have moments where I feel like we are normal family, when I come and tell a joke and my mom laughs and we talk about random stuff. Then 25 minutes later my father forces us to pray together and gets mad at us for not being happy to pray and I feel like absolute shit. 

I am going to be leaving the house in January because my internship this summer will be enough for me to live on my own indefinitely. But I feel weird about leaving, like I don't know how I will do it, and I'm scared to tell them I no longer believe in Islam."

(Long ramble ahead) 

Currently I am a junior doing bachelors degree in EE and I’m wondering if doing an additional degree (bachelors or masters) in CS would be useful. I have prior internship experience at a defense company sophomore year but they had me so some basic programming to automate tasks and I also realized I don’t want to work in defense in general. This year I was unable to land any EE internships since getting an internship in hardware or systems is pretty hard so I ended up taking a software development intern position at IBM. I wish I could have gotten more EE internships to know what’s it’s like to be in the field outside of classes.

The thing is, while my resume is heavy in software, those jobs didn’t require any real coding interview that a lot of CS majors have to do to land an internship at a big company. I know how to code (with the help of google) but I don’t know the fundamentals in CS where I could pass a real coding interview at a company such as google, amazon or even a start up.


I’m in my final year and I’m trying to figure out what I should do for a career. I have interest in embedded systems but that’s more CE and my degree is EE. Should I pursue an additional degree in CS so I can 

1. Learn the fundamentals in the event I want to do SWE.

2. Be able to get into embedded systems (so more Computer Engineering like jobs)

Or will my bachelors degree in EE and resume be enough? 

And also is software experience useful in EE? What were your jobs like after you graduated?

Sometimes ago I started being interested in building a digital platform. I talked with a friend which I knew was reliable and could help me with its knowledge and we were interested to start the business together after we graduate. Unfortunately for me, he got a internship offer in Amazon and he will probably get a full-time offer he won't reject at the end of the internship.

From my point of view having someone else on-board working on your side is an occasion to discuss things and find more solutions to problems (you know 2 brains work better than 1), but I know really few people which take things seriously and fewer that have the technical expertise to be a good fit. None that does not have an offer in some company already.

Moreover, I'm in a geographical position where fundings are rare (with current crisis even more utopian) and my personal resources are really limited. So I can't afford to hire people.

So, should I look for co-founders? If yes and none of my acquaintances wants to join, how?

I worry about the help desk trap. Also, I've heard help desk is not helpful experience for dev work. Some have said that maybe the right company would let me move into a dev position if I did my time in help desk and showed interest. Others says that's unlikely. My last help desk job was resetting passwords, imaging, adding new users, etc. and got mindlessly boring, The only way up was more help desk.

I am thinking about applying for Starbucks (I worked there before in  college), Target, etc and just sitting on that until I land an Web dev  position, but can't just expect a job to land on my lap in a year and will start wishing I had better income after 6-10 months of a job like Starbucks.

My LinkedIn, Indeed,  resume, summary/statments are all built around looking for IT work. I want to switch to dev work, but I dont beleive I am ready and need time to learn, but maybe there is entry level work outside of helpdesk that would be more beneficial? fyi, My main interest has been in web dev, but I am open to other work and have enjoyed working with SQL and Python some. I would really like to learn more python tbh, because It would probably benefit me no matter what I do.  I would like to find something more dev work oriented then tech support. Tech support made me miserable tbh

gg7sy7,281,2020-05-08,From Cheating in CSE 143 to a Full Time Programming Role,ch3zzter,udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/gg7sy7/from_cheating_in_cse_143_to_a_full_time/,"**As I am seeing that many admission decisions are coming out I thought now would be a good time to share the (success) story of my journey at UW, which is coming to an end this quarter.**

  
Like many hopefuls I came into the UW hoping to do Computer Science. I had built my own computer in High School, I thought coding was fascinating, I saw that it was a field that was employable and paid well. Like many up until I started at UW I didn't really realize the work it took to be successful, and I wasn't prepared for the competitive nature that UW cultivates. 

By the end of **my first year** I knew I would never be a CS student. I took CSE 143 that winter with my roommate, we were both struggling on an assignment and he sent me an ""example"" of a past quarter's submission found online. As I soon found out, you can change every single variable name and you will still get caught. The program they run is able to see the structure of the code and compares it to their database of submissions. That crushed me, and was one of the hardest lessons I had to learn my Freshman year. Having to own up to my own mistake and look past it shook my world for the better. We both got caught and I don't blame my roommate at all.

I was able to finish the prerequisite courses to Informatics just in time to apply my Freshman year. I wrote a piss-poor essay which I was revising with 10 minutes left to the deadline. In retrospect of course I'm not surprised at all that I wasn't admitted, but at the time I was still partially in the mindset that life would just work out for me. 

After getting rejected my **Sophomore year** with an actually well written and revised essay I was heartbroken. In my head I still was set on Info as my backup major and didn't have another backup, I didn't have the prerequisites or grades for ACMS or any Math heavy major. A friend of mine had recommended GIS in Geography as a tech-related alternative and by the end of the year I was a declared Geography Major. I still wanted to program for a living and still was hoping to get into Info my Junior year. I had it calculated that I could take Info classes on the side and still graduate in 4 years if I was admitted then.

So many students I see on this sub-reddit put an incredible emphasis on getting into their major. Which is a great goal to work towards, but it isn't the ""end all be all""! I finally came to realize around this point that *my Major wasn't what was going to get me that desired job after college, it was the skills was able to gain and retain from my studies*. This was when I got my first internship paying minimum wage at a research center downtown to help add data visualizations to their website. I got this through applying to nearly every data science related *Undergraduate Research Program listing.*

For my **Junior year** Informatics essay I was actually so ticked at the system that my essay was about how my Major and grades don't define my capabilities in life. haha! Long story short I didn't get in then either, and was officially going to be graduating as a Geography Major. I continued to take Informatics and the non-major CSE courses that I was able to get into and began applying like crazy to internship roles for the next summer. I likely *applied to over 100 roles mostly on sites like Glassdoor*. I got my second internship at a recreational equipment company working on their employee management system/database. Around this time I also secured a part-time engineering internship at a telecommunications giant that would go throughout my senior school year. When I applied and accepted these Internships my resume still had Informatics as my intended major even though I was denied from the program a few weeks afterwards. 

This might apply to tech more than other majors but *don't think that because you didn't get into your major you aren't qualified or able to get that role you want or be successful in the future*. Fight through it and apply everywhere! **Work experience is so much more valuable than any major title or course.** 

The Geography major is not incredibly technical and even though I'm seeing this Data Science option that has been recently added to it, after looking at the courses, it's not that much more intensive. Geography courses all hold your hand through the material and if you do major in I highly recommend going above and beyond. I was able to take every single non-major CSE course except for AI and the photography one. In Informatics I was able to get the Android, iOS, and Server-side courses (don't take professionalism), many people assumed I was in the major.

For a while I regretted not transferring when the Geography major initially disappointed me, but in retrospect two factors made staying worth it, the reduced in-state tuition (probably saved over $50,000 in debt), and simply *the amount of opportunities in Seattle*. All my internships were located in Seattle and being able to be at school so close gave me the opportunities to go to interviews (of which I got rejected from many) and eventually find internships. 

This Summer I start work full time as a Diagnostics Engineer writing programs that monitor and help to maintain cell phone service around the country, I get to work with massive amounts of data, and am making a 6 figure salary right out of college. To everyone who has been rejected from any major, know that it isn't the end of the world and you can and will bounce back. Stay positive and fail forward."

My goal is to get a job in data engineer and probably data science in the future. So I use Python often, I work on several projects for fun such as finding a recipe from online using API and give to the user according to the user input and building GUI and things. Also for work, I work a lot with data frames using pandas, NumPy and so on. 

I enjoy everything about this, but the only thing is I'm just so bad at those coding challenges. I really don't like doing them at all. I use Leetcode, but reading and trying to understand the problem is not fun for me at all. I wonder if I ever can be a programmer if I don't enjoy problem-solving things. Doing one problem a day is very challenging.

I know I will need to do coding challenges because I will need to get a job in the future. I want to work as a data engineer and I'm not sure if data engineers still go through those coding interviews but either way, I want to enjoy solving those problems. And eventually, be good at it also.

Does anyone who had the same issues as mine? If so, how did you overcome it? Any advice or tip will be greatly appreciated.....

P.S. I promised myself to do one coding challenge today but I made excuse and didn't do it... Ugh..."

Econ major, so this GPA looks very very low. It was my fault that I entered Berkeley and majored in Chemical Engineering. I got 2.9 GPA in my first three semesters, which was a quite devastating experience. Instead of coming here, I should have just chosen Purdue or Illinois that matched my quality. In my fourth semester, I switched my major to Econ and I tried my best to catch up by earning multiple A's. But still, till this semester, I have only managed to reach 3.4. And as I switched my major out of nowhere during my second year, I did not accumulate enough knowledge and did no networking to help me secure some decent internship (like big four or investment bank). The only thing that can cheer me up is that I have one Haas research now and probably I will get a good recommendation letter written by my professor. It seems that my future is very hopeless. The only way out is to get into a good master's program. I'm eyeing on degrees such as master of finance, master of financial engineering, or master of data science. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could send me some useful suggestions that could guide me into a brighter future.  Thank you! Also, I'm not sure if I should take the risk and switch to grading. I don't have 100% confidence that I can get A's in these classes, which means that my GPA may be lowered. Considering that many colleges only look at GPA till the end of junior year, what should I do now? Study hard, take the risk, or stick with 3.4?"

Honestly I really love and enjoy reading new stuff and learning new things in React but when I apply for the Jobs with better I'm always rejected with the statement *""you lack experience"".* I'm really confused about how should I proceed with my career?

Just to give you overview I'm vell versed with all this:

1. React

* Props, State
* Hooks
* Component Lifecycles (tbh I do require some help in this)
* Redux, Context API
* CSS Modules, CSS in JS
* REST API integration using both **axios** and **fetch** &amp; Building **Forms**
* React Router and using almost any other library with it

Normal Stuff that I'm also good with

* **CSS Frameworks**: Semantic UI, Bulma and my fav. Bootstrap
* **CSS Preprocessor**: SASS
* **Node.js**: I can build basic CRUD APIs and also familiar with Jade and Pug Templating
* **Angular**: Dependency Injections, Behaviour Subject, Forms, Routing, ViewChild, Eventemitter
* **JavaScript**: I try to adapt to new syntax as much as possible, familiar with all the functions like map, filter, reduce etc and concepts like hoisting, closure
* Also I can write **jQuery** too (though anyone who has written JS can write it)

Please help me in moving forward as I really want to become a really good frontend developer and earn decent pay so that I could pay off my student loans and do something good in this field. I know the stuff written above is quite normal to any experienced FE Dev. but that's why I want to improve myself and become a better Dev, any critics please answer where am I going wrong I'm really open to listening any flaws.

My new internship for this summer was essentially cancelled as they didn’t have a virtual program set up. There is the possibility that the city, Philly, opens up before the summer ends so I could intern there, but I doubt it.

One last option is a startup for the summer. My friend has some other friends who also interested in a startup. They have money to spend so, it could actually work. But, this is not fully guaranteed as people’s schedules could possibly change in the next 2 weeks.

#Background

Due to low engagement, last years spring elections saw 3 unfilled seats in USAC that required a special election during the fall quarter. A south campus major, Orion Smedley, ran on a platform to bring back a bus connecting UCLA to LAX that had been discontinued due to low usage several months before. In their election endorsements, the Daily Bruin wrote 

&gt; [The board does not endorse Smedley because of his narrow focus on small-scale visions and his lack of comprehensive understanding of the position.

Orion went on to win a seat in the special election making him one of the few political outsiders as most USAC members are voted into the council after years of working their way up a slate.


#The Referendum

On April 8th, the Daily Bruin reported that USAC had approved candidates and referenda for an online ballot due to campus closures in the wake of COVID-19. In this ballot was a particularly contentious referendum, Cultivating Unity for Bruins (CUB). [The CUB referendum would increase student fees by $15 per quarter and $9 per summer session in order to fund the creation of a Black Resource Center, maintain meditation spaces, and offset the rent of the Transfer Student Center.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/08/usac-approves-candidates-and-referenda-for-online-spring-2020-election-ballot/)

[A post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fxy4rl/usac_is_once_again_trying_to_increase_your_fees/) was made onto r/UCLA the next day calling for students to vote down the referendum. The post garnered much attention as many students were unaware that these measures had been passed. The referendum sparked backlash as many had recently lost their jobs, campus resources would not be accessible due to closures, and the Community Programs Office had [$2.7 million unaccounted for.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/14/public-information-is-lacking-for-over-2-million-used-by-two-campus-committees/) The subreddit began to fill with threads demanding accountability from USAC President Robert Watson. 

In response to the outcry, [USAC ordered its affiliates to make reddit accounts to downvote threads that were bringing negative attention to the CUB referendum.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fyjyls/so_my_friend_is_a_lower_level_usac_affiliate_and/) These messages were instead posted onto r/UCLA which only served to further foment backlash against the CUB referendum.

Students began to dig into USAC financials only to discover other information of which many had been previously unaware. In particular they discovered [most accounts were overfunded even accounting for spring quarter expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g1i25k/a_closer_look_at_usac_spending/) Many were also shocked to learn that [USAC officers were paid stipends of up to $10K a year for serving on the council.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fylv1a/update_usac_stipends_they_allocate_over_160k_for/) 

After this story broke, students flooded the USAC public meetings that had been moved to Zoom. During the meeting immediately following the backlash against the CUB referendum, all USAC officers, save Orion, voiced their continued support for CUB. Orion stated he did not think the time was appropriate for a fee increase but planned to abstain from voting as he was running for USAC president in the coming elections. Throughout the meeting, [other officers berated Orion for not supporting the referendum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jeq7NQzzA9o&amp;app=desktop) (Timestamps in the comments). During the Zoom meeting, a participant vandalized the chat with racist remarks which prompted the hosts to [remove students from the meeting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g1k19p/usac_removed_me_from_their_public_meeting_this/) Soon after, [USAC officers took to other forms of social media, where they had more support, to continue attacking Orion.](https://twitter.com/ay_its_rob/status/1249516805456121858) Students responded by [shaming council members that had attacked Orion and removed students from a public meeting.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g1l0mq/my_take_on_the_usac_discussion_today/)


In response to USAC's mishandling of the CUB referendum backlash, [the Daily Bruin wrote an article chastising members of USAC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g56c92/daily_bruin_usac_creates_a_negative_online_culture/)

&gt; [Student representatives are supposed to focus their offices’ firepower on students’ problems, not on one another. But recently, the voice of the student body has largely been composed of Twitter rants and screenshot exposes. Tensions between Undergraduate Students Association Council members have boiled over into the public social media sphere over the Cultivating Unity for Bruins Referendum, a proposed referendum on the upcoming USAC election ballot.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/04/20/editorial-usacs-lack-of-clear-social-media-guidelines-allows-for-negative-online-culture/)

Soon afterwards, an unrelated scandal was brought to light by Orion. [He claimed that on March 10th, USAC voted against an independent judiciary with only he and another officer in opposition.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g6h7gw/usac_can_overrule_the_judicial_court/)

#The Election

In the same article that announced the CUB referendum would be on the ballot, it was revealed that Orion had formed his own slate, Cost Cutting Innovations (CCI), and would be seeking the presidency. He would be facing Naomi of For the People (FTP), the slate with the greatest representation in USAC, and three other Independent candidates. The fallout over the USAC's mishandling of the CUB referendum gave Orion and his slate an unexpected surge of support. He became the posterchild of reduced student fees after he was the only one to state his opposition to the referendum.

As election week approached, r/UCLA was rocked by several instances of fraud, where students posing as members of both Naomi and Orion's campaigns made unsanctioned posts. The moderators stepped in and [began requiring verification from users claiming to represent candidates.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g752qo/verify_your_campaign_or_organization/)

As election week was about to kick off, the Daily Bruin released their endorsements of candidates. To the dismay of many, [the Daily Bruin endorsed FTP candidates nearly straight down the ballot.](https://features.dailybruin.com/2020/usac-elections/#/endorsements) Users were quick to notice the amateurish reporting of the editorial board and called out discrepancies online.

In their endorsement for FTP's Zuleika over CCI's Deven they cited both of their lack of experience in student government as transfer students but gave very different spins. 

&gt; Zuleika 

&gt; While she lacks experience on USAC, Bravo has a wide range of leadership experience working with the Students with Dependents Program and the Transfer Leadership Coalition.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Deven 

&gt; Additionally, her lack of experience within USAC raises concern given the rigorous and sometimes toxic environment of student government, and we worry that her ideas may get lost in the transition.

A user pointed out that the USAC and the Daily Bruin had strong incentives provide legitimacy for each other. The user observed that south campus majors are less inclined to participate in student government because it is not in line with their career goals. The growing threat to USAC due to an increased number of south campus majors running on the CCI slate this year revealed to many students that the initiatives of previous administrations had merely been for show and were not focused on real student issues.

&gt; [South campus majors don't run for office. More importantly they don't vote. So when it comes to it, USAC is filled with the same people who push initiatives that stroke the ""woke"" ego that is so pervasive among the self proclaimed journalists at the Daily Bruin while the few [who] do push for South Campus specific plans get called ""out of touch"". It's absurd that a candidate can run on a campaign that wants to restore a tangible service to students and gets called out of touch while another candidate is praised for adding seats for students we don't know to a senate we've never heard of.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gd6jon/north_campus_dominates_ucla_politics_and_that/)

This message resonated with the r/UCLA userbase that skews heavily towards south campus. Students attacked the Daily Bruin and USAC for working together to maintain a system that allowed faux politicians and journalists to push unrealistic agendas for the purpose of advancing their careers and to the detriment of real student's problems. They alleged USAC and the Daily Bruin were out of touch with the student body after they had repeatedly endorsed candidates with the same type of lofty, good-on-paper agendas over candidates with realistic, sensible plans.

The start of election week was plagued by several more scandals. On Sunday, students also discovered that the the elections board, u/uclaelectionsboard, had paid for actors [Brian Baumgartner](https://www.instagram.com/uclausaeboard/) and [Lena Headey](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gcw4d9/where_your_usac_fees_go/) to record videos encouraging students to vote. Students complained this was a waste of student fees during a contentious election currently being fought over student fee raises.

On Monday morning, [an email, seeming to address incidents of racism, was sent out to all UCLA students.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gdhuos/beep_boop_beep_boop/) The email stated that racist attacks had been made against the CUB Referendum, citing specifically the incident where racial slurs were used during a public Zoom meeting. The USAC President, Elections Board Chair, and leaders of various ethnic student groups signed on to urge students to participate in the current elections.

[Students accused USAC of violating election codes by sending partisan information to students over a service to which all students are required to subscribe.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gdhuos/beep_boop_beep_boop/) 

&gt; [If you believe that USAC president Robert Watson violated campaign guidelines by sending an email to all undergraduates encouraging a 'yes' vote on the CUB referendum, click here [go to 'report a violation'] to file a complaint.][1]

&gt; [I recommend you cite Regulation 2.1.a.i of the Social Media Guidelines.][1]

&gt; &gt; [The Social Media Guidelines for campaigning, Regulation 2.1.a.i, state that campaign literature cannot be sent to email lists that all students are required to subscribe to."" [note: such as the undergraduate student directory]][1]

&gt; &gt; [Campaigning is defined in the election code, section 8.2.1.a (page 27) as:][1]

&gt; &gt; [[A]ny effort by any individual or group to influence the decision of any student in support of or against any USAC candidate, slate, initiative, referendum, recall, or constitutional amendment appearing on the ballot in the next election through the use of verbal or nonverbal interaction, electronic correspondence of any kind, or the use of physical materials. (emphasis mine)][1]

[1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gdhuos/beep_boop_beep_boop/fphmc9r/

Students called upon the Elections Board, the independent administrators of the election, to investigate the incident. Despite high activity in encouraging students to vote just hours before, the Election Board account went silent.

Further violations of election code occurred when students posted [screenshots of unsolicited texts messages they had received from an individual endorsing the FTP slate.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gdkfxq/i_have_no_clue_who_this_is_and_how_they_got_my/)

After a two day investigation, [the elections board found the complaint to be invalid.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gf1ftj/_/) 

&gt; [The Board first makes it clear that the main reason behind its approval of this letter was to take a clear stand in solidarity against incidents of hate speech that have occurred as a result of the ongoing debate about the CUB referendum][2]

&gt; [Many of the petitioners took issue with the sentence “These instances further highlight the inadequacy of space where Black students are able to feel safe and welcome on and off campus.” The Board agrees that this line itself could possibly be construed as campaigning as one of the components of the referenda is the construction of a Black Bruin Resource Center, which was mentioned in the email. On the other hand, the Board also agrees that this line itself could be construed as entirely factual by others and that the inclusion of “off campus” makes it so that racism as a whole is being addressed, with “on-campus” being used as a reference to the University. The Board acknowledges the petitioners’ concerns but this is ultimately a matter of subjective interpretation.][2]

[2]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/159x7E_NMBqKGiX8SnC51zX7W0rsIZwyu/view

They also wrote 

&gt; The third paragraph of the email discusses the CUB referendum, but only in the context of the racist incidents that have occured; these incidents are among the ones that the Board denounced in a April 15th statement.

Many students responded by repeatedly asking for examples of racist incidents other than one in the Zoom meeting. Students also noticed a lack of justification on why the email was not sent immediately after the incidents happened.

Allegations of conspiracy grew when a screenshot of the [USAC President claiming he had been given information on the current state of the election was posted onto r/UCLA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gflj6e/_/) Fury continued to mount against the elections board for this perceived impropriety. However, in this thread, the elections board defended itself by [claiming they had no knowledge on the results, only the number of votes cast.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gflj6e/_/fpucq7k/) Students continued to take issue with this statement asking why this information had only been made available to members of USAC.

#The Results

At 6 PM Friday, five hours after voting had concluded,  [the elections board announced the results of the election.](https://dailybruin.com/2020/05/08/naomi-riley-elected-usac-president-with-highest-voter-turnout-since-2016/) With the highest voter turnout since 2016:

* [Naomi of FTP had won the Presidency with 60% of the vote after 3 rounds of Single Transferable Vote.][3]

* [The CUB Referendum failed by 163 votes, a margin of 2% of the 8000 votes cast.][3]

* [FTP picked up six contested seats in USAC and an additional two seats in uncontested elections.][3]

* [CCI won two seats in contested elections.][3]

[3]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pME_bkzkCYA9yQCpfgG-RHpDG97TqV5P/view

Unexpectedly, the results were a mixed bag with many projecting a sweep by either side, contingent on the pass or fail of the CUB referendum. Despite both sides gaining and conceding ground, drama continued to ensue.

Shocked that CUB had failed, supporters of the referendum [took to twitter and began accusing r/UCLA of racism.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ggcoym/_/) Reddit users also [posted and criticized screenshots of several tweets by Naomi.^\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gg81gd/this_is_naomi_rileys_retweet_if_you_were_curious/)

As the fervor over the elections died down, some took the opportunity to [remind the student body of the alleged misconduct of USAC, the elections board, and the Daily Bruin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gg1q9o/let_us_never_forget_the_corruption/) However, it is unclear if the student body will have the momentum and memory to hold the newly elected USAC accountable to transparency and real change after this particularly contentious election.

^\[1\] : It is the opinion of the author that the second tweet can be construed as frustration at middle class people for not joining the plight of lower class people. Whether it is true, that middle class people do not support lower class people, is subject to debate.

###Author's thoughts

Since this section is my own opinion, I won't be adding sources unless its about an event that actually happened.

First I would like to start off by disclosing my biases. I completed my undergrad at UCLA and am currently a graduate student in a south campus major. Graduate students are governed by the Graduate Students Association (GSA) and have no stake in USAC. I also happen to know some members of the Daily Bruin's editorial board and their political beliefs; although, I have not been in contact with them for the duration of this event.

I'm extremely disappointed by USAC, the elections board, and the Daily Bruin for their behavior during this election cycle. While much of the evidence regarding collusion is circumstantial, it's hard to give them the benefit of the doubt, especially when many of these organizations have obtained notoriety for engaging in playground politics.

USAC and supporters of the CUB referendum have failed in every attempt to engage in civil discourse with the opposition. As a somewhat liberal individual, I probably have voted in favor of CUB, if I were an undergrad, barring a pandemic and the unaccounted $2.7 million. USAC and supporters refused to attack the argument: a student fee increase during a pandemic and by the least transparent USAC in recent history is a bad idea, opting instead to call all detractors racist. If these students wish to be future leaders and activists in America, they need to do better. On an unrelated note, this is why no one takes liberals, and by proxy college students, seriously. If your first reaction to disagreement is to scream racism, you don't know what you're doing. 

If you take your role on USAC seriously, and I know many do because it's what many want as a career, you have to be accountable. Real governments are accountable to the people they serve. If you read this story not knowing that it was a college government, you would think it was a democracy on the verge of collapsing into a totalitarian state. Which is kind of ironic considering how dyed in the wool liberal some of these people claim to be.

Despite actively engaging with students on r/UCLA in the days prior to election week, the elections board has been eerily silent since allegations of franking came out on Monday. I read the full Notice of Findings and am obligated to believe that a thorough investigation was conducted by an independent board. However, that is not to say that their actions were not incredibly suspect. As students, we know who is friends with who and it makes it very difficult to believe that members of the elections board did not have a personal stake in CUB despite statements to the contrary. However, in a democracy, they are entitled to the benefit of the doubt and the court of public opinion has brought nothing but circumstantial evidence. If this new USAC takes transparency seriously, I think commitments to increasing oversight would be a much needed reassurance.

With regards to the Daily Bruin, I hate being misinformed. So much that if you knew me in real life, you might be able to guess who I was based on how much I insist people go directly to the source material. I understand that journalists are not paid just to report the facts but also to give their opinions. But with that said, many of writers who covered this story let personal politics affect their ability to report the facts first.

There was a sub scandal that I didn't cover in the main story where students alleged that the Daily Bruin deliberately put off reporting on the fee increases as to not bring attention to its negative impacts. Several people^[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/g2ivme/we_are_reporters_of_the_daily_bruin_who_have/fnlqg8n/), ^[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/fxy4rl/usac_is_once_again_trying_to_increase_your_fees/fmz23py/) asked the Daily Bruin to report on the story when it first came out. But it took three weeks for the article to come out and [it came out after voting had already started.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gefbzu/students_now_pay_29457_toward_referenda_fees_each/) While I would like to give them the benefit of the doubt, I wouldn't put it past the editors I know to strategize like this and others were keen to keep track as well

&gt; [But it looks like they never got around to it. How tf could they fail to cover something so substantial? And boy, how convenient was that... considering that they also recently announced that they endorse the fee increase (referendum).](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/gd6c0j/usac_and_spring_elections_megathread_voting_will/fph12sc/)

There was a UCLA student in the comments of the r/SubredditDrama post that said I was being unfair to the Daily Bruin. I openly admit I don't much like the Daily Bruin and agree their opinion pieces hot garbage. But their investigative pieces have been incredibly lackluster as well. Their report on the unaccounted $2.7 million was the best I'd read from them but they failed to report on its connections to concerns of transparency as it relates to the recent election.

Another thing that is incredibly concerning is the lack of south campus representation in USAC and the Daily Bruin. It was pointed out in the comments of the r/SubredditDrama post that the Daily Bruin does employ south campus majors in the stack, their data visualization and tech blog. I spoke to a friend who is a graduated member of the Daily Bruin about this story and they said they weren't surprised. The south campus staffers were not really concerned with campus politics and mostly kept to themselves.

Which leads us to south campus representation in USAC. It's true that internships and research experience is way more valuable careerwise to south campus majors so they don't really bother with USAC. But I hope that changes after this year. The bigger issue is with the USAC establishment denying representation of the south campus perspective, as evidenced by the tweets linked above

&gt; [... my platform will explicitly include banning south campus majors from running for office or voting ...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/ggcoym/_/)

Hyperbole aside, it's disconcerting that people are trying to paint the result of the referendum as a north vs south argument. There is north vs south culture at UCLA which is discussed mostly as a joke but sometimes seriously, e.g. north campus majors are attractive but unhireable and south campus majors are goblins but will be rich, the north side of campus looks beautiful and the south side is trash, etc. But that north vs south culture isn't the reason CUB failed. It's the reason referenda like CUB are allowed to exist to begin with. 

No one is doubting that marginalized communities need our support. But if you read the linked threads and articles, you would have seen dozens of acronyms, CPO, CRC, SIOC, CEC, CSC, SREC^[4], CAC, CTP, AAC, AAP, MO, TLC, UCSA, SWC, CAPS, and more. There is not a single ""run of the mill"" student that can tell you what each of these stand for, what they do, and how some of them are different from each other. I also made one of those up and challenge anyone to tell me which one is fake without looking them up. 

UCLA is a huge school and I get that there needs to be a lot of groups to cater to some large populations. But it's alarming how easily some groups are made to serve a seemingly niche purpose, funded all on the student's dime. If I didn't know any better, I would think that some of these groups were made just to push some esoteric social justice agenda and make resume padders for friends of officials. South campus demands realistic and practical goals, as evidenced by CCI's slate. But when south campus doesn't participate, the runaway north campus effect goes on to create groups after every color of the rainbow spending money on things students don't know about. 

If USAC wants referenda to pass or fail on their own merits, they have to engage the other half of the campus while they're being written. There is no point in north campus throwing referendum after referendum at the student body for it to be voted down after south campus grows tired of increased fees without representation. If USAC wants students to take future referenda seriously, they can't disenfranchise south campus.

USAC, do better.

u/uclaelectionsboard, do better.

u/daily-bruin, do better.

And yet today when we were all supposed to be celebrating, instead we were reminded that no matter how hard you try to rise up and be a leader in society, there will always be people who will be waiting to tear you down because of the body that you were born into.

· Undergrad school/major: T25, top public college (Berkeley, Michigan, UVA, UCLA, UNC, Texas, etc…)

· Other education/coursework: Took some online coursework at target schools. I honestly think this helped a lot because my work experience is hard for an adcom to gauge how I'd do at coursework.

· Demographs: US ORM Male

**Stats**

· GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 770 Q47/V48 (high point of my app) 

· Undergrad GPA: 3.27 (low point of my app, however in my undergrad I graduated with honors (top 15%) because my program is curved to a 3.0 with a narrow distribution).

**MBA Info**

· Goal of MBA:  Transition into Financial Consulting in NY (accepted internship for this summer...supposedly).  I really really also wanted to get out of the Great Plains career-wise, particularly to the Mid-Atlantic. (NY/Phila/DC)  

· Target schools: Rejected after interview at HBS, Admitted w/o $ at Stanford, LBS, HKS (MPA). Admitted w/ 50% at Wharton, Admitted w/ &gt;50% at Fuqua, Instant Ding at Haas (wtf haas) and Sloan. 

**Application Post Mortem**

I didn’t use a consultant and thought it was a great move for me. I have an untraditional background and mixed stats (GMAT/GPA split).  I spoke with a few consultants and I felt they believed less in me than I did in myself. I *did* spend tons of time (months) building relationships with recent alums from the schools, finding them on linkedin, checking in over the months, and getting info about specific events and classes they enjoyed, and alumni activities they’re still involved in. Poured this into my applications, sent my essays to alums for feedback until they said my essays sounded like I was already a member of the community. 

**Regrets and room for improvement:**

1. I spread myself thin (8 apps) and applied all in R1. In retrospect I should have staggered my apps where I hadn’t spoken to as many alums and rushed the essays. Also I started with cities &amp; schools that were prestigious without thinking about what I wanted to do in the long-term first. Could’ve saved myself time &amp; effort on the front-end.  

2. Didn’t practice interviews beforehand – I got better with time, but I stumbled over some obvious questions in my first few interviews. Really enjoyed Wharton’s group interview, even though it was the one I felt most worried about.

3. I didn't apply to CBS and Stern because I was worried about the Cost of Living.   
 NYC prices just seem insane when my baseline has been $600-$800 for a 1-bedroom in my city.  Given that I got more funding than expected, it may have been worth applying.

**Decision**

Chose Wharton because I wanted NYC financial consulting and the branding+location+funding was impeccable. Felt terrible giving up Stanford because it had been my dream undergrad, but I knew I wanted to spend weekends in NYC during recruitment. 

Feel no regrets now, I made some friends at GSB anyway through the process. Philadelphia is a fun city for an MBA student. Really really fun. I also loved the culture at Fuqua and felt like I was drawn to the program above most others – but the distance from NY was a negative for me because it felt harder to justify recruiting there when I had no connection to the region. I’d recommend Fuqua to anyone else, they are amazing.

**Social**

I had a huge “imposter” syndrome starting school, especially when I realized I was the only one from the central US that's not-Chicago. My self-limiting hampered my early social life, and it’s my biggest regret. 

In retrospect, I should’ve spent more time just hanging out and going to all the bars/houseparties/nightclubs without worrying about class and recruiting for the first month. Even the Friday-Night boardgame crew was full of super-friendly extroverts who happened to be boardgame nerds.

**Professional**

Successfully recruited for Financial Services consulting in NY:

· I messed up big on my early applications – didn’t emphasize my consulting-relevant strategy experience and my resume was too full of startup stats and funding milestones. Stupid to think that McKinsey recruiters would care about that for NY finance consulting.

· Wish I had spent more time talking to current consultants / alum consultants like I did with the application process. In general I felt like I put extra effort into the MBA apps and coasted too much on the internship applications. I wish I would’ve spent time before the start of the MBA program talking to MBB and Big Four consultants in New York – it’s a great opportunity to say “hey I’m starting at \[school\] in the fall and want to work for your company in 2 years. What should I focus on doing?” 

· Recruiting for NYC was tough in general – I had lots of competition for MBB from others in my school who were coming from NY offices in other consulting jobs. I felt like I was one of the few who didn’t have prior consulting experience, and it made everything harder. In one interview I literally followed a Wharton guy who was from BCG NY Finance Consulting and was applying to Bain NY Finance Consulting…come on dude, leave some internships for the rest of us.

· Didn’t get acquainted with the career office early on. Should’ve done that before I needed help. Regardless, got a consulting gig in Manhattan that pays really well, even if it's not MBB (\~$168k/yr base).

**Dating**

Unique situation for me that I started dating someone the summer before my MBA who had recently finished Penn undergrad and was the only East Coast person in my Great Plains finance company. We hit it off well after I asked her a lot of Qs about Philadelphia and Wharton -- She’s moving back to Philadelphia and probably also surreptitiously influenced my decision to attend the school lol.

**Real Talk** – dating in MBA programs is super-available, but remember that it’s basically a small insular community so everything you do will be quickly known by everyone else. I love hearing the grapevine gossip but I hate being part of it, so I probably wouldn’t date within my program.

**Financial Aid/Loans**

I was making \~$70k as the top-level analyst at my Midwest firm so no regrets whatsoever. Even when you try to tell people “hey, the Cost-of-Living in my old town meant I was basically making $100k worth of NY-money”, no one in NY would take me seriously pre-MBA. The location was probably the #1 thing for me, coming from so far away, and it would’ve absolutely been worth sticker price for me. 

**Conclusion**

To atypical or non-coastal candidates – SPEND TIME TALKING TO ALUMS! This was by far the most important thing for me. I didn’t like the idea of working with a consultant because I felt my story wasn't typical and they wouldn't be used to it. That being said, I did have literally dozens of people review my applications.  Feel free to ask me any questions!"
ggs48d,14,2020-05-09,I’m going no contact with my mom,PawesomeContent,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ggs48d/im_going_no_contact_with_my_mom/,"I need some advice, I’m drafting my final no contact email. Any suggestions? I’m 17, my mom has schizophrenia and refuses medication, is almost homeless, lives off my dads 700k divorce settlement, and refuses to let me replace my 2010 Nissan Altima, which has been totaled by its transmission. Somehow, she wrote into the divorce settlement that I can’t buy a car without her permission in writing.

Context

I was beaten as a child weekly, my father couldn’t help from work or without pressing charges, but he wanted me to have a mom. She forced an eating disorder on me, force feeding me food, and if I didn’t finish it, she would beat me. She stole money from me to peruse a schizophrenic delusion of a patent, a store selling only off brand bedsheets, knock off purses, and more. She pawned my heirlooms, my grandmother (fathers side) wedding rings, dresses, my father’s father’s high end watches, and gold to fund her spending on pointless items. I’m broken as a person, I’ve survived 3 suicide attempts, and am dealing with the health and social consequences of her imbuing my life with her schizophrenic delusions and crazy actions... I don’t know what do anymore.


X,

That was the last time we will ever speak. You are not invited to my graduation, I’m not giving you a ticket, or invited to be involved in my life from now on. I don’t care how much money you will have someday, or whatever you will provide, you were a terrible mom, still are, and mentally ill. Anything I do in my life is going to be from my work, and not your idiocy, oppression, or mentally ill ideas of the ‘evil people’, or any of your other hallucinations. All you want to do is control, and oppress. I need transportation to school, to work, my internship for college, my volunteer hours. You say, no you can’t have a car to replace the broken one that I left behind. No you can’t continue to your job that you earn more at than I ever did. No you can’t have a social life and can’t go anywhere without inconveniencing someone else.

I’m blocking your email, and your phone number on the home phone. Don’t call again, and emails will be sent to junk. I’m leasing that car when I turn 18, and you’ll never have control of me again. 

Without any remorse

Me

P.S my practice sat score is top 1% of USA, you can’t teach me anything, you can’t even do basic calculus. 



In response to her last email.


I am so glad to receive your phone call today. I am also glad that you have started talking like an adult about car shopping or car repairing. 

I am sorry to hear that the transmission of your car was broken. I am surprised that you have had your own car now. I am sorry that I have missed so much things in your life. Your father has excluded me since the beginning of the divorce, and I didn't have any quarrel with him because I knew that you wanted to stay with your father. 

However, I have always believed that it is not good idea for your to stay with your father all the time. You shall stay with your both parents to have maximum benefits which you can have from your both parents. I don't mean by maximum benefits that you can manipulate anyone for money or meeting your any desire against God's will. But, you certainly can learn a lot about preparing SAT test and the knowledge for live  from your mother and eat healthily by living with me, while you can learn about chemical lab, science and some housework from your father.  Please think about living with me and I can come to pick you up anytime.

As I told you on the phone, buying a new car is not first thing that I would think of, no matter the fact that you will have a nice car from me for your life someday. 

At last, I would be seriously telling you that I will have enough things for you to support you for all your life. However, it doesn't make you look any good when you are spending the money that you don't have to or you are spending more money than you should do. Be smart! Be smart to know how to live smartly.

By the way, I have noticed that you had so-called skills to talk with me about the broken transmission for your purpose by telling me the price of your father's new Volvo price. However, it was not a smart thinking. Therefore, it didn't work.

Think again to make it work - make your thinking working successfully for your life. It means that you need consider what was wrong of your current thinking. 

Write to me if you have any questions.



Fuck her, I’m done. I got waitlisted from an internship I wanted, I got refused on a car, and this sucks."
ggs7y9,2,2020-05-09,Leaving Parents at 26 and going to NYC,MargaritaPizzaPie,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ggs7y9/leaving_parents_at_26_and_going_to_nyc/,"I'm a 25-year old F and I've been living with my parents being a part-time pastry student and I have a side job. I was planning to graduate this fall by taking classes in the summer but those have been cancel due to the pandemic. I had my ups and downs that goes in waves. For my ups, I get to spend more time baking and learning my craft and practice baking and decorating. And my downs are that I feel like my plans have halted and I'm stuck living with my parents longer than I should.

I got back to school at 22 because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and went on soul searching. I found that I love baking and I wanted to pursue that! During the years I've been in school baking! Before I graduate I'll be going to an internship in Disney World, resorts, or other hotels. I don't have much money in the bank right now but when I get the internship I'll save up to about 6 months before I graduate and my parents will lend some to help get me started.

My parents (namely my mom) wants me to work at Disney resorts and want me to save up and rent an apartment near my job so I won't waste any gasses and that they'll help pay for my rent. It's really telling me that my parents don't want me to leave and said I can stay until I'm 30 and it's normal to live with your parents that long in our culture. (We're Latino btw) 

My brother stayed with us until he was 26 and left to NYC and a year later he met his wife and now they are married. I told them my plans that I'll save up money in my current job and get an internship, graduate, and live with my aunt in NYC and work in the Grand Hyatt. They are supportive but EXTREMELY reluctant and they have every right to be because NYC is the epicenter but I know it won't be like that forever. They want me to stay close and be safe. For right now I want to get out of my comfort zone. 

After my brother left, there were tears they missed him greatly but were happy for him nonetheless. I want my parents to be proud of me and I want so badly to make a life in NYC. Make or break I want to see if I can try. I never really learned how to struggle, me being a woman my parents coddled me a lot compared to my brother-- even though they loved us very much I was always their little girl. Oh and I'm disabled too :&gt; so yeah but still, want to see if I can make my own life without my parent's help and be a self-made woman. NYC is a hard city but you know the saying is""if you can make it in New York, You can make it anywhere"". 

And I been their bunches of time because I have family there so I have connections. I don't know if I should stay in Florida where I have everything close by and my parent's support or just headfirst to the iron jungle."

I have been accepted to an EU based MSc Finance (top10/15) and decided to defer for a year (before the Coronavirus became an issue) to take a gap year.

I’m planning to spend a good chunk of the year traveling... hopefully. However, I’m looking for some advice on what I could do to improve my profile for after I complete my MSc.

A bit of background on me:

* Bachelors in finance - semi target UK - very involved in finance and related societies
* Middle office summer internship at bulge bracket
* Study job for 1 year as an analyst in a financial consultancy - mostly valuation and restructuring
* Finished my undergrad and played professional sport abroad for 1 year 
* Native English speaker but fluent in French &amp; Spanish 
* I founded and manage a small business which now has 6 people working in it - not related to finance

Ideally, I would like to use my MSc Finance to move into IBD. 

Given I will have a lot of free time, the options I have been considering are:

1. Taking the CFA Level 1 
2. Completing a CISI qualification
3. Adding some programming skills to my CV
4. Completing an online course in data/analytics

What do you think of these options? Is there anything else I should be looking at?"

This however, has changed ever since my sister came over, since they kind of banned it. To avoid this, I've been waking up at 3 am to play till around 4-5 am and then study till 6 b/c that's when her fiance wakes up and we go for a run. However, they caught me recently and made me stop. It's just really stressful because they make me study all day till I sleep, and playing games has been a way of stress relief and motivation. Their argument is that since my brother was addicted to games in his youth, it distracted him from his studies and he failed a large amount of classes which made him delay many years. They now talk about how he used to work trash jobs, how even though he has a really good job right now, hes going to lose it because he doesn't work super hard. A big difference however, is that he used to play all day and not study at all.  On the other hand, because I've been told that ever since I was a small kid, I've always maintained the high standards for everything academically related. I have done better than my siblings in grades, standardized test scores, course rigor, extra-curricular, but they tell me that I will become a failure in life if I even do anything related to games, like watching twitch or whatever. I don't know. I just feel like I cant do anything I really want, especially with Covid-19, where games are basically the only way I can talk to my friends. I don't know what do in this situation."

The pandemic changed the summer plans of many here at McGill and has left myself and I'm sure many others scrambling to figure out what to do over the coming months. Once my internship was canceled I signed up to 2 summer classes. Both classes end mid-June and keep me somewhat busy at the moment, but when they do end I will have virtually nothing to do, especially if quarantine persists deeper into the summer. 

As a Software Engineering major, I had the idea to work on a large project with other students over the summer. We are currently a handful of engineers (mainly Software and Computer) with experience in mobile and web development. We think it would be great to direct our effort towards some type of organization, charity, or association that could use an engineering team to help them during this difficult time. 

We would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on different tech ideas that we could work on or different charities or even local businesses we could reach out to that might need help. We recognize times have been tough for many and would like to use our time and skill set to help give back.

Wouldn't a personal project in the mobile app development space then be almost required to garner any interest from employers along with quantitative results, e.g. a mobile app that you created in your spare time had X unique downloads in Y months on the Google Play or iOS App Store?

gh3u32,78,2020-05-10,"For the 1st time in my life, i’m being honest with myself",atomic_dumbass,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gh3u32/for_the_1st_time_in_my_life_im_being_honest_with/,"I SPENT THE ENTIRE SCHOOL YEAR TRYING TO CONVINCE MYSELF I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR WHEN IT REALITY I WANTED TO DO FILM PRODUCTION ALL ALONG...or something along those lines. 

Hi, I’m a dumbass. You’re probably wondering how I got into this mess. It all started when I watched Grey’s Anatomy for the first time my freshman year of high school and I thought it would be amazing to be a doctor. It wasn’t until I had an internship this school year, my senior fucking year, with a surgeon that I realized I did not want to fucking be a doctor. At all. 

Now, I know a lot of you may be thinking “it’s okay that you truly learned that you didn’t want to do this &amp; you experienced it all first hand what it would be like so now you won’t have any reason to turn back.” and you would be 100% correct &amp; I agree with that. But i can’t help but feel like I wasted so much time especially during my senior year bc I dedicated all of my classes to science electives &amp; spent hours every week at an internship &amp; doing research for a field I deep down for a long time was beginning to feel like wasn’t for me.

Ever since I was younger, I loved to write and I wanted to be an author. I got into photography during high school and actually became the photographer for my friend’s business. There was nothing in the world that could come close to the way writing and photography made me feel, and I developed this intense adoration for movies and cinematography so much so that I longed to be able to create similar productions.....but I always told myself those would be hobbies of mine on the side when I became a medical professional.

I was applying to colleges for all the wrong reasons. I told myself, “I’m gonna apply to schools that aren’t STEM focused just so I can have the option to change my major if I so choose. huh???? who the fuck thinks that way?! might as well just apply to a bunch of schools undeclared instead of for biology/biochemistry like I was planning on doing. My thought process was already that of “i’m going to plan my escape plan before I even need a reason to escape/before I even begin” and THAT is not how you should approach your future. 

And you know what it took for me to finally be honest with myself? That new show on netflix Hollywood. Now I knowwwwwww this all sounds cliche &amp; stupid but hear me out. If you haven’t watched the show, this may not make any sense to you, but for those of you that have, try to understand how inspiring the story, the characters, &amp; the ending might be for a person like me who has a suffocated &amp; buried interest in everything the show is about &amp; then being told that it is possible to turn that pipe dream into a dream. I’m a black girl from suburbia who lost her mom to cancer two years ago. My biggest goal in life was to become successful to make her proud, but my idea of success was monetary &amp; shoving down a huge part of my identity that was into the arts &amp; creativity. A few months before she died, I told her I was gonna buy my first legit camera &amp; lenses on my own with my own money by the end of the summer because I had just gotten my first, solid job as a summer camp counselor.

And I did. The summer was hard because she had just died and all I wanted to do was to be able to take photos and for her to see them. However, I think a subconscious part of me shoved the full potential of my creativity down because I thought I couldn’t impact the world the same way I could if wanted to become a doctor. 

I haven’t told my family about my decision and I’m honestly freaking out because I know zero about film production and didn’t apply to any schools with a solid film program (besides UCLA but even if I went it would be extremely difficult to change my major to get into that program). I don’t know what I’ll tell my family because it’s a little embarrassing to tell them I actually don’t want to be a doctor but a producer and I don’t think it’ll be received well because my Mom’s siblings and her stepdad were all part of that Hollywood life but want more for me because they think I’m this smart, STEM person when in reality that was just an act I was convincing myself and everyone else I was into. 

Well to sum it up if you’ve made it this far, please be completely honest with yourself. Sometimes it takes time like it did for me. Sometimes it takes one conversation with someone to leave you completely changed. Sometimes it takes introspection or prayer. I would just encourage all of you to really examine why you are pursuing your field of interest. Examine what you are passionate about and for what reasons. What is it about the career you want to go into that makes your heart pound with excitement and inspiration? And if you aren’t excited about what you want to do, why do you think this path is the right one or the only one for you? 

If you have any advice for me, please share lol. I’m feeling a whirlwind of different emotions right now &amp; I’m slightly unsure of what my future will look like for the first time in my life. Some comforting words or tips would be greatly appreciated haha.

Good luck to everyone on their journey!!!

EDIT: For those of you who are interested/care, after much thought today, I’m thinking about pursuing a BFA :) This is soooo different from what my original biochem plan was, but it feels so much more natural. I am nervous as hell about my future but very excited at the same time. I’m slightly intimidated because I only took an entry level photo class my senior year and although it taught me a lot, it was definitely nowhere near as rigorous as the college courses will be. However, I know for a fact that I love photography &amp; will be a quick learner."

I got really lucky in my app results this year and got accepted to a bunch of my dream schools. Essentially my choices have come down to CMU SCS, Berkeley pre-CS L&amp;S, UIUC CS, Georgia Tech CS, and UT Austin CS .

I have already eliminated Berkeley CS cuz don't wanna stress over declaring. 

To be perfectly honest, I can really see myself thriving at Gtech or UIUC as a CS major. I'm wondering, what the actual impact is of going to one of the big 4 CS schools (Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, CMU) over say other top 10 programs (UIUC, GTech, UT, Princeton, Cornell, Waterloo, etc). 

My sister is a senior at UT Austin who has had internships at Google and Dropbox and is joining a rapidly growing unicorn in Silicon Valley next year. She says when working at top companies, everyone who went to a top 10 CS school kinda treats each other with the same level of respect and the people who don't come from top 10 cs are still held in high esteem by other colleagues since they probably needed to do something even more impressive to get in to begin with. According to her I can't go wrong with any of these schools but I'm still unsure. I mean for the big companies I think it makes no difference from what I see on linkedin. 

Other than bragging rights (which i don't really care abt lol), would some prestigious Palo Alto YC / Sequoia backed startup/unicorn or some impressive Chicago or New York HFT overlook someone at Gtech or UIUC for someone at CMU ? I do see a heavy Big 4 and UIUC presence in trading firms and a massive Big 4 and Waterloo presence in top funded unicorns. I would really appreciate your input guys!"

gh6nxr,2,2020-05-10,Advice on liking my close friend?,ZOSAI,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gh6nxr/advice_on_liking_my_close_friend/,"So I am a 22 yr old 6 ft.(1.85 cm) tall, skinny, dark haired pretty normal guy with 2 past considerably serious relationships and I will consider myself a solid 3.5/10. 

And my friend is a 21 year old blonde who is  a very lively and shorter than average girl with no past relationships(as far as I know) and she loves when someone plays with her hair.

So when I first went to university I was in German Teaching but after a year of not being able to focus and struggling with my own problems I changed my thingy (profession maybe) to Tourism and Management. 

And in the first day of my second school I was sitting in class as I always did since the elementary. A hand poked me in my shoulder and asked for a lighter and I gave it so we were friends from then on. 

I can't tell everyday of my 3 years with her but our relationship was steadily getting better and healthy in that period. We have a small group of 5 friends (my and her best friend) and we go to movies, picnics, concerts etc. and we have good times overall. 

That feelings started to develop in me last summer when we did an internship together and has been increasing since. We also started to watch movies at her place (she stays with her friend) and in the last 6 months of watching movies she started asking me to play with her hair. 

She put her head on my lap and I knew that there is a bunch of nerves in the scalp and I practiced some massage things when I was bored back then. Anyway I started doing my thing and she liked it so much and I felt damn good about myself and it happened a dozen times after that we also stayed up talking until sunrise a couple times. 

So in the end I like this my best girl friend and I did that before to another girl and when I confessed she said no and I have this weird rule that I never stay friends with a girl that I liked before cause it hurts everytime I see them and if I see them with another guy things can get ugly. I like her friendship but if I don't say anything I may never will cause this is our last year in college. 

Should I tell her? Should I keep the friend and suffer for a while? 

I really need help universities in my country will open around June 15 and I feel like have to do it soon."

**Background**

· Work experience: 5 years in digital marketing analytics; no official title movement but a lot of high-impact project work to talk about

· Extra-curriculars: recreational athlete and non-profit board post-college

· Undergrad: Ivy League, business+liberal arts double major

· Demographics: Chinese American woman; originally from the Midwest

**Stats**

· GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 740 (49Q, 41V)

· Undergrad GPA: 3.5

**MBA Info**

· Goal of MBA: CPG brand management - more broadly work-life-family balance

· Target schools: Kellogg, Booth, GSB, HBS, Sloan, Wharton - targeting analytics, marketing, and general prestige

**Application Post Mortem**

I bought a couple a la carte hours off a consultant to go over my essays, and felt good about it - my writing style was much more journalistic/narrative, and my consultant helped me get down to business in my writing. The end result was less interesting to read, but much more persuasive as to why I deserved a spot in their class.

I did some outreach with alums of my target schools and had a couple phone calls / lunches / coffee chats, but honestly didn't really know what I was doing with this part and was going through the motions because I had heard that's what you do. I didn't get as much value out of this as I could have.

**Regrets and room for improvement:**

1. Needed more variety in target schools - can't just target M7! Luckily it worked out for me, but it could easily have gone sideways.
2. I was waitlisted at my ""backup"" M7 and accepted (no $$) at my dream school, then checked out of the process. Definitely should've gunned harder at the ""backup"" for pure scholarship negotiating power, especially given current conditions, but hindsight's 20/20.
3. Should've continued cultivating those student/alum relationships initiated out of the application process - what a natural way to continue building your network.

**Decision**

Was easy - got into my dream school, accepted the offer, didn't bother thinking any further than that. Probably should've, but didn't.

**Social**

My plan going in was joining a bunch of structured extracurriculars to meet people in a more ""shared activity"" environment - this ended up working pretty well. I didn't do as many happy hours and off the cuff stuff on evenings and weekends, but I also live with my husband and it was a big priority of mine to still spend time with him. I basically ended up being a business school student from 8 am - 7 pm and then came home to have dinner and hang out with the fam - not a bad deal. Definitely lost out on some socialization, but it's been worth it.

**Recruiting**

I wanted brand management at a traditional big CPG firm because I wanted the general management training ground - owning the P&amp;L - on a more interesting consumer-facing product, plus the hours were good and would allow for a decent work-life balance.

I did a pre-MBA internship at a startup run by an alum of the school and then used that experience to interview for pre-MBA recruiting opportunities. Got a strong CPG brand management offer for the summer and took it.

This fundamentally changed the shape of my business school career, no two ways about it. I didn't spend any of my first year networking and recruiting with companies. I threw all my energy into socializing, academics (ish), and balancing school and life at home, and it's paying dividends in the virtual days because I have a broad network throughout the student body.

I did miss out on bonding with fellow students over shared recruiting stresses - running cases / doing interview prep together / interviewing for the same companies together, etc. - but honestly, that's one bonding experience I can live without.

**~~Dating~~** **SO Relationship**

Maintaining a sense of normalcy in my relationship with my husband was really important to me. As you can probably tell, having balance and not going all in on one thing is the name of the game for me - I didn't go for finance or consulting because I knew I'd never see home again, and I was determined not to let business school take over my life completely.

Turning down school opportunities to protect SO time was **hard**. Turning down time with my SO to do school things was **so hard.** And yet, seeing myself stick to my guns over and over again taught me a really interesting lesson in what my values were.

Caveat: everything's going to shit for virtual school - I have no more boundaries between school and regular life. Don't think this is some idyllic fairy tale I'm trying to weave - ""scope creep"" is so real.

**Conclusion**

Everyone says this, but for real - know exactly what you want to get out of your two years at business school. That strategic priority has to trickle into several tactical choices that you need to think through ahead of time as well - trying that decision in real-time with people (or groupthink) pressuring you in a different direction isn't going to end well for you.

For me, my ultimate overarching goal was work-life balance - this is why I chose CPG for a post-MBA career. To get to work-life balance during school, I was determined to intern/recruit during the summer. I used projects and extra-curriculars to socialize during daylight hours and spent (relatively more) evenings at home with my husband. I took a max courseload of classes when everyone was head's down in recruiting season since no one wanted to just hang out anyways, freeing up future time for either socializing or family time. It wasn't always easy, but I'm really pleased with how this year turned out - even with the conversion to virtual. I'm getting what I wanted out of business school, and that's my metric for success.

Bottom line - Taking two years off from working is a really expensive way to not get what you want, if you're not careful. There are a lot of ways you can tactically execute on whatever your strategic objective is for these two years, but thinking through them ahead of time will save you a lot of waffling, heartache, and distraction."

Graduating next year from a third world country where hardly anyone is doing research relevant to my sub-field. I am fortunate to have 6 months of US research experience during my undergrad, and with another local summer internship I have about 8 months of full time research experience. I know this doesn't make me competitive for top US biomedical science programs. I would love to be better prepared, but at this time I don't believe people would consider hiring foreign RAs. I've made quite a few posts about that in this thread, and everyone said it was highly unlikely.

I'll probably try to join a lab in my country anyway, even if it's not my area, as soon as COVID-19 dies down. I'm not expecting it to make my application any better, apps are due Dec 1 so it'll only be a couple of months of me working there till I submit my application. It'll just be a job till I join a PhD program next fall.

Which is why I feel like I should apply to plenty of low-ranked programs as well, cast a broad net and just deal with the consequences. Who knows, maybe I'll find a great lab in a less known school for my PhD.

It's not that my institution doesn't do research at all, I tried to get involved on two occasions, but it was so on and off due to our hectic schedules and lack of support for research (our uni is focused on getting us placed in companies) that it didn't amount to anything I'm proud of. I list them in my CV and weave them into the narrative of my SOP, but they don't do much beyond that. I didn't gain any useful skills, and I don't have much to talk about regarding them. I wish I could have afforded undergrad in the US or some country where there would be more opportunities for me to prepare for grad school.

Apologies for the rant, been feeling kind of down this week with all the uncertainty. Do you guys have other suggestions where I can get research experience in my field and still pay my bills? Thanks in advance.

Another option I was thinking of doing is to get the iPad Pro for now and wait to get a new computer in 2021. I could continue using my current Air for now, but not sure if the iPad Pro would fit my needs or if it would be worth it.

I've developed a good understanding on universal coding/can switch between languages when needed. I've also developed a good understanding on OOP. I've seen many freshmen programs don't require much coding experience, but I thought it would at least give me an advantage if I tried to get ahead seeing my highschool didn't offer APCSA or any of that. Ive been trying to find ways to stand out by thinking of a few projects I could work on with this basic knowledge I have, but I'm unsure as to what my projects must be about?

I have had 2 internships in high school, so I came into college confident that I would be able to find a summer internship. After apply to probably 80+ internships, I got rejected from virtually every one (the only one I progressed to the final round for got cancelled due to corona) and I am really doubting my CS skills now. I am kind of scared because I am on track to graduate a year early, so this would have been my second to last internship. I am honestly really stressed, and I am getting good grades and learning a lot, but it never seems to be enough as people are always throwing questions that I can't solve in optimal time, or mess up in some other way. It's even more discouraging to see my other freshman friends who are similarly qualified get multiple internship offers, and I can't even get a single one despite being ""ahead"" and able to graduate in 3 years (a distinction that I made on my resume albeit fairly late which many recruiters didn't see). Does anyone have any advice for what to do?"
ghb1s0,224,2020-05-10,How the fuck does someone like to go to college!?,[deleted],CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/ghb1s0/how_the_fuck_does_someone_like_to_go_to_college/,"After finishing a bachelor's in math and currently finishing a master's in applied math, I can say that, without a shadow of a doubt: college is LITERALLY the worst fucking thing to waste our money and time on. At the beginning of my college days, I was stupid enough to believe that ""college was going to be the best years of my life"" and that ""I would be learning with the best professors in the country"" (my bachelor's holds the title for ""best math course in the country"" where I live in). It sounds like people are paid to boast the college they were in because my college was literally the biggest clusterfuck LMAO.

I had around 20 different teachers but only 4-5 of them actually took the time to make sure we learned the material as best as we could. The rest? One of them forced us to TEACH THE FUCKING MATERIAL! Yes, literally he told us that ""I'm not in the mood to come to class and start yammering about the material, here's a list of topics you'll be presenting""; other couldn't give less of a shit about us, she didn't teach us anything, only gave us books to get the material from and never responded to our emails when we had any issues with our learning.

And don't even fucking get me started with the ""but college teaches you how to learn, you have to go get things on your own, in the job market no one's going to teach you anything"". If college is all about learning by ourselves,what the serious fuck are teachers doing there, you fucking idiot!? They're supposed to give us the necessary tools in order to learn more efficiently, which doesn't fucking happen. And most jobs need specific skills that you'll learn there, you normally go through a internship and people actually take the time to guide you until they deem you can be autonomous enough, because guess what: NOT EVERYONE IS A FUCKING GENETICALLY MUTATED, SELF-TAUGHT GENIUS, EVEN EINSTEIN AND NEWTON HAD SOMEONE EXPERIENCED GUIDING THEM. STOP BEING A BUNCH OF FUCKING IDIOTS, PLEASE!?

Even though most of the things you learn in college are meant to teach you problem-solving and other soft skills, the way that they're thought totally defeats the goddamn purpose. Instead of teaching stuff in a way that we'll understand and apply them to exercises and further work on real-life projects, no, you're studying things you half know of so you can regurgitate them on an exam and forget them when (or if) you'll use them again. Outdated courses are also an issue but that's a rant for another day. The only positive aspect of this expensive shitshow is the friends we make along the way, otherwise it would be an useless and painful piece of shit of a process we all go through if we don't want to starve to death.

And fucking hell, man, it ruined my self-confidence, my brain ""jams"" when I try to learn anything, my potential is being squandered, I fell into a horrid depression which I'm still trying to get rid of. If college are the best years of your life, I might as well get cancer if it's all downhill from here, right? Or the people who say that ""college years are the best"" are the ones who peaked there, just like with high school? Here's some food for thought...

Feel free to tell me that ""I don't deserve to have a master's"" and that ""I'm in for a rude awakening when I get a job"", I don't give a goddamn shit, I hate college and I can't wait to be done with it LMAO

EDIT: I'm talking about MY experience in a specific college, on a specific degree. If your college experience was completely different from mine, I'm glad you didn't have to go through hell, like I did. My experience is still valid and I'm not generalizing or hating on you because college were your best years, if you feel offended by this post that's on you. Try not to invalidate my experience just because my college doesn't match with the good times you had in yours, it makes you look like an idiot, try to be more empathetic with people who were unlucky in their college, as the ""best years of your life"" generalization is just that, a goddamn generalization..."

I'm a 21 year old college junior majoring in Computer Science. I'm at the point in my college career where I want to have an internship to get some good job experience. I knew of this last year and informed my boss (who also happens to be my brother) that I would not be working with him this summer. I also told my parents about that and they seemed generally happy. Now I have an interview lined up for an internship I really want at a place that refurbishes and rebuilds computers and servers. I am taking a bit of a pay cut assuming I get hired as an intern and I am okay with that. The only thing is now my parents and my brother (boss) are all trying to persuade me to not pursue the internship. They're main reasoning is that I need to make as much money in between semesters as I can, but I feel that this job experience is going to be very helpful in my future. 

I'm not necessarily asking for a computer genius to help me with this, I just want some general input."

That promises went down to drain when Trump declared national emergency on Friday, March 13. Then on Monday the 16th around 9am.

I am a senior studying Mathematics and Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Philosophy, and I was wondering if any experienced members know of a career path / graduate program I could pursue that aligns with my interests and background.

I have industry experience in an internship within the defense sector (rocketry), and I found that it wasn't as fulfilling as something that may be more theoretically-oriented or people-related (since I sat at a desk all day analyzing launch vehicles). With this in mind, I realized that I have *always* done better in my abstract-oriented classes in my Math major and Philosophy minor courses. I genuinely enjoy these x1000 more than my engineering classes because they're more enticing, enjoyable, and satisfying to learn. However, I don't want to waste my engineering background and efforts on a career path that deviates from STEM or something technology related.

With that in mind, does anyone know of a way for me to pursue an avenue within the STEM field that encompasses these interests, experiences, and education?

\- Abstract / theory oriented, 'big picture' focused, visionary  
\- Philosophically inclined, people driven, service to others  
\- Within the STEM field, can be anywhere around the world, **lots** of learning

I have been suggested a PhD in Philosophy with an emphasis on the ethics of engineering technology, a professor of mathematics, or conducting research at CERN or somewhere in the US. However, I was thinking of maybe pursuing a PhD in Computer Engineering with a focus on AI since it seeps into things like psychology, consciousness, and other meta-things that I love. Any thoughts?"

I am a rising senior with a BS in Aerospace Engineering, BS in Mathematics, and a minor in Philosophy. After an internship experience in the Aerospace industry, I realized that Aerospace may be too far from my actual interests and passions. I am generally very theory-oriented with a love for learning (as exhibited by education), and I can't see myself in the Aero industry for more than 5 years. I know it was just an internship and a small glimpse of what's out there, but I'd like some new advice.

Would it be possible for a student with a background in Aero and Math to pursue a PhD in Computer Engineering? I was thinking of maybe pursuing this since I think researching / developing AI would seep more into my philosophical interests along with my STEM focus. I enjoy things like philosophy and psychology equally as much as math and physics, but I'd like to pursue something that is people-oriented and helps actual people rather than building rockets. Is there something in the industry that enables me to pursue something similar along these lines? I really just want to be a service to people without discarding my education in STEM entirely while also feeling satisfied in a continual learning process. 

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you."

Now I have also gained JAVA and Python Expertise by doing courses but I know its not the same as actually working in real life.

What are my options here? I need suggestions. Also should I go for internships first or apply for jobs directly? Or should I do courses for now? Or should I just leave it all and become a singer I dream to be (@saifmusic96) can find me on Insta? 🤣

I noticed that almost all jobs are for technical programmers and developers and rarely any that are related to my degree which are entry level. I need suggestions and guidance since time is running out. Also Covid19 is a thing so things are going pretty slow.

I graduated last year from a top tier college in the US. While my primary major was Finance, I decided to add a CS double major my Junior year after taking a programming class and finding it interesting. It took a lot of work to finish up a second major in a short amount of time and as a result, I didn’t delve into the field as much as I wanted to with my only resume worthy projects being the short ones that I did in class (many of which I struggled through).

The problem:
While I have internship experience in investment banking, I realized that I’d rather be working in CS. My goal is to start out in SWE and work my way into a PM role. My dilemma is that my resume isn’t particularly geared towards CS and my very limited experience in the field comes only from class work. I certainly wouldn’t consider myself as proficient as my friends who were hired into the industry. I figured that I’d likely be better off honing my skills and gaining more knowledge before entering the job market.

I don’t know whether I should do this by applying to graduate school or going through a coding boot camp such as Hack Reactor or Fullstack Academy which I would almost certainly do remotely.

I have heard that bootcamps are looked down upon in the industry but in my case, it would be combined with the fact that I went through an undergrad CS program. A CS graduate degree seems like a large time commitment and I would probably have to start next Winter or Fall based on admission timelines. I can get through a boot camp in the next few months but I’m worried about the job prospects that would come from it.

Any advice as to which route I should take would be much appreciated"

2- Do you recommend making a software project? 
I have one that I'd love to implement to make my life easier, but not sure if this is the best way to spend time versus studying, coding problems and preparing interviews for more time. Also, I did several internships on my thesis' topic.

3- Do you have any recommendations on things that are worth to study vs things that are not important?
Given the timeline I want to make it as efficient as possible.

4- Do you recommend any specific resource to help with this transition? 
So far I'm going through some coursera algorithm videos and having fun in codewars.

5- Any idea on what to expect in salary? Given that I have internship experience and academic research experience. Would I go to the very lower entry level? Planning to apply to a FAANG first.

I'm an intern at a major Asian player that wants to use satellite imagery techniques to optimise its agriculture business (wheat, rice etc.)

I'm required to carry out a feasibility study to help them decide on the entry strategy. From my initial understanding, I'll be required to objectively establish that the move will be profitable in the long run. However:

1) A lot of the foreseeable benefits (yield estimation, irrigation/fertilizer service optimisation, higher quality yield etc.) are subjective and I'm finding it hard to quantify the associated benefits.

2) I tried looking for parallel companies that have adopted satellite techniques which I can benchmark this against, but I'm unaware of how to go about procuring that data.

3) My mentor is extremely busy and owing to the current WFH scenario, I'm able to establish contact only on a weekly basis. 

I don't want to wait around for brainstorming sessions with my mentor because chances of having one look extremely bleak at the moment. I've been picking my brain for days and would be extremely grateful for ideas/suggestions on how I could go about doing this.

gho5ea,3,2020-05-11,Career realization,mnoble0902,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/gho5ea/career_realization/,"Good morning, 

I'm going to do my best to make this clear and to the point. Sorry for the long post.

I work in the video production field. Specifically, I am an editor. I've been at the same place since 2009 when I started as an intern. I am now a contractor. I have been hoping for a regular, full time position since about 2014, but that has not happened. 

Here is where it gets confusing. During the last 10 years, I have had thoughts where I did not want to do video production as a career, and I have tried to find avenues out. Recently, though, I have realized it is not the career that I dislike. It is the place I work. It has negatively impacted my desire to be in the field. In fact, I changed my major in college; I have an Associates in film production and a Bachelors in an unrelated area. At one time, I wanted to be a director. I wanted to make movies. Point blank, my job ruined that desire. My skill set, unfortunately, has remained pretty much the same. I have learned new software and skills, but what I know is all I need for where I work. I think a large part of that is because of the mind numbing work and to me, the lack of value in it. It is mundane. Outside of work, I did a piece for a friend last year. While I was working on it, I realized I was making it look like something I do at work, and it was upsetting. 

I think this is the difference between my co-workers and myself. My co-workers have great jobs, no doubt. They are content though. I have never been content with simplicity. I need something exciting and interesting.

Recently, I got my camera out again, started shooting random things, editing them, and having a good time while doing it. I want to keep doing this. I used to watch shows and movies and dissect them. I have been doing that again. It feels like my desire is coming back. Here is the problem though. I do not have a film degree. Even with my 10 years of experience, a film degree is still required. 

Now for the main question. Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions about what I have said? Maybe someone that is in or has been in a similar situation. I would like to hear anyone's opinion. 

Thank you very much!!"
ghodpv,76,2020-05-11,"Graduated from maths and physics, considering data science but feeling lost.",[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ghodpv/graduated_from_maths_and_physics_considering_data/,"Graduated with a 2:1 in a dual-honours master's in maths and physics last year. My thesis was in quantum computing. Most people from the course have gone into teaching, finance or research. I always thought I'd go into highly theoretical research as that was what I was interested in, but after learning and thinking more about the real problems in the world I've become disenfranchised with that and want to do something more applied that can help make real change. 

Originally I was considering PhDs in physics but wasn't able to find anything that suited me. Now I'm thinking about doing a postgrad master's in data science, for 2 years starting this autumn. Not sure about it and no idea what I want to do afterwards, but it gives me more time to think and I feel like it'd probably put me in a good position for whatever that is. I can get proficient in my third language at the same time. 

I'm skilled in technical stuff, doing analysis and understanding complex systems generally - in the sciences, maths, computing, economics etc. I love learning. Not particularly good with people. Stereotypical stuff. 

Although data science has long been a hobby of mine, I haven't done much formal learning in the area so my knowledge is a bit discordant. Did an internship where I built production systems which was a very insightful experience but since I was only one of two people in the building who understood the field, it didn't really help from the formal perspective. My knowledge in computing generally is almost entirely self-taught so I have significant gaps, and my code can be up to production standard, but often isn't. There's a lot of stuff I'd need to catch up on but if I can commit to this degree it seems doable over the next 4 months or so.

My internship put me off corporate work: not sure how much work there is in NGOs or whatever in the field. I don't care about money but want to solve interesting problems and help people or animals or something. 

Hoping for some advice or maybe ideas of other paths I haven't considered."

As part of my PhD, I spend a few months in a company who also funds me. I am entitled to a little bit more than 13 days of holiday which I have not cashed out yet.

Because of the whole coronavirus, etc. I have been working from home but it has not really affected my work as they moved lab equipment, pc, essentials etc to my home. Also, there’s no point (for me) to cash on the holidays as I wouldn’t really get to travel or do much right now. 

Instead I was thinking of cashing this in towards the end of my internship; so in a way, I would finish ~13 days earlier than my end date. This would work well because I wouldn’t have to worry about paying next month’s rent as I would move back to my original home with parents. These 13 days I can use to any last things for eg. Packing up, flight ticket, etc and then basically leave at exactly the end of the month.

I have a feeling this would be a little unprofessional, I’m not sure why. It does not feel right (in terms of the internship) and If it isn’t, I don’t want to leave on a bad note or give bad impressions as they have helped me a lot. My question is, would this be normal?

Thanks!"

I'm a rising senior majoring in computer science and economics at a semi-target school. While I have a good academic background and some decent experience doing research at my university, I've procrastinated on finding a specific career path I'd like to follow post-grad and mostly dabbled in random internships my past two summers. I have always been interested in real estate though and have some minor internship/research experience in the field which helped me secure an internship at a real estate private equity firm this summer. 

 I'm hoping to learn some light real estate modeling, but will probably be doing more due diligence and research. Anyways, I've been taking more finance classes lately and have found that I really enjoy it. However, given that I'll likely be doing more qualitative due diligence this summer and that I have little experience in finance, I'm wondering how I should prepare myself for full time recruitment next fall if I'd like to work in finance (real estate or not).   I understand I'm fairly late to the game and probably should have recruited for heavier finance internships this summer, but I'd appreciate any tips from reading recommendations to networking advice.

Thanks!"

ghufkl,3,2020-05-11,Guide to becoming an ML engineer?,[deleted],cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/ghufkl/guide_to_becoming_an_ml_engineer/,"Hello everyone!

I have come to learn that becoming an ML engineer might just be the career I want after working as a research assistant for over a year in a similar capacity. 

I will be joining the University of Manchester for my MSc and hope to find employment somewhere in Europe as a Junior ML engineer or similar upon graduation. However, I’m worried if I’ll be considered by employers. 

My experience is something like this: I worked part time as a full-stack dev for a year before converting to full time in the same position and working in the role for 6 months. After that, I joined my professor’s research group as a dev/engineer (I was in charge of building the software using ML models and cloud, finding the right model to use, finding solutions to scale it up etc. ). But the work experience isn’t really structured, it’s more like a group of friends who meet, and decide what to do, and keep at it and brainstorm until one of the ideas work. 

My graduation project was a cloud-based face recognition system (which again, involved a good amount of ML)

But this is it. Apart from a few side projects (twitter sentiment analysis and the like), I don’t really have any significant ML experience in a professional environment. 

What should I do to improve my chances and fit for this role? Should I simply apply for ML internships, or is my profile enough to be considered for junior level roles directly? Also, should I remove the full stack position on my CV when applying for jobs? (I’m wondering if it’ll highlight my relative inexperience in ML when compared to web dev)

P.S. I have also completed two online courses (ML by Andrew Ng and ML A-Z on Udemy) in case it’ll help your answer. 

Thanks in advance!"
ghug4g,1,2020-05-11,"Changing careers - part time work, Bachelor's requirement, best certs??",RemoteCity,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/ghug4g/changing_careers_part_time_work_bachelors/,"So, I need to change my career. Sorry if this question gets asked all the time, thank you for your time in answering. My ultimate goal would be to pick up a side hustle I could do 1-4 days/ week, but I'm willing to work fulltime for a couple years to get started. (Question 1: do part-time careers like that exist?)

IT is attractive to me because I've always been good with computers, taught myself to program in elementary school for fun. I haven't done a lot with it in the past 5 years though and I know I'd need to work hard to gain a real skillset, because there's so much ""yeah I'm good at computers"" talent in the world these days and that's not enough to get a job. Not trying to diminish the hard work and training that goes into IT career.

I never went to college (did vocational training instead) and I can't imagine taking on that debt. I've been comparing various certifications, considering A+ or salesforce. But, is a cert useless without a degree or experience? How do I get experience and escape the catch-22 of breaking into a new industry? I could make some personal projects to pad the ol resume...  or unpaid internship?

I think web design would be my ideal job - I have a background in graphic design and I build websites for friends/local businesses when I get the chance, I love the combination of functional UI, graphic design, SEO, etc. It's satisfying to finish a project too (rather than network maintenance... forever). But I really don't want to freelance, I've done that before and the grind kills me. With the growing popularity of squarespace, wix, etc, I have to imagine this job is shrinking anyway.

I'm very anaytical and like building efficient, automatic systems. I have great communication skills. When I read about salesforce admin I feel like that's the job I'm supposed to have, but I feel like I'm starting too late. I'm sure that market is more saturated than they pretend anyway.

To be honest I live in a very big tech city, so I think I might just be wasting my time trying to get a job around here when there's so many people more qualified than me but not quite able to break into the local big leagues. I was looking at jobs in my area and it seems like most of them require a Bachelor's, all of them require experience, and they're all fulltime 40-60hrs/wk. Lots of jobs posted though, great pay and benefits.

I know I sound wishy-washy; please give me a good strong dose of reality. I'm desperate here, I need to change. Thank you."

ghwazg,2,2020-05-11,Should I get my masters in Digital Humanities before a PhD in English?,Aieles,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/ghwazg/should_i_get_my_masters_in_digital_humanities/,"I recently graduated with a bachelors degree in English-Literary and Cultural Studies and am applying for grad school for the fall of 2021. I have no interest in an MFA, so I've always planned on applying to PhD programs right away. However, the more I learn about the digital humanities field, the more I wonder if it would be smart to get a masters in that prior to my PhD in English. My goal is to be a professor one day. 

I have a fairly strong interest in digital tech- I built my own computer as a kid, learned some front-end development in my free time, and worked as a digital marketing intern throughout college. So I think I would be a good fit for a digital humanities program. I also took one Shakespeare class in undergrad that had a digital humanities focus and I enjoyed it. But I don't especially want to be in school for an extra two years if it won't help me much with my career. 

I was a very strong student in undergrad and the conversations that I've had with my professors/advisors have made me optimistic about the likelihood of getting accepted into a PhD program without an MA first. But would it help my eventual job prospects to have a degree in Digital Humanities as well? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Besides this, my background in IT has been that I have been tech-savvy with everything, but I don't have much professional experience behind it. I had an internship for 2 years at my old high school being ""IT Support"" for the school and besides that I have an active A+ since 10th grade and renewed it once already, and I have studied for a Network+ certification, and know maybe 1/3rd of a security+, my plan was to get those certifications as soon as possible, I know CompTIA isn't going to change my life with having these, but its what I got for now...

In my past I have tried to get an IT role job but based on where I live (Virginia Beach) a lot of places have required security clearance eligibility, and I was too demotivated on looking further after getting a job not knowing this fact, and then being told a US Citizenship was required after being told that I got the job, with them going cold afterward. This issue is resolved now I was able to obtain citizenship about 10 months ago. 

I have interests in Cybersecurity/Cloud Computing, and feel like if I had to pick one 6 digit ""fancy"" endgame job it would be one of those 2, but as I said I'm not some kind of advanced person as of yet, but I know its kind of a hard path and know nobody just gets that within early career moves, but I think I would potentially have the capability of maybe one day mastering that (not like computer science things, I can't ever see myself doing any type of computer science stuff on a large professional scale)

My current job situation is pretty good, I am a independent contractor alongside being a part time salesperson and pre-corona I was making some really good money and I enjoyed doing it, but the ceiling of potential income is already pretty much hit and i see no growth in that, and since it's all demand based I don't ever see myself want to rely on the income of that. 

I looked into my options, and my attempt would be to spend the first few weeks out of school organizing my life around, while collecting the generous unemployment benefits, and trying to finish that network+/security+ part time studying thing I have been doing, and then trying to find jobs afterwards. 

I also have considered going back to school so i get another year of not having to face this inevitable getting into a profession while i get a masters in cybersecurity, but I don't think its wise spending another $20k for something that will just delay this situation. 

What should I be doing? and if i do start looking for jobs what titles would I want to aim for? I know the words ""helpdesk"" have come around a lot here, but is there another way?"

I am a Brazilian civil engineering student who has spent the last three years struggling with everything I have to get a place for a double degree program at the École des Ponts (France). It is one of the most traditional and respected civil engineering institution in the world and it has been my dream to study there. Fortunately, I was able to be approved in the first place for the selection process, which guaranteed me a scholarship from the government of my country. 

I was ready to move to France in August when the pandemic came and changed everything. As you may know, the current government of my country is run by a fanatic who not only denies the pandemic but science as a whole. Investments in university education in Brazil are worse than ever. So a few days ago I received the news of the suspension of my scholarship for an indefinite period of time and with the risk of definitive cancellation. The scholarship would be worth 1000 euros a month, which, due to the price of my country's currency, which is plummeting more and more, currently corresponds to the value of a salary of a graduated engineer employed in a good Brazilian company. 

Therefore, I come to the community of engineers and engineering students looking for suggestions and advice on how I can finance my studies. I look for scholarships and government programs, but also partnerships with engineering companies. I've heard of cases where companies have been willing to help with student expenses, as an investment in a future employee. At Ponts, for example, students have the possibility to spend 12 months doing internships in some company, in France or in another country, which usually result in future employment. 

Could someone help me or guide me? I am very motivated and hard-working and I am really willing to make my dream come true, despite the difficulties that have been imposed. 

Thank you very much."

I’ve been learning programming languages on my own since middle school and got much more serious about coding in college. I’ll soon be starting a software development internship with an F500 company which I’m pretty excited for. However, my parents’ enthusiasm does not match my own to say the least. My dad is a lawyer and my parents badly want for me to follow in his footsteps. However, for now, I wish to continue going down my current career path. And even if I decide at some point that software development isn’t for me, I still don’t have a desire to be a lawyer. Lately, the conflict between my parents and I about my future has grown even stronger since I graduate in a year and they’re talking about LSAT prep. Yes, really. Even after telling them in the simplest terms that I don’t want to attend law school, they’re still deluded into thinking that I’ll be studying for the entrance exams.  

I love my parents deeply and they’ve done so much for me, which makes their behavior right now all the more disappointing. They’re acting like I want to be a circus clown or something silly like that. They were so much more supportive of me exploring my interests and deciding what I wanted to do when I was younger. I don’t understand. It’s becoming painful but at this point, all I can do is go about my life in a way that make me happy and leave them to accept the reality on their own terms."

So I just graduated from college with a BS in CS. I've been with my current company for about a year as an intern. At the end of last summer, I was offered 76K in a low cost of living area. I had planned to teach English abroad for a year for myself. I told my company my plans and they said that I could accept this offer and have the start date moved or I could stay an intern through the next summer and accept an offer then.

They said I'd be getting a new offer at the end of this summer regardless of whether I accepted this one, so I decided to reject it just in case other opportunities came up. Well, since COVID has hit, I'm not going to teach abroad, and I've decided to begin my career. All my coworkers have encouraged me to apply to other jobs in town so I can negotiate.

I've only gotten one response (probably due to COVID but who knows) and I had three interviews with different sectors within their company. From what it says online, the new company starts out at about 74K and doesn't have great 401K options. My current company's 401K options are about average for the industry.

I haven't asked my current employer to be promoted to full time yet. Since the new company's starting pay will likely be less than I was previously offered, I'd likely have to ask them for more before asking my current employer for more.  Because of lockdown and me basically having to ask for a promotion at my current company, I'd love some advice for handling this in the most professional way possible. Thanks!"
ghz9tc,0,2020-05-11,"I was supposed to go to Miami for internship, paid housing for $1175 (1 month rent, 2 mos. security deposit) with 7 other people, got denied a visa, supposedly roommates don't want to refund me the money. What can I do?",vividdreamer04,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ghz9tc/i_was_supposed_to_go_to_miami_for_internship_paid/,"Hi everyone! The title basically explains my dilemma but I can give more specifics if that will help you understand my situation. 

I'm a college student from Philippines who applied for an internship in a hotel in Miami, Florida last May 2019. We were assisted by an international agency that is affiliated with our university &amp; the people who got accepted from my uni asked me if I wanted to share housing with them as it'd be cheaper and convenient for everyone. The apartment has only 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths and I know 8 people is quite a lot but it's normal for exchange students to squeeze in a small apartment to save money.

Basically 5 of them had a starting date set for September and the rest is for October. Although we didn't have the same starting date, I agreed as I was told that I don't have to worry about the first month's rent. 

Fast forward, those five were granted a visa and bound to leave in 2 weeks. I was surprised because they are asking us to make a down payment urgently even though they said that we didn't have to. They explained that the down payment for the housing is quite high and they needed our share so they can get the apartment and also so they can guarantee that we still have the slot for the housing. 

I paid the down payment to avoid any conflicts and in hope that in a couple of weeks I will be getting my visa too. Unfortunately, I wasn't granted a J-1 visa and 2 more people from our group. It was devastating as I know I'm qualified but I had to accept it &amp; move on in our life. 

Now it has been 8 months and they still haven't refunded the money. We were expecting them to give at least the 2 months security deposit. I asked one of them yesterday if when can we get the money and apparently since their internship got terminated they had to go home and so they had to terminate the contract for the housing too.

Apparently the owner said they had to pay 2 months worth of rent, but instead of paying they used the security deposits. So now they are saying that since they couldn't get the security deposit back, they couldn't give us any refund. 

Can anyone give me an advice on how should I handle this since technically we weren't even listed in the contract as tenants, and second I feel like it's their responsibility to pay off the termination fees since they are the one who used the apartment and we just helped them to get it in the first place. Do I have any legal rights? Or if not how can I negotiate with them? Thanks in advance!"

gi00nw,85,2020-05-11,[IWantOut] 20F Student New York City-&gt;Mexico City,TaraTheCreator,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gi00nw/iwantout_20f_student_new_york_citymexico_city/,"I'm a student finishing up my junior year of college in New York City. I love NYC because I'm close to my family, it has great public transportation, beautiful architectural aesthetic, and a vibrant/diverse immigrant culture. However, I can't imagine myself settling down here. The winters are miserable and everyday is cloudy more than half the year. I dread going outside when its below 50 degrees (F) and the grayness makes me feel depressed. This past winter was super mild here and I still could barely stand it. I spent my whole life in upstate NY where its even colder so its not a matter of acclimation. Besides the weather, I'm not a huge fan of the type-A environment that exists in a city like New York that is so competitive as well as the extremely high cost of living. Everyone I know outside of school that grew up there work crazy long hours with a freelance side-hustle on top of a 9-6. I just feel like its so difficult financially to live here that people spend all of their waking hours working and no one has time to really enjoy life. I've looked into other cities in the US that I might potentially like to live. I considered San Diego, Oakland, Miami, and DC but none of them seemed like the right fit for me.

A few months ago I spent a couple weeks in Mexico and I loved it. Mexico City seemed to have all the things I loved about NYC, but with perfect weather, a more laidback vibe, and lower cost of living. After doing more research, I learned that Mexico also has affordable healthcare (something I currently don't have access to in the US) and a large American expat community.

I'm majoring in sociology and will likely end up with a minor in Latino/Latin American studies. With graduation approaching, I've been thinking really hard about what I want to do as a career and grad school (because you can't do much with a BA in sociology) and I can't decide. I like sociology enough to maybe go into research in the field but I would rather just do a masters than commit to a long process of getting a PhD. I also chose to study sociology because its flexible with very broad range of career options (with a masters degree). I could go into social work, law, business, public policy, academia, government, sales, and more. Careers I'm most interested in are the following (*somewhat in order of what seems most appealing right now but it fluctuates every few weeks*): city planning, nonprofit/NGO work, diplomat, research, social work, and school guidance counselor. With everything that's going on in New York with the virus atm, I think it would be nearly impossible to get an internship in any of these fields to try one out. And between school during the day and working as a barista at night to cover living expenses, I probably wouldn't have time anyway unless it was paid (most are not).

So with that overly detailed background info out the way, I'm wondering what the best steps would be for me to take to move to Mexico City given my unique situation. Should I go to grad school in Mexico? Which of the career options that I'm interested in has the best employment prospects in Mexico particularly as an American. I'm willing to get TESL certified to teach English for a year first to get my foot in the door but I absolutely do not want to teach longterm. If I did go the grad school route, how can I support myself while I'm in school? I'm having a hard time finding this information online so any advice someone could give me would be really appreciated.

Also, I have a good foundation in Spanish and think I could be conversational with a couple months of immersion in Mexico. I'm a lot better at reading/writing in Spanish than speaking and understanding Spanish spoken to me. I've been spending time refreshing myself on vocab I learned in high school and watching Spanish language shows with spanish subtitles to train my ears. I also listen to a lot of Puerto Rican reggaeton/trap music.

**EDIT: So I am also interested in Barcelona and a couple people were able to give information on moving there. Does anyone know anything about Mexico?**"

gi0urj,2,2020-05-11,Why don't more people choose boot camps over a four-year degree?,IVEBEENGRAPED,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/gi0urj/why_dont_more_people_choose_boot_camps_over_a/,"Earlier, I was reading a thread where a CS major was complaining about all the superfluous classes they had to take for their degree. The thread had plenty of debate on each side, but there were many people asking why they had to take so many math classes, theory classes, and G.E.'s without learning more practical skills. The thread got me wondering, why don't more people who would rather learn practical skills over all of this do boot camps or specialized programs?

Here's my background: senior CS major, interning at a great non-big-N company, absolutely loved college. My favorite classes were statistical ML and compilers, I enjoyed my math and theory classes and I got lucky and found an internship working on NLP algorithms where I use stats and linear algebra every day. My friends are the opposite: most of them either have rich parents who wanted them to do college and STEM as a status thing, or they picked a major that sounded cool and ended up in CS. Most of them hate all their classes, want to do web dev and nothing else, and constantly complain about college and how useless it is.

I get it: at least in the US, college is a huge status symbol for white collar workers. But if you know you want to do web dev or a similar specialized low-theory field, why not save thousands of dollars and three years of your life to do a program that teaches you that? I know that CS majors have really good job prospects, but it seems like having three extra years to start your career (and get paid instead of paying for school) makes up for this. For those of you finishing your degrees, would you have done the same thing if you could go back in time four years?"

gi3who,147,2020-05-12,"I’m a senior, I hate BU, and it’s time to admit it",gegenbanana,BostonU,https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/gi3who/im_a_senior_i_hate_bu_and_its_time_to_admit_it/,"Most of this is temporary anger at final grades for this semester compounded by mounting 2-month levels of stress due to the fucking tragedy that was this semester due to the pandemic, but as a graduating senior I’m not gonna kid to myself anymore that BU has big fucking problems that seriously weight down students and that the administration could not seem to care less about. Yeah, I know I’ll get over the anger and stress of this semester. But my biggest shame is lying to myself year after year that BU is better than the criticism that people correctly give it.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m so glad I got an education, and I’ve had fun at BU, and I have a reasonable path going forward even in spite of the pandemic. But that education has at the same time seriously held me back in so many ways, and I seriously wonder if I would have been better off elsewhere. BU has absolutely damaged my sense of self-worth because of fucked up grading policies in STEM or intro courses that chip away at respectable and especially minimum GPAs for fellowships and grad programs. It has seriously numbed me to any sense of school spirit or school pride because we do not integrate a diversified athletics into our school identity, only hockey, or any other sense of centralized community. I have no pride for BU, at all. The campus itself feels fractured and segregated, and lacking any unified cohesion other than just running along Comm Ave. Even going around campus sometimes feels like a struggle against a bizarre campus architecture.

To cut to the chase, I never felt like the CAS or general administration wanted to create a truly unified university, but rather focus on elevating the school’s image through manipulating as many disparate parts as it could, and to selectively present its strengths to outsiders. And I feel like students just fell through the cracks I feel so sorry for those that I know and who have struggled way more than I have.

And I cannot be the only one who wants to fucking punch a window when they hear all this bullshit about BU going up in the rankings. It’s pathetic. If you’re a good institution, IT WILL SHOW ITSELF and it will SPEAK FOR ITSELF. Traditionally strong institutions are not plagued by insecurity. They don’t give a shit about rankings because they know they don’t need to, because they know what their identity is as a strong institution. Yes, BU has strong researchers and professors and bright students, but it has a huge, huge identity problem that is exacerbated by an egomaniacal administration that feels like it’s on the cusp of transforming BU into something truly stellar. Yes, I want BU to succeed, but sustainably. But their means are just irritating. Have you read how BU presents itself in its own language on like its admissions pages? Or it’s annual financial report? Or strategic plan? The self-congratulatory gloating is asinine and puerile. Modesty is clearly not in the BU repertoire, and will come to bite it in the ass.

I’m happy to say I’ve gained a lot from BU as a double major and minor, multiple fellowship-awardee, Honors College student, amazing internships, athlete, Greek life, graduating with Latin Honors, and generally being a poster child for the university (see below) or whatever. You would think I have no real reason to complain. But those achievements mean nothing to me when there’s a deep dissatisfaction with your school outside of the classroom, and no sense of pride. I would think that I should be thankful for my achievements, but they seem sour in the face of so many of BU’s problems. 

I always felt adrift in a university that prioritized shiny new buildings and stupid campaigns that seek to build an image tinged with smugness at climbing in the rankings and increasing its respectability. Yes, I understand the importance of capital investments, and better infrastructure, and better facilities, and of brand. But I have received the benefit of none of those, as far as I can tell. I still ate shitty Warren food or whatever, still went to class in old ass buildings, and still met others that felt so deeply frustrated with BU.

I felt like BU was hurrying to become something more at the expense of focusing on who’s actually already at the university and trying to succeed, like it was always enticing the next class and forgot about those who were already here. I know this because I have worked 3 years in admissions and have seen BU’s tactics and ways for marketing itself to prospective students. Yes, BU is great and all, but I feel like I had to reluctantly defend BU against serious criticisms because I had a stake in the good image of BU as a student. And as an alumni that stake in BU’s prestige doesn’t go away, but I feel compelled to let loose my frustrations as a student and representative of BU.

And I say all of this about BU because I care. When I was an underclassman I wanted to really contribute my excited opinion to BU because I believed in the importance of participating in the betterment of our community. But all these town halls I’ve attended seem so far to have amounted for nothing. Back in 2017 they had some town halls and asked students for feedback, but often would push back against student criticisms, or just hand wave and play along. What was the point then? I never felt any assurances that our feedback meant anything.

Ok, maybe I don’t hate BU, but my irritation with the incongruity of my grades with my actual knowledge, my frustration with the tenor and tactics of BU’s management, and the general sense of discontent I’ve heard from others makes me feel relief at finally leaving this school. And it makes me so sad that I don’t feel a real, deep, and abiding pride at graduating from BU; I’m just proud to have graduated.

I’m curious to know how other seniors might feel, or anyone else for that matter. I’m aware that I’m extra critical because of the stress of the times, but it doesn’t obviate the years of discontent I’ve felt prior to now."

 I am currently a CC student looking to transfer this coming fall as a junior! I have been accepted into UCD and UCSD for their CS program and am trying to pick between the two colleges, but I know virtually nothing about how each campus is like. Thus I thought the best way to find out was to ask the students themselves! I'm really curious as to how smooth (or rough) the transition was from a CC to Davis was, and how campus life is like in general. I also have a few specific questions. 

* What is the atmosphere like at Davis for cs students? Is it really really competitive where each student is always working alone? Or is it more collaborative?
* How is the faculty? Are the professors good and open to office hours?
* How is the social life at Davis? 
* How are the career opportunities at Davis? Are there a lot of internship opportunities?
* How are the classes? Do they prepare you for your internships/careers?
* Before you entered Davis, was there something that you didn't consider that played a big role in your experience?

If there's anything else that I might not be considering please let me know! I'm really curious as to how it is like at Davis so I can make the best decision when the time comes. 

Thanks Everyone!"

I’m also stressed and worried because I haven’t done well on the midterm examinations due to a completely different format of testing than I was used to (online exams). 

I have internship experience with a company I worked with last summer, but I have absolutely no interest in going to work with them as I just didn’t enjoy my experience with that company (They also laid a few people off recently after I saw a post on LinkedIn from people I worked with at that company, which gives me the impression they won’t want another person on the payroll.). Because of my lack of experience, I just get a lot of “Sorry, we went with another candidate” emails after I apply to new grad jobs. I’ve been applying to almost any type of company that has a software position open and just keep getting rejected. I’ve also had numerous applications automatically turned down because of the whole coronavirus situation and companies taking down open positions. 

I’m just worried I won’t be able to find a job in the current market and I don’t want to have a gap in my career as well because I know in the future employers will ask why/what happened.

Here is what happened:  


* I applied online, uploaded a CV that had information about where I received my bachelor's degree.  One could clearly infer which country I am a citizen of based on my undergraduate institution.
* Had 2 interviews, the interviewers were very impressed.  One week later I received the offer: an email saying I was being offered the position + PDF document describing the details.
* A few days after receiving the offer I got an email from my recruiter saying ""there is an urgent update regarding the status of my internship"" and that he needs to talk to me on the phone.  I got slightly worried but assumed they are going to talk about going virtual etc...
* During the phone meeting with the recruiter, I was told they are going to rescind the offer due to complications associated with my nationality. They apologized and told me these issues are because of certain sanctions from the Department of Treasury and the company can't do anything about it.

This was not only a huge bummer but also will be financially devastating to me.  I was counting on doing a paid internship this summer.

gi611n,13,2020-05-12,TIFU by jokingly threatening to blow up the dog of my senior at work,[deleted],tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gi611n/tifu_by_jokingly_threatening_to_blow_up_the_dog/,"It’s probably not as bad as you think it is by the name of the post, but I still feel very bad and embarrassed about the entire situation regardless.

Essential backstory: About three weeks ago I woke up one morning with the entire police and fire response force in our small town surrounding our house. The garbage disposal municipal workers had found three live mortars in our trash. How they got there is a complete mystery up until this day.

Optional juice: [here is the video of the police detonating the mortars outside our house on the beach.](https://imgur.com/gallery/al9HBZQ)

Due to all the chaos that ensued and all the sirens and what not I had to miss a work meeting (conducted over Zoom). I notified my senior about what had happened and he was pretty chill with it.

There is this running joke in the office that I’m some kind of mastermind villain in disguise, primarily because I’m way too friendly and always have a big smile on my face, and the craziest shit (like the mortars) always happens to me. Before I knew it people at work were throwing around jokes and “theories” that my family is part of some kind of crime syndicate who got targeted and almost blown up by the mafia.

Fast forward to yesterday (which is about two weeks after the mortars were found and blown up).

I’m at work. I’m currently an intern at a company who opened up shop after being in lockdown for more than 50 days. It was great seeing everyone again. Of course the first thing that was brought up were the mortars. Everyone in our video team has quite a good sense of humor about things, so I don’t mind the jokes at all (I rather enjoy them to be honest).

The conversation about the mortars turn to jokes about how I’m part of some massive mafia syndicate. My senior at work happens to be the one making most of these jokes. I laugh along and am genuinely enjoying the banter.

At this point I remember that my senior has a dog (Australian sheepdog). Jojo, the dog, is still a puppy (he’s only a couple of months old) and is super smart and cute. I met him a week ago when I dropped some work off at my seniors house.

As the jokes start flying around about how I’m the greatest supervillain alive, I jokingly decide to bring up my seniors dog. My exact words went something like this: “You have a nice dog Zach, it would be shame if he were to blow up too.” For the first time since working there, my seniors face completely sank in like I’ve never seen before. He went completely silent. No one said a word. All the heads in our department turn to Zach and then slowly to me. 

Out of nowhere Zach starts laughing awkwardly. I could feel something was off. We’ve been throwing around insults and jokes at each other for months now, so I was really confused as to why this had him this rattled. Turns out his poor puppy got run over by a car a couple of days ago. He got run over and died on the spot, and I had no freaking idea. 

I could feel my face turn completely red. How do you respond to that? I probably apologized sincerely for my remark about a hundred times yesterday, but the thought of me just telling that joke still makes me cringe and feel bad. My senior is laughing about it and apparently finds it funny, but I’m struggling to believe that I didn’t cause hurt to some extent.

Anyone know of any services that are able to reset my memories so that I can forget the joke I made yesterday?

TL:DR - Jokingly made a threat where I threatened to blow up my seniors dog. Turns out the puppy was run over by a car a couple of days ago and I didn’t know about it."

Here is what happened:

* I applied online, uploaded a CV that had information about where I received my bachelor's degree. One could clearly infer which country I am a citizen of based on my undergraduate institution.
* Had 2 interviews, the interviewers were very impressed. One week later I received the offer: an email saying I was being offered the position + PDF document describing the details.
* A few days after receiving the offer I got an email from my recruiter saying ""there is an urgent update regarding the status of my internship"" and that he needs to talk to me on the phone. I got slightly worried but assumed they are going to talk about going virtual etc...
* During the phone meeting with the recruiter, I was told they are going to rescind the offer due to complications associated with my nationality. They apologized and told me these issues are because of certain sanctions from the Department of Treasury and the company can't do anything about it.

This was not only a huge bummer but also will be financially devastating to me. I was counting on doing a paid internship this summer. My plan B was to TA but there aren't many teaching positions available in my university since most classes are not being offered due to the pandemic situation.

Being in quarantine and having my internship cancelled because of Corona, I wanted to pick up a new skill so I've been teaching myself some more coding recently and was wondering how I could apply it to my engineering studies.

Then I had the idea, what did I always hate to do, the pesky interpolation of the steam tables for thermodynamics. So at the moment, I am making a website that will simply allow interpolation of the Rogers &amp; Mayhew Steam tables and wanted to ask for any suggestions/feedback. I know that this isn't really anything useful but hey would have saved me some time in first and second year so it might help some other people.

Planning to implement a question solver after adding all the tables that will hopefully show working (in a wolfram alpha sort of manner) to help some of the first years at my university understand how to solve these questions as they seem to always have trouble with them.

i have a haproxy with httpd as backend web server.

I use haproxy to distribute different tls Websites to their specific servers based on SNI.  
It works more or less.

So i have centos 8 boxes, what ha proxy 1.8.15 and httpd  2.4.37

im completely at a loss, where to look further.  
I hope some mastermind is able to point to the problem, or how to dig deeper.

if that works stable i want to utilize the send-proxy protocol, but at the moment i makes the situation even more worse.

I was wondering if anyone had any tips for my senior year schedule. I'm currently signed up for 6 AP classes and 1 double blocked Practicum IT class. My schedule's looking to be something like this:  
AP Lit  
AP Physics C: Mech  
AP Calc BC  
AP Econ &amp; Gov (both 1/2 sem)  
AP Comp Sci Principles (1/2 sem)  
Practicum in IT (double blocked)

I don't know if I should replace practicum with AP Stats, which would bump me up to 7 APs in senior year. I'm not really trying to take a lot of APs to impress colleges, but mostly just because half of these are my core classes and I'd rather stay on track with AP. The issue with taking Practicum is that it's at another school AND double blocked (takes up 2 class periods in one day) so that means it might be harder to get me into AP Calc BC and Phys C. I'm pretty sure there's only two classes or less of BC (same with Phys) next year so being able to fit those one my schedule while also making the practicum class work will be risky I feel like. I'm honestly debating dropping practicum and taking AP stats with an extra senior release or something. I plan to major in Computer Science, if that helps. I know that practicum can help me and I believe that it has opportunities for a small internship. I'm not sure how stats could really help me but I've always had a fondness for math subjects. Either way, if I take stats or practicum I'll have an extreme workload already. 

It's too late to request a course change but I bet once I get my schedule in August I could try and get them to change my classes. I'm pretty sure that if I don't get into BC then I'm definitely going to drop the practicum class instead because I really want to take BC instead of AB.

If anyone has any tips or suggestions, please let me know :)"

I've done several web projects as a group throughout my degree but most of them aren't aesthetically pleasing enough to showcase in my repo (though I had been mostly doing the back-end for those particular projects). I only have one personal website that I've created on my own from one of my courses using Django, and I'm currently fixing some stuff to make them look presentable for my resume. The website currently has a schedule-making feature, user authentication, a status feature, and a book-search feature using Google's API.

Thing is, most of the deadlines for the front-end internships are end of June, and I literally have only that one project to showcase my front-end skills. 

I'm planning on doing another project in React since that's one of the hottest frameworks right now. But I don't know whether I should try making small React projects (weather app, twitter bot app, chat app?) or if I should go for a bigger, more complex web application, like a social media app, a blog website, or something of that sort, keeping in mind that I pretty much around 6 weeks before the application deadlines.

Also, after applying for an internship, if you decide to do more projects, will the companies look at them, if say the projects were put on your LinkedIn account, but not on your resume, since you hadn't done them when you applied?

Any tips or advice on this would be very much appreciated! :)

TL;DR Should I make several small React projects or one complex React project to get a front-end internship?"

I know a lot people are struggling with massive financial and emotional burdens at the moment which are definitely more important than my problems, but I am dealing with a little quarter life crisis at the moment in regards to what to do with my life. The whole death thing and having to live with myself for the past couple months of COVID has made me question and wonder what I am doing with school and all. And not to be too tone deaf, but I am doing great in school for the most part and even in finding an internship and that sort of thing. So its not like I am having trouble, its more that I do not know if this is what I want to do with my life.

I have been listening to Alan Watts on Youtube and something he said about not wanting control and that once you know the future you won't want it because its lost all its surprise and that is what we really want in life. That really rung true with me. I am 18 at the moment in EECS, and I can already sorta predict my future for the most part as long as I maintain mediocre effort in my opinion. Not to say the major is easy, haha, I just mean mediocre passion towards the subjects and work.

I hear stories about people who really commit themselves blood and tears to their businesses or projects. However, I live my life with school as a grind and then watching TV or other hobbies as my free time to enjoy. I just really want that moment in my life where I commit entirely to something where it is my work time and my free time and I love it to death. I feel like the path my life is headed down at the moment by all accounts is fine and leagues above bad, but also lacks something I desperately want. I think the way it usually goes is that you live that life where your work is work and it supports you and that is just the life you have to live to get by, or you have the wonderful privilege to find something that makes you really passionate.

I have never been that passionate about EECS and that sort of thing to the degree that I would want to be towards something I commit so much time to, but I never had a major failure on my path, so I just figured it must be the path I am a good fit for. This has brought me success and the like, but it does not make me proud and overall has sorta muted my curiosity and original spark of interest in the field. I feel ridiculous and sorta entitled to say that I do not want to be successful and have a great quality of life by most standards, but I just cannot help but feel that there is something else out there for me.

I have many hobbies in art, music, and sports and I love them, but I do not know if that is what I want to do either. I've started becoming sorta self destructive in my actions when it comes to school, subconsciously trying to sabotage myself to give myself the failure to put myself on the hot seat and finally realize what I want to do, but that really just reminds me of that scene from the office where Andy shits on his boss' car to burn his bridges and pursue music. And I, like most people, hate Andy.

So now I am considering withdrawing or cancelling for fall semester since It will probably be a low quality high demand online education which does not fit me. I am not sure whether or not that is the right decision, because there is a very high chance I will just end up wasting my time watching bunch of TV and not doing anything. So I have to at least come up with an idea of alternative paths for myself that I would want and some sort of way to pursue those paths during these COVID times for a semester. Anyhow, best of luck to anyone struggling during these times."

I made a program that holds a list of internships I want to apply to. In essence the user can input a command to show a list of of internships, see if the person in charge has been contacted and can add new info to the list.

I have the list of internships as a dictionary (key = internship name, value= website) so naturally when the user inputs the command 'list' I print the dictionary as:

for key, value in library.items():

print( f{key}, {value})

&amp;#x200B;

I'm very lost as of how I can hold the information of having contacted the person responsible for the internship.

I'm even more lost as of how I can have the user add information such as new internships.

Since the internship info is listed in a dictionary there is only space for a key and value (the value being the website), so can I go about adding if a person responsible for an internship has been contacted?

Thank you all for thelp"

I know I am not supposed to post a resume over here but please read my story!!!


I am a British Citizen.  But due to personal reason I had to shift to my home country in India.
I have a Bachelors Degree in Computer Engineering from a less known college in India.  I am also currently interning at a startup as a Devops  Intern.  I really want to come back to Uk and work as software developer(most probably in Devops).  

Currently my internship is only teaching me terraform.  So could anyone just review my Devops internship part in my resume and tell me how to highlight my terraform knowlege.

Feel free to give any other suggestions!

Here is the eleventh installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

I am basically applying to all network engineering, cyber security, SOC, and even getting to the point where I am applying to data analyst/science jobs.

gij2x8,3,2020-05-12,should I just go back to school?,Jeffreyjellyfish33,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gij2x8/should_i_just_go_back_to_school/,"I am 22 years old and It has been about a year since I graduated college. I went into college trying to be a computer engineer. My school didn't offer that and instead they offered electrical engineering. I picked that hoping I could branch out into computers. Didn't work out and I didn't really care for learning what we were doing In the electrical engineering curriculum. My school's IT program was in the management field which focuses on more data science in a business perspective. It wasn't really something I wanted to do, but my mom was stressing me to graduate on time.

I had to catch up and take all these business classes I didn't care for and I ended up graduating on time in the long run but now I can't land a job. I have no experience in data analysis or anything. I haven't really had a job during school. So with my student loans coming up and all my resume and applications being denied I have no options other than go back to my school. I don't even know if I am sure I want to be a data scientist I was just applying to thousands of jobs trying to get it because it is what I painfully studied in college.

The truth is I am not sure what I want to do with life and my moms emphasis on me finding a job is really taking its toll. My schools program I feel hasn't really prepared me to becoming a data analyst/scientist and if I am going to be one I feel like I need more training or education.

Should I just go back to grad school and study more? its impossible to get a job for me I feel. I have no connections in companies, no experience compared to so many graduates and I just do not compare to the recent IT grads. If I had a masters I feel like i'll have more of a shot. I think its even too late for me to get an internship so I'm kind of beat in the job market."

I am currently working in IT as an IT specialist. This is my first IT job out of college. I have a B.S. in Computer Information systems and have had 2 internships as well. One was on a service desk and the other was doing something similar to what I do now. ( A Little bit of everything in IT but not specializing in one area.)

With all of my experience at my current job and with the internships I have about 2years experience in IT general support. I have almost been in my current role for 1 year and have done very well in it so far. However I am realizing day by day that I do not want to do this specific job much longer and am really beginning to hate it. To clarify I enjoy helping people very much but I feel like I am doing the work\roles of 4 people and the compensation is below average for the amount of work I do.

I am part of a regional IT team and the larger Infrastructure team is based in our headquarters. I am expected to do my local office support job while working to implement new infrastructure systems that should be handled by the other Infrastructure team. The infrastructure team is very understaffed as well as all of our IT department for the size of company we are. Around 8,000 employees for the whole company and I alone support 3 offices with around 350ish users.) This understaffing leads to rushed and miss managed projects, usually leading to my regional team including myself to pick up the slack and essentially do job functions that of the Infrastructure team because they overlooked them.


So I am wondering how to get a job in cloud computing? AWS, Azure and GCP intsrest me and I believe these systems are the future of IT and have good opportunities to increase my earning potential in the future and offer a more specialized job function in IT.

What are my some good 'next step' job titles\functions  that I could look at and what jobs could I currently be qualified for that would prepare me well for a cloud engineering role? 

I am currently taking Coursera's ""Cloud Engineering with Google Cloud Professional Certificate"" course. Does this course have any value to employers?

I have a BS in Civil Engineering and worked as a Civil Engineer for 3 years.

I was unable to secure an internship during the summer. Could any of the experienced people guide me on what should I study during summer? I was thinking about focusing on Algorithms, Leetcoding, Cracking the coding interview book, and Deep Learning courses on Coursera.

My goal is to get a position as a Data Scientist or ML engineer. But I don't have a CS background.

If you could suggest where should I focus now or any general advice you may have for me. I heard people saying ML/DS is so saturated and it would be too difficult to secure a job. How true is that? I'm a US citizen if that makes any difference."

Project Management sounds right up my alley, but I don't really know! Can anyone help shine some light on this?",obstinatecompass,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gik9yb/a_small_business_owners_struggle_during_covid19s/,"Hi everyone! I'm new to posting on reddit but am an avid reader. I'm looking for help on here because I have exhausted all options outside of the internet. I've talked to friends, family, boyfriend, other business owners, and I feel like I'm in the same place as when I started. I just don't want to reopen when all of this is over. This is going to be long, so I thank you in advance if you actually read through it all!

So, from the beginning: I was about 23 and completing my business degree at a college in my town (fairly big city in Florida). I had already known my entire life I wanted to own my own business. From when I was little, the plans changed from Vet to Massage Therapist to Groomer and then somewhere between me practically living at my local coffee shop and going to school I realized I wanted to own a cafe. My life had just went from a pretty live free lifestyle; I was in a committed relationship, but we partied a lot, went to a lot of music festivals, experimented a lot, and had a great time! I got arrested at 22-23 on the way to a music festivals and once all of that passed, I decided to go back to school full time, finish my degree and get started on my business plan/future. I worked tirelessly between being a full time groomer and school. Fast forward a few years, I gained restaurant and coffee shop experience in both back of house and managerial roles (got an internship working as an assistant manager and was hired officially and promoted within 2 weeks to manager).

A few different jobs later, I found myself ready to open my business. I had saved money, worked my tail off planning aspects of my business, and doing research on everything pertaining to the business. I had decided to open up a coffee food truck!! It was so exciting and could NOT wait to get started!

I registered as a business in 2017, but officially opened October 2018 due to unforeseen issues with my business. The food truck builder ended up being a huge scam. When I finally got my trailer about 4 months later than it was supposed to be finished, the first day out it broke down.. It cost me $4k to fix the issue, and I had to cancel all future events (my FIRST events! :() .Due to the trailer being 4 months late already, I had used up most of my savings. I had told my job I was going to leave once my trailer was done, and they were nice enough to take me back part time until I was ready to leave, but could not go back to full time, therefore I was losing a lot of money just waiting for the trailer to be finished. Then the repair came along and put me in debt. I trenched through and persevered. Thankfully I had support from my family and incredibly supportive boyfriend (who works in Law and would never work in a coffee shop. He has his career path he's happy with.

After all the hardship with opening my business, I did it anyway. I worked on the side and hustled as much as possible to make money to put into my business, and I did it successfully. I pushed incredibly hard to get a contract with the college I graduated from to let me set up on campus and sell coffee/healthy food to students and faculty. I got the contract and I was there for 2 years until Covid 19. During my contract with the college, I did really well. It was hard because college students are usually not trying to spend a lot of money on ""good quality food"", but I was able to grow my business, and over time, started getting really great opportunities and was making great money outside of the campus, while I had the campus sales keeping me afloat. It was perfect! I finally was able to pay my employees $11-$12 per hour plus tips on a W2..this is a barista position ya'll. Not touting my own horn, but I don't know any coffee shop that pays so much (maybe this was part of the problem..) Anyway, I felt okay not making as much to be able to pay my employees more for them to be happy. Then March came along and the Covid Shutdown happened.. everything cancelled, school cancelled indefinitely, all side events cancelled, no money coming in at all. I improvised and tried to set up in neighborhoods, but then 2 family members of mine got Covid and it really scared me. I didn't want to be a carrier and I also didn't want to catch it myself. I decided to close down temporarily (was hoping it would only be 2 weeks) but cases continued to rise, and more began to close. We have been closed now for 2 months, and I was forced to get a job. Thankfully I found something working in customer service for an unemployment company (YAY- you can imagine how crazy things are currently). Despite the nature of the calls, I discovered that I was missing out on life, quarantine was actally really good for me, mentally and physically. I started to take care of my body, my neglected partner, dogs, and just in general my personal life really blossomed, and I missed that tremendously. I started to go back out in nature which I had almost completely stopped when I started my business. I had been working at least 11 hour days almost everyday, but most were about 16 hours. I had one or two employees that just clocked in for their shifts, but I did EVERYTHING else back of house, online, management, etc. I was the sole owner and ran it alone! It was crazy. I loved it and was proud of myself, but I was neglecting literally every other aspect in my life. I am now realizing that I don't really want to open it up again, not unless I had a partner who could really contribute 50% either in the kitchen or behind the scenes.

Wow that was a rant. Congrats if you made it this far. I guess now I'm just in limbo... I'm just not ready to go back to grinding 16 hour days every day for minimal return. I'm thinking about switching careers but I don't know where to start. I'm interested in Project Management, preferably for a company who is eco friendly/humanitarian, but where would I begin? Do I need any certs?  I just need some guidance, I feel very lost and do not want to return to my old grinding life.

Thanks for listening!"

I started applying to jobs as soon as I was out of the military and haven't stopped, I've applied to jobs that require no experience, jobs that require experience and basically everything in between. On top of that I've worked on gaining and am working on developing projects related to new skills that are more in demand to increase my chances of getting hired.

I've been interviewed by about 10 different companies at this point, most of the interviews I've been through went really well including technical questions and any challenges, but none of them have ever resulted in an offer.

I've also asked around to see how other people in the SWE field got their jobs and most if not all the answers were that they knew someone who worked there. Unfortunately I do not have such connections that and I have no idea how I'd get such connections.

Experience is also a huge issue since I barely have any in a market that is desperate for experienced engineers, I've thought about maybe doing freelance or remote work to gain experience but I have no idea where to even begin. 

Due to the outbreak and the economy the job market is pretty dead and some of my interviews have been postponed for a few more weeks.

What can I do to help my post corona job search result in an offer and not further disappointment?

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated."

The projects are mostly ML/DL based though I’m really flexible with anything else also, except web development. I have always been pretty intimidated by the monotonous job life routines of people, especially as I have not had really good experiences during my internships. I feel that IT is the right choice for me as I have the necessary skills in it, but sitting in a chair for 20-30 years coding seems to be a lot for my brain to comprehend. I’ve also heard that the growth in an IT firm is really less as compared to Management roles. This is making me rethink my future decisions of which post graduation degree I should go for.

Like other Indians, I could also go for an MBA, call it herd mentality, but the work doesn’t seem pretty bad for me to handle. I’ve heard that management pays extremely well in senior positions and are also pretty relaxing. However, to dump all my technical skillset in the drain just for a job seems really wasteful and unnecessary to me. 

I have always loved my topics in my major (CS and Maths). I have considered a career in research, but the field is not really considered to be great in India, stress-wise. I really don’t want to shift out of my country to do research elsewhere.

In general, I feel I have very less experience of how IT jobs are going to be like and want to make my mind a bit more focused so that I could possibly work towards it. Do people in technical jobs also get into management positions later on in life? Or do you prefer to get into research positions? 

So, could you guys give me a glimpse of how an IT career is generally like? I would prefer if you’re an IT professional in India or work specifically in ML/DL related areas as it would be more relatable, though others are free to write about their careers as well. Sorry for being a little vague but i’d love to learn the growth trajectory in terms of what job you do and the salaries you get.

TLDR: Really confused about the career progression in an IT job. Would want to know about your careers and growth in the IT sector. 

Thanks!"

I am about to graduate with my bachelors in Management Information Systems (22 years old).

I was hoping you guys could shed some light and what I should do. I am currently in an internship in a user support role at a mid-sized company. They suggested I apply for an open full time position in a larger city with the company a few hours away. The pay seems okay, but I think it could be better (about $21 an hour).

But the thing is, I’d rather my career go towards the business analyst or systems analyst route versus the technical side.

Should I apply for the full time support job and build some more experience (I am pretty confident I would get this job)? Or should I hold out on that job and apply for junior/entry level BA jobs?

If you guys could give some insight you have from your own experience that would be great!"

The backstory: I have both a bachelors and masters degree in an unrelated field. A year ago, I decided to take the Cyber Security route because I found it (and still do) very interesting and envision myself in this field for the rest of my career. I applied to a few entry level positions but understandably couldn't find anything considering I had no certs or industry experience. I studied for and passed the CompTIA Security+ exam in October 2019, thinking it would give me my chance to get my ""foot in the door"". It's now May, and I haven't been contacted by any employers even though I've submitted countless applications. Almost all of the job qualifications required at least two years of IT/Cyber Security experience, which I don't have.  I even went so far as to look into unpaid internships so I can at least get some hands-on experience under my belt. 

I've noticed a lot of the job requirements include programming (Python, C, Java) and cloud knowledge. Also, I really want to continue to keep my Cyber Security knowledge fresh. I ultimately want to pursue the CEH and CISSP, but I know that will definitely take some experience. 

In addition to networking and continuously submitting job apps, my question is what to do in the meantime? I've heard of the CySA+ and GSEC so far. Also, would you recommend I get some programming/cloud experience? If so, which ones?"

Ultimately, I'm looking for suggestions on the best way for me to proceed professionally, especially during the summer months when I have some free time. I haven't had an opportunity to use ArcGIS yet, although I believe my university offers free access to it. Furthermore, most of my coding experience is limited but I do have some limited experience with JS/Google Maps API, and a basic understanding of Python. This summer, I've already joined some politically-oriented data fellowships and will be working in a data-based role for some campaigns, but I'd like to supplement some of those opportunities if possible.

A couple of questions I also have: how applicable is QGIS knowledge to ArcGIS? What is the best time investment coding-wise that would assist in my GIS skills?

TL;DR: I am extremely stressed and worried right now because, by the end of this semester, I will have at least one C (in English), maybe two (in Discrete Mathematics), and maybe one B (Calculus III). The rest will most likely be A's. What are my chances for being rescinded?

A little bit about my journey: I am a UCLA Mathematics transfer applicant that did all of my work in 1 year (I am technically a freshman but in terms of units, I got enough to apply for UC transfers). I did this by not only going to online classes at multiple community colleges, but also going to in-person classes at my CSU. When I applied, I had all A's. I also did a few volunteer and internship jobs. This semester (because of COVID and some family issues), I am in a grade predicament. I will definitely have 1 C in English (at a community college) and maybe another C in Discrete Math (at my CSU). I will also likely have at least one B in Calculus III (at my CSU).

I was wondering if my chances of getting rescinded are high and, if I do, if I can submit an appeal. These times are extremely rough for me (I don't really want to get into details), but considering how I went from straight A's to having a bunch of C's and B's, I doubt UCLA would really care.

If you guys have any advice for me or if you have any stories that were similar, would you please share it? I'm extremely stressed and fearful for my future at my dream school

I've asked everyone I've met in industry, grad students, undergrad why they like CS: they like math, they like the classes and the projects are cool, they like problem solving, they like making products people will use, they're naturally good at it (because regardless if you find things interesting you'll at least moderately enjoy something you excel at), etc.

Why do **you** like CS?

\-- optional read/rant: --

Coming out of 61ab and working on side projects, I think the classes, the concepts, everything is just ""ok"". The only reasons I'd feel negatively towards it is because of how excruciatingly difficult everything is (I'm a very average student), which is probably just exacerbated bc I don't actually enjoy a single moment of this. Every time I finish a 61b project I feel immense relief it's over but I have never felt joy from engaging in any CS related thing. I thought I was not the only one that felt this way but the more I talk to people the more I fear that I'm just not meant for this major. Not because I can't do it but because I have zero interest in these classes and projects and back end in general. I feel like I'm going through CS but CS is not going through me.

The thing is, I'm trying really hard to like it. I do intense club recruiting. My friends are mostly CS, I have CS mentors, I'm in a tech related club, I'm in AWE and SWE, I follow CS memes and subreddits, I went to a hackathon, I go to company events, I do interview prep and apply to and cold email *many* internships. I'm going through all the motions. At this point I wonder if I'm just not meant for this major.

Thank you for any input :)

I’ve recently learned how incredible this industry can be if you can somehow get on with the big companies. I feel like this is something worth making the priority of my life for a few years to get into one of those companies. I have the summer ahead of me, so I wanted to outline my plan for improving. Keep in mind I only have three semesters of programming experience. 

I have 3-4 semesters left of college. My idea is this:
The first 2 semesters + summer, spend as much of my free time as possible studying and learning about programming. Emphasis on reading textbooks, just learning and trying to get better at it.

The last 2 semesters, focus on using what I learned to strengthen my resume - mainly focusing on personal projects, hackathons, and internships. Doing everything possible to make me stand out.

How does that plan sound to those more experienced in this industry? Is it nice in theory, bad in practice, or a good guideline to go by?

Finally, practical measures. The next step would be, start learning like I said. My idea was to start with the textbook Introduction to Algorithms, work thru that for like six months, and then once I complete that work thru Cracking the Coding Interview and Programming Interview Exposed.

My most recent course was my first course introducing Object Oriented Programming and Data Structures. Is Intro to Algorithms too advanced for me? I have also heard that it’s a bit too much like a reference book to be read cover to cover. If you’ve read the book yourself, would you recommend it to someone in my position, and if not, what would you suggest? I want to read a textbook(s) that will make a quality software engineer/computer scientist. I’m willing to take on something a little difficult.

All in all, how does this plan sound? Any advice? My main emphasis is though, am I tackling this the right way, or is my inexperience showing?"

I’ve been going through self-improvement since first year of university (I’m in 4th year now) in all aspects of life, but it feels like COVID19 destroyed everything I’ve been working towards. 

At first it started with wanting a good physique and wanting to glow up to become attractive enough to get a girlfriend. I ended up accomplishing it to a certain extent and gained 50lbs after being anorexic, but couldn’t accomplish my ultimate goal of reaching 185lbs and a 315lbs bench because I plateaued and didn’t have the discipline to work harder.

I eventually got a girlfriend, and my first thought was that all my hard work of increasing my value (with the guidance of reddit) paid off. However, a couple months later she broke up with me and I experienced my first heartbreak. One one side I learned a ton from the heartbreak experience, as well as from reading books like the rational male and 48 laws of power, but on the other, it’s been 6 months and I am still heartbroken, alone, and depressed everyday.

Then I noticed another area of my life was severely lacking: my career prospects. I’m in software engineering and all my peers were scoring internships from prestigious companies and getting paid $50+ an hour (almost 2x what I get paid in my internships) Naturally, feelings of inferiority and stupidity occupied my mind, so I started working harder in building my interviewing skills and personal projects. I was making good progress, and spent the past 4 months grinding &amp; working on making myself more employable.

But then COVID19 hit. I’ve lost at least 15lbs of weight and muscle since quarantine started. I haven’t worked out in 2 months and lost my physique and strength, and my self-confidence has taken a dive. My depression and depersonalization is getting worse everyday. In addition, due to the terrible state of the job market and the economy, all the work I put into becoming more employable isn’t going to pay off. I have to look for another internship and with less job postings and significant travel restrictions, the internship search has gotten so much harder and uncertain. I had hopes of landing a prestigious internship and now I’m worried I won’t be able to even get an internship.

Before COVID19, I felt like I was making good progress towards all my goals. Now I feel discouraged and lost because I feel like I was on the path of getting to the finish line, but it just suddenly got much further away. Obviously I have no one to blame but myself and shouldn’t just blame it all on something out of my control - I could do bodyweight exercises to decrease the rate of muscle loss, and I should’ve worked harder in becoming more employable a couple years earlier.

But man, I feel terrible. I lost my girlfriend, my physique, and my job prospects. I am not where I want to be in life. I am becoming more depressed every day and my drive to grind and work hard is quickly dwindling away. 

I am lost."

Some traditional areas like Mech E and EE can also be technically transferrable (within their domain), but opportunities are much less than SWE and doctors/physicians. It's all luck and a little of social/soft skills if you're not SWE or physician. 

I'm non-traditional engineering, and I've only recently begun my first full-time job, but it isn't all that different from my internships that I had more than 5 years ago. I just have to be a lot more meticulous with my calculations. It's like being given a pass/fail exam where only 95%+ is pass (the other 5% is coming from co-workers or self-checking that can hopefully can catch any mistakes that didn't throw an error). The pace is also exhausting, with constant overtime at least every other day. I assume physicians would be under the same conditions...but physicians actually make good money (although their tuition is high).

SWE tuition would be the same, work stress would be the same as other engineering, and pay would be above average for engineering - and on par with physicians if you manage to get into a top tech company with stocks (of course even at a regular tech company without stocks, pay is still much better than any other engineering position). 

It's like unless you're absolutly obssessed with mechanical mechanisms (e.g. car hobbyist) or DIY circuits, there's no point going into traditional engineering. 

Downside of engineering is that, unless you're an expert in a specific domain with high demand (of which there aren't that many) , if you get laid off, you essentially start from zero when yoi look for your next job. That's not usully the case for SWE or physicians. 

I mean an engineering degree is better than a bachelors in biology/psychology/english/etc. But for all the work put in (with a potential masters that's needed if you want to be competitive during the job hunt), it just seems like SWE and physician would be a similar amount of work with much more reward. (SWE may be less or more work; physician would be like a bachelors + 4/5 more years, not bad). 

The most reliable way to increase your earning potential is with experience, but if you pick a job that doesn't give you that experience (e.g. non-technical support role), or the experience is not transferrable, then you severely risk your earning potential if anything happens during your career. With SWE (as long as the language doesn't go extinct) and physicians, their earning potential is a lot higher."

I am an international student and am pretty unfamiliar with the US application and college system, and I applied for a major in Computer Science in San Francisco State university (SFSU) and San Jose State University (SJSU) in california.
I got admitted into sfsu directly into the CS major with no problems, but I wasn't admitted in SJSU for the CS major ( nor my alternative, software engineering ) due to a low ""Impaction index"" score.
I talked to them and found the general engineering major, and asked if I could switch majors while studying this one ( to CS or Software Engineering ) and they said yes, but it could take up to a year after enrolling and depends on grades on courses like calc and physics.
SJSU is better known in silicon valley, and has way more connections to land an internship or interview, and has better ratings.
I'm really having a hard time making a decision, and would really appreciate any help or insights.

I'm actually a computational physicist and I was hoping to use my computational physics skills to work at NASA(asking in this sub because not many physicists transition to NASA). I really enjoyed the idealism NASA had and the idea of contributing to society by expanding our ability to go into space.

I'm going to a PhD program in the fall, and I was preparing this past year to get an OSSI internship. Things changed though when I went to a conference in Fall 2019 to present my research. I met someone at the national labs and she and I connected well. She offered to help me  get an internship there and I got one. My experience with the national labs has been really good. They have been very supportive going out of there way to give me advice on applying to grants, editing my resume, and being patient with the project I'm working on(it's a completely different physics field than mine, but still computational physics).  And this is all before I even worked there.

I'm doing a remote internship this summer, and despite not even working there, it's been a great experience. They're paying me really well too(28 an hour). The reason I'm asking this is that my experience made me reconsider my goals. I always wanted to work at NASA, but the national lab I've been associated with seems like a dream place especially to do physics. If I want to make a good career, I need to make good relationships and interning for the next 5-6 years for my PhD could do that.

That's why I wanted to ask and whether I should focus on the national labs instead of going for an OSSI/pathways internship. People at NASA, how has your experience been? Was it a fulfilling one and would you say that I should also consider trying to get one?"

Backstory about me:

I recently just graduated from Penn State University with a degree in Engineering Science and a minor in Engineering Mechanics. To clarify, since this degree isn't a common one, engineering science is an honors interdisciplinary degree. You essentially have a course or 2 per semester that provide interdisciplinary work and then the rest of your course are what you want. You also have to research and write a thesis. So in my case, my degree falls in line with a mechanical engineer more than anything else and my thesis was ""Optimization of friction and wear for resin materials"". My GPA was a 3.0, I had an ME internship in summer 2019, and I also completed a capstone project. Since COVID19 pretty much screwed everything up, I am currently unemployed.

My main concern:

While I search for jobs, my biggest problem is my lack of interest or passion for the field. I picked ME because I do enjoy problem solving and I enjoy physics/math. Now that my college career is over, I almost regret majoring in it and have zero motivation to enter the field but I have student debt so I need to. Honestly, taking all the coursework has bored me to death of the material. I really enjoy design, but I don't like designing machines and things i'm just not interested in. Im proud to have engineering degree but I don't think i picked the right one.

I feel that I would enjoy programing and computer science. It's a field in high demand and I love a lot of the companies that have open positions. My sister is in CS and it looks enjoyable. She said a lot of her coworkers don't have degrees in CS, they learned programs on their own. How can I enter the field? I think i'd enjoy the design and creativity aspect of it. Computer skills/programs that I know are below. Thank you!

I'm young, life will work itself out, and I'm notoriously great at worrying about nothing. But nonetheless, I would like some advice from people with more experience.

I just graduated from a BS in CS program. My GPA is not great (3.1), but not for lack of trying. I did a 180-degree change in majors, so I was enrolled in roughly 18 hours per semester in order to graduate on time. (I was concerned I would not be able to fund a 5th year in college, hence the higher-than-recommended workload.) Additionally, I worked for the entire duration of my college career to cover my tuition. This is all to say: I have not been twiddling my thumbs.

I do not have a full-time job lined up, and it's not easy to get an internship if not returning to school. I have decided to spend quarantine focused on preparing for interviews and working on personal projects, and I will continue my job hunt when it's over. But I feel like something is wrong with me. I have internship experience, and I get great feedback from my boss and coworkers (small software job), so why does it seem like no company is interested in me? (I should note, I am job hunting a large distance outside of my home state, which makes in-person networking difficult.)

I plan to reapply to some of the Big4 this summer, as I feel I have grown quite a bit as a software developer since I last applied. I am not hellbent on working for one of the large companies, I am honestly happy to work anywhere.

I know a lot of people are going through much worse, even highly experienced professionals have lost their jobs due to this virus. But does anyone have any advice for me? This is honestly an awful time to be graduating, and this virus has shot my anxiety through the roof. Is there a way I can make myself more marketable during all of this craziness? Did anyone experience the same issue with lack of employment upon graduation?

Thank you in advance. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and well, and good luck to everyone during this time."

And because of that, because I'm a student in pharmacy, and currently doing my internship at the hospital, I know I should be more than grateful for my life when I hear that so many people are hospitalised or die. I should be grateful for being healthy. For being born without a disease. I should be grateful for having a roof over my head. Clothes that can be worn. Warm food on the table. I should be grateful. 

But tonight, when I am feeling down, all I can feel is sadness. All I can think of, is how lonely I am. Because when I look around me, all I can see is people who succeeded in their studies when I failed my own selective exam, and if they did not find achieve something important in their professional life, they still have someone to love, someone to talk to, someone to trust. They still have that love that makes them going on. I fell in love once, and it was like a firework everyday. But I wished someone could love me. Really. 

And I know that I should be contented. I should be grateful for what I already have. But I can't help myself longing for those things too when I see these all around me.

It feels like what I am asking is too much. As if I already got all my wishes and now I don't get to have more gifts. I just wanted someone to love me. I just wanted to succeed in my life. 

And I hate myself for wanting so much when I should be more than grateful when I see how many people in this world are in a worse condition. Is it too much to ask really?

I am fortunate enough that my finance internship is going virtual (and is not cancelled), but as of now, all I have is a macbook air to use.

The bank I’m working for will be sending us laptops, but recommends we have additional screens.

My question is; should I buy a PC and monitor, or just a monitor? Should I buy two monitors?

I’m going to be using Excel frequently for financial modeling so I will also have to get a good keyboard for that as well. I will also need to have multiple screens open simultaneously (to look at documents/videos while modeling), but I am assuming one monitor, the laptop they send to us, and my personal mac will be enough screens. It would, however, be far more ideal to work on a single unit with multiple screens...can I attach the monitor(s) to the laptop they send?

What type of monitor(s), keyboard, and PC if necessary best suits these purposes? I want something that is sharp, has a high refresh rate, and ideally curved. I’d want this to be something I can use over the years. Also, I’m a bit interested in gaming if I do get a PC (particularly PUBG), but this is of less priority.

My budget for everything including monitor(s), keyboard, and PC if necessary, is anything under $800 but $1000 is okay if it is absolutely worth it. 

Thanks in advance."

Hey guys! I'm fairly new to the Reddit scene. I'm just a confused high school student who is using the magical website to help me with the periodic struggle of college. You guys are probably more knowledgeable than most people I know at this sort of stuff and I was wondering if you guys had any advice or college recommendations for me.

I am just **an above-average student** at my school and I consider myself to be involved at my high school and community. I really haven't thought about the prospective of college until this week and I have been doing research.

**Awards:** FBLA and TSA Nationals Competitor &amp; *Presidential Fitness Test Award (5th)*

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays:**

I have no idea what I am planning to write my essays on. I will probably write something that is extremely abstract so I can set myself apart from other prospective students. I like to do creative writing, so expect me to slip in a haiku, haha. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why do I need help:**

gje8vl,1,2020-05-13,Are there any possible career paths in IT for my mom? (background in post),advice_for_a_parent,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gje8vl/are_there_any_possible_career_paths_in_it_for_my/,"I'm looking for advice on possible 9 to 5 (preferably remote) career paths for a parent who has experience with starting and managing education-related businesses.

**Some more details:**

My mom has spent the past several years starting and running two educational franchises; one is a tutoring center and the other is STEM-related summer camps for kids. She's got a lot of experience working with people and in the area of education for kids. She started and ran two franchises on her own with a very minimal help from me or my dad. They don't make much money though (or at least not enough for it be better than a 9 to 5 job).

She has a degree in computer science but it's from a long time ago and wasn't really used so she doesn't know much about writing modern software. I believe her degree would only be useful for getting past automatic resume screenings that tend to look for a degree.

We're looking for a job that would allow my mom to work 9 to 5 with low stress and still make money. We're not necessarily looking for a lucrative career path because my dad has a job and I'll be starting a job soon. My mom is tired of running two businesses and is looking for an income-generating substitute.

Personally I think she should do something that leverages her experience working with people and in the area of education but I'm not exactly sure what she should do. She's willing to take online courses and learn new skills if it takes less than a year to acquire training and get a job.

My mom has been considering Lambda School because students can pay after they get a job but she's getting a bit old so agism is going to hurt her chances of finding a job in software development and I'm seeing some bad reviews for Lambda School. Freecodecamp seems like a better option than Lambda School. I've done some software engineering internships and I'll be starting a job as a new grad engineer soon so I can help her out with learning new stuff, filling out job applications, creating a resume, and interview preparation. I see that [some companies like microsoft have some online certifications in all sorts of technical stuff](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-overview.aspx) but not sure how useful it is for getting a job.

For additional context, we live a hour out from D.C. and my mom is a US citizen.

We'd prefer a job that leverages her existing management and education-related skills while being 9 to 5 with low stress but we care more about the job being 9 to 5 with low stress.

Any advice on possible 9 to 5 career paths in IT?"

It took me 6 years, I graduated with a 2.4 GPA, I had to take calc II 3 times, calc III 2 times, and diff eq 2 times, but I did it.

Despite my low GPA, I was able to obtain both an internship *and* a co-op (6 month internship) during the course of my education, each at a different company. 

Despite my low GPA, I was flown and drove all over the country in the fall semester to interview with 8 different companies, 4 of which presented me with job offers. The job offer I accepted, which wasn't with either of the companies I interned with, starts at $76k per year.

A low GPA is not the end of the world. It won't be as easy to find a job as someone with a perfect 4.0, but it's not going to be impossible. If I could do it, so can you.

I am all for pushing and pushing to reach a goal, but at some point, you have to face reality that it might not happen.

It sucks, I get it.

There is no need to move on completely.  You can send out some resumes on the side while you turn your attention elsewhere.

Why do I bring this up?

Over the past week, I have had several engineers who have reached out to me and are hesitant to move on to anything beyond their internship search.

Again, I commend the drive, but there will come a point where it simply is not going to come through for this summer. 

By keeping up the internship search at 100%, you are losing out on the other opportunities that are presented.

No, they won't have the same experience and value as the internship.  However, they will be better than nothing, which is the path you are on right now.

You can give it another week or two, but when June rolls around and you still have no internship, I think it is time for Plan B."

I am an Econ major intending to internally transfer / double major in business as well. I am currently enrolled in Notre Dame’s College of Arts and Letters, however I have just been admitted into Georgetown College (D.C.) off of the waitlist. I have made a list of advantages for each school below. (Cost will be about the same)

Notre Dame:
-Sports / school spirit (I’ve rooted for ND Football my whole life)
- Better school environment ( higher graduation rate, higher retention rate, have heard only good things, etc.)
-Potentially smarter / more hard-working peers (have higher SATs and HS GPAs, whereas parent’s clout may help for admission into Georgetown, feel free to disabuse me in the comments)
- Higher endowment, and thus larger budget for better quality education
- Very strong alumni network
- I’m Irish-American, so I have a slight bias toward ND

Georgetown:
- Not as strict (less archaic rules such as parietals)
- Closer to home (I’m from the East Coast, but still a few hours from Gtown)
- Higher regional prestige
- More internship opportunities
- Very liberal (I’m moderate, and political talk of either kind bothers me)
- less emphasis on Faith (while I’m technically Catholic, I believe more Protestant theology, I don’t practice either though)
-No weird gender relations like I’ve heard about ND

If I missed something or am wrong about or overemphasizing something please let me know. Any insight helps. Thank you."

I have chosen USA because of my convenience to enter the country legally and work. In the long run, I’d like to help my parents settle and retire in US territory.

•Should I expect to get hired as an unpayed intern?

•How can I seek for housing and housing areas? I’m not sure what I’ll be able to afford and I don’t know how to find what the good and bad areas of town are.

I want to preface this story by saying that I am not a physician or dietician.

I used common sense, research, my doctor's encouragement, and ultimately went all-in on what worked for me, discarded what didn't, and put in the time and hardheadedness required. I will not give nutritional advice here. I focus on mindsets, not meal plans.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: The desire to change must outweigh the desire to stay the same.

I had to take responsibility for the role my behavior was playing in the results I was getting in life.

Through taking ownership of my mess, I was able to do something about it.

&amp;#x200B;

From a young age, I was EXTREMELY dysthymic.

Symptoms of dysthymia include:

* Loss of interest in daily activities
* Sadness, emptiness or feeling down
* Hopelessness
* Tiredness and lack of energy
* Low self-esteem, self-criticism or feeling incapable
* Trouble concentrating and trouble making decisions
* Irritability or excessive anger
* Decreased activity, effectiveness and productivity
* Avoidance of social activities
* Feelings of guilt and worries over the past
* Poor appetite or overeating
* Sleep problems

I was the kid who would sit in bed and read all day, refuse offers to take me to the movies or beach, sit and bite my fingernails while all of the other kids at school played at recess, and responded to every attempt to get me to participate with an annoyed sigh or a shrug.

When everyone else I knew was going to karate, boy scouts, or the pool, I sat by myself.

I had no self-esteem, no confidence, no energy or motivation to change. I knew something was very, very wrong, but I didn't like myself, so why would I take care of someone I didn't even like?

I was put on a different medication every few months and saw therapists and specialists in several states, but nothing ever stuck. I had an issue with authority, I didn't want to do the work, and as I got older I found punk rock and developed a rebellious streak, and I stopped taking medication so that I could 'stay real'. I struggled in school and eventually dropped out. I went to a federally funded trade school a year later when my mom gave me a 'do it or you're out on your own' ultimatum, learned some business and office skills, completed a few internships, and was looking like I was on track to get a pretty comfortable job and possibly develop professionally. I was extremely articulate, sensitive, empathetic, and could easily get excited about creative projects that fit my extremely specific interests, but due to my attitude, I didn't appreciate any of these qualities, and I didn't apply myself at all after graduation. Things got worse as I failed to find work and my anxiety and frustration with myself grew. Eventually, I was put on social security disability benefits due to becoming entirely despondent and unable (which was unwillingness mistaken for inability) to get out of bed, bathe, brush my teeth, or do much of anything to take care of myself. This continued for about 11 years.

I got up to 400+lb, I smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes every day, I didn't leave my house except to buy soda and candy, and I resigned myself to dying of a heart attack by 40. Nothing interested me except escapism. I played video games for 14 hours a day. That is not an exaggeration. Despite all of my issues, I was somehow considered endearing and managed to find a girlfriend who I moved in with for several years. I was not a good boyfriend. It's hard to be a good boyfriend when you're more focused on how unhappy you are than how unhappy your partner is.

Eventually, after understandable relationship issues, I moved back home and once again resigned myself to more of the same. I met someone through an online community who offered to help coach me through weight loss, but she ultimately flaked and I never heard from her. That had been my moment. I had spent so many years feeling like I couldn't lose weight because the exercise was hard, and I told myself that I could never give up pizza and candy and soda. I imagined having to run on a treadmill for two hours every night and eat only unseasoned chicken breast and boiled broccoli. It seemed miserable, and I didn't believe in myself, so I never really tried. I would daydream about finding a magic lamp and using one of my wishes to be transformed into someone skinny, attractive, and confident. So when this person ghosted me, my initial reaction was pain, betrayal, frustration, and this victim mentality that ""well, of COURSE, she gave up on me. Everyone does.""

At that moment, something clicked, and everything changed. It hit me like a bolt of lightning.

I could not control other people, and that meant that if I left things up to other people, I would never be able to guarantee that I'd get what I needed to feel secure. But I was in control of myself - and that meant that I had the power to determine what I thought, what I felt, how I behaved, and ultimately, the results I would get out of my life.

While there is some small amount of terror in knowing that you alone are responsible for your outcomes, there is also relief and empowerment. You can't rely on anyone else...and you don't have to.

I was not helpless. I was not a victim. I simply had unhelpful beliefs and attitudes.

I thought about the magic lamp and realized that if I spent even 10% of the time I was wasting on daydreaming on taking action instead, I'd be unstoppable. I didn't need a genie. I was the genie.

I started my weight loss journey in late 2017, and a little under 2 years later, I had gone from weighing over 400lb to 172. My original goal had been to try to get as skinny as possible, but I started losing my hair and people were asking if I was OK, so I figured it was time to chill.

I figured I'd get big again, but strategically, this time.

I quit smoking cold-turkey and started lifting weights and running at a gym 5 times a week. (I'm up to 215ish now, but I can do pushups, so it's a fair trade.)

I stopped playing video games for 14 hours a day and started going to church and volunteering in my community. I eventually recovered all of my mental and physical health issues (prediabetic, sleep apnea, gout, chronic migraines and heartburn, among others) and was deemed fit to return to work. With the income I'd always relied upon gone, I learned how to write a resume, went on job interviews, and landed my first full-time job in over a decade. At that point, I realized my purpose in life. After so many years of thinking I was the victim, I couldn't do anything, I was too this or too that, I overcame all of my ailments, my addictions, my insecurities, my supposed inadequacies, and found unshakeable confidence and inner conviction. I feel a calling to share that with others. The universe granted me that spark of clarity which inspired me to do a 180 in life, and I hope this story inspires you to realize what you're capable of.

Seriously.

If a guy like me could get it together, anyone can."

But have I never in that time programed anything. Until recently..

By end of last year (2019) i started to learn programing, cus I got tired and broke paying other people to program for me. And I fell in love with the code, I like it. Right now I am engaged in Bootcamp in my country and I am one of top students. 

Regarding my interests in startups I would love to get an internship in one of them in Germany. Especially if they are based in Berlin. That would be ideal situation. But I also know that I am no position to be picky about this one. 

Visa laws writes that I could get the visa but my monthly budget must be around 900€ (which should come from salary, everything below I need to compensate from my pocket) and I need to have legitimate internship provider (of course). And my thoughts are also that I need to by under 25yo. So you see that I have time limit for this to roll out.

The issue is the manager (who uses the master workbook) wants to give feedback in a “remarks” column found in both workbooks. However, my connection only allows a one way edit; staff A can edit on his workbook and the edit will be reflecting on master but if I type in “master”, it won’t be reflected on “Staff A workbook”.

Did I do something wrong/miss something out? Would appreciate all possible solutions for this and if you have a better method to handle such data, do suggest! 

Much appreciated!"

gjmp2m,2,2020-05-14,OPT requirement for MBA US internship,hudida,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/gjmp2m/opt_requirement_for_mba_us_internship/,"Hi guys,

I am an international admit (residing outside US) enrolling this Fall. Due to the virus, and recent discussion with admits, I feel the need to ask questions to clarify my doubts. The concern is whether we can do internship in the US next year. 

1. US regulation: OPT = able to intern in US, can only be given if a student completes 1 full year (2 semester) of study. **If Fall (Semester 1) is fully virtual, no OPT (aka no internship) regardless of whether you are present in the States for fall semester? (Yes/No)**
2. If the answer to 1) is Yes, then **if I am in the States for Fall semester and do a full virtual sem,  I am eligible for OPT. (Yes/No)**
3. If the answer to 2) is Yes, then it means I'll need to enter the States for Fall semester (assume Sept start date). My current I-20 start date is September. **However, my school implies that should Fall sem be fully virtual, they'll have to change I-20 date to Spring 2021 (assume Jan 2021). Is this legally required? (Yes/No)**
4. If the answer to 3) is Yes, it means I'll have a F1 visa (currently in process) based on the old I-20 (Sept2020), and a new I-20 issued by school with a revised start date. **Can I still enter the States with the old I-20 and valid F-1? (Yes/No). Will customs be able to verify whether there was an updated I-20? (Yes/No)**

I am writing these questions built upon the previous one, as if the answer to the previous question is otherwise, then there's no need to go down the list.

Really hope to find answer from you guys.

Cheers"

I hope everyone here is doing their best to stay safe and healthy. I am using a throwaway to try to avoid doxxing myself.

So I am somewhere between a junior and senior level computer science student. I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed but I work hard in school and have a 4.0 GPA.

I got pretty lucky and received an internship offer for this summer from a local government contractor. I have a couple somewhat trivial personal projects on my resume and definitely spoke about my coding abilities in my interview. I don't have a ton of coding experience, but I am a strong problem solver and good at figuring things out on my own.

Anyways, I got an email this morning from the gentleman that I'll be working under. He gave me a very brief description of the project I'll be working on and I'm not too sure what to make of it. 

""We will be working together on a project to increase the flexibility and security of our desktop environment. As part of that effort, we will be developing hardware agnostic Image that will have security settings built in to the image."" 

I am totally unfamiliar with this type of work and what I'm wondering is: does this sound like something that would involve much coding? My main goal with an internship was to get some hands-on coding experience in a professional setting. While I am grateful for the opportunity and the pay is pretty good for my area, I am worried that I might have been able to gain more valuable experience by dedicating my time outside of my summer class to working a personal project to learn in-demand skills. 

I would appreciate any input you guys and girls can offer me on this. 

Thanks and stay well!"

I took several computer science courses in college but straight out of college, thinking that I'd go to medical school, I've been working in research labs for the past 2 years. I did a bit of programming on these jobs using Matlab mainly. I also did a lot of basic statistical analysis as well (simple, multiple linear regression, ANOVA, paired t-tests). 

Relevant technical courses-wise I've taken during college: data structures &amp; algorithms, data structures &amp; advanced programming, fundamentals of computer science, and intro to computer science. Linear algebra, combinatorics, discrete math, and statistical linear modeling (which is mainly a course on linear regression). 

I'm trying to find work as a software engineer now.

In terms of interviews, I've interviewed at Facebook and Google before for their software engineering intern positions but I didn't make it during college (this was almost 4 years ago). A few months ago I had another interview for a programming job but failed to pass the technical interview.

I feel like I should work on my technical interview/coding questions - spend some good time there. But I also feel like I should spend some time working on a project for my resume. I was thinking about doing a coding bootcamp like HackReactor but it's quite expensive ($18k) and seeing that I know how to write about my past job experiences to at least land interviews I felt like if I brushed up on my technical interview skills and maybe worked on a project or two to get good at a language people are hiring for, I could find a job. I'm looking at a career in software engineering long-term. I could go back to school in the distant future for a masters but trying to see if I could land a job in the field with what I have so far. Also, I was thinking about doing projects in C++, Python, or R but getting good at either C++ or Python. 

I worked in a orthopedic surgery biomechanics lab in NY for about a year, where we programmed a robot in Matlab to do perform tests on sectioned knee cadavers. 

Before that I did a year at stanford med school neurobiology department working also in matlab working with an eye motion tracking system and webcamera - so working with image data and such. 

I have a background working in a clinical environment also as an emergency medicine scribe in case that could help. 

GPA: 3.8 

Would anybody here happen to have any advice?.."

I’m a dental graduate looking to apply to Imperial and UCL next year for their conversion MSc CompSci, although I missed the UCL deadline this year, I was able to apply to Imperial few days ago. I’m doubtful I’ll get in this year because of the competition and how late I’ve applied.

So I was wondering whether going though the OSSU course here - “https://github.com/ossu/computer-science”, is a good idea, along with self teaching web development. Are these all I can be doing for the next year and a half when hopefully I can apply and successfully get into those top courses?

I want to do a MSc to be able to stand out to bigger tech companies that have stringent HR, as I hear some companies still want a formal education background and to be more competitive, as well as demonstrating my commitment to a career change.

I’m a bit wary of going out to find internships or jobs related to tech because I’ve heard that for example UCL have rejected applicants based on having this sort of past experience.

The situation is very different from past years because competition has become stiffer locally (great students choosing to apply for local schools instead of overseas ( demand increase supply stagnant/decrease so higher competition). 

So in view of this, what will your plans be, especially for girls, because you don’t have NS. Gap year? Retake? Private U?Appeal?

Edit: I read some of the comments and thought i can share about my experiences. I actually took a gap year too. Finished NS in 2019. Decided on a gap year so i withdrew from my sch of computing course NUS BZA. I wanted to gain exposure and perspectives and felt that what I spend time doing during gap year can nourish me with insights which allows me to make more well-thought through decisions and actions in uni. So i took on 2 internships, and was selected for SSEAYP(Ship for Southeast Asian and Japanese Youth Program) by National Youth Council, went solo-backpack-king and was awarded a 21 day obs camp (LSA) too. If you ask me did i have any regrets for entering one year later than my peers, what i will want to say is : It’s your life, so if you see value in taking the unconventional path, and you have thought through well, do have belief in yourself and try. I have no regrets and now I’m excited for university !! 

That being said, not everyone can afford a gap year because of financial concerns. Some might have to finish uni asap to start working since the parents are old.

Do pm me if u wanna find out more abt gap year, or why i did what i did :D"

gjtgn1,57,2020-05-14,Researching Colleges from Home,theadmissionsangle,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gjtgn1/researching_colleges_from_home/,"*Researching colleges is an integral  part of the application process. It’s important to feel out a school,  preferably in person, to see if it’s a good fit. However, 2020 is not a great year for college visits. Now, more than ever, it’s important to understand the process of researching colleges from home.*  

Since the outbreak of coronavirus, [colleges have closed their doors](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/how-coronavirus-changed-college-for-over-14-million-students.html), reverting to online systems. It goes without saying that for the foreseeable future, in-person guided tours are out of the question. But this adds an element of complication beyond the concept of applying blindly to colleges that you might not have considered. Many colleges depend heavily on “[demonstrated interest](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristenmoon/2019/09/17/10-ways-students-can-use-demonstrated-interest-to-their-benefit/#226309d74431)” as a metric for admitting students. A college ideally wants every person they admit to eventually matriculate, and the more excited a student seems, the more likely they are to matriculate. A student may demonstrate interest in many ways-- opening emails and reaching out to professors, for example. But historically, an [in-person campus visit](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2018-05-21/what-demonstrated-interest-means-in-college-admissions) has been a dominant metric for determining this interest. 

Therefore, college research is critical for two reasons. First, it is important to choose the right fit and collect details for your essays. And second, it is an important practice for demonstrating interest. In this article, we will explain methods for researching colleges from home for both of these purposes.  


## Start with “The Big List”

If you didn’t catch it already, we posted an [article on building a college list](https://www.theadmissionsangle.com/2020/04/27/how-to-create-a-college-list/) last week. To recap, the first step of this process is to build what we call “The Big List.” The Big List is going to comprise every school that you could potentially be interested in. Then, you will research further to pare this list down and determine the best fits. 

We recommend that you build your big list by first doing a little Google-fu. Search for “best undergraduate x programs” wherein x represents your field of study. This search will turn up lists with rankings for certain colleges and degrees. Of course, the top schools on this list are likely to be Ivy League, but some of the results may surprise you. Scan through the list and take note of any schools that may be able to accommodate your academic goals while ruling out no-gos based on location, expense, minimum specs etc. In the end, your list should comprise twenty or more schools, which will give you a starting point for your research. 

If you don’t know what you want to study, then you may choose some other metric for building your big list, such as location, student life, or post-graduate starting salaries. That said, we generally advocate applying to colleges with a specific field of study in mind.   


## Go to the source: official school websites

The next step is to research each individual school so that you can eliminate non-options from your big list. First, you’ll want to check out each college’s official website. However, it is important to remember that colleges have excellent marketing teams, just like any other industry. They are presenting a [perfectly cultivated profile](https://admission.stanford.edu/academics/undergrad/index.html) to prospective students, which may not be entirely accurate. When looking at schools’ official websites, we recommend looking at the pages geared toward [current students](https://registrar.stanford.edu/) for a more accurate look at student life and opportunities. Each [department is likely to have its own website](https://dlcl.stanford.edu/departments/german-studies/about), which you can check out to see events, news, faculty, and course offerings. While you are investigating, take notes on the things that interest you. You can use these notes later on for your Why Us essays. 

After a while, schools might start to look the same. There are a number of websites that exist to [compare schools](https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/compare-colleges) and to even help you find schools in exchange for your personal information. If you are okay with having your [personal data commodified](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2019/11/15/college-board-student-names/), then these tools can be great for helping you narrow down your list.   


## Think quantitatively 

After you have a look at the above items, take a peek at the available data and statistics. Schools often make their admissions statistics public, so you can see the percentage of students admitted as well as GPA and test scores of admitted students. Some schools even break down this data by academic program. You can look at this data to determine whether a school falls into a dream, reach, target, or safety category based on your own qualifications. 

Another valuable piece of data to include in your research is “outcome data”. Google “(school name) [career outcomes](https://www.nyu.edu/students/student-information-and-resources/career-development-and-jobs/programs-and-reports/career-outcomes-surveys.html)” or “[(School name) first destination surveys](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey)” to check out data based on starting salaries after graduation, percentage of students in the workforce, etc. You will find that some schools are particularly known for producing highly employable graduates, which is a metric to consider when researching colleges.   


## Think qualitatively

Getting an idea of a school’s layout can help you visualize whether it’s a good fit. Many colleges are trying their best to post videos of campus tours. However, independent companies also offer fantastic resources. We like [YouVisit](https://www.youvisit.com/collegesearch/), which offers campus tours using 360 views compatible with VR headset, if you’re that fancy. You can click around to have a look at school facilities while a virtual tour guide explains what you are looking at. 

But aside from aesthetics, student life is an important consideration for whether a school is right for you or not. It’s best to start by reaching out to current students within your social circles or school communities. Students like this are more likely to give you honest answers to your pressing questions. Then, we recommend moving outside of your network. We recommend [CampusReel](https://www.campusreel.org/), which offers short videos made by current students. These videos can give you a powerful glimpse into student life, dorms and other facilities, and the general atmosphere of a school. 

We also suggest checking out Youtube for informal vlogs. Although we cannot speak to the usefulness of all vlogs, we suggest searching for vloggers with fewer followers (non-”influencers”), as they are less likely to be trying to sell you something.

And finally, almost every college will have a subreddit that you can check out. Many of these informal internet communities have content that is immature, offensive, or meme-ish in nature. However, if you are willing to wade through this, you can find a lot of useful nuggets of information from real students. These communities also offer a platform for you to ask anonymous questions and are generally a good way to understand a student population.  


## Attend formal informational sessions

After completing the above steps, you should have a pretty good idea of where you are trying to apply. But making your list is only half of the research battle. The next step, as I mentioned in the introduction, is demonstrating your interest. To reiterate, schools will often check to see how much enthusiasm you have shown towards matriculating and use that data as a metric in their decision. 

The second best thing to a campus visit is a formal informational session, of which admissions departments will often note attendance. Since informational sessions are not available in person, schools are offering online informational sessions, which can be just as useful. Think of questions to ask, and take note of who is giving the presentation. You might be able to use this person’s name in an essay later on. There are also a number of [virtual college fairs](https://www.strivescan.com/) that are ongoing during this time, wherein school officials are [offering sessions via Zoom](https://admission.cmu.edu/portal/information_session_webinar). These are also considered official events, but may be offered by someone other than the school itself.

Try to engage in sessions not only for the school, but also for the department you are applying to. Student groups are also offering online Q and A sessions that you can use to learn about faculty and other opportunities. But in the case of any official session, keep in mind that the information you’re receiving is carefully curated to avoid negative information.   


## Reach out to the school 

Outreach is a favorable (and often overlooked) aspect of the application process. For any school that you are serious about, but especially at the “reach” level, we suggest reaching out to a regional representative from the admissions office. Even if a school does not regard demonstrated interest in the decision making process, they might when considering financial aid and scholarships, so in any case, it’s a good idea. 

The names and email addresses for regional admissions officers are available on school websites. When you are [contacting these people](https://admission.cmu.edu/portal/adm_counseling_session_videocon), make sure to inquire specifically about the program you are interested in using details from your research. Demonstrated interest is counterproductive if it looks too general. 

We also recommend reaching out to a faculty member from the department that you are interested in to ask questions. Here is a sample email for outreach: 

&amp;#x200B;

*Hi Dr. (Professor name),*

*My name is (name), a rising senior attending (school name), and I'm writing you to inquire about the (name of department) department at Penn. After careful consideration and countless hours of research/college tours, I am strongly considering applying to Penn for early decision, in particular, for the Science, Technology, and Society major. I've always had a significant interest in the evolution of medical practice and technology in society, and thus, have written a research paper on (details of STS related paper). I believe the STSC department will provide similar but unique resources that will allow me to dig deeper into my research interests and academic endeavors.*

*One of my strongest criteria for the university I wish attend is the opportunity to conduct undergraduate research, so I was hoping that you could answer some questions I have about undergraduate research/internship opportunities within the History and Sociology of Science departments.*

*First, after applying for the Penn Undergraduate Research Mentoring Program (PURM), will archival research be assisted by the faculty member and do these research projects produce research papers that often get published? Second, in order to apply for the University of Pennsylvania Press Summer Internships, are there any courses or research programs that need to be fulfilled in order to show my suitability for the program? Third, after finalizing a research project through Center for Undergraduate Research &amp; Fellowships (CURF), are all students eligible to participate in the research expo and open house, and is that event annual? Last, but not least, can you let me know if there are any research opportunities specific to the STSC major that I may not be able to find out about on the Penn website?*

*I know these are a lot of questions but I am genuinely excited to hear back from you and explore diverse research opportunities offered at Penn.* 

*Thank you!*

*Sincerely,*  
*(student name)*

&amp;#x200B;

Reaching out like this is a great way to begin a dialogue while giving yourself something to talk about on the Why Us and Why Major essays.  
 

## Going forward

Of course, nothing beats an in-person campus visit, so as soon as schools are open again, we recommend trying to schedule yours. But in the meantime, researching colleges from home, aside from providing useful information, can help to boost your odds of admission. Do your best to reach out, stay apprised, and build an admissions strategy that fits your unique situation."

I extremely appreciate all responses, opinions, and pieces of advice!
I have a a few pros and cons of my own for each:

Mac CS Pros
- only a 30 minute commute
- smaller program, so you get to know your professors and cohort better
- co-op (so I get more chances at different companies, but not learn as much)
- not as hard of a program so easier to get a good GPA
- better school-life balance than UofT (imo)

Mac CS Cons
- there were quite a few people online saying that the program isn't good (but I've talked to people currently in the program and they had no complaints at all)
- I don't think the internship opportunities are AS great as UofT
- overall just mixed reviews of the program

UTSG CS Pros
- a well reputed school with a reputed CS program
- employers maybe favour a UofT degree over others (for STEM)
- PEY (learn a lot, but only have one 12 month shot at it. also, could get my own internships in other summers)
- I kinda like the city life (although I don't mind the feel at Mac. But it might suck in the winter?)

UTSG CS Cons
- about a 1 hour 15 minute commute
- harder to get a high GPA
- not a great school-life balance
- only one PEY internship term (12-16 months), so if it sucks then that's not good (but could find own internships during other summers)

You don't necessarily have to tailor your response according to my pros and cons, your own advice works great! Advice specific to my pros and cons would help too though! Thanks!"

First and foremost I hope you have all been well, were living in interesting times to say the least. I just wanted to reach out to you all because I am slowly but surely reaching a significant crossroad in my life. I am currently a sophomore Comp Sci major with big dreams to try to make my mark on the world through my pursuit of cyber security. I was recently admitted into a LEP cyber security program at my university and (despite early troubles) have started getting myself on track to pursue my dreams.

Before I continue I would like to lay out my \*dream\* scenario. I would like to (one day) start and manage my own security firm focused on either security consulting or offering software based security solutions (software to aid preexisting security professionals). I am sure my goals and focus will become more specific when I take my higher level classes, so I am not overly concerned with my goals being relatively vague at the moment. This leads me to the two problems I am currently facing.

My first problem is that, due to COVID-19, I will not be able to gain any valuable internship experience this summer. The problem is I still want to separate myself and still gain new marketable skills. My current plan is to develop practical skills in development, network administration, and database administration through doing personal projects in my home lab and thoroughly documenting my progress. This information would then be stored in a database accessible through a personal website linked on my resume. I feel that this is the best path, but I am unsure what concepts I should try to learn first. If any of you have any recommendations, I would really appreciate it! To help you understand my current skill set, I am well versed with Java and PostgreSQL, pretty good with Python, and I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My second question (which hopefully is easier to answer) is how I should proceed once I graduate. I admittedly love school, and have thought about pursuing a Master's Degree quite often, but it always seems like experience trumps everything in cyber security professions. Would it be more worthwhile to simply enter the workforce as soon as I graduate or would a graduate degree really help me separate myself?

Thank you to all of you in advance! I'm actually about to take a math final right now so forgive me if I respond late! I also understand that the first question is VERY open ended which makes it rather hard to answer. If you do not feel like answering the first question but do have input on my second question, I would love to hear your thoughts!"

- Instructors: Can grade students’ lessons and can view their students based on the type of flight license they are teaching. 

- Admin: Can add students to a syllabus by creating a login for them, remove students, add/remove different types of syllabus’, and can basically edit every student’s information and change their instructor.

I have an interesting idea for an app. I can't say much about it apart that it has to do with Health intensives. Every coder and business major I have consulted say it's a great idea and that I should create a draft with a NDA for any potential partners.  

This would require getting a dependable team of developers that would know how to work with languages like flutter, C++, Python, React, Swift and more. All things that i am a total novice at.

 I want to get some experience working with other coders. An internship or a part time position would be great. I am avoiding the companies that sign you on to a two year contract. Ihave been warned about Revature and co. 

What would be the best way to go about and talking to coders willing to collaborate and to gain experience coding in a working environment? AND. What is the best way to get my foot into the door with under a year of experience?

gjvzn9,1,2020-05-14,What’s the Better Option for a Recent Grad Going Into Commercial Real Estate?,prodigyac,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/gjvzn9/whats_the_better_option_for_a_recent_grad_going/,"I have CRE investment experience as a summer analyst for 2 large CRE investment firms. I have networked a lot over the past 2 years and was in the interview stages with a couple companies before they got postponed due to COVID-19. It seems that no CRE company is hiring right now. I have 2 current options.

Option 1: I have the opportunity to intern for one of the companies I have prior experience with and the option to leave whenever if I get a full time offer somewhere else.

Option 2: I also have the opportunity to intern for a different (and more well known) CRE company but would be fully tied to the internship for the entire summer. I think interning here would be good because I would be getting experience at a different company but also don’t want to be tied down to an internship if I get a full time offer somewhere else half way during the summer.

 

My biggest question is, do you guys think CRE companies will be hiring full time analysts in the next 10-12 weeks? If not, it might be best to go with option 2. Besides the state of the economy, I also feel like companies won’t be hiring analysts this summer because they probably have interns that can fill an analyst’s role until the summer ends. What would you guys do in this situation?"
gjwu81,1,2020-05-14,CU Boulder or UF?,fpicoral,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gjwu81/cu_boulder_or_uf/,"Hey guys, how are you doing?

I'm down to only these two universities  - UF and CU Boulder - and was looking for some advice. In both universities I was accepted into Computer Science in the Engineering School and from what I researched, they are very similar academics wise.

The only negative aspect I can think of UF is the fact that it's on a very isolated location, while CU Boulder is 30min away from Denver; don't get me wrong - I don't care about the city or if it's boring or not, but from an internship perspective, Boulder seems way more attractive, since there are a handful of offices from big companies just minutes away from campus.

Before I start, just want to say I would appreciate any help, thanks a lot!!!

A few background information:
I’m an international student and did my undergrad in US as a policy analysis major in a top ranked program somewhere Midwest. I want to focus on social policy or data privacy policy in my graduate program; for post-graduate, I would like to find a job in large intergovernmental organizations like UN and hope they can assign me to their European office, but I’m also willing to stay in North America. The tuitions and financial packages provided by both schools are similar so expenses/tuitions are not issues for me now, I’ve also lived in both Chicago and DC before and enjoyed, so maybe just education quality and career impact. 

Something I care:
1. Ranking and reputation. U of C is a top-ranked school with high international reputation. If I ended up not getting a job in US, the Chicago graduate title would definitely guarantee me great job in private sector at my home country. Georgetown has a nice rank too, but GU is mostly famous for international studies outside US so less choices.

2. Location. DC, the policy center of North America (just my own view lol if anyone disagrees), many international organizations have offices in the area, also close to NYC and Philly, so a lot career opportunities. Chicago is a large city too, but as someone lived in Midwest for 4 years, I would say Chicago is the only big city we have in this area😂

3. Career opportunities. As mentioned above, the benefit of living in DC is a bonus on this, also there are more internship opportunities in regular semester if I’m looking for some positions in international organizations. The opportunities related to public policy I can find in Chicago is usually more domestic focus. However, bring back to the reputation issue, since my long-term career plan is not focused on US, so maybe UofC means more opportunities international-wide.
 
4. Study abroad opportunities. I studied abroad almost my whole undergrad in US, also spent some time in Germany and France, and I’m thinking about do a semester exchange in my graduate school. GU has a program to Hertie that I’m interested in, but it seems like U of C does not have many options on this.

5. Capstone opportunities. GU has a capstone that students can choose to write a thesis or do a client-based project, but there’s nothing on U of C’s curriculum about this, and the thesis there is optional.

6. Class size. Most courses in MPP programs have a 20-30 class size, but core courses for MPP in U of C has a 60+ class size, this somehow confused me...

7. Policy area focuses. Both U of C and GU are famous for social policy, but it seems like U of C is better on data privacy.

8. Alumni connections. One point for GU! But I’m not sure if connections work in international organizations as they work in private sector.

9. Convenience for moving. It’s easy for me to move to Chicago from where I live now, of course there are more troubles for moving to DC from Midwest.

Above are some differences I figured out for U of C and GU when look through what I care about for graduate programs. I tried to ask people I know, but they have different views and just made this decision harder lol. For example, my capstone professor said UofC is the best option among all my offers based on academic quality, my career advisor said GU is better if I want to work in UN, my mentor (got his MPA in Harvard and working in public service consulting) helped me to eliminate usc on my list although I had already accepted their offer (sry usc :/

I have no friends going to these schools and most of the friends I made in the past 4 years have different majors (policy analysis is one of the smallest majors in my undergrad actually and I’m the only or maybe two of the only international student out there, so the only time I met all my fellow 2020 graduate policy majors at once was in my capstone lol), therefore after talking to faculties and professors, I’m hoping to find some current or previous MPP students here to see what other students think 🤔 

Again, thanks so much for anyone spend time to read this and willing to give some suggestions!"

* English teacher (8.5): nominated my works for in-school competitions, so I assume she thought highly of me   
* Latin teacher (9.5): is very extra about his writing and knew me since 9th grade  
* Guidance counselor (6.5): I basically told him what to write  
* Additional rec (?/10): conductor at a HYPSM school's orchestra who also conducts for my youth symphony, but I'm unsure of the rating because more talented kids also asked for a rec. I got rejected from the school he works for, which is a big rip because 5+ or **20 FRICKIN PERCENT** of the other graduating seniors in our program got in and are matriculating there

**Interviews**

* Amazing: Brown, Princeton, UPenn
* Solidly Good: Yale, Northwestern, Georgetown
* OK: Harvard, Stanford, Tufts
* WTF: Dartmouth (lasted 15 min and he didn't ask me any questions. Really bizarre)
* N/A: Columbia, UChicago, Williams, Amherst, Boston College, Northeastern, UMass Amherst

**Essays** 

Won't rate, but I think I'm a good writer. I reduced, reused, and recycled extensively because I was tired af

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Stanford RD: very surprised because a. I didn't send in a music supplement, b. my interview was not very memorable, c. it's Stanford
* Brown RD
* Williams RD
* Amherst RD
* Georgetown RD
* Boston College RD
* UMass Amherst RD

*Waitlists:*

* UChicago RD
* Northwestern RD
* UPenn RD
* Dartmouth RD
* Northeastern RD: to be fair, I showed 0 demonstrated interest

*Rejections:*

* Harvard REA (after deferral)
* Yale RD
* Princeton RD
* Columbia RD
* Tufts RD: yep.

**Reflections**

* I regret applying early to my dream school because my essays were pretty trash back then. REA/SCEA is also brutal because the competition is fierce
* This is just anecdotal, but I really don't think the average (not wildly terrible or amazing) interview matters, unless it's for Harvard
* First semester grades definitely matter (I PMed williamthereader after I got back my shitty report card), but Stanford seems to be more lenient than other top schools
* I’m not sure if I should’ve asked for the additional rec? I guess the HYPSM faculty part helped with my credibility and I’m assuming it was positive given that he agreed to do it, but I genuinely don’t know what he wrote
* I think having an obscure major with ECs + awards to match really helped me
* I wrote all my RD supplements during winter break, which was a terrible idea. It worked out, but would not recommend—those two weeks were absolutely horrific
* I redacted a lot of information for privacy reasons, but you can PM me if you want deets. I'm really not that interesting though
* Also, I think I’ll read my admissions file once I get to Stanford. I’ll keep y’all updated

Hope this helped! I'm headed to Stanford this fall (fingers crossed for no Zoom). Good luck to all future rising seniors!"

As for other side project ideas, are there any tips on where to start? I've taken most of the core classes at Cornell so far (2110, 3110, 3410), and I know part of CS is learning as you go, so I know there's a fair amount of learning when it comes to pursuing something of your own;  I have some ideas but they're very far fetched and cool in theory, so I wanted to start out with something more simple and feasible.

gk0k5r,7,2020-05-14,"22M, I had a shred of self-confidence when I was 16, and that's not working out too well",doyafeelme,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/gk0k5r/22m_i_had_a_shred_of_selfconfidence_when_i_was_16/,"Well, against the advice of all of you, I got a BFA in Theatre Arts.

It's a prestigious conservatory, if you're in the theatre field. If you're not, it gets destroyed in the Big East every year with mediocre academics. Graduated magna cum laude in June, got double minors in education and business admin.

I worked as a summer camp counselor teaching theatre, then I took on four internships at arts organizations, one in the box office, one in development (fundraising), and the other two in educational programming &amp; community outreach.

In almost a year since graduation, I worked at a restaurant, did sound design for a play, wrote a play, did a reading of it, and applied to about 400 jobs in arts administration, entry level nonprofit, and entry level admin stuff. I got about 20 phone interviews, 5 real interviews, and 1 second interview. This was kind of what I expected, honestly. 

Then uh, the global pandemic happened. And all the restaurants closed for dine-in, and I got furloughed. And all the theatres closed. What stings the most is that I had another second interview scheduled, with the same company, for a position I was more qualified for, on March 13. That company, a nonprofit theatre, will be out of money in 6 months.

I should mention that I'm under a bit of pressure from my parents. And for good reason. I'm a privileged fuck, and I don't have any debt. I will not incur any debt from grad school either. A master's degree is referred to as a certainty in any conversations about my future. I'm obviously going to take advantage of that opportunity. I know that I'll be fine no matter what until I'm guillotined, but I'm just feeling lost and want to finally start a career.

That brings us to the reason I'm posting here, because I don't have a clue on what to do now. Grad schools are quite specialized, and I have a narrow field of good programs to apply to with my undergrad degree. This will also be a historic year for master's degree applications. People oftentimes  can't just throw their jobs aside to further their education, and about 36 million people just had their jobs thrown aside. The programs I want to get into will be extremely competitive.

I'm considering getting a master's degree in arts administration, double down on what I'm doing now. It's what I have experience in and I've enjoyed it a lot, but it's a very narrow field that I haven't been able to get a job in, and theatres will be closed for a *very* long time, which will be financially catastrophic for the industry - most will close. Maybe I'll start a theatre company when it's safe to watch theatre again.

I'm also considering teaching. I have mixed feelings about it. It's an in-demand position, and certified teachers in online schooling will be more in demand in the future. It's a secure living, if not by any means a privileged one. But when I was a camp counselor, I... didn't enjoy teaching that much. I was teaching theatre at a sports camp - the kids didn't want to be there, they had to be there, they did not want to do the play. It was my first job outside of a restaurant, and I had to design the curriculum and lesson plans, direct and do all the other jobs on the ""big play"". I might like teaching kids that are a little more likely to pay attention. Teaching only theatre isn't really marketable when public schools don't have the money to teach any arts, so I'm looking at a few programs that would allow me to be certified to teach English as well as theatre. I don't really have a passion for teaching English, but I feel like I might be good at it - I like writing and I feel like I could lead good discussions on literature with older kids. 

My mom wants me to get an MBA and get paid. She was entirely supportive of theatre before the pandemic, but she's completely changed her tune. I don't really know what paths in business I would like. I took a business admin minor to look good on my resume and for arts administration, which is essentially the same thing. I took courses in accounting, finance, marketing, business law, data analysis, and economics. I can't imagine myself enjoying a career in any of those fields in a corporate environment. 

I'd love to use those tools to help people. I loved using data analysis to map out which schools in the city were providing arts education, I don't think I'll like using it to sell insurance. I might be a hippie snowflake, but I kind of hate the idea of working for the ultimate objective of making money for shareholders. I want to help people, serve my community. 

Sorry for that. I'm overthinking and need therapy, but that context will definitely help you answer these questions.  


**TL;DR:**  


What are fields and paths I can take with my minimal experience in theatre, education, and business administration? I can go to graduate school without taking out loans, and am expected to do so in a couple of years, but I don't know what kind of program to look into, because I don't know what I want to do after."

gk0v21,8,2020-05-14,Feeling Stuck. Everything wants 2 years of experience.,CastlebAby,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gk0v21/feeling_stuck_everything_wants_2_years_of/,"I don't know if I need advice or I just need to rant, and I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this. 

I'm graduating in June with my degree in Computer Information Systems. By the end of this, I'm supposed to be able to pass the CCNA (though that was before the test change) And I feel like if I went back and studied from some of my old classes I could probably pass a few of the A+ exams. 

I've also had 2 internships during my studies lasting a total of about 6 months. And I thought I was so lucky and so grateful and must be doing something right because some of my classmates were struggling to find just one. 

The first of the two being during the summer after my first year and being that I barely knew what Vlans were at that point I learned SO much in just a few months. They gave me so much time to learn and grow. They gave me projects that had to do with things I had no idea of and they let me tackle them and learn from them. I thought that if this was what growing and working in IT could be like then I would be happy here. 

Then the second internship came along and, not to be dramatic, but I kinda felt like my dreams were crushed. They gave me no direction. No support. I spend one month pumping out pxe boot machines. Another month cleaning laptops for their sale (literally. physically scrubbing them and getting stickers off). And the last month reorganizing their storage and rewriting their printing documentation. Honestly, I don't really blame them, aside from our ops manager who was rarely out of meetings to be a part of the team, all of the people on the team were less than 30. most of them less than 25. They probably didn't know what it meant to be a mentor. I guess I got used to using a Mac since I'd never touched an Apple product in my life before then. But that was it. 

Now I'm worrying if that was the real look at IT. That nobody really wants to hire someone they have to teach. I've been looking at jobs and even though I know COVID has taken a large hit on hiring, I've seen literally nothing out there that doesn't want at least a 2-year degree and 2 years of experience. I was excited that I had 2 internships but it looks like that wasn't near what I needed.

Do I really need to do 2 years of homelab just to get an entry-level position? I'm willing to be challenged at my job and I'm so excited to learn and grow but it looks like no one is willing to hire that. They want experience, and frankly, after school, I feel like I'm just full of concepts. 

Thank you for letting me rant. And if you have any advice, I would love to hear it. Even if it's telling me that I'm being whiny and I just need to suck it up. 

(and if anyone in the pacific NW is looking for someone like me, let me know. I'm especially interested in networking)"

I'm currently interning at a large company in the DevOps department and this is my first non-dev role during college. (I held a general IT role in a small office for junior/senior year of high school)

I have increasingly researched DevOps leading up to this term and think I could find myself making my long term career in this field. 

My first assignment has been organizing user permissions for projects/plans in Bamboo. As you can imagine I've been having a ball (/s) organizing perms for 1500+ projects. It really hasn't been that bad, but I am nearing the end of the list and want to take initiative to show my uppers that I am serious about this area and want to really excel within it and not do similar work to the first assignment the entire term. 

So my question to people employed or who have good knowledge in DevOps:

What should I request my next task be/what areas should I be asking about that will help me take advantage of learning from the other professionals and really sinking in deep to this field while I have the chance? 

I appreciate any and all feedback, thank you!"

All input is greatly appreciated. For context, my main goal in life is to create apps, wouldn't mind working on wall street tho lol. Also to consider, my parents aren't giving me too much money (maybe enough for 3 semesters at NYU), and I'm getting no financial aid, so I would have to take about 200k in loans. I'm also someone who likes to have a lot of fun, which I don't think NYU offers.

&amp;#x200B;

UCF Pros

\- Free

\- Honors college is decent

\- Love the location/ warm weather

\- Love the people

\- Seems like a lot of fun

\- As a NMF, they will treat me well

\- Decent intern opportunities (Nasa, Disney)

\- GPA would be very good

\- Can join frat, party, tailgate

\- Easy to make friends

UCF Cons

\- Not highly ranked

\- Would def have to go to MBA program afterwards 

\- (Much) less opportunity to find a good job

\- Far away from home

&amp;#x200B;

Stern Pros

\- Very highly ranked, prestigious (def a reach for me)

\- Great connections

\- Great intern opportunities

\- Great job opportunities (wall street)

\- Will be surrounded by smart people

\- Wouldn't have to go to an MBA afterwards

\- If I do want to go to an MBA program, it would be easier to get into a good one

\- Would have an overall better education

\- If I hate it, would probably be able to transfer to another decent business school (like USC or even an ivy)

\- Much closer to home (I'm from SE PA)

Stern cons

\- 320 thousand dollars (!!)

\- Not a huge fan of the city / cold weather

\- No traditional college experience, football team

\- Party life not my scene

\- Cutthroat atmosphere (I consider myself on the chiller side so it would be a weird fit)

\- GPA probably wouldn't be incredible

\- Hard to make friends

\- Def wouldn't start in the fall"

I have difficulties choosing between becoming software engineer vs machine learning engineer.

**Background**: After graduation from my BSc in Computer Engineering I worked 3.5 years in top tech companies in my home country designing scalable features serving millions of daily users. Then came to Canada to study AI for MSc. I'm graduating soon and my field is natural language processing. I did an internship in a FAANG as a machine learning engineer and now I have a full-time offer from my team.

Now I should choose if i want to stick to software engineering or choose machine learning engineer as my future career.

Pros of Software engineering:

1. Already have good experience in it (however there are 2 years gap due to my MSc and companies consider me as fresh grad i guess :-?)
2. Speed of delivery is much faster than ML and I feel more satisfied
3. You actually design and develop something. Most of what I did in my ML engineering internship was training existing state-of-the-art models with company's data.
4. More team work compared to ML engineer and i like team work

Pros of ML engineer:

1. At rare times that you do something research-ish, i like it because i feel creative and challenged but those times were not that much during my internship.
2. Not all people can do your job? (But they don't know that what you do is actually not that difficult :p )

Can you help me on how i should decide? I'm kinda stuck here and not sure which one makes me happier."

During undergrad I worked myself into the ground to help give me a strong foundation and it still wasn’t enough to get me into the programs I applied to. I applied for 8 clinical psychology PHD programs and didn’t even get invited to interview. I am passionate about helping others through this field and would like some feedback on how to improve my chances for the next round of applications. So here is some general information about what I have already from undergrad: 

-Degree: BS in psychology (with departmental honors) BS in biology (with departmental honors) 
-GPA: 3.949 (summa cum laude) 
-GRE: 161 (v) 155 (q) 4 (w)
-Research experience:  principle investigator of IRB approved research that dealt with the effect consumer’s expectations and experience on placebo (presented at 2 peer reviewed conferences, 1 of which was national), principal investigator of research that dealt with the effect of teaching methods on students’ cognitive engagements as measured by an eeg (presented at 2 peer reviewed conferences, 1 of which was national) 
-Professional: internship at local psychiatric hospital with a clinical psychologist, TA for general psychology (3  years) , TA for experimental methodology and psychological statistics (2 years)
-Volunteer: peer mentor for local autistic teen with depression (who I am so proud of!) (4 years), officer for the FTK organization (3 years)
-Extras: President of the Honor society at my college, admissions ambassador (4 years), literary society member and officer

The school I went to undergrad for is very small ( 700 students total) and I think this might have counted against me especially due to the lack of connections with graduate professors. 

During this gap year I am planning on working at the hospital I interned at as a clinical counselor. I am also working on publishing at least one of my research studies in a academic journal. I am hoping these experiences will make me a better candidate but I am still not sure it will be enough.  I feel like I have failed despite doing everything I thought I could. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and for any ideas or advice you can provide."

I am currently employed full-time as a junior software engineer with a backend focus in a well-known global company. However, I want to get out of this country as soon as possible because you know it is Turkey.

I am a computer engineering/science graduate (I graduated in July 2019). I have multiple internships during high school(it was a technical high school) and university. I have worked as a parttime software developer while I was in the 4th year of my university education. After graduation, I have started working as a Data Engineer for an international company that operates on the energy stock market. At the beginning of this February, I started working on my current job. In total, counting university internship too, I have 1.5 years of experience. I have fluent English, my all courses were English at university too. Besides the work and other things, I try to learn different tech stacks and tools where I lack experience.

I am continuously applying and searching for job opportunities on platforms like LinkedIn and Glassdoor but could not get any chance to get on the interview phase. How can I increase my chance and make myself a good candidate for jobs in Europe while requiring a visa sponsorship?"
gk9egw,2,2020-05-15,Not allowed to ever make decisions. Is this normal?,bargainbinoflife,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/gk9egw/not_allowed_to_ever_make_decisions_is_this_normal/,"At work, I’m a designer. I work with two guys who are principle “designers”. I say in quotes because they’re software engineers and don’t have any prior design experience or education, and fell into the role out of circumstance. I’m the only other designer so I’m the only one who realizes this.  I’ll call them Bob and Joe.

During my time at the company, Bob has not designed a single thing, and Joe has designed 3 things, while I’ve designed hundreds. Yet they make all the decisions and often discuss without me, about changes to my work, leaving me out of the loop.

I have 4 years of experience prior so I know the industry standards and techniques. They have some knowledge, but often then take advantage of their superior title of Principle to push their opinions. 

Whenever I make a design change, even extremely minuscule changes, to improve the design, Bob says “Let’s all meet and see what Joe thinks.” Then I have to wait for a meeting to review it. And then Joe always criticizes and pushes his opinion that completely changes what I’ve done. And it’s almost always just a matter of his personal preference. For example, I named something in documentation based on industry standards, and Joe had me change all of it, taking hours of busywork, to an outdated term just because he personally preferred it. Because I’m lower in rank, Bob agreed with Joe. 

I’ve never been treated this way at any of my previous companies, even as an intern. It’s like they don’t trust me. Whatever Joe says is “correct” even when he’s not. Most things I say are ignored even when it’s correct.

Is this normal?? What do I do? It’s driving me crazy. I subtly mentioned it to my manager and he seems to think they’re amazing and he highly respects them, and even mentioned what I said to them, and they started treating me worse."
gka975,1,2020-05-15,Thinking about working towards becoming a GIS developer. Could use some advice.,[deleted],gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/gka975/thinking_about_working_towards_becoming_a_gis/,"Quick backstory:I have a BS in IT and have been back and forth between wanting to pursue Web dev or GIS. I moved to Raleigh, NC about 3 months ago and have been eyeing the GIS cert from NSCU. I have 9 months until I am considered in-state, so the earliest I would start would be next spring. Might start spring and take one class as out-of-state, then by summer I'd be instate.  Can only start on spring and fall semesters...

So I have awhile that I can take advantage of.  I'm considering sticking to studying web dev, python and SQL, and using free resources like ESRI.  Then working on the cert and hoping I can get an internship or a entry level position and work my way from there. I am thinking the end goal would be to get into GIS development which would be combining both interests.

Resources for Web dev are easy. TOP and FCC are great. Any recommendations for Python or SQL.What can I be doing in my own time to work towards getting into GIS?

Side question. Is GIS Dev in demand? Is it one of the more in demand jobs within GIS?Other two things I see are GIS analyst and technicians.

Also, I think this subreddit might do well with a career thread. Unless people here don't mind my postings, but I feel like I'm posting to much and it could be annoying :P.

edit: Honestly, becuase of out-of-state tuition I dont know if I would want to start until next fall, which is a long time. Since I can't enroll during the summer and I will still be out-of-state by spring.

out-of-state is like $1,300 per credit. That's about 4k for just one clase?! Then financial aid doenst work with certs, but they have payment plans. 10 month payment planes. 4k/10 means $400 a month :O.  For one class. YIKES.

Can I get into GIS without it?? Maybe I should focus on getting a front end dev job or something that pays alright so that I can actually afford education like that.  


edit: hate to keep adding, but another option is ASU GIS cert. Their out-of-date tuition is the same as instate. Just maybe NSCU would be better because its local? ASU in total would actually cost me less. "
gkaaw7,122,2020-05-15,"What People Do Wrong When Building a ""Spike""",brandonz1234,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gkaaw7/what_people_do_wrong_when_building_a_spike/,"There is an overwhelming amount of information out there that pushes ideas that colleges only like certain extracurriculars, certain internships, or certain scores. I believe that the amount of incorrect information out there on the internet exacerbates the stress that students face.

I am no admissions expert or admissions officer, I am just a senior who went through the process last year who would like to share their own views about how to approach the process.

There has been an emerging theory about college admissions which suggests that students have a ""spike"" as opposed to being well-rounded. The main argument is that colleges are looking for students that can create an impact and that students with a ""spike,"" or a distinct area of expertise or focus that sets you apart from other applicants, are more likely to create an impact in a certain field.

Although I agree that there is a benefit to have a distinct story built on an area that you are interested in when applying to college, I feel that the process of building a ""spike"" is misunderstood. The key phrase for the definition is ""set you apart from other applicants."" A large proportion of students believe a spike to mean that they only do activities that are similar to their ""intended major"" or ""area of interest"".

However, I would imagine that the majority of people applying to be a computer science major would have some of the following:

\- Started Coding Club for a specific language

\- Taken AP Comp Sci

\- Developed an iOS application for their local community

\- Taken summer courses at their local university

\- Interned at a startup or tech firm

\- Serve as a coding instructor at a community service organization

Because these activities are so saturated, it actually makes sense to incorporate interdisciplinary aspects to make your application more unique. Obviously, I am not shaming any of these activities, if you are passionate and interested in these areas you should continue to pursue them but you need to consider how you can make yourself stand out.

Building off of the above example here is a list of ways to branch off from your interest in computer science:

\- Taking neuroscience courses at a local college and focusing on the intersection between neuroscience and AI development.

\- Competing in linguistic olympiad and focusing on the intersection between linguistics and the future of machine learning

Basically, all I am saying is that you should discount things you are interested in simply because they do not fit your niche. They could help you build an interdisciplinary connection that makes you stand out or display that you have certain qualities the college values (Leadership, integrity). In the end, I agree that building a spike is important but many people are doing it incorrectly. Read more [here](https://www.brandonzhang.com/blog/myth-college)."
gkc3xe,1236,2020-05-15,The head of our town is craving the smell of death,likeeyedid,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gkc3xe/the_head_of_our_town_is_craving_the_smell_of_death/,"I live in a place named Tattletoe, where [death smells like cinnamon](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gfygt1/when_the_town_smells_like_cinnamon_you_know/) and [life smells like nutmeg](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gh7ew0/when_the_town_smells_like_nutmeg_you_better_take/). All because of the wonderful bakery of Mrs. Holly where I work every day surrounded by the most delicious scents in the world. I have to admit that I have grown a little opposed to cinnamon though to the point where I feel nauseous just getting a sniff. Unfortunately the death rates have been sky rocking lately and the snickerdoodles, cinnamon buns, and banana bread have been piling up in the bakery, almost leaving no space to work. They haven't been picked up yet by any of the exporters and I kept wondering what would happen to all these goods. Mrs. Holly didn't say a word about it though and I wasn't sure how to ask.

Luckily we can balance out the smell from time to time with some vanilla, chocolate, or strawberry. Scents only Mrs. Holly and I smell in the kitchen. We wouldn't want to give the town any strange ideas.

""Deborah, get started on the frosting for the cinnamon rolls. Those are his favorite for some unspeakable reason."" She mumbled.

""He? As in Mr. V?"" I shouted. A feeling of both excitement and fear swept over me. ""He wants cinnamon goods?""

Mrs. Holly nodded silently.

Mr. V was the head of our town. The man who doesn't live in Tattletoe but controls it all. I guess you could call him our mayor, except he is more of a businessman who funds more cities, towns, and projects than you could ever imagine. The town had been preparing for his arrival for days now. Thrill and excitement were filling up the air.

The big statue of Mr. V at the market place had been cleaned and polished. The painters had been working day and night to give the houses with damage a cordial new look. Every shop owner had been updating their store windows in the most unique ways possible. It was a silent competition in which everyone wanted to be the one to impress Mr. V with the most original idea. The nicest one I'd seen so far was the flower shop whose owner had created a jungle of sorts, with plants growing from all directions. The dollmaker had made a toy-sized Ferris wheel as well as a carousel in which his creepy dolls were taking rounds. The shoemaker had built a theater, including actual spotlights, and his newest collection were the stars. I have to admit, that one seemed a tad ridiculous to me but the man is absolutely obsessed with his shoes.

&amp;#x200B;

Mrs. Holly and I had been baking new creations and were experimenting with different flavors. I figured that she was making new goods because the committee commanded her to. They always want to impress Mr. V. However, hearing that he asked for something cinnamon-flavored was odd to say the least. I've mentioned it before but cinnamon only has one specific purpose in Tattletoe and that is associated with burning corpses. I figured that the goods get shipped to some bakeries or shops around the country afterward. Hearing that Mr. V likes to indulge in them made me think there might be even more to it. If he ate them, they couldn't be so dangerous after all.

The whole time we were baking she stayed silent. We had grown closer in the time I worked here and in a way it was like being with my own grandmother. This day was different though. She was cold and distant and I was afraid to push her nerves. Asking dumb questions could cost me more than some bruises with the current climate.

Nobody had real answers to the cause of an increase in death lately. Some whisper they were suicides, others say they asked the wrong questions or stopped working. Unfortunately burnouts are taken far too literally in our town.

There was another thought creeping up in the back of my head though. Could these new deaths be connected to the upcoming arrival of Mr. V?

""Deborah, you are being given a huge honor tomorrow. Make sure to dress nicely.""

Mrs. Holly snapped me out of my thoughts.

""Mr. V asked for our new baker to bring him samples of our goods.""

I opened my mouth but couldn't bring out any words. I had never met Mr. V before and even though he was worshipped here, I was feeling extremely anxious. Besides, he ran the committee and those bastards commanded the death of my grandfather. Simply because he was trying to help people.

Mrs. Holly smiled at me sympathetically.

""It will be okay."" She whispered.

&amp;#x200B;

\--

The next day I got the basket from the bakery and made my way to the office building of Tattletoe. The place where I would be meeting Mr. V.

The overall atmosphere in the town center was incredibly festive. The decorations looked even better than yesterday and workers were arranging benches and tables for the upcoming beer festival tomorrow. A tradition to lift the spirit of the townspeople and a way to forget about the smell of cinnamon for a while.

I took a deep breath and walked towards the office building where one of Mr. V's employees let me inside. I followed him upstairs as he guided me towards the room where Mr. V was awaiting me.

Inside the room I saw him. He hadn't changed a bit since his last visit. Dressed casually but still radiating a sense of power. In the back of the room was another person though. Someone I had never seen before and who didn't match either the Tattletoe aesthetic nor Mr. V's employees. It was a young man, his dark hair looked messy, he had a bruise on his eye and on his arms. He wore a black shirt with some holes in it and there were stains on his jeans.

""Oh don't pay attention to him. That's an old friend of mine who decided to come along for the visit.""

Mr. V got up from his chair and gave me a warm smile.

""You must be Deborah Deller!"" He got up from his chair and opened his arms so I could hand him the basket with the baked goods.

I nodded.

""Wonderful, just wonderful."" He took a deep breath, inhaling all the smells. ""Don't you love the smell of cinnamon? It's simply the best.""

His green eyes were shifted from the basket to me.

""I prefer chocolate,"" I said.

Mr. V laughed.

""So did your grandfather. Please, Deborah, have a seat."" He pointed me towards his table.

I swallowed. How could he so casually mention grandpa?

""I know what you're thinking. And I know you're too afraid to ask. But just so you know, I appreciated your grandfather very much. I always liked that he had a mind of his own. There aren't many people like that, you know, the ones who aren't sheep,"" he sighed "" The committee decided for him to die. I swear those people are useless half the time. But someone gotta do the work, right?""

""I guess.""

Mr. V smiled and took another sniff of the basket.

""Now, I understand why Mrs. Holly made such a wide variety but actually the cinnamon rolls are more than enough. When you get back to her, tell her to make enough for the entire festival tomorrow, will you? You might not believe it but beer and cinnamon go wonderful together.""

Those eyes were basically staring into my soul. I was feeling slightly uneasy but weirdly comfortable at the same time.

""The people here aren't allowed to have any of the baked goods,"" I responded.

""Sure they can, there's nothing wrong with the cinnamon except that it smells like heaven. Or hell. I guess it depends on your definition."" He said as he raised his eyebrows.

I wasn't sure what to say or why I was still here. It didn't look like he was gonna eat any of the goods, he just kept smelling them.

Mr. V smiled again.

""I know you are a smart girl and I assume working with Mrs. Holly has given you quite some new impressions of this town so I feel like I can be honest with you. I want to use the cinnamon rolls for a little experiment.""

""So you can see if the people will break the rules and burn even more of them?"" I blurted out. My heart was racing at this point but for some reason I couldn't keep my mouth shut anymore.

Mr. V didn't look angry though, he just shook his head.

""It shows me their preferences. Cinnamon means death and I want to see how many of them will happily indulge in the rolls. There's nothing wrong with them, though, you can try one now if you like."" He said.

I shook my head.

""Very well."" He continued. ""Now let us talk about the real reason I invited you here.""

I raised an eyebrow, though I had a hunch he didn't just want me to bring the basket. He could have sent for someone to pick it up after all.

""I have a job offer for you. Well, for now it would be an internship. You can start by taking care of my friend over there.""

I looked back at the man in the peculiar clothes. I had almost forgotten about his presence.

""Hello,"" I said to the back. He waved with a careless expression on his face.

""He's new to town and I'd love for you to show him around a little. Maybe get him some fresh clothes and a haircut. And bring him to the festival with you tomorrow. He's been staying inside a little too much lately.""

Mr. V laughed.

""Do you want me to work as your assistant?"" I asked.

""In a wider sense, I guess... Deborah, how would you feel about leaving that old bakery behind you and become a member of the town's committee instead?""

I didn't say anything but we both knew what my answer would be.

It's not like I really have a say in choosing a job here.

At my old counseling job, we had something called ""final review,"" where editors would get a massive stack of other editor's students' work and we would go through them to provide a final edit. I never liked this process because I quickly found my options to be ""do nothing"" or ""freak out and leave like 40 comments days before submission."" [I work on my own now for a reason.](https://www.collegewithmattie.com/how-to-get-noticed-and-stand-out-during-the-college-admissions-process-have-a-weird-hobby/)

I probably read through 400 essays in my time there. I would say about 75 were terrible, 300 were fine, 25 were pretty good, and 5-10 were magnificent. Whenever I hear from knowers of things like u/williamthereader it seems like that breakdown is about par for the course. But here's the weird thing; of all 400 essays, there's precisely one I still think about. The actual writing and story structure were deep in the ""fine"" range, and I certainly didn't cry. But after I read it, I went, ""Huh. Neat."" And I still think about her and her essay to this day.

The girl had a badass hobby. She AQUASCAPED:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquascaping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquascaping) 

The essay explained how she loved nature and would make Aquascapes and leave notes near them for others to find. She's the Aquascape girl to me, and I guarantee she is to a bunch of admissions offices that read that essay.

This is probably fit for its own post, but I'm coming to see a critical flaw that so many students succumb to in the quest to get into great schools. I'm still workshopping a dumb name for it, but basically, the problem is that for the first 17 years of your life, there has been an objectively ""correct"" way to build a successful college application profile. You study hard for your tests, take the right courses, join clubs, start non-profits of questionable validity, intern at companies with names I can't spell, and do everything else like it's supposed to be done.

But the problem comes when every student follows that same gameplan. That's at the core of how and why ""perfect"" applicants don't get in where they want. They're perfect, but in the same way too many other applicants are perfect. It's what I see over and over on Chance Me posts: A never-ending shopping list of awards and positions and bells and whistles, and it just looks like *stuff.* Granted, some of the stuff is impressive enough that I get it, but mostly it just makes my eyes glaze over. There's no narrative there. No story. Just a ton of checked boxes.

One of my very first college theories was that something you wanted to do with your application was to become the ""X kid."" If you don't know, the way college admissions usually work is around ten people each individually read dozens of applications, take notes, and then all meet to go over everyone and vote. The original person who read your profile is kind of like your lawyer in that they present their case for you and (hopefully) why you should be allowed in. These meetings go on all day, and by 4:45, a team may be talking about you as the 100th+ student that day. With that kind of backlog, it's easy to become lost in the shuffle.

My goal with every student is to have something about them that makes their officer immediately remember them once they pull their file out as the 23rd student they're presenting that day. 

""Oh! This is Kimmy! She does this art thing with water! I Googled it and it's real!""

Kimmy succeeded. She was the water art girl. 

There is no ""service-learning hero"" kids or ""resilient injury recovered athlete"" kids. There can't be; every school gets too many essays on those topics for anyone to claim that crown. Even if the essay is ""[wonderfully written](https://collegewithmattie.com/blog/i-think-modern-elite-essays-are-terrible-and-heres-why),"" it still falls into the pile and is forgotten.

There also aren't too many ""brilliant scientist"" or ""world-class musician"" kids, either. That's because to qualify as such, you have to be the real deal. 1% of 1% of 1% kind of talented. I'm not that good at anything. By definition, most students won't be, either.

**So what do we do about this?** 

We pick up a hobby! A weird one! And we get weirdly good at it.

My hobby is handwriting analysis. Essentially all someone needs to do is write five sentences on unlined paper about anything they want and then sign their name at the bottom. Then I can analyze the way you write and tell you about your personality via it. I will do it for the first two people who submit pictures in this thread. You can just sign your first name if you want. Don't need to be doxing people.

I started it as a way to impress girls in college and quickly discovered I had a knack for it. I started doing it at parties, and then my school's social events. By my senior year, I was working part-time at weddings and birthdays analyzing handwriting for tipsy aunts. Today, it's the first thing I do with every student that I meet to work with. Fun little ice breaker. It would make a cool essay. I would be the ""handwriting kid"".

So that's my advice to you: pick up a hobby that will one day be fodder for an awesome essay topic that will make you different than every other student applying to that school. I only have three requirements:

1. It has to be weird enough that it is highly unlikely that more than, say, 100 other students in America will write about the same thing. I don't think there are that many Aquascaping stories out there. As a general rule, if you know of anyone at your school who does the same thing, it's not weird enough.

2. It should be something you can and do get good at, preferably to the point that there is a time in which you use your talent for a greater cause or objective result.

3. It should be something you like and want to do.

Optional: Include your friends! You don't have to be some lone wolf out in your basement. Come up with some ideas with friends or rally a club to take on a big project together. 

The one idea I always recommend that none of my students ever run with is to start a podcast with a friend about something. Produce weekly episodes and start a listener base at your school. Promote it online with its own website and build a following. Get sponsored by Zip Recruiter: you're golden.

I also am dying to get a musician kid to pick up a juggling/music playing routine. Imagine you're Mr. Harvard, and some kid writes about how he can play *Maple Leaf Rag* on the piano while also juggling three tennis balls. Mr. Harvard clicks that Youtube link.

This advice is probably best served at current sophomores who will be applying to schools 16ish months from now. But even for all the upcoming seniors, you still have 5-8 months to start and do something. You can be in the process of doing something while writing about it. Just have it done before you submit.

I'm aware that ""think of an insane hobby that you will also want to do"" is a tough ask. An easier way to build this path is to figure out something you already like to do and go in deep on it. One of my favorite students liked to bake. She would make a new type of pudding every day. That was pretty good, but I wanted an arc. I had her start writing down her different pudding recipes every day in a book. After six months, she had enough written down to publish together as a cookbook. She was the pudding girl.

I had another student who loved baseball. Since he was a kid, he would leave right after school three days a week to see the SF Giants play. He loved the games, but what he enjoyed most was catching batting practice. This kid had a custom net-glove...thing he would use to pick up balls hit into the outfield. He signed each one with the player and date and kept them in a case in his room. I worked with him to get some of his balls signed by the players who hit them so they could then be auctioned off for the charity event he was involved with. He only got a couple back, but one was from a former Giants legend, and it became a top bided item. He was the baseball boy.

(No, of course Barry Bonds didn't respond. We didn't even bother asking Jeff Kent).

These were both students I lucked into. They came pre-packaged with neat hobbies, and all I had to do was guide them to form their experience into a narrative that could then become an essay. That's all you're doing; you are building a future essay/EC topic with actions you make now. The game plan is simple:

1. Take up Hobby
2. Get good at hobby
3. Utilize hobby in a way that provides a big flashy fulfilling ending to your essay. 

That flashy ending is crucial because otherwise, the essay lacks a narrative structure. There needs to be a payoff to you making all those pigeon sculptures out of soap. The most obvious payoffs are producing a physical product people can and do buy, being featured somewhere, or utilizing your talent to raise money for charity somehow. In lieu of all that, personal pride and a sense of accomplishment always plays well. Let's see if anyone reading this tries it, and then I'll write an update a few months from now on ways to escalate.

I'm not calling this hobby idea some magic bullet or genius idea. But what I do think it is is a better use of your limited time and energy than whatever else you think you ""should"" be doing. Instead of having two internships, have one internship and spend five hours a week building an exotic ant colony or something. You be the officer: Kid who worked at two different labs or kid who worked at one lab but also owns 50,000 ants?

If you wanna get *really flashy*, you can even double up with the ideas [in this post](https://collegewithmattie.com/blog/the-one-key-difference-between-my-students-who-did-and-did-not-get-into-t20-schools).

I love synergy in my applications. I'll write more about that later (every time I write one of these things, I end up with three more topics I want to do…) But if you can combine your academic passion/future major into a hobby, that's cash money, dog. If you're an engineer, start building stuff for fun. I once had a student who built a beautiful, functional model Ferris Wheel. Could I work with him now, I would have had him build one Ferris Wheel every week for four months. Every week it would be out of a different material. Then we'de take photos and raffle some off and eventually make one out of wood students could ride. God, that would have killed. I'll get you next time, MIT.

Maybe here's another way to think about it: what's something you've always wanted to do but don't because of of...reasons? Either you're not sure you can or because ""it's not something someone my age should be able to do."" The fact that you feel that way means that doing it anyway will be most impressive of all.

For me, back in 2009, that was writing for the website Cracked.com. I eventually did get published there in 2011, but by then, I was already in college. I could have done it at 17 and not 19; I just needed someone to tell me I could, and I should. I'm that person for all of you right now. Go do it. 

Hell, let's have some fun with it. For any student who is currently a sophomore and will be a junior this fall, start and continue a hobby for one calendar year. On May 15th, 2021, PM or Email me a link to proof of your hobby as well as an explanation of how the year went. I like Youtube videos. The SICKEST HOBBY WITH SICKEST PROOF I will take on for the entire 2021 fall essay season: free of charge.

Hope you all enjoyed this one. I'm working on a HOT SECRET PROJECT that's coming soonish. Love to hear your feedback on anything you read. All info about my website and working with me this upcoming fall is available in my profile. Also, I added a picture of me to the ""About"" section. Feel like I'm going to shock some people.

gkkme4,16,2020-05-15,My Transfer Journey From High School all the way to Sophomore Year in College: Read if you are bored or considering going to a community college!,Successful_Swim,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gkkme4/my_transfer_journey_from_high_school_all_the_way/,"Hello, I was getting bored during this time of crisis so decided to share my transfer journey! (Goes all the way back to my high school story) I hope this can help anyone thinking of transferring. WARNING: Very long, but interesting!

**First**, let us start with high school stats and what schools I got into as a freshman.

**GPA:  (Grade point average by semesters)**

**9th**\- 3.8 UW; 4.0 UW

**10th**\- 3.8 UW, 4.1 W; 2.9UW, 3.3 W (I might be a little off? Too lazy to look up my transcript lol)

**11th-** 4.0 UW, 4.6 W; 4.0 UW, 4.6 W

**12th-** 4.0 UW, 5.0 W; 3.8 UW, 4.8 W

&amp;#x200B;

(Tbh I do not remember my frosh-soph grades too well because there were some Bs mixed in)

&amp;#x200B;

**SAT:**  1490

**PSAT:** Did not take

**SAT Korean**: 800

&amp;#x200B;

**ECs:** Literally nothing notable. Typical Asian kid stuff. Fills the page, but nothing eye-popping.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools I applied to:** UCI (Accepted), UCR (Accepted), UCSD (Rejected), UCLA (Rejected), and USC (Rejected) all applied for CS and Computer Engineering for alternative major.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, I was not surprised at my results. I was surprised I even got into UCI and UCR for my first major because UCs are GPA whores. (Many friends got into Cal and UCLA with much lower standardized scores but higher GPA) It is pretty obvious that my GPA from 10th grade second semester got me rejected, also probably my intended major. I could have probably put Applied Mathematics or something for an alternative and maybe squeeze into UCSD or even UCLA. Why did I not? Well, the truth is, I did not have education as my priority at that time. Growing up, I was a jack of all trades. I played sports, instruments, or whatever that caught my interest or seemed popular. Once I got into high school, it seemed all the smart and studious kids seemed to have the most clout lol. So, I started to study. I mean, I have always been a 3.8ish student in middle school, and with some effort, I was able to achieve my first 4.0 in my life in the second semester of my freshman year. (I got a B in English honors in my first semester because English is not my first language, but after that class is when I started to become somewhat good at English) The streak of good grades continued until my second semester of sophomore year. Man, I went through some traumatic shixx in my sophomore year lol. Mental health issues, toxic relationships, physical health problems (Torn labrum. Had to get surgery), League of Legends addiction, etc. Well, I ended up getting almost straight Cs, and Bs in Korean 4 (My first language LOL) and Art.  Funny thing is that I know I did so bad that I never checked my grades until Senior year lmfao.  Well, it felt like shit. It was my first time getting any Cs on my report card. I was not worried about my college admissions, or my future, but it just felt like shit lol. Fortunately, I quickly recovered and ended high school strong. I think part of why I was able to recover quickly was because I found my true passion. Music, more specifically, rapping. I fell in love with rapping through a Korean Hip-Hop show called Show Me The Money and Highschool Rapper. I started to dream about flying to South Korea and auditioning, and maybe even become famous. To do this, I needed to work to save up money. Now, my parents would not have let me work a part-time job if my grades were not straight, so I worked hard and got good grades. Also, it always sounds cool to have a ""4.6"". Anyways, forward to senior year, I told my parents that with my saved up money (18K, I had a decently high paying job 1k per month), I will go and support myself and pursue my dreams for six months after graduating. I told them that I will still most likely go to college because the chances of me becoming famous are close to zero. Also, at this point, I knew that I did not have a good chance at UCLA or Cal. I told them, because of my low UC GPA (only counts 10-11),  after I graduate, I will go to an SAT school for 2 months in the summer and take my SAT and subject tests to increase my chances at privates schools such as USC, Babson, Boston U, etc. I also reassured them that I will apply to schools during the fall before I leave for Korea. My dad said ok do whatever you want lol. My mom, however, was very against the idea. She thought that I would not come back to the U.S for my education even if I did not become a rap star in Korea lmao. I mean I do not even know why she would think that? How would I support my self lol. Anyways, I did not care and told her I am proceeding with my plans. Although I respect and love my parents, I do not put up with irrationality disguised as a parent's ""authority"". My mom told me to at least take the SAT and apply to schools to see where I would get in. So I did, but  I wanted to prove to her that my stats were not good enough for some of the schools I wanted to attend. At this time I did not have my SAT because I planned to take it after graduating, so I had to take the last available SAT test I believe for UC applications. This gave me three or four weeks I do not remember tbh, but I had done plenty of research on preparation materials (SAT Black book, College Panda, Erika something, etc), so I had a good study plan. The hardest part was to go through all the material in time. I ended up fine with 1490, but I told my mom that I really need to put in more time to study to get a 1540+ to offset my Sophomore year GPA. I ended up applying to the UCs and purposely checked off CS as my major because I wanted to prove to my mom that I was right. Well, acceptances came out, and my mom suddenly had a change of heart. She seemed to be ok with my plan, but all of a sudden was very against it. She made a sweet deal that I do not want to fully disclose, but it involved money, andddd I took it lol. I chose to attend UCR because their SRC (the gym) made my pants wet in the super dry weather. Also, I chose to stick with the CS major because why not. Can't really go wrong with it.  Also, I did end up going to South Korea, but only for two months. I gained like 20 pounds after chugging down soju for 2 months with my friends. HAd a blast :)

&amp;#x200B;

Wow, that was long. I tend to go all the way back whenever I explain something to someone to give them some context. lol

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I started school and let me tell you, it was the best year of my life.  I got involved with clubs and started going back to the gym. I also got an internship at an entertainment start-up company which helped tremendously in personal growth. Also, living in a dorm has been the best thing that has happened to my academic growth. Away from my house, and surrounded by students, I became determined to graduate Summa Cum Laude lol. I went to bed at 1 am on most weekdays and woke up at 6 am. I went to the gym and ate breakfast. Got in 2 hours of morning study sesh. Went to classes. 1 hour of study sesh after lunch, and 2 more hours of evening study sesh. I averaged around 5 hours of productive time (Studying, homework, projects, skills) every day. Here was the most surprising thing: I still had helllla time left lol. I was involved with the Korean club, competed in business competitions on campus,  networked with recruiters, and just had a blast overall. BTW I ended up hating Computer Science and switched to Economics. CS was very challenging and rewarding, but it just was not for me. I ended up loving the economics class and decided that I will be an economics major. This was the first step to my transfer journey. Later in the quarter, I attended an economics major alumni panel hoping that it would solidify my decision to major in Economics. However, it had another effect. The alumni panel was great. They were honest and very upfront, but my fellow peers were.. lol. I went with a group of friends who were considering Economics as a major, but everyone including me was disappointed by the immature questions from the students. I do not want to get into details, but the majority of the questions were very rude and no one seemed to be serious. I also started to look into the job prospects for Economics majors. I found out Investment Banking and Consulting were the two major industries coveted by many Economics and Business Majors but to my disappointment, the overwhelming consensus was that my school was not prestigious enough for me to get my foot in the door.  Also, the career fairs were horrible for Econ and Business majors, and I realized that most of the companies that I want to work for are all located in Orange County, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Orange County has CSUF and UC Irvine. Los Angeles has CSULA, CSUN, UCLA, Loyola, CalTech, and USC. San Fran has Stanford, Berkeley, SJSU, Santa Clara. This made me realize that companies are not going to be recruiting as heavily at UCR, because they can get better or equivalent talent in their own cities. Obviously, people still succeed in UCR and I have talked to many alumni who have. However, I thought to my self how much I would grow if I went to an institution with a better environment. Better as in more peers that care about their academics and future job prospects. Better as in faculty who are leading the industry in their niches. Better as in an environment with resources even greater. I do not want to come off as an elitist, but I know that some of the higher-ranked schools will provide me with everything I want. I also hated Riverside's weather. Just So Cal, in general, to be honest. So I started to look into the Unis I wanted to transfer into. Then I found UC Berkeley. UC Berkeley had the peers, the faculty, the resources, and the living environment that I was looking for. I could just imagine how much more I would grow as a person in an environment like UC Berkeley. So, I decided to leave UCR and spend my sophomore year at my local community college. I'm not going to lie, I hated community college lol. I felt like I was back in high school. Professors would get mad at me if I was on my laptop. But I persevered and worked my ass off to do whatever it takes to get into UC Berkeley. Now, academics was the easiest part, because community college is definitely easier than both high school and other four year institutions. (YMMV, I had one professor who made the class super hard, but in general very easy). I would like to get into more on my time at the community college, and what I had to do. As I said, academics was the easiest part, but there were so many more components like finishing the right GEs, finishing the right prerequisites for each institution because they all vary. Anyways I got into UC Berkeley and I am headed there in two weeks for summer school. I hope my story may give hope and courage to anyone who did not get into their prospective schools or for anyone who is considering transferring out. Also, I would like to note that UCR is a GREAT institution and you WILL succeed as long as you work hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

**CC GPA:** 4.0

**ECs**: Internship at a media start-up company, founded a Korean school at my church, Deloitte Startup Competition, various tutoring for free of charge from SAT to just high school AP classes for low-income and minority students. High school ECs. Nothing spectacular, but I would say very solid.

**Schools I applied for:** UCLA , UC Berkeley, USC, UCSD, UCSB, Vanderbilt, BU, Babson, 

**Acceptances:** UC Berkeley, UCSD, UCSB, BU, and Babson.

**Waitlist:** UCLA (They put a high emphasis on finishing pre-reqs by the Fall prior to transferring. I had one class not finished because my schedule got screwed up)

**Pending:** Vanderbilt and USC.

Feel free to reach out to me. I am just finishing up at my cc and have been just wasting my time playing league of legends. I want to give back to any students looking to transfer because I definitely felt lost at times during my transfer journey."
gklww3,3,2020-05-15,My roommate agreed to help with my interviewing skills. He is not familiar with the field,Joaaayknows,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/gklww3/my_roommate_agreed_to_help_with_my_interviewing/,"I am a senior Cyber Security major with no Internship experience graduating next semester. I have been looking for work but was discouraged in march by canceled interviews due to COVID to the point where I decided some career self-evaluation and improvement before submitting any more applications would be more beneficial long term than to continue submitting resumes. Instead, skills like interviewing, Sec+, AWS, and additional python AI and machine learning courses are what I will be focusing on this summer.

&amp;#x200B;

A little background so you have a better idea of my current skill level:

I got a few calls back for help desk positions in the spring but never made it past the phone interview. This makes me believe my interviewing skills are the reason I'm not getting a second interview, not necessarily the resume although I never got an initial call for the non-help desk positions, which is why I will also be working on other skills over the summer. Ideally, with a degree, I would be able to step over the help desk, but at this point, I am more than willing just to get my foot in the door. I have seen ""ask for an internship"" on these types of threads before and I will be doing that in the fall as well.

My roommate agreed to help me with my interviewing skills, but he is a law student and very unfamiliar with the ITSecurity field. The idea for this thread is to ask you guys to hit me with any interview questions, general or technical, and advice relating to entry-level ITSecurity and/or help desk positions.

&amp;#x200B;

Positions I am preparing for:

Cloud Security Analyst (intern), Cloud Architect (intern), Cryptography Security (intern), Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst (intern), Cyber Threat Analyst/Programmer (intern), Cyber Security Analyst (intern), Data Security (intern), Information Security Analyst (intern), Internal Audit Analyst (intern), Incident Response &amp; Red Team (intern), Incident Preparation &amp; Blue Team (intern), Information security (intern), Information Security engineer (intern), IT Audit (intern), IT Security Specialist (intern), Help desk.

My job prospects are broad because I don't know what I like yet, to be honest. I have no experience. But I enjoy my projects in classes and clubs, and I know there are many places to go in this field.

&amp;#x200B;

The gimmick for this thread is I will show my roommate the post so that he can pick and choose general and technical questions and topics tomorrow and over the next few weeks, and will not be looking at this thread's questions myself. Only the advice, pointers, or any additional input this sub has. The purpose of this is to make this feel like a real interview, where I am not pre-preparing for exactly what the questions are; only a general idea based on the job description, which I have already started working on. I want to come out of my summer quarantine shell in a few months feeling very confident about my interviewing skills. Please help me make the best of the virus!! It is very, very much appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

\*IMPORTANT\*

This leads me to ask that if you have interview questions, Please label your contribution \*\*INTERVIEW QUESTIONS\*\* And if you have advice, please label it separately \*\*ADVICE\*\* (preferably in a separate comment) so that I can navigate safely. I will of course still thank you all for your help individually even if I do not explicitly read your \*\*INTERVIEW QUESTIONS\*\* post :)

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I am here to work on interviewing skills for an entry-level position and would like help. Please read the above paragraph as well"
gkmiuk,1,2020-05-15,Should I still pursue my field I majored in or change careers?,73hebdhyd6h36dhld,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gkmiuk/should_i_still_pursue_my_field_i_majored_in_or/,"I majored in Recreation &amp; Tourism and graduated in 2018. The problem is that, like many college graduates, I need experience to get experience and I'm not good at interviews either. My internship and practicum didn't really offer a great stepping stone because I had to settle for less (again, no experience). I still liked them but they didn't offer the experience relevant to the kind of jobs I might want. Immediately after I finished my internship, I started working at a job to start paying off my small debt. I didn't wanted to waste my grace period looking for a job and I didn't have a clue of what kind of job I wanted in my field. A year later, I got a second job and I am currently working at both right now (60 hours/5 days a week) even with the pandemic going on.

With the Great Recession and the current downturn in the economy, it has me reconsidering my field a lot. The tourism/hospitality industry is usually one of the hardest hit industries during recessions and I don't want to get into a bad financial position every time there's a recession. 

I was wondering if there are any more stable jobs in the field I could look into before I start getting into IT since I'm tech-savvy and I might try to get into lower paying/entry level job with a certificate (Security+, CCNA) to see if it's right for me before I pursue it. Right now, it feels like the longer I work at my current jobs, the harder it will be to get out of them. I actually did try volunteering at a hospital to get customer service experience a year ago but a lot of the hours available conflicted with the job I had (back when I had only one) and they saw themselves as priority over the volunteer work.

My current situation: Living at home, have $23k saved up and more coming. I made big plans on going to Russia to live there for 2 years to learn the language, experience a different culture, travel, etc. This is something I have been wanting to do for awhile before I get tied to a good paying job, family, etc. and then I can't do it anymore. I was going to go there this summer but I delayed it to the beginning of new year. 

Obviously I'm not looking to change it up right now but when all this passes and the world starts recovering again.

Any suggestions?"

Sorry that this post is delayed, I forgot today was Friday and also it's taken me an hour and a half to think of what to write.

But, I hope everyone had a great first week of school. I know that many of us are discouraged by the jobs available on Waterloo works. We all knew that this term was going to be hard to look for jobs. But I don't think we anticipated it would be this bad.

The good news is that the economy is slowly opening up  and as the days go on more jobs will be posted. So even though main round might suck, continuous will probably have more jobs. A lot of offices are just waiting before they hire their fall interns rn. 

Also remember to apply for the cesb if you're eligible!

Unfortunately, I had to drop out of my second computer science class and college altogether due to extenuating circumstances, but nevertheless I've been studying algorithms and data structures, grinding on leetcode and hackerrank, and learning web development and frameworks.

Currently, I'm familiar with common data structures, like list, maps, trees, stacks, queues, and popular sorting algorithms. I know how to code in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LUA, and C/C++. I'm familiar with Git commands and use it regularly, though I only have one branch haha. I've made crude websites. I've just recently learned JavaScript, which was easy to pick up since Java is my native language, and I've made a simple movie randomizer. I've also made a nice UI for a flower business website using bootstrap. Right now, I'm working on making a resume builder which I thought I can make with vanilla js, but it looks like I'll have to learn node.js to pull it off in the quality I want.

I don't have a meaningful portfolio yet. I'm thinking of making a portfolio website after I build the resume builder.

gksefk,2,2020-05-16,Should I leave now or should I stay until I have my next job lined up?,Eti_eti_eti,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gksefk/should_i_leave_now_or_should_i_stay_until_i_have/,"Hi,

So I've got multiple things on my mind about my current employer and personal situation that I probably need a very **objective and validated opinion**

* **(1) on my workplace (especially about the severity of toxicity) and**
* **on (2) the fact that should I quit now (3 months notice where I'm from) even while not having a job lined up yet or wait until I have a new one for career reasons (am I too fearful?)**

First thing off, I'm suffering from my 3rd depression in quick succession (every 2-3 months a new one). The first one was triggered due to stress from the job. I'm completely open and am already receiving help from a therapist and also my friends are very supportive.

Secondly, I'm contemplating about leaving my toxic workplace without yet having found a job because it had considerably affected my health the past 5 months (elevated blood pressure - back to normal now, heart palpitations - back to normal now, the only thing bothering me now is waking up too early due to unbalanced brain chemistry).

The workplace (a smaller company of about 40 employees in the consulting industry) has had 40% - 50% y/y turn-over for years.  I've started there as an intern fresh out of university 3 years ago. I was (and still am to some sort) very ambitious and talented in wanting to making an impact on the tasks and responsibilities handed over to me as well as that the office is conveniently located 5 minutes from where I live - so I decided to stay there. I actually was quite successful in doing so by building up a critical sales-support/center-of-excellence function - firstly stemming from the fact that I was promoted regularly every year from intern, associate, lead, to manager (with team-lead responsibilities), while also being honored multiple times as transformation example for the company.  I've also applied myself and invested lots of energy in creating an open, supportive, inspiring, humorous and ""can-do"" attitude and way of working with the teams and people around me - especially given my perception on the toxicity und incapabilities rippling through the company coming directly from the psychopathic CEO/Owner and subsequently management.

Unfortunately, this has been the only workplace I've been at - so while I know it's toxic, I just need perspective to understand the severity to help me with my decision to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

My first and hardest depression started in November, escalated over new-year until February, and finally resolved through open and almost honest conversations directly with the CEO, as my ex-boss (though kind and nice but incapable) didn't have the emotional energy herself after the strenuous period she, others and I went through at that time. During that time

* I worked harder than before and directly with the partners still remaining to make sure we would reach overambitious company sales targets after 1/3 of the commercial team left during summer (which we achieved). In terms of workload, I was already handling 2x-3x what my other colleagues would.
* I worked with a Partner, who was - in my opinion - on the verge of a burnout himself. Working with him during that period was extremely stressful for all team members as he was completely disorganized, unavailable, and non-responsive. On top of that, we had many opportunities that involved him and that I had to push through the commercial process - while not allowed to have access/escalate to the CEO as the ultimate decision-maker in many instances. My ex-boss was and still is completely overworked and was not being able to relay my escalation messages to the CEO (the company is overly complicated in terms of organization and R&amp;R's). That situation still remains as of today and is extremely frustrating as it's totally killing my productivity and causing unnecessary stress.
* I was given additional workload absolutely outside my roles to support dysfunctional teams who wouldn't make progress - while clearly stating that this was too much (at least they took me out of it pretty quickly again)
* I was simultaneously responsible for the process and supporting my ex-boss in setting up a bi-annual 3-day company event in December with workshops and everything around that, and had flagged early on that preparations were in delay, top-mgmt. was not doing their job in providing guidance, sign-offs or actually providing the content etc.
   * As the 3-day event started in December, I was already completely drained-out, working days of 14hours (except weekends) had been routine over the last 2 weeks given my other high-workload responsibilities
   * Things finally escalated for me, when my boss started to break down and cry at the end of ""day 1"", as she just didn't have the energy left to remind top-mgmt about open items and their to-do's they had been slacking off entirely the past 3 months. She is the first employee of the company and the most precious darling of the CEO made him explode. He then violently started screaming and blaming me, for not having managed the process well - at least my boss came back and shouted back, that the least to blame was me, who had done everything to support her, and that it was the CEO and top-mgmt. themselves who were responsible for that mess.
   * I thought I had seen it all by then. What totally brought me over the edge to the point of no return was then on the evening of ""day 2"", said previously mentioned partner jokingly and drunkenly started talking with me and then projected onto me ""I have only one more week before Christmas to totally burn you out"". He knew exactly what he was doing!

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, I burned out, experienced PTSD, strong depression (I'm an endurance athlete and I couldn't even go for long walks anymore without feeling that I'm going to just break down on the spot, I underwent MRI, cardio and heart-tests, and am now in therapy). I took 2 weeks of sick leave to recover from that traumatic experience. I then took all my courage and guts to get back to work. The reason I did this was:

* to get my promotion in February - which in terms of responsibilities I had already gotten back in Autumn but where they didn't want to give me a promotion yet.
* ask for a considerable salary raise (they already pay 10% less than the market). My new current boss was open but my emotionally unavailable ex-boss totally escalated the situation again to the CEO where I was then bullied to back down and excuse myself for my behavior. This + a heartbreak in my personal life sent me straight down my 2nd depression.
* prove myself I can overcome those challenges and thus get my self-confidence back. I sought open discussions with everyone who had hurt me - they were incredibly hard from point of view but ultimately led me to experience lots of personal growth.

&amp;#x200B;

This leads me to my current situation, where I'm now hitting my 3rd (light) depression, still working at that company and actively seeking new jobs since already 1 month

* I'm having low self-confidence, self-efficacy, and a semi-identity crisis (i.e. realization that I'm still missing lots of skills that I thought I had or actually once had such as regression of communication skills and social intelligence).
* I haven't accomplished anything meaningful in the past 3 months at work. I  might be leading a team of one now, we're trying to build up a new center of excellence function along the customer to replicate the success story I was able to deliver in the past, I'm still delivering on the core responsibilities of my old function.
* Nonetheless, I'm walking around in a negative mindset and in self-doubt over my capabilities, motivations, values, interests, and skills.  I completely messed up an interview this week on a job I really wanted. After that, a lot of my (Ex-) colleagues have offered me coaching which I'm now accepting and regaining confidence in my abilities.
* Thanks to COVID and Home-Office, I'm able to withhold lots of my performance towards the company and re-directing that energy in furthering other aspects of my life. In comparison to work, I've achieved an incredible amount of change and on the trajectory of self-growth in most of my other personal life dimensions.

Alas, the CEO is still a psychopath, and most of the leadership team has been groomed to unquestionably follow him. I've gained assertiveness in politely expressing my boundaries towards work, my boss, and also influence my ex-boss. This is due to the fact,

* that they have cut salaries now by 10% due to COVID,
* started to scheduled meetings after-works (from 6-10pm) hours almost every day
* and the last transgression was the CEO now creating Whatsapp groups on my personal phone number for proposals due in 1 to 4 day, instead of using official company-wide communication channels - how am I supposed to shut-off work?

However this retaliation of mine meets resistance by my boss and ex-boss, both groomed and scared by the CEO. I get told to fall in line and accept it as it is ""these are tough times, we have driven people who want to achieve"".  While hearing this, all I'm thinking is: ""you only ask, but you're never really to give back to your employees""

&amp;#x200B;

So, in the end, after this long story, what **I'm probably looking for is an experience and outside perspective in how much was I either (A) just not able to deal with the requirements of the workplace, (B) I should have grown-up and left a long time ago, no matter my advancement in career due to this being a truly toxic environment, and/or (C)  that extra push/confirmation, that it is indeed the right action to leave now - ""cut my losses"" even without a job - and rebuild myself with a more positive mindset, so I'll be able to land the next job/interview.** Ultimately, the goal is to become again more open, caring, inspiring, relatable, etc. to my immediate environment (friends, families) and regain confidence in my abilities to shape and enjoy life.

Any elaborate opinion is very welcome in these times.

&amp;#x200B;

In a way, I'm considering this attempt to concisely synthesizing my recent experience as a further therapeutic approach to deal with what has happened to me, besides talking this through with friends, and a professional."
gksujy,15,2020-05-16,So I Found This Journal Walking My Dog,baxter_kolton,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gksujy/so_i_found_this_journal_walking_my_dog/,"  

Last night I was out walking my dog Julip near some train tracks. Usually nobody could ever wind up near them, but there was a large rip in the fence surrounding them and I’m the curious type so we went. The tracks are a good mile away from my house and the fenced off stretch is between two underground tunnels. It’s no more than half a mile long and surrounded heavily by forest on both sides for about 50 feet from the tracks to the fence. Normally if you looked in you wouldn’t catch that the tracks exist at all. 

The first interesting thing happened after I’d walked Julip a bit into the forest. She was sniffing around the area as dogs do and I was taking in the unkept forest. Then I saw a light up ahead. I quickly grabbed Julip and hid us behind a nearby bush. The train that passed looked like a normal cargo train, but instead of the yellow Union Pacific cars that usually came through the area the locomotives were entirely black with what looked like tinted windows. If it weren’t for the red light on the front and the loud noise the train made it could have went through unnoticed. The next oddity were the cars themselves. They looked like normal coal cars, and I would have thought they were just that had I not caught a brief glimpse of a man opening a door at the end of one and throwing out a notebook as the train sped by. 

Once the train left I waited to make sure nobody was somehow in the area and went toward where I thought the notebook had landed. It took some searching as I no longer felt safe using a flashlight, but eventually I found it in some tall grass. It looked like a normal composite notebook you could get for cheap at any store and was worn, but not completely torn apart. After grabbing it I decided to leave exploring the rest of the area for later and get Julip and the notebook back to my house.

As much as I like to think I would always give anyone their privacy, I definitely abandoned that notion with the notebook. I should have just burned it or left it in the forest, let the man keep his secrets, but it’s origin caught my curiosity. I’ll do my best here to transcribe what few entries I could find in it, but not all handwriting is legible and quite a few statements aren’t in English and don’t use any alphabet I can recognize. Entries appear to be completely randomly spread around the notebook so I’ll write them in the order they appear when I read cover to cover. Most pages are blank and an entry never takes up more than a page. There are also no drawings or diagrams to back up any descriptions given. 

&amp;#x200B;

First Entry, Page 31

Henderson brought another \[unintelligible\] into my office today. I told him to leave the things in the lab when they spawn, but he just can’t listen. He is thoroughly caught up in the idea that somehow a \[unintelligible\] could be his offspring. This belief does seem to give him the uncanny ability to care for them though, so Doe decided he could be the primary caretaker under heavy supervision. Well apparently heavy supervision doesn’t care how many human rights violations could occur should one of those things leave the lab. That or they’re under the \[unintelligible\] control too. Most likely the second. Doe needs to get more sense knocked into him.

&amp;#x200B;

Second Entry, Page 56

Today Philips came into the office with Lenin’s head on his neck. I don’t know if it was a model or the real thing, or how Philips managed to keep his brain and body functioning through whatever procedure allowed him to do this, but it nearly gave Doe a heart attack. I doubt the old man will ever give Philips an easy job again after today. I heard from Henderson that Philips has been moved to room 40 to administer testing. May \[unintelligible\] go easy on his soul. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third Entry, Page 78

I’ve been on this train for over a month now. In all my sleepless weeks I’ve never felt it stop to refuel. Doe was right about how useful that \[unintelligible\] could be for us. I should be going back to the office soon though. I’ve finished about 89% of the paperwork I was sent out here with and communications are becoming frequent again. Apparently Henderson got a kid he’s been showing off to anyone who will entertain him. How a kid could even get passed the \[unintelligible\] and into the office is unknown to me, but it seems like it really pisses Doe off.

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth Entry, Page 82

The \[unintelligible\] Philips keeps in his desk ended up on my shelf again. I’m tired of having to request thermal gear and it hasn’t touched anything yet so I think I’m just going to leave it where it is until he comes to get it.  

&amp;#x200B;

Fifth Entry, Page 97

An opossum in a tracksuit who goes by Yandi and only speaks Latin somehow got an internship at the office. I used by lunch break today to set up one of Doe’s \[unintelligible\] to follow it around. It preformed all functions of a typical intern including data entry, coffee delivery, and international supply runs with perfection despite it’s small size. Security is now angry at me for preforming their function, and despite everything Henderson says I don’t trust the sensitive act of supplying everyone’s coffee to one mammal who could easily be \[unintelligible\]. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sixth Entry, Page 111

Apparently Doe somehow acquired a train for the office. Although all program 616 routes were shut down decades ago we managed to get access to the tracks. Yandi was sent out the assist the janitor with cleaning them up and got back about an hour ago to give the report they’re in working order. Doe wants me on the first trip. The train is set up to sustain human life for months and I’m being sent with a large amount of paperwork to complete over the duration of my travels. A break is welcome right now, but I’m sure I will somehow Stockholm syndrome myself into missing the office by the time I return.

&amp;#x200B;

Seventh Entry, Page 138

Today I was tasked with watching Henderson teach the \[unintelligible\] to cook. He is thoroughly convinced they are his offspring and insisted upon giving them some skills before they were sent out into the “cruel and unforgiving hemisphere.” The cooking lessons were standard with Henderson first showing the \[unintelligible\] how to operate basic kitchen appliances and then moving onto making basic meals. By the end of the training the \[unintelligible\] successfully crafted a five course meal out of three potatoes, an egg, and five gallons of liquified road kill. I noticed throughout the day that Yandi seemed to be in close communication with the \[unintelligible\] during routine coffee and roadkill delivery which leads me to believe they may all be working together. Doe ignored my concerns though and has now replaced our kitchen staff with the \[unintelligible\]. Henderson is very proud. 

&amp;#x200B;

Eighth Entry, Page 158

Smith came back to work for the first time in months today. Though his legs are completely gone he now walks with 98.6% accuracy and is already hard at work with the new \[unintelligible\]. Why Philips thought it appropriate to haze one of our oldest staff members with his lighter trick especially after accident 107 completely eludes me, but he did. After the fallout of what has now been dubbed accident 609 Doe is putting me on Philips workload for an indefinite amount of time and it is unknown if Smith returned to the office or not today.

&amp;#x200B;

Ninth Entry, Page 178

I am to go back on the train today. This news came at the perfect time seeing as Yandi and the \[unintelligible\] have now staged a coup. Henderson is to be considered treasonous and executed immediately should he ever be found again and Doe has been promoted by command to rebellion leader. I’ve been given two months worth of paperwork and am to be sent on my way within ten minutes should I still be able to leave the office without coming victim to \[unintelligible\].

&amp;#x200B;

Tenth Entry, page 199

I received a call from a woman referred to as McKinley today. I am to unwork all completed paperwork and all information regarding base 82 is to be immediately destroyed. I can only assume this means Yandi won. I’ve been promised a managerial position at base 83 which will be the next stop on this train."
gkurw6,2,2020-05-16,Looking for some advice,peekurchoo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gkurw6/looking_for_some_advice/,"**tl;dr**: getting fed up with my job after 1 year, what do I need to do? Worth trying to bail during this pandemic if I can get an offer?

I recently hit the 1 year mark of my Software Engineer role at a DoD. I feel very fortunate to have a $71k/year salary and job security during this time, yet I also feel conflicted. I am tired of the processes and formalities that come with dealing with government/classified work; I would say about 80% of my work is more dealing with moving code from unclassified to classified systems or vice versa and 20% actually writing code. I work with another team that focuses more on unclassified work, and I am almost just as frustrated there because it seems like the whole team is juniors and they’re just cowboy coding. I thought about it, and I am not entirely sure what my options are. I don’t think I’m getting any new skills out of this role anymore aside from technical writing and JIRA proficiency. 

So I guess the advice I’m seeking is what options do I even have? It sounds dumb, but I’m a bit lost; I was grandfathered into my role more or less by being an intern with said company, so I never aggressively marketed myself on Github/LinkedIn once I graduated with my B.S. I think I want to leave DoD for good, but it seems like the only other option is FAANG (please feel free to correct me if this is horrendously wrong). Does that mean I should start Leetcoding everyday now? Doing other stuff? I am equally motivated to try and find work I’m passionate for as I am to also increase my salary. Any/all advice is welcome. Thanks in advance."

 I want to build mobile apps so I need a suggestion.

Like 3-4 months ago I started with a Javascript Course on Udemy, quitted like 2 months ago and now I want to start learning again.

I want to build a mobile App, which is connected to my database, where I can show some data from the database (articles, customers, etc.), edit some stuff (like customers data).   
I want to do it either with being connected ""all the time"", or sending and recieving csv/xml/json files to exchange information.

I already watched like 20 hours of the Javascript course and I did understand it, but I still have like 30+ hours in it and have to start building something by myself aka learning by doing, to be sure that I can do something.   
My goal was/is, after Javascript Course, start with some mobile Framework to build a mobile App.

I would like to know, if doing it with Ionic/React Native/something else (?) would it be good, or is Flutter a better alternative? I never done anything in Flutter, just watched some videos and it seemed cool.

Which one would be better for my project? Is the documentation on the internet good enough for Flutter, to find some things by myself? 

I know, that Javascript/Framerworks have so many more examples on the internet, but still, Flutter is growing and I think, building such an app as a Native App would be better/faster than an App built with Javascript.

Can you give me a suggestion? Thanks!"

We have seen a lot of people stressed about having no internship over the summer (canceled or otherwise). We are a group of advisors and mentors from major US companies (Citi, Google, Microsoft, ATT and more) who want to help out.

In real-life, developers don’t work alone. So we set up a space to match participants in groups to work on projects together. Our goal is to give a ‘real’ internship experience. As you know, projects on a resume is a critical way to get noticed for a first job.

Here’s how the process works: 

* You fill out a [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) about your programming ability, favorite languages, and technologies;
* We match you up in groups of similar experience and interests;
* We help you find a project that matches your group, interest, and professional goals;
* Our industry mentors give feedback and notes on your project idea;
* We ask you to assign clear roles (architect, product owner, scrum master) to avoid confusion on the team;
* We set you up with the tools, processes, and feedback loops that are used in companies and startups on real projects;

These initiatives tend to get everyone excited at first, but then fizzle quickly. We ask you to please apply only if you are serious about coding and adding a project to your resume. Similarly, if someone drops off of your project (that happens), we help you find a replacement with similar skills.

You can start your journey by filing the [questionnaire](https://forms.gle/d5hSs2RXFanseDyq7) and we will add you to the project. You will also need to join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/x6mAjHe) which allows you to connect with other members, share tips and resources, and more. LAstly, you can checkout our landing page at www.hackyourown.org and share it on social media.

Please also check out these similar initiatives. Let’s all stick together and beat this!

I soon realized I don't really want to be a music professor, nor do I want to try to live off of performing music, as I don't believe I have the social abilities/motivation required to network enough (social anxiety/aspie here). I'm still keeping music in my life no matter what, though, so I'm keeping the major even if I don't finish/graduate with it.

I've been trying dual majors now as a result. This past semester I tried computer science, and while coding itself was fun, I REALLY disliked how soul-sucking the math/science requirements were, so I decided to drop that major and do a coding bootcamp if I want to become a software guy. Next semester I'm going to be trying some journalism classes since the careers, while not as lucrative, do sound a bit more fun, as do the classes themselves to finish the degree.

My problem is that since I have no particular career goals in mind which correlate with a specific major, I'm wondering if I'm even ready to finish college now. I know it's not supposed to be a means to an end, but I'm sure this will be the only chance I get to have further education that's partially funded by my parents. I want to be able to take full advantage of the internships, major-specific societies/clubs and all that stuff which could help build a network and a decent resume for a recent graduate, but that seems pretty difficult when I don't actually know what I want to do!"
gl35b0,0,2020-05-16,I think my [M44] underage son [M17] may be making/selling porn online. [TX],LAThrowaway11982234,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gl35b0/i_think_my_m44_underage_son_m17_may_be/,"I’m a single dad living in North Texas with my two sons who we’ll call “Mark” the oldest, who is 19 and temporarily home from college, and “Nick” who is 17 and still in high school.

A few months ago, I started noticing that Nick had a lot of expensive stuff that I never bought for him - Electronics, clothes, etc.  Whenever I asked him about them, he’d have a reasonable explanation, and I’d shrug it off.  He’s always been a hustler, so I never questioned it, but then I got a chance to see his bank account, and saw that he had over $10,000 in there.  Several of the recent deposits (most-recent is from April 30) appear to be from some kind of eWallet that I’ve read is a popular payment method used by content creators on OnlyFans.

I should also note that this theory isn’t totally baseless.  Both of my sons are very comfortable being naked around the house, and having seen them naked on many different occasions, can say that they both look like attractive and fit young men in their 20’s with what some people would call the “proper equipment” to pose for porn if they wanted.

Now, I thought that Mark might have given him the money for something (he worked an internship last summer where he made a lot of money), so I asked him, and he said, “No”, and told me that he knew nothing about him making any porn.  Then, the next day, he came to me and told me that one time he walked in on Nick receiving oral sex from a friend.  He told Mark that he wasn’t gay, just experimenting, and that the only way he could even “get it up” was to watch porn on his phone while he was doing it.  Mark thought it was weird that he even mentioned the phone, and that he sounded, “Like a guy denying an accusation that no one even made against him.”

Furthermore, I checked with his boss at his job, and he told me that Nick not only couldn’t have made nearly that much at his restaurant, but that he cut his hours in half nearly six months ago (which is around when the first deposit was made into his account).

I know this isn’t exactly “proof”, and there are also a few other things that make me suspicious, but none of these things are unexplainable or abnormal for a teenage boy.  I know I won’t know for sure until I talk to him, but I’m very worried he’s going to lie if I confront him, and he’s going to put himself, me, and his friend in serious legal danger by doing so.  He’s a really good kid, and I’m convinced if he is doing this, it’s because he just doesn’t understand the repercussions.  

What kind of legal danger is he in?  What kind of legal danger would I be in for knowing what I know now and not reporting it?  If he already filed his taxes for 2019 without reporting this income, could he re-file without getting into trouble?"

I'm still pretty new to programming, I just finished my internship as a data engineer at a start-up tech company. I've been learning Python (a little bit of C++, HTML/CSS) about 10 months or so. I did not study in Computer Science and it was my first internship in IT. 

I'm trying to develop my skills over this summer, I've been taking a few courses in computer science such as data structures and algorithms, mathematics, machine learning, and so on. And I'm planning to do more projects using Python, but I'm stuck.

So I've done a few projects such as creating recipe finders (using Tkinter, web recipe API.. etc), pretty simple ones but I enjoyed doing them and want to do more. Sometimes, I start from scratch, but most of the time I start with a starter code in the documentation. 

But I don't know how I should really start. For example, I was looking for a project to start, then I saw something like ""music player with Tkinter and Python!"", and I thought, that sounds like a fun project. But the problem is, I don't know where to start. When I google it to find more info about it, I just find a full code in GitHub or other tutorials with already written out codes. I do not want to see the code because then I feel like it defeats the purpose of learning. 

How do you start a project? Do you just write from scratch? Or do you start based on someone else's project or a starter code?

Thanks in advance for any advice and tips!"

Should I start all over?,ebandatf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gl5h9v/just_got_accepted_as_a_transfer_for_university_as/,"Hello everyone,

When I started community college in 2015 my goal was to study and major in computer science. I failed calculus too many times that I was not able to retake it. I switched to management information systems and have just been accepted to a program at a local state university as a transfer. 

My plan was to teach myself to program and eventually find a job as a software engineer with the MIS degree. 

After giving it some thought, I think if I start all over for a CS path I will have more opportunities available such as internships at FAANG and the like. 

My questions are: will it be worth it? Can I apply for internships at those big name companies with an MIS degree? I mainly want to work/intern there for the experience.

I’m currently 24."

I’m supposed to start working for a company that develops web applications in Java. I have literally zero experience in either of these, which I made clear during all of my interviews.  

I am so scared that I’m just going to be a huge disappointment. I know they know I need a good bit of training, but I’m worried they’re underestimating how significant my knowledge gaps are compared to a real CS graduate. I’m almost positive I can “rise to the occasion,” but what if I can’t and I just waste everyone’s time and energy?

After getting rejected from REUs, I planned on emailing professors to try to get an unpaid internship for the summer, and obviously that’s not going to happen. I had almost completely given up, but now I’m thinking of emailing people for remote research opportunities. Has anyone done this? I know it might be too late by now (I’ve spent the last month and a half riding out the pandemic depression wave and trying to do well in my courses), but I wanted to see if anyone had done it and if you have any advice. Should I assume I’m too late and any opportunities will be gone? Will anyone take me seriously? Should I try anyway and begin emailing?

I’m interested in computational biology, but my experience is a little limited (I’m getting a math degree outside the US, very limited in non-math courses I can take, 8 months of compbio research experience, but no significant results yet). My ultimate goal is to go to grad school in the US, and I’m nowhere near on track to get good research experience, have no idea what exact topic I would like to pursue, and I’m just overall feeling super defeated. I would also love to hear everyone’s summer plans, I’m feeling super lost on what to do if I can’t get into a research project."

1. Take CS169a 
2. Take UGBA 101a (session A) and UGBA 102b (session D); they don't overlap 

Pros of option 1: 

 - good to help review tech/coding before recruiting for full time PM roles; potentially helpful for coding challenges, which is a weak point for me
- the class is built to be online, probably more digestible logistically speaking

cons of option 1:
- more difficult than the haas classes, this is a somewhat large drawback since this will happen over summer and I might not be as focused as I would be over the school year since I'm also going to be working
- more compressed, so might not get as much out of it compared to if I take it in the fall, which is what I will do if I don't take it over the summer 

pros of option 2: 
- get 2 classes out of the way instead of 1
- easier material (better for summer)

cons of option 2:
- classes aren't natively built to be online, so I'd basically be watching recordings of live lectures 
- aren't useful for recruiting purposes

Any thoughts? :)"

gl9ual,2,2020-05-17,25 male thinking about a pretty drastic career change and I’m sort of confused on what I should or shouldn’t do?,poppyswordsman8,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gl9ual/25_male_thinking_about_a_pretty_drastic_career/,"So I’ll be 25 this year. Since 2017 I’ve worked glorified internships in professional sports on the analytics side of things. I’d be brought on by an MLB team and assigned to a minor league team and travel with them and sort of be the team nerd. Analyze data, distribute information, initiate tech studies. Nothing wildly in-depth, but I got to work with a lot of cool technology. However, three years in I began to sort of see things you just don’t as a fan. 80 hour exhaustive work weeks. You’re looking for work every winter after these positions end. I was always invited back, but i always sought higher level positions and more responsibility. Which I did. I was promoted each year. But it’s led me moving all over the country, and from April through September, you’re living in awful hotels, traveling tremendous distances in shady buses, and you’re sort of the odd man out the whole time - everyone else you work with is an ex player. 

Anyway, for as much as it sounds like whining, baseball was always my passion. It’s all that’s ever really been in my mind. But, I began to see a reality that moving up to full time positions is both A) an incredible shot in the dark (so few vacancies each year with EVERYONE wanting those cool jobs) and B) the knowledge that you will make about 30% less doing the same work for a professional sports team than any industry. A data analyst in pro sports might make 45-50k, whereas one in healthcare would make infinitely more. Supply and demand is the name of the game, and teams use it to pay people very minimum. And if you don’t like it, some wide eyed younger person will do it for free. If you want an idea for how little I personally made, after going to a very good university (I was in Management), my first job post-undergrad was $8.50 an hour 1,000 miles from home. I never made more than $35k. But, I’d get raving reviews. I made so many friends and lifelong connections who would vouch for me. I’m proud of what I did, but that level of instability is excruciating. 

So this past year, I left. Sort of. I stayed in pro baseball but worked as a partner. My new company provides technology for baseball teams and in-game assistance. It’s really cool tech. It’s a smaller company, which I love,  and I now work (well, should be working) 40-60 hours. Infinitely easier and more doable. Plus, it’s work from home. But once again, there’s a catch. I’m misclassified as an independent contractor. I am assigned a M-F 9-5 schedule and am not given overtime. I have no say in hours or availability. And I knew that going in. Just another sacrifice to stay around something I love. But, quarantine has made me a bit more angry. I am off my family health insurance in 12 months. Then, I’m 100% unprotected. I already pay a lot more in taxes as a 1099 and only make $31 an hour. To add insurance on that is scary. And it didn’t even really cross my mind until COVID. I’m a generally healthy young person - but I am asthmatic and immunocompromised. I don’t think COVID would kill me, but I’m scared to be scared that I can’t go to the doctor without a monster bill. The lack of benefits after all this makes me very afraid. 

At a point, I feel like I’ve had it. And it doesn’t help I hear from friends who do work in sports that are all being treated very poorly by billionaire owners of these sports teams. It’s made me a bit more angry. And a bit more resentful. And look, I don’t need $100k. I don’t need a glamorous lifestyle. To live my dream, I moved 1,000 miles from home. I worked an $8.50 internship from 2p-11p and then I’d stick grocery shelves overnight. I can make anything work. But, I’m at a point where I want a livable wage. And I want to be insured.  So, I am in graduate school working in computer science - I love data and one day would like to maybe do software engineering if I’m good enough (it’s been a hard adjustment). And I’ve spoken to my mom lately, who offered to maybe help me get into healthcare data analysis. An entry path into a field that pays well, there’s be room for growth, and at minimum, I can work with data. 

That said....as we make progress on it, I tend to feel empty. Like I’m abandoning a dream. But, I’ve grown so bitter and truly burnt out towards it. But, the thought of moving on still unsettled me. I still have my sports tech job (well, I’m furloughed), but I’m beginning to look elsewhere as a contingency plan. I’m not ashamed or distraught about my sports career. 3 years in I have an understanding that’s much deeper of it. The supply and demand is tremendous. There are interns in their mid to late 30s still just taking hourly salaries for a chance. It’s not that I cant do it, but do I want to live my life that underpaid and with that level of uncertainty? I really don’t. I’m realizing I can’t have my cake and eat it too. At least until I get my master’s. I do think maybe working in CompSci with healthcare or something else will let me one day move back. But, as it becomes more real and I may leave, it does fill me with a bit of emptiness. But I need benefits and I need a salary that won’t fluctuate and won’t just disappear every 9 months. 

Any thoughts, I guess? Part of me feels ill just die inside. But another part says, I’ve done all I can with what I have, the risk is too great, and maybe come back to it."

As the title says, I will be graduating in the Spring of 2021 from Penn State with a BS in Accounting and a minor in Finance. I will also be graduating with a GPA of 3.4 (for whatever that’s worth). 

During my time in college I also worked as a Personal Banker at US Bank (2 years) and a Wealth Manager at Citibank (2.5 years), amongst other jobs. Unfortunately, I have never taken up an internship though. 

My general question is what opportunities are available to me?

I originally entered college as an accounting major because I enjoyed math in high school and it seemed like a natural transition, but as I progressed I realized that I enjoyed analyses quite a bit and understanding the markets. 

I’m really just trying to figure out what my best options are. It seems like a stupid question because the obvious jobs I should look at are financial analyst or accountant, but I think that would be limiting myself. Granted, I would enjoy both jobs but I want to know what all my options are. 

What’re your thoughts? I’d enjoy hearing a second opinion. 

Thanks!"

And, while I think they have their reasons and right to say so, and motivate people; I personally think, believe and endorse the second quote in the title: ""YOU DON'T MATTER, GIVE UP."" Now it might be said that it is plain and simple attempt to whine about how I am depressed and am trying to demotivate others too, I have my reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a tier 2 city. I work for minimal money(INR 12500). My last job was as a retail employee and I earned INR 7200. Yeah, what's the difference? A lot of people earn that kind of money? What do you want to say?

In my country, there's a scholarship that is given to top 1% students of the country passing out of school named as INSPIRE (Innovation in Science Pursuit for **Inspired** Research). I was shortlisted for that in 2013. You get INR 60000 per year as scholarship and also if you choose to do an internship, you get an additional INR 20000 for expenditure, you can keep it or use it for a project etc. I wasn't financially sound to go to a decent college for graduation but I got the offer letter right after passing the school(after 15 days maybe) so I thought I could use this money and take some from my parents(in our country parents are pretty supportive financially IMO, but my parents were not financially that good so), and go to a decent college. I took admission in college and I was supposed to get the money by march 2014(IInd semester). A few of my friends in college who were all selected for this too, got the money by then, and I started getting worried. I contacted the Dept of Science &amp; Technology, and also posted it on grievances portal of the govt.(last year, and got a reply in 75 days lol) Fun Fact: My name wasn't there in the list of ""rejected candidates"" either. I dropped out of college in 2015, attempted suicide twice through 2015-2016 and ended up working retail.Meanwhile, when I was in college, I was preparing for my passion: The air force of my country. I took 5 SSBs(pls google for more details, it's a pretty scientific testing process). I was rejected 5 times in a row. My interviews went pretty solid, but I couldn't figure whether I fucked up in psych testing or group testing activities. That also added to my insecurities.

&amp;#x200B;

After dropping out in 2015, I went back to a tier 3 college in 2017. I passed first year but second year, working retail and a lot of things going on in my personal life I fucked up and failed by 6 fucking marks. remember the INSPIRE? Same me.

Third year, I couldn't even enroll in time,dealing with 12 hour job and one of the closest person in my life having chemo sessions( I am not making this up). 17-18, 18-19 and 19-20 fucked up. 7 years after school and I don't have a fucking degree. 2 of my colleagues are MBAs and my work is at par and at times even better than them. The only reason I can't get a job that pays more? I don't have a fucking degree.

But the government doesn't give a fuck about me.

We live in a world where your talent is useless. Your degree is valued more than your talent.

This rant is going to get buried in reddit and the only person giving two fucks about it will be me, looking at it time and again.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, we also have a mortgage. payable as on date stands close to INR 500,000.

So this is keeping me up at nights and I have all the right to say that if I give up one day, I am not doing anything wrong. It is my life, I am the one who has been through shit and deep shit and even deeper shit. SO, the world has been giving me the message: ""YOU DON'T MATTER. GIVE UP.""

PS: It was written in a wave of mixed emotions so it might not be perfectly drafted, but I seriously hope you guys get my message."
glc90c,0,2020-05-17,UWaterloo vs UCLA CS,burnyman02,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/glc90c/uwaterloo_vs_ucla_cs/,"I was recently admitted UCLA CS. While I was initially very excited to go, I have read numerous stories online and from a current CS major there about how the course is overly theoretical and teaches outdated technologies, has less course rigour than other school's CS programs, lacks startup culture and overall is not extremely well regarded in CS. I was also told you are forced to take a lot of low quality engineering courses as the CS course is in the department of engineering.

However, I have heard that it is possible to get into top tech firms if you are willing to work hard and look for opportunities (though this appears to be the case from any university), and therefore good internships and job opportunities can be found at UCLA.

I have also received an offer from UWaterloo, which I have heard has a very strong co-op program, excellent startup culture, and is very well connected into Silicon Valley. Further, as an international student, the costs of tuition, room and board at UWaterloo are about 14000USD a year cheaper than UCLA. It is possible to earn money in co-op terms at UWaterloo which further offsets its cost, however I have heard it is also possible to earn a substantial amount of money doing internships at UCLA and so I am ignoring these sources of money. 

Further, I am an international student and would eventually like to work in Silicon Valley. Graduating from UCLA will give me 3 years of OPT during which I can hope to win the H1B visa lottery. However, green card waiting times for citizens of my country are extremely long and I would therefore be forced to work on H1B visa, which I have heard is very unpleasant. I have also heard there are now a lot of US firms that refuse to sponsor visas for international students due to the uncertainty the visas cause.

Hope everyone is safe and doing well right now!

As the title states, I am an upperclassmen in undergrad right now regretting not majoring in CS. I was and maybe still am pre-med, and that is why most of my courses are STEM and I have a pretty shitty GPA to reflect that. All my internships are also all medicine or research related except for this summer where I was supposed to intern with a three letter government agency. Because I am home this entire summer, I wanted to try to get started learning R before I took a class about it this fall.  I now am learning that I love this and would like to explore having a career in R programming. 

My questions are: 

1. Can I find a career that just deals with R programming? I took one into to CS class and it was python based and it honestly was not my favorite. 
2. Are there any CS careers which deal with R programming, medicine and/or linguistics? 
3. How can I prove to employers that I do have the CS skills to do their jobs?

I am starting with a R programming book and after I finish that, I plan to start projects and put them on GItHUB. 

I honestly hope this crossover is possible, and thank you for reading!"

I really liked the other post that gave a perspective into the lifestyle of an entry level dev in a Low CoL area and wanted to share the same information from my own perspective. Here's a link the the post if you missed it: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/glj6t5/my_lifestyle_budget_as_an_entrylevel_dev_in_a_low/

About me: I work at a private unicorn in SF. My base is 185 a year before tax along with an RSU grant of 120 worth of stock per year bringing me slightly over that 300 mark (Plus 15 in sign on). I graduated from UNCC with a CS degree, a middle-of-the-road school at best imo. I didn't have any internships, but throughout my teenage years I built somewhat successful flash games and got paid via sponsorships. After graduating I moved out to San Francisco to take my first job (120 base with a bunch of worthless options). After around a year at that job, I quit to work on my own startup which ultimately failed a little over a year later. After that I applied to a lot of the more well known companies in the bay area and received a lot of offers similar but slightly lower than the one I ended up taking (Although those other offers were all from public companies meaning the RSUs would have been worth real money immediately). I am single with no dependents.

**The Budget and CoL part**

After taxes &amp; healthcare and whatnot, my net pay each month is about $9000 (Plus that paper money [RSUs] valued at $10,000 pre-tax). I don't contribute to a 401k at the moment which is probably a mistake, but I don't want to have to deal with withdrawing money early with a penalty until I have more savings.

I don't have any strict budget in terms of what I spend my money on, but I do keep a spreadsheet of what my typical spending normally looks like. 

* Rent: Previously I lived in a small studio for $1900 a month, but around half a year ago I decided to significantly upgrade and started renting a stunning 1700 square foot apartment with a roommate on the top floor of the building costing me $3000 per month for the master. Utilities, internet, and all of that bump up my cost to ~$3200 per month total. Definitely much less frugal than I used to live, but it's definitely within my budget and makes it much easier to host people and is only a 5 minute walk from where I work.
* Food: I almost never cook, my company provides free breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day (or at least did before the whole pandemic thing). However I tend to get bored of the food provided and tend to eat out all the time whether getting takeout from my favorite places or eating with friends. During the pandemic I have been spending around $750/month on food, but before my spending was closer to $500/month.
* Entertainment: I budget $500/month, before this mostly went to bars, but now with my new apartment I tend to host most of the time which tends to be a similar cost since even though making cocktails at home is much less expensive, doing it for a lot of people offsets any savings. The rest of this money just goes to doing random events with friends, but usually nothing too crazy.
* Side Projects: I have a bunch of side projects that I run for fun that don't bring in any income. Hosting, emails, database, twilio, etc... run me about $500 per month.
* Travel: I previously haven't done a huge amount of travel, but have started doing more and more recently. I spent nearly $5000 on a 3 week trip around Christmas break (Would have likely costed $1500 or so had I gone during an off time). A usual shorter trip to somewhere in the world will usually cost around $1500 which I was trying to do every few months before we entered a global pandemic. On average I budget to save around $700/month for this.
* Misc: This number always ends up a little higher than I would like, I bought a new computer recently for $4000, a new phone, some new furniture, etc.. This number used to be around $350 before those purchases, but is probably closer to $600-700/month now even though it's trending downwards since I don't feel the need to make any purchases during quarantine.
* Transportation: Luckily SF is very easy to get around without a car so I don't feel the need to own one. Whenever I need to go somewhere far away via driving I'll rent a car, or if it's somewhere close I'll just hop in an Uber. I usually average maybe $100/month on all transportation costs (excluding travel) per month.
* Debts: I was fortunate to not have any student loan debts, but while doing my startup I did end up going into debt of ~$20k before eventually closing up shop. However I have fully paid off everything and am now saving.

My spending for the last 3 months: (These are slightly lower than normal due to the pandemic)

Feb: $2400 + $3200 = $5600
March: $1900 + $3200 = $5100
April: $2200 + $3200 = $5400

This means I'm saving ~$3600 or so per month via my base salary. Then I also save all of my RSUs which on paper are worth $10,000 per month (~$5000 after taxes I will realize when we go public). Making my total savings ~$8600 per month. 

**Takeaways**

I really hope this gives some information in to what it's like living in a high COL area. I see so much mis-information being spread around what it's like to live in the bay area. How much/little you actually end up saving, etc...

I obviously don't live the most frugal life possible. I have friends that rent one bedroom in a mediocre apartment of a bunch of roommates that make more than I do just due to the fact they want to save as much money as possible. I personally like having a balance between having a very nice QoL having a nice apartment, eating out, hosting events, etc... while still growing my savings by a nice amount.

This isn't meant to be an argument for/against moving here and working on bay area salary, but it gives some perspective for anyone who is looking to do so. Another thing that shocked me was just how high salaries really are out here. When I came out here I thought you needed 20 years of experience working at Google as a staff level engineer to make money like this, but that's just not true. With just a few years of experience anyone can command these types of salaries from any competitive company. I'm actually pretty confident that I could easily jump companies right now and get a pretty substantial raise, but mostly don't since I'm pretty happy with where I work and have a very good WLB at a high growth company.

I'm happy to answer any questions that people have."

I busted my ass in school to get good grades, but I never did any personal projects and I don't enjoy coding in my free time. It's been giving me anxiety for the longest time because I thought I would end up hating the career once I started work. I've heard so many people talk about how you need to be passionate in this field and enjoy hackathons and personal projects, neither of which I ever want to do. 

Well it turns out I absolutely *love* the work. It's fun to solve problems all day. My team is super supportive and we all get along really well. I wake up looking forward to work which I genuinely didn't think was possible after so many years of customer service hell! There's no way I'll ever spend my free time coding, but it's really comforting to finally feel like I made the right choice making this my career.

I will be taking an internship (offered by my county's talented and gifted program), that acts as a yearlong course, in the CS field during all of my senior year. (unsure where as of right now due to rona). To get into these higher-level tech schools, my grades and gpa alone really won't cut it (B+ student w/ all honors/ap courses) and I want to do more things that will help me seem more passionate in general for Computer Science (which I am) rather than a grade seeking robot.

During the school year I tried to apply to a few SWE jobs and I got interviews but it was clear for both me and the interviewers that this was not where my passion was. I did CS because I absolutely love math and I took several CS courses before making it my major (and passed them with flying colors). My conclusion for pursuing my degree in CS was that I could essentially do any job that included math or statistics with a CS degree but could not get a CS job with a math or stats degree, ya know? (in case I had a change of heart). All in all, I graduated with honors in CS but I cannot stand coding. I even took a SWE internship last summer to see if it was just because the university tends to give tedious and irrelevant projects and if I actually would have fun in a work environment and working for a company, I was wrong. 

So with all that being said, my passions are very much into data analytics, product management, product engineering, business analyst, minimum amount of coding yet still involved in the product itself. (i do eventually want to create a startup). What other jobs are out there and what can I do with my degree? How do I tailor my extremely CS / SWE resume to fit those types data/ business analyst jobs or product jobs? Any ideas on some projects I could work on over the summer? I would really love the advice!! Thank you!

gls3t9,3,2020-05-17,Advice for future steps?,DS__throwaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gls3t9/advice_for_future_steps/,"Hello folks,  
I will be graduating in a few months from a top 10 CS university (Master Degree), with decent grades and some publications in top peer reviewed journals as first author.  
I am now looking for jobs, however, from the 40+ jobs I applied for, barely 2 answered back and gave me the opportunity to interview.  
I went to get my CV professionally checked, where they said it looked exactly as it should. Whenever we actually get to coding questions and interviews it works out well, but why is it that nobody even wants to let me interview in the first place?  
I've currently been applying for new grad positions, but as I do not have any internship experience I'm starting to think that this might be the reason why my CV might be off-putting, as I have no practical CS experience other than research.  
My goal is to work as research engineer either in computer vision or ML/AI. Would you recommend I get an internship (if that is even still possible this late in the year), or keep applying to new grad jobs after changing my CV again?  
I'm honestly at a bit of a loss here. I know that the current COVID-19 situation is not helping, and that there is a lot of experienced workforce looking to get hired right now, but I'm sure there must be  tech companies that still hire new grads without much experience, but who are willing to put in the work."

glsstq,6,2020-05-17,Life after Graduation,JustCG3,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/glsstq/life_after_graduation/,"I'm currently at the beginning of my final semester here at UCF before graduation. I transferred here in Fall 2019 with the intention of graduating with a Business Management degree at the end of Summer 2020, but I recently had to switch to a degree in Integrative General Studies to ensure I could graduate on time. So with that said, I'm hoping that some alumni could weigh in and give me some feedback as to what life was like after graduation. What did you do? Were you able to get a job? Where did you live? Was life as enjoyable as while you were in college? Do you have any suggestions or advice for things that I should be doing in this last semester or things I should do after graduation?

Right now I'm still trying to figure out exactly what my plan is. I want to continue living in Orlando rather than going back down south to live back with my parents, but I realize that it's expensive here and I don't have any jobs lined up. My plan is to start with an internship and then use that as a means to land a job that can pay enough for me to live here in Orlando. Any suggestions for places to live or ways to find a decent living situation would also be appreciated.

On top of trying to get my career/ housing situation figured out, I also want to get my social life figured out. I transferred here 9 months ago without knowing anyone and had high hopes of making friends and putting together an ideal college social experience, but it just didn't quite turn out that way. I went to clubs, events, spoke to people in class, and did everything I could, but was unable to get past the phase of being acquaintances to actually having good friends to hang out with. Having the Covid-19 pandemic breakout midway through my second semester definitely didn't help that. So my hope is that I can still live here in Orlando and still put together a social life just as good as I could've had in college even though I'm graduated. Please feel free to share any input on this as well. 

Thanks for reading. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."

I'm mainly interested in quant finance but I'm trying to figure out whether I should aim for tech internships as well. It would be awesome if I could get a couple opinions about whether I'll be likely to get in if I grind leetcode (or whatever I need to do to prepare) over the summer.

Some info: I'm majoring in computational and applied math with a 3.8 GPA. I did a web dev internship at a random media company after freshman year. I've been assisting with applied machine learning research for the past few months and I'm doing a fellowship-funded research project this summer. I've taken all the intro CS courses including algorithms, and I'm taking a machine learning course right now. I've pretty much never programmed outside of school/work though, and I don't have any side projects. Is this around the level of achievement I need or am I a better fit for less competitive internships?"

I went to a competitive engineering school and the entire time I was there, I always felt like something was wrong with me. 

1. I refused to join clubs/friend circles because I thought I wasn't cool/smart enough. 
2. I refused to date because I was afraid of rejection (even though I get told I am attractive).
3. I developed massive anxiety/guilt issues due to failed exams, projects, hw, etc. 
4. I kept postponing my applications to companies (and missing the deadlines), thinking my resume wasn't good enough. 
5. I refused to talk to my friends because I was too embarrassed that I had no internship for the summer. Even when I did get an offer, I felt like it wasn't good enough.
6. I didn't go to office hours, because I didn't want my professor to know how much behind I was. 
7. I set high expectations of getting an A, which I rarely did due to massive procrastination and inability to focus on lectures. As a result, I'd always feel like a major disappointment to my parents. This spiraled into self-hatred and depression.

However, there is something that's somewhat ""positive"" that I gained after college: I am now an overachiever. Since I always feel like I am not successful enough, not smart enough, not charismatic enough, and not attractive enough, I am always pushing myself to be better than before. I think this is something people don't realize when they meet me. On the outside, I look like a model adult who has everything, but underneath I am just deeply insecure, discontent with myself, and afraid of not meeting my expectations. I hope one day I can conquer all this through therapy, but for now, my medications do the job."

For seven months I worked in 12 different restaurant locations in thankless quick-service and custodial jobs (while making under minimum wage) and had to interact with hundreds- if not at least a thousand- people per day. Since we were all together in a consistently overcrowded park in the searing Florida heat, most of the people I dealt with were quite unhappy and more often than not rude (I got cursed at at least once a week, and even got spat at once for putting ice in someone's drink when apparently they didn't want any). I would then come home from work to my ""dorm"" with grease all over my clothes and tears in my eyes to see my four roommates (who were genuinely kind ladies- but unfortunately I was never able to grow close to them) giggling from a wholesome fun day they spent together, because their off-days were always during my work schedule. My days off I spent in an empty apartment as they worked their shifts. Twice I helped out with an elaborate birthday party for two of my roommates, but when mine came around they couldn't get out of work (my crap birthday is close to Christmas, and it was company policy to not take time-off requests at that time). I spent my 21st birthday seeing the movie Les Miserables, by myself. 

A few weeks later I ended my internship and moved to a big city, notorious for its rudeness. I spent my remaining college years-while being in a bad relationship where my ex didn't value my input on anything- bouncing from one restaurant to another. After a few years I developed a knack for mitigating the more obnoxious drunks with some jokey diplomacy, and so it became a habit for my coworkers to ask that I handle the worst customers. Eventually, it got to a point that I could only get along with loud-mouth locals. 

It's been almost eight years since that internship and frankly, talking to anyone *exhausts* me. I've been conditioned to view a new person as a new problem. Whenever a coworker or rare friend would ask anything of me, I replied ""what's *wrong?*"" instead of something along the lines of ""oh how can I help you?."" I've been talked down to by so many people that even if I witnessed the *vaguest possibility* that someone would act like a jerk to me, I just shut down and gave short, spiritless answers. For instance, if someone would start a request with ""gimme... uh,"" rather than ""may I please have..."" I didn't try to engage them in any type of conversation. I repeatedly had issues with people telling me I had an attitude, which I was always defensive of, because in my mind, that person didn't earn my niceties with something as meager as basic human decency. But, knowing how unbearably unhappy I was for so many years (and yes I was bullied all throughout school and don't talk to anyone from my hometown, go figure), I know that often, not always but often, that people who show the least grace deserve it the most.

Out of pandemic boredom I scoured Yelp for old reviews of my past restaurants, and I found a handful of reviews regarding my service. Some praised my hospitality (one even said ""I didn't know Millennials even worked hard until I saw her running around!""- which... small victories I suppose), but a small amount ranted about how awful I was, with one even calling me the c-word. 

I don't want people to feel anything like that when they meet me, but I'm at a loss. Putting up a charismatic front seems so debilitating now, and I really don't think I smile much at all, so I struggle with a resting b\*tchface. My career is in entertainment, and I NEED to be personable. I make eye contact with any of my servers or baristas and ask how they're doing, as well as tip generously, but I LOATHE going into brick-and-mortar stores lest the employees ask me ""if I need anything,"" in the event I decide not to buy anything. I also really make an effort to ensure that the people I am talking to feel heard (I even make a point to swing the conversation of a group back to the person who was originally speaking before another person swooped in) but I just. don't. smile. And I have a lot to smile about. 

Outside of active listening, are there techniques I can adopt to be more charming? I want people to be in a better mood after they meet me, because I suffer from chronic depression (shocker) and wouldn't wish that on anyone. I started looking into FBI interrogation and negotiation techniques, which is admittedly a bit bleak, but I hope that illustrates my desperation. Any and all thoughts would be greatly appreciated!!!"

I’m becoming quite old, getting into my late twenties.

I am currently doing a Bachelors in engineering, going into my third year.

I am quite concerned, because mental health has ruined my studies so I feel like I need time to recover. As I haven’t made much use of engineering skill building fraternities ar college.

I was aiming to find an internship for next year, a full year one. But mental health and corona virus happened, so it’s not looking too good now.

So my plan was to go for an integrated masters and then try looking for an internship next year again.

Only, if I do both an internship and an integrated masters, I will be 28 when I graduate?


Isn’t that quite old?

What wou you guys recommend?

1)graduate as soon ba a possible to start my life early if I manage to. 

2)Do an integrated masters to give me more time to recover from bad mental health and build my engineering skills up?

3) Do an internship and then graduate with just the bachelors in engineering?

4)Or do both but graduate at 28 at which point I would’ve felt like I barely lived my own independent life before 30?

What do you guys recommend?

TLDR: Is it a bad idea to graduate at 28 even though I might have more qualifications or work experience, compared to at 26, where I can start my life early and build up savings and be independent before I become 30?"
glxv2j,0,2020-05-18,Why an Internship is important for your career growth and how it can impact on your career?,AmphiGo,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/glxv2j/why_an_internship_is_important_for_your_career/," 

In the ever-changing world, you have to keep improving yourself.

The internship is the first phase after your schooling or college when you step into the industry to get to know your abilities.

The industry and market are very competitive, and you have to be very sharp and skilled to get through this cut-throat competition.

Most of the students after graduation apply for their internships with organizations and firms. An internship is becoming a crucial part of the career of a student after college.

According to the study of the National Association of Colleges and Employers [(NACE)](https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/internships/), there is more than 56% of graduating seniors who reported taking part in at least one internship.

Out of those participants, fifty-six percent of those were paid, and forty-four percent were unpaid. 

The internship is crucial to get experience when you are very new to the market. For young persons who are preparing to join the workforce, getting a relevant internship experience is the biggest issue. The internship defines the transitioning of your career in the coming years.

There are many advantages to having an internship experience when you are going to start your full-time career in the market.

Let us a look into the importance of internship in shaping your career.

**1. Career Exploration**

**2. Practical and Real-Time Work Experience**

**3. Personality Development**

**4. Networking**

5. **Impressive resume**

**6. The transition from Newbie to Full-time Expert**

I landed a paid internship a few months ago. The goal of the company is to train the 10 interns they selected and keep them as devs in their workforce. (In others words, they are investing).  


I did learn some stuff in these months (git, how big corporate projects look, using tools better etc). I had some ups and downs adjusting to the work environment and adjusted well enough to working remotely. However I still get stuck at seemingly simple stuff sometimes, ask stupid questions, and not enough questions. I feel like they don't hand me much work in purpose.

At 31, I'm realizing NOW is the time to make moves...

I'm currently working in an unfulfilling trade. I've been in this field for roughly 5 years, and \*mentally\* I've been absent the entire time.

In the background I pursued athletic/strength coaching as a side-hustle for my 'funny money'.  However, overtime I noticed myself becoming less and less excited for coaching as I was for learning and executing on marketing, content creation/copywriting, and storytelling.

So this realization coupled with the corona virus spurred me to close down my other gig (for good) and pursue an actual career around the things I like.

I'm really looking for a position that allows me to work with my brains over my hands.

A career that coalesces my knack for research/organization, learning, desire to create, and to work in a creative/business setting...

Ideally, I'm hungry to work in a marketing agency, but for now I'll take what I can get.

**My problem is that my resume is completely irrelevant...**

My buddy tells me to take a more direct path -- leaning on a technical skill (like salesforce) -- to gain entry into this world. And I'm okay with that so long it starts to build my resume and gets me heading down the right path.

I'm also working on putting a website together where I can *dimensionalize* what I know and my ability to write. I'm thinking if I can display my marketing skills on it -- by growing and leveraging an email list, building traffic, and creating offers-- then it can replace my weak resume.

I'm also looking to find short(er) internships with agencys where I can lend a hand on projects in exchange for using their name on my resume...

In a way, I know what my **north star** is, but my compass dial is spinning in one hundred directions. I'm really seeking advice on what my priority should be right now.

Anywho,

For those that made a career change into marketing what steps did you take that proved most helpful?"

I have been working at Whole Foods for the past five years, which is really helpful as employers can see that I am dedicated and responsible in holding a position for a solid length of time. I dont wanna fall into the loop of working at whole foods with a college degree, I have too many people I work with in that position. I am going to make a LinkedIn later today.

I feel lost and don't wanna get left behind... Can anyone give me advice on how to put myself out there, where to look and what I should be doing. I haven't had an internship in IT yet, which is probably the first step. I got so caught up working and going to school and trying to enjoy my college years, I put it off. 

I am now reading other posts that are dissing ITI and that its for people who can't do comp sci. Did I screw myself? Should I have done comp sci? I am not the best with coding, but decent.

I am ready to find a new job, which pays more than 16 an hour :P. Let me know what you guys think...

And to anyone else that is graduating during this crazy pandemic, do you know when we should be getting our diploma? I filled out the form for it. I am the last one that gets excited for graduation, but its weird leaving Rutgers with no formal goodbye. After getting accepted to Rutgers, that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing my family proud is what motivated me. Its going to be weird just having a piece of paper with no ceremony haha.

First internship- 6months
Freelance in startup- 5months
Discontinued after probation- 3months
Second internship (the one above)-6months

Obviously I am torn but I only want to find solutions before my situation starts to affect other parts of my life. Specially my focus on being independent, paying debts and starting new life with my bf in another country where I cannot go for lack of visa. Mainly lack of capital scares me-I have a lil ove4 2000€ overall and only source of income left are my private tutoring where I teach math to a student. 

I also did Pubcrawls. Fair money for extra savings.

I am very strong on soft skills part and I am exploring some EA(Executive Assistant) courses. It's possible to leverage both my okay technical skills and strong soft skills in a position like that. Plus I am real people's person. 

I am F28. And I feel scared to make this huge career shift. 
Obviously as I invested in my Master's. Acquired debt over studying and moving overseas. Regret is a negative word as I did experience so many amazing things and learned a new language, now I am Trilingual plus my mother tongue. I cannot help but feel if somehow things would turn out different and more stable and professional success might just show up. I worked so hard. And now it looks all for nothing. 

For now my focus is to find a way to make money stable way. I want to be doing a job and not leave for at least 2 to 3 years or as long as I want.
My father worked 2 jobs in his whole Life and I am a fucking job Hopper. I feel very disappointed in myself.

I graduated a year ago with my bachelors in chemical engineering. I always wanted to pursue a career in process engineering, but I couldn’t find many jobs in my area hiring a recent grad with only internship experience. However, I managed to land a job as a quality engineer in the automotive industry and now have 9 months of experience in that position. I know there are problems with every job but I have felt unwelcome from the beginning. I’ve asked family for advice and I keep being told to wait it out, but my days are extremely slow and unchallenging. Every time I ask to get involved in something whether it be the smallest task or a big project I’m always given bad excuses and pushed out. I’ve been here a while, constantly try to get involved and get some more work and I am told no. My boss is very passive and no help. I’m constantly asked if I’m a new intern, and it’s actually starting to feel like I am one at this point. 

I would love to try a new job as a process engineer, but what are the odds that I can get the job I want with hardly any real projects to talk about? I’ve been working almost a year with hardly any real work that is helpful in an interview. It’s been very hard on my emotional well-being and I would just like some thoughts on my situation from someone other than my parents. Is this normal for a recent grad? Should I try applying for other jobs? Did I kill my chances taking this job in the first place?

Thanks in advance!"
gm31vv,4,2020-05-18,My winding path of becoming a developer.,bigphildogg86,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gm31vv/my_winding_path_of_becoming_a_developer/," 

Hello all,

I am a 34 years old Senior Software Developer. I have not been part of this sub long enough to call it toxic and that isn't the point of this post anyways. I have been a developer in some form or another for 14 years now. I make around 100k a year in a midwest not large city with low COL. It's around Dayton, OH so we are normally on the map but are far from a metropolis. I can't speak to larger cities if they have opportunities like what I've found but just wanted to put this out there for those in the kind of markets that I live around or those who would want to relocate in order to be around this kind of market.

I took a bit of a bumpy road to get where I'm at. But I like to believe that I am good at what I do. I did get a few breaks - but that's why networking is so important.

For my education I started at a career center as a junior in highschool. I was lucky that I had been exposed to computers and how they worked from a younger age. My father was a mechanical engineer at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and so always had access to new computers and was showing us anything electrical he could. He has a masters in engineering. This comes into play later.

I worked at fast food as a 16 year old as soon as I could so I could have my own money. I also worked at a grocery store and at a call center. This I think lent to a work ethic that I built.

I went to the career center where I was exposed to A++, NET+, graphic design and development. Development starting there was QBasic and Visual Basic (oh my). From there i got a scholarship for $3,000 to the local community college where tuition is 12,000 a year or so for in state students. I planned to transfer for a 4 year college and get my bachelor's degree. Unfortunately I got pretty burned out on school. I think my GPA ended up around 2.8 or something. I really was not proud but I didn't care at the time. I was drinking a lot and just didn't have it in me. And higher level math ended up not being a strong suit for me either and I was never good at studying. I graduated with an Associates in Computer Information Science with a specialty in development. I had taken C# courses, an oracle course, C++ courses and I also had to do some server and networking courses. Those (except networking) I always did really well in. The general education courses are the ones that I struggled with.

My first internship was at the Air Force base while I was going to community college. A friend got me in there. I didn't consider it good experience. To ask the senior developers for help felt like pulling teeth - like us interns were so bothersome. I taught myself Java because there weren't enough side projects for the devs to hand to us. I ended up mostly spending my time scanning documents into an OCR systems and cataloging them using a php website that someone else had written. It was something for my resume but I really did not consider that good experience besides teaching myself some Java.

Then I got an offer from another contractor in the same building for a full time position. Woohoo I thought. I went there and this was a very small contractor. They were mostly doing mathematical modeling but needed an application that could import the excels that their main guy was working in so that they could do reporting and such on the data. What I also didn't realize is that they had no IT department whatsoever. I ended up wearing ALL of the hats. I worked on their server (which was like 10 years old), I worked on their network, I tried to make sure backups were running, I cleared the desktops of malware when these PHDs would click god knows whatever link and I also worked on a simple C# desktop app with SQL Server express as a backend. You really realize that everyone has their own niche, when these scientists and very intelligent people couldn't figure out the printer, or couldn't figure out that the fake anti virus warning was not the real anti virus. Knowing computers and knowing science are two very different things. It was eye opening - that I could still be needed by these folks.

Well lo and behold that job also was not good for gaining experience as there was just no one senior to learn from. I ended up getting laid off from there because the contract was ending - at this job I was making about 30,000 a year. I was on unemployment at this point and had three months to find a job. The first two months I spent screwing off and partying. It was stupid, I know this now, hell I knew it then but I just didn't care. Until it finally hit me that I had to do something. I was living with friends at the time renting a room in their house for 250 dollars a month. That was one of my saving graces.

Anyways I go to a job fair at the community college that I graduated from. I also worked through a head hunter to also look for me. I got two interviews. I showed up to both hungover. I ended up with an offer from both. Now I'm not advocating saucing up before going to interviews - but I really do believe my relaxed persona helped me answer calmly and made me less jittery.

I took the offer that I was more excited about - it was with a company in the health care industry. One thing I will say is - if you don't want to go FAANG - healthcare is a great alternative. Generally healthcare is recession resistant. With the pandemic we have not felt the effects generally. I think we aren't doing quite as well as we would be - but the company is still hitting some marks. Healthcare is and always will be needed.

I started at this job very green. Junior developer that started with two other junior developers. There are two senior developers and two server/helpdesk folks. It's actually a fairly small company (under 200 employees). There's a 24/7 call center, customer service and many others.

Here's the stack of software that I started with (laugh with me) - classic asp websites, an access database with linked tables to a Microsoft SQL Server and windows services. They had just gotten a big contract and were going to start working on some .NET software soon. I learned it all, I learned classic ASP, I learned Access better than I ever had, and there are thousands of lines of VBA that back this database. I learned how to create windows services and RESTful web APIs. I created a .NET desktop app. Then we finally moved to doing some .NET MVC web apps. I started at this company 8 years ago. Sadly we haven't been able to fully replace the access software - but we have written most of an application that will. We just need to get the business focused on being able to get rid of it. I am still here at this company. I am a senior software engineer. I became proficient enough at the database that they asked if I'd be interested in becoming the DBA part of the time as well - that was partly because they were having trouble finding a DBA - but hey I was fine with that. I am now certified in Microsoft SQL Server 2016 with my MCSA and am working on my MCSE. For the development side for a new app we are writing I thought it'd be a perfect case to use React. I convinced my team and the business to let us take a little extra time to learn React and use it. The app has been production tested a few times now with users and we will be working towards a release in June. Everyone in the company really likes the new app - and I and the team got to learn a new language. With adding DBA to my title I have been bumped just over the 100k mark. It's a great feeling and I never even thought I would get there.

I didn't know this company would be my career - most companies probably are not like this. I have had great managers that realized my potential and also made sure I didn't leave. I started here at 32,000 a year. At one point I got bumped to 50,000, then I got to 60,000, then 70,000 and finally 86,000. They have made sure I'm taken care of. At this point I know almost every facet of the business. We've had some turnover on the dev side over the years. Yes I have frustrations. There were times early on that we were somewhat abused and I had 80 hours weeks for multiple weeks. We now follow a rough agile methodology though and in the position I'm in I am able to push back on unreasonable requests. It's all about give and take. I have received offers from other companies as well - so at this point in my life I know if this job were to fall apart - I would be able to find another. Maybe not with the current salary I have - but close I'm betting.

I always regretted not finishing my bachelor's. I have always felt inferior to new devs coming into our company with their bachelor's. My dad had pushed for me to continue as well - I don't think he knew that I could do what I've done with just an associates. I am married now and have a 10 month old child. I did try to start the transfer program up again after I got married. I did one math class online - and oh man. It took so much of my time, my wife missed me and I was always either working, going to class or studying for the one class. At the rate of one class per semester it would be like 4 or 5 years to get my bachelor's. The thought of doing that was not worth it. Plus at the time I was already making 70k. Would I get a pay raise for finishing my bachelor's? No - part of me thought I could go back to the air force base if I finished it and really ""do something"". But you know what I realized? I'm doing well. I have time for my family. I spend weekends taking care of the house, playing some xbox and playing with our baby. We hang out with friends when it's not a pandemic and just get to live life. My dad one day told me how proud he was of me - and the way he said it - it just made me realize he was kind of surprised what I had done. At one point I started a side business with a coworker. We got one really good contract - this was before I was married - but again it took all my time. I didn't want that still. It wasn't healthy - I didn't have time to do my laundry working a full time job and doing this side job. At least for me I couldn't do it. At that time I was only making maybe 50K at my main job - but I decided that was enough for then. The side job afforded me to be able to buy backpacking gear so that I could learn to backpack and took some trips doing that - just one or two days here and there. So that made it worth it. But I don't need to do that again. At least I tried I figured - and it wasn't for me.

I wanted to share this because reading this sub - even with all that I've accomplished I did feel inferior - again. Like what would happen if I lost my job. I questioned if I could get another. It's a self-confidence thing. I wouldn't blame anyone here for that - it's my insecurity - however for people like me - who maybe aren't following the straight and narrow to see that there is a way to make your path without normal convention. Until this sub I never even knew the acronym ""FAANG"". I had never heard of leetcode. I didn't grind leetcode - but I sure as hell did grind real world experience. Projects at work I took on with an obsession. I would see code I didn't understand and even though it wasn't in my ticket I would follow it through so that I knew what was going on. I do love to code so that helps. I did spend extra time when I was learning it all. I do spend extra time now even too. Because I enjoy the work and like when learning React - I did the tutorials on my own time.

My company helps people, and I help the folks who are helping people. It's rewarding - and I love when I present a new feature or software and someone lights up and says ""YES! That's what I wanted.This will save us so much time"". I don't have to change the world - I just have to make someone's day better by making their job easier. At one point I thought doing ""really cool"" things with drones or something would be rewarding. But no - I'm good right here.

Now - from someone in this position - my tips would be:

1. Learn to debug well. This has saved me so many times and has set me apart from my peers. I can fix something in a hurry and if needed come up with an out of the box fix.
2. Learn to be curious about code you don't understand - if you don't know what a piece of code is doing - focus on it. Figure out what it's doing, step through it. It might save you later because you may learn a new skill that was used in that code or you may realize what you're working on is impacted by that piece of code. Many mistakes are made because a dev doesn't truly understand the piece of code they are changing.
3. Learn to network - if you are looking for a job, hit job fairs. No job fair is off limits. Talk to anyone and everyone. Look into local development groups that meet up to have talks. A company near me does free food and talks monthly or quarterly. Others meet at a restaurant or coffee shop and just talk development.
4. Learn to unit test early - this I am still working on - the test first philosophy I haven't fully been able to embrace - part of it is the culture where I work but the other part is I didn't learn it until late in my career. This can be a good tool so that you don't have to debug as much :D
5. Learn soft skills - Part of the reason I've done so well I think is that people generally LIKE me. I talk to people like humans and equals. I learn to cut out the technical jargon and explain why something broke to help them understand and what I did to fix it so that it won't happen again. In my many hats I have gathered requirements also - sometimes as a dev you will need to - so learning to talk to people and really get at what they need is invaluable.
6. Learn about the other branches of computer science - Another part of what's helped me is that I know how computers are built. Having NET+ and A++ experience as well as doing some on my own I am able to talk to our network and server people with a level of confidence. I have been able to understand on the WHOLE what is going on when my app connects to another server or does something on the network or with a server. Many devs I've worked with only know development - and it really limits the kind of out of the box thinking that can help you find issues that may not be a coding problem alone.
7. Be honest and own up. When a mistake is made be truthful but have a plan for what you'll do to correct it. I have been forgiven for many things - because I owned up to it right away. I have updated a table entirely with incorrect data, I've taken a server offline accidentally. These are all things that can happen especially in a small company with few controls. It's the learning from those mistakes, being open about it and being honest that management appreciates. Now obviously if this happens too much you may need to revisit why it keeps happening but keep this in mind.
8. Be humble and be grateful. Everytime I have been bumped in pay - I have been flabbergasted and thankful. I make sure to thank them and it has helped renew my effort. Understand that although I am proud of what I have done - I am not the king and I am definitely NOT the best developer in the world. I have gotten some lucky breaks but have worked hard.
9. Try to solve a problem for a specific amount of time - then ask for help. As junior and still today - I ALWAYS try to solve a problem myself first. I use the internet, I go over the code with a fine tooth comb if something isn't working right. If I still can't figure it out I try to think of what it could be and I take a break. Then I'll try again - but if it's been a few hours - sometimes less is fine too. It all depends on the problem, and the due date for what you're working on. Then I'll go to another dev to ask for help. Do not be afraid to ask for help. If you have senior devs who aren't willing to help - then it might be time to find a new job. When I came into this job I had seniors who had been in the field for 20+ years. They helped a lot and I made sure to ask questions until I really understood the issue. Now as a senior - I don't appreciate it when someone just says ""X isn't working"" and sends me a screenshot. I need you to tell me what you did to try to fix it. What do you think it is? I like to potentially know how long you've been at it too. But please don't bring a fresh problem to me - the only way you'll learn and retain is if you work hard at it - not ask me to feed you the answer.
10. I'm making this the last tip - there could be so much more but don't be too good for any task. I have vetted excels of data, I have corrected data, I have manually copied and translated VBA code to SQL stored procedures - lots of boring tasks. Lots of tasks that aren't even necessarily dev related. Now - that is not to say you should be abused with that work constantly - there is a limit. But when that kind of work is at least being rotated fairly - or you are the junior so sometimes you will do grunt work - just try to work it and get through it as best as you can with attention to detail. It's not fun but no one enjoys every part of their job.

Well - now that I've written a 5,000 word essay - please if you have any questions or comments let me know. I am an open book on this subject. I really do hope those who made it through this and needed to see this can see that there's not just one way. Don't let others set your expectations - you can create a path if you look in places that aren't traditional.

P.S. On the topic of side projects - I have tried my hand at a few side projects. I haven't finished any myself but I have been gainfully employed for a long time. What we like to see when hiring is that if you were between jobs, or don't have a lot of experience that you can at least talk about either side projects you've worked, technologies you've looked into, email lists, websites or other resources that can help keep you up to date on development technologies or information. Just show that you have an interest in being a learning."

gm4cmq,399,2020-05-18,"23. Unemployed. One year out of University, cant get a career or even a job going. How screwed am I with Covid-19?",The-Treehugger,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gm4cmq/23_unemployed_one_year_out_of_university_cant_get/,"A bit of background:

Im a 23 y/o Female and I only have ever worked casually (high school through to March this year). I worked in retail all through uni. Due to the economy here in Australia (im talking before covid19), I struggled to also get the hours I wanted in these casual positions as a 18-22 year old and probably wasnt the best worker due to my mental health issues. I tried so hard though.

From Jan-March this year I worked in administration for a not for profit. This role was only 15 hours a week and I only got it through nepotism (spent a bit under a year volunteering in that role beforehand). In this admin role, I was told that they couldnt pay me when the manager returned from her trip that was cancelled due to Covid-19, and thats why I left in March (Laid off I guess). They didnt explicitly state if it was due to not actually being able to justify my role or simply Corona-virus. I had a casual contract till Dec 2020 in this role.  I was disappointed because I found the work easy and they constantly ask me to do work for them now (Im still volunteering for them).

Anyway thats a bit of background.

Im struggling to find work in my field and I just dont know what to do. Ive suffered from serve anxiety and depression since I was in highschool.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce, in International Relations and Legal Studies, with a distinction average (mid 70s average mark). The Legal Studies side is basically like 'qualifications' in legal secretary work. However, I found out too late its extremely difficult to get into legal admin work without connections. International Relations is an arts major, but the majority of my high achieving class mates are now working in grad roles for high level government departments or international organisations etc. Due to my legal studies major, I could do a J.D Law Degree in 2 years if I wanted to, but I dont really want to be a lawyer, plus Australia is super saturated with unemployed lawyers who hold average intelligence.

I found it hard to put in applications while I was finishing at uni, but between July last year (when i graduated) and November 2019, I put in about 100 applications.  70 of those would of been relevant positions to my degree. Of those 70, I had about 5 face to face interviews and about 2 phone interviews. All obviously weren't successful. A lot of these positions I couldn't get past the psychometric testing part of the application process (when they were graduate roles)

(I applied to a broad range of graduate programs in both the public and private sector- to entry level admin/sales/support positions i could use as a stepping stone.) I know its not alot, but most people with the same degree havent had this issue, and my anxiety was so bad after I while, I admit I gave up.

I stopped applying when I landed a Christmas retail position I working in up to 50 hours a week- then i moved onto the nepotism admin role in Jan. Ive been applying again from Jan this year but no Luck. Then Coronavirus hit and I just have been ignoring the entry level roles now because everyone is on a hiring freeze and focusing on graduate programs which would start next year.

Things I want to mention/clarify

1. Ive had my CV/Resume run over about 5 times with a career councillor. They think its pretty good so im not sure what else I can do. I ustilise the S.T.A.R method to demonstrate my experience/volunteering etc on my CV. Its two pages long, which is normal in Australia for graduates.
2. I  dont have an internship under my belt. I tried very hard to get an internship, literally got one in my last semester, they said 'you can start on Monday"" -then I  got a call four hours later saying they could'nt give me the internship after all. The 'big boss' didnt think he could run me through the ropes or something before he left for a holiday.. Im not sure if this was just an excuse, but this was for a professional partisan Industry chamber lol. It blew my confidence massively.
3. I have 2 years experience in 2 volunteering roles. Basically event management/fundraising and supporting refugees and migrants integrate/learn English.
4. I write each individual cover letter from scratch to suit the companies needs/utilise key words. Every, single time no matter the role.
5. Im not picky. I realise at my age, I can try anything or any industry. I just want to get my foot in the door. Like I said, I have applied to 'very top' graduate government roles- to local council admin job roles- to entry level admin jobs for small businesses to KPMG, EY etc.

I honestly think Im just a dumbass, and I will never be able to land a full time job. If I cant make it past most of the psychometric testing in these graduate jobs, it must be true, right?

Also because of my anxiety, a lot of the positions Im too afraid to apply for.  I look at the skills and experience and I freak out. An admin role asking for 3 years experience? Forget about it. I've realised I dont actually have many solid technical skills, despite, obviously a pretty much worthless degree and vague transferable skills.

Its so disheartening. Im really not sure what I should do. None of my close friends went to uni, are unemployed or work in completely different industries. My dad is a mechanic and my mum has been a home-maker for 30 years.

What should I do? Should I continue to apply for graduate roles, or focus on very low level admin/business/sales roles and go from there?

Edited: for my shocking grammar at 1am. I do apologise. Im also a pretty 'straight' person. No tattoos, piercings, crazy hair colours and I like the real trees, not the ones you smoke through a pipe."

I'm a second year student at a decent uni (top 20 in the guardian rankings, around 40 elsewhere) and am on track to get a first (75% last year, safety net of 74% this year being my lowest grade I can receive, along with a couple MTA and the Azure Fundamentals course), had a 3 month internship as a software engineer at the UK's biggest insurance company (according to my searches, at least). Am hoping to get another internship there this summer but it is looking unlikely due to the virus, sadly :(.

I have a good team project from university and am currently working on my own project (Simple hardware monitor using WPF but something to show on my CV/LinkedIn of what I can do). CV avaliable at: [http://prntscr.com/sj3r0e](http://prntscr.com/sj3r0e)

To cut to the point of this, I ***think*** I want to move to London (I've only ever lived in relatively small, quiet cities) for a software engineering role (I'm open to other technology roles, just software engineering is the one I have experience in) as seemingly a lot of opportunities and seems like it should be a lot of fun whilst I'm young. What sort of roles/salaries should I be expecting/looking for? As well as what to look for? (i.e. if a company says something like this don't go near them) 

In summary, should I be looking to go for the big boy FAANG grad roles, or am I better looking at smaller companies? The dream would be to end up at Microsoft or Google.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)"

Is anyone else seeing this in Win10 1903?

I'm not even sure if this will actually reach someone since this is a very rough draft of words and thoughts all written and jumbled together and uploaded, but it's worth a try, right?

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't go on a full detail about our company just yet. Smarty is still unstable going through the testing period as a proper creature, and the Surfacers would delete everything regarding me by writing everything just yet, so basic explanations would suffice for now.

So, the company that I work at creates monsters in this big, secret underground building. Actual living, breathing, and moving creatures that look nothing like what we see in everyday life. *Various gods, mythical creatures, urban monsters, cryptic, fiends -* whatever you call them, they have it all here - created, contained, raised, and used in various ways. Mostly used in beneficial ways for humans. We try to find a good or useful purpose for each creature, totally in human perspective. It's not like they have any choice, but only God knows what and who all this work is for.

There are staff members that look after and control the creatures, officially called *caretakers*. Usually, it's only one person caring per creature, but some have more than two depending on the entity. Since the creatures have quite eccentric and abnormal behaviors, most creatures that have a risk level over 3 are recommended to care in partners or more for the sake of safety.

&amp;#x200B;

I, happened to take care of a typewriter.

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine me, a few months before, a newly hired intern that knows nothing about taking care or even surviving monsters at all, having a task of caretaker of an automatic typewriter. At first, I thought that this was some kind of bullying from the senior and other staff. Turns out, when my senior **Levol** \- *we'll talk about her someday, she's beyond amazing*\- showed her three unicorns that she takes care of, it was no joke or bullying.

""I thought that those were only myths?"" Confused and freaked out, I asked my senior as she gave me three sugar cubes to feed it to the unicorns. Apparently, they had almost the same appetite as normal horses.

""Well, yeah. Stop shaking your hand. This is reality and you have to take care of BM-0212, the typewriter. You said you wanted to be called R?""

""Yes, but I worked in a small marketing company before I came here. I, I don't know how-""

""Oh, just, stop whining. You think I knew how to take care of a horse before I met Sandalphone,  Sleipnir, and Liccoshe? We have internet here, use it to do research on whatever you need to."" One of the unicorns nudged its face against Levol, and I wiped the horse- no, unicorn spits on my lab coat. Their spits had glitters on it. Gross.

""This... is not really a fair job, is it?""

""Face it, R. At least they don't care about your education degrees and give you damn thick paychecks with great medical care service. Just don't make the creatures kill or torture you, but 0212 is easy to take care of unless you have a fragile mentality. The last one got crazed over what he saw, but I think you can do better.""

""What happened to them?"" Levol just made a small sigh, and said, ""Something that you wouldn't want to know on your first day of work as a caretaker.""

Now, a sudden nervousness started to rise from my throat. I mean, the company did give high life allowance and made me sign a contract that I am responsible for my own actions and death. I didn't want to know what happened to them at then. This pure pressure from facing the unknown was higher than I expected, but I somehow managed to not faint.

&amp;#x200B;

When Levol took me to the shelter I will be working in, it had a huge iron door with steel doorplate that had ""BM-0212"" written on it. To me, it looked like a prison more than a shelter. Still does.

""The door will open when you stand in front of it and it scans your fingerprint, iris, voice, hair, and whatever body part that you have attached to yourself. Our company got some way-too-advanced technologies to identify and keep mimicking creatures away from creating chaos.""

""That sounds nothing like I've heard before."" Mimicking creatures? Over-technology materials for just a door? Is this even safe anymore?

""Neither have I, and I majored in electro-mechanical engineering. Anyway, go in for your work. I can't help you out from here, but just remember Four Rules. **Read the past reports and records about your creature, don't panic if the siren or someone screams, someone's loss of blood, intestines, or limbs are not your major concerns but your creature's safety is, and only stay in your creature's shelter if a danger announcement is made.** Got it?""

""Got it."" As I entered the room, what I saw was nothing like I imagined. I thought that the room would've looked like an interrogation room or a prison block from its blunt, rough iron door, but BM-0212's room looked more like a cozy, comfortable study that you'd see in an old Victorian house. There was a fireplace with woods and warm fire, a huge sofa that looked like it belonged to the Palace of Versailles, a coffee table full of document files, and a single typewriter.

Honestly, this at first kind of displeased me because it looked... way too common. Too plain. I thought that unicorns were much cooler to take care of, but no, this typewriter is the best out of any creature that this company has ever made.

Anyway, I had a work to be done. I sat on the sofa, took the documents, and started reading them.

&amp;#x200B;

Official codename **BM-0212**, risk level 2, non-living object, classified as a machine entity, artificially made creature, and a *fucking* fancy, old-fashioned typewriter. That word was not supposed to be in there but whatever, it's not like I can really do anything about this. It writes on its own.

Yes, this typewriter has a mind of its own and writes whatever it wants to one the paper.

I call this creature *Smarty*. Not just because BM-0212 is too long, but it's a sort of tradition for every caretaker to nickname their own creature for some reason in here. I don't know who started it, but some of the seniors say that I'd rather not want to know about the past events when another creature, **BM-0421**, did when their caretaker took a day off and substitute staff called it 0421 instead of its nickname.

To explain Smarty's appearance as best as I can, it looks like a silver typewriter that you'd see in history museums or small antique shops selling 18th-century stuff. Small keyboards made of pearls and have fancy letters written on it presses and makes clacking sound by itself whenever you put- no, touch it.

Smarty is very similar to a normal typewriter, so it needs new paper if it finishes writing. I'm the one that has the task of changing and refilling the papers whenever Smarty finishes typing or runs out of it.

The ink that Smarty use has a similar color component as human blood. It doesn't run out as the papers do, but I was freaked out when Smarty just splashed blood-red letters and words on the paper that meant nothing and nonsense for some time when we first met. But it's not real blood, just ink that resembles it too much. Way too much. Smarty just likes that color. Even I can't tell Smarty to change it.

Okay, Smarty also can't fix grammar or typing errors as you would on computers, but it just writes whatever it's thinking on its own. Smarty does get frustrated if it makes a single typo or grammar mistake. I think that's enough to be quite phenomenal in the literature area.

&amp;#x200B;

""So, you never really liked the other caretakers?""

*""Yes, those humans were not only rude, but never had a sense of humor. Those people and you, dear R, are as different as water and oil.""* Clicking sounds came from Smarty as it typed out responses. We usually conversed like this when we were bored. Caretakers had a job, but my job was close to just hanging out or cleaning the room since Smarty was, well, just a typewriter that didn't require anything other than changing paper and cleaning dusts off.

""But your sense of humor is horrible. I mean, it's content is good, but the way you write it looks like a blood ritual curse from Satan or something.""

*""Funny. It's not that different from what you're saying, dear R. You'd rather not know what wish to I write. They're too dangerous for you. You'd die from pure horror if you see what disgusting things I see in human minds.""*

Sometimes, the caretakers and creatures get attached, and those things tend to happen often. It's not rare to see one of the staff running back to their creature immediately after lunchtime is over. Some get along like best friends, others pray desperately to not lose another limb or go mad. Thankfully, I like Smarty very much, and it seems that this precious little machine does like me too since I talk almost every day with Smarty.

&amp;#x200B;

As I said, Smarty does nothing other than automatically writing whatever it has on the mind. From what Smarty told, no, wrote to me, it also knows understands my words when I speak and knows what I'm thinking if I touch Smarty.

Well, Smarty doesn't try to dig into my deepest fears when I touch it or splash those red inks on the paper like its some cursed being, so that's a huge chunk of favor coming from Smarty. I even got a letter that said *""Be honored that I like you the most out of all living things,""* from Smarty. Not that I want to brag it, but it feels like a prize that Smarty *does* like me.

Technically, Smarty's company's property but I'm the only staff taking care of and using this, so I can call it partially mine. No one really cares after all. Other staffs think that this precious little machine falls into a useless category for writing too much, but no, Smarty is quite badass when it comes to breaking into people's minds- but that story is for later.

&amp;#x200B;

""Huh, that's kinda creepy. Please don't do that to me?""

*""It's not 'creepy' but only natural. However, I'll make an exception, then. Only for you, dear R.""*

If you think about where Smarty can be used, it can be used in a lot of fields. Smarty's great at writing fantastic stories, is a great talk mate, and is, to my surprise, gentle and caring in some parts. But some are straight out creeped out by this trait, and how I can get close to such a disturbing creature. (*From what I know of, many of the staff and company members seem to be afraid of smart creatures, and Smarty lives up to its nickname that I gave.*) Trust me, when a tired staff member accidentally touched this precious little machine before and it instantly typed out a huge chunk of *""I can't do this anymore""* repeating all over again on a full page. Never heard or saw anything from that staff after he screamed and ran away from seeing the paper writing on its own as Smarty just typed a bunch of laughing onomatopoeias. Poor thing.

For some days after our first meeting, I spent the days in peace and wrote some new rules for the manual document. Easy, simple rules that don't really make Smarty and me happy in our relationship but the Surfacers- those watchers of company, happy enough.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;^(1.  Try to make BM-0212 write every day, or else it will become rusty in few days.)  
&gt;  
&gt;^(2. Treat BM-0212 as you would with any typewriter, but never put or drop oil on the typewriter. It will make the caretaker's blood hard to clean.)  
&gt;  
&gt;^(3.  BM-0212's room should be cleaned by the caretaker, but never use water to clean the room. Moisture will cause BM-0212's paper to crumble, and the caretaker will be fired.)  
&gt;  
&gt;^(4.  Anything that BM-0212 writes is to startle you, the caretaker. Don't believe that whatever BM-0212 write is true.)  
&gt;  
&gt;^(5.  Anything that was written by BM-0212 should be stored, not burned or torn. If the writings get harmed, I cannot guarantee that BM-0212 will recognize you as your caretaker.)

These, are some half-assed rules that Smarty and I came up with for the annual report about creatures. To my surprise, kinda worked. Well, the general manager didn't say anything about it, so I thought it worked. It seemed like my boss doesn't really consider anything other than keeping creatures safe and sound without trouble.

Sure, I don't really follow those rules, but that's just because Smarty makes special exceptions for me. It's not like the Surfacers actually care about Smarty and my interactions. I was doing a perfect job as a caretaker, keeping a dangerous creature from causing harm and chaos in the company.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh, I was *so* wrong.

Smarty is not even close to *anything* considered dangerous in this company, and I learned that the hard way after a few days I met Smarty.

And it was all happened because of that stupid report we wrote."

*Sorry, this is kinda long, some life-story-ish stuff ahead!*

I’m a 33F Children’s Librarian at a fairly large (but not huge) suburban library in the greater Chicago area. My job is actually good – full-time, decent pay (not amazing but liveable), awesome manager, great coworkers. I actually raised through the ranks pretty quickly – I went from a shelver to part-time librarian to full-time in a short amount of time, and I’ve accomplished a lot. However, now that I’ve finally “arrived”, so to speak, I can see that this is not my passion. I sort of stumbled into this job. I originally got my MLIS with the intention of becoming an archivist, but honestly, I was young, dumb, and desperate to get out of my crappy hotel front-desk job that I managed to hold onto during the 2008/9 recession, and thus did not really think that job path through very well. It was honestly a pretty rash decision, and came out of it with a MLIS degree but no experience, which is how I ended up as a shelver with a Master’s degree at my library. I just applied to whatever job came available, which is how I ended up where I am in the Youth Department. But, I have always felt kind of like a fraud – I honestly don’t care that much about creating library programs or Summer Reading or even children’s fiction books (I’ve always been more drawn to nonfiction). So I’m in a good place, but I don’t exactly love the work I’m doing.

I thought about finding a way to transition over to an archival or digital library job, but it’s been so long since I’ve done archival/digital library work that I don’t know if a hiring manager would even look my way, and again, I have no real experience outside of my semester-long internship I did many years ago. Plus, I have been thinking about my true passions, and I still don’t know that I’d be happy doing that type of work. I landed on pursuing an MLIS for archiving as a way to “use” my B.A. in History. That Bachelor’s degree is yet another one that I did not think through very well. I had no idea what my passions were at the time, so I just majored in something that seemed sort of interesting. TBH something like Anthropology would have been a little more up my alley, but my small university did not offer that as a degree and for some reason I didn’t want to transfer schools. I did not think of any sort of career path, and ended up graduating into the recession with no options and a useless degree.

Again, I was young and dumb, admittedly had no clue what I was doing, and I’ve learned my lesson, I hope. My real interest and passion would involve something to do with Ecology – restoring habitats, conservation, helping endangered species, reducing pollution and plastic waste. Ocean cleanup sounds awesome, but I don’t live near a coast, unless you count the Great Lakes, haha. I want to start gravitating towards pursuing a career path that involves those types of things, but I want to do it right this time – get some experience BEFORE ending up with a useless degree, make connections with people in the field, and just have a clearer, more well-planned path ahead of me. I may need to do things fairly slow, as I don’t want to incur tons of debt if I can avoid it, and I don’t necessarily want to take a huge pay cut if I can avoid it – I have two kids, and my spouse and I are trying to save up for a house too.

One way I think I can manage is by dropping down to part-time in my library work, and either getting a part-time job in the ecology field, or volunteering somewhere. This will be even more possible in a year, after my spouse has gotten a certification which will likely double his current salary. In the meantime, I’ve been brushing up on biology and ecology courses on Khan Academy, which have really been fascinating! I loved this stuff as a kid, and somehow forgot how much I loved it as I got into my teen/young adult years.

So I guess my question is if anyone has any suggestions on the best way to progress? What degree(s) should I get? What jobs could I pursue? Is there a way I can use my experience as a librarian to make myself more marketable in the Ecology field? What organizations could I look for to try to get some experience under my belt before jumping into a degree?  This would also help me feel absolutely sure that I’m not pursuing a degree I’ll end up hating again. Salary-wise, I’m not necessarily looking for a huge pay increase or anything, but I also don’t want to make poverty wages. Something comparable to what I’m making now ($40,000-$50,000 per year range) would suffice, though if I could make more of course I’m not going to say no to more money, haha.

This is a little scary, since part of me is afraid I’ll regret throwing away what I have. But I want to have passion for what I do every day, and right now, I really do not.

Thanks for reading!  I appreciate any advice!"

**Me**

I'm a 21yo student from Europe. I study ""Infrastructure Design and Security"", this means that most of my classes were about Linux, ESXi, CCNA, INFOSEC etc. I have my own homelab which I thoroughly enjoy working on, so even in my free time I like this stuff (which is quite common here). I just came back from a 1-year exchange in South Korea country. I realized I really love the country and I want to do my masters there, but before that: I want to find an internship!

**My Problem**

 I always knew I wanted to do something involving my major, but never really what exactly. Linux administrator? System administrator? I was hard for me to pinpoint. I've been reading this subreddit for some time and I realized I should look into AWS because it looks quite awesome, but they never have internship applications for the Netherlands on their site so I kind of gave up. 

Until I today; I found an internship for an Associate Solutions Architect Intern at Amazon in Seoul. It really looks like the most perfect solution for an internship ever. The only problem is: I don't have any AWS certs.

**So what now?**

The job offer says the following: Completion of one career pathway in AWS Educate. So I'm pretty sure they're talking [about one of these](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/). I already did some basic research and the ""Cloud Practitioner"" sounds like the easiest one I could get fast and apply for the job. I want to get one quick since the job offer has been there already for 17 days and I'm scared it'll expire soon. Of course the Solutions architect would be the best, but I'm sure that one will take too long.

**Options I have considered**

1. Get Cloud Practitioner within a couple of days and apply for the job. Since one of the ""basic qualifications"" for the job is ""Completion of one career pathway in AWS Educate"", I need it to apply. After getting the CCP I could say in my resume/interview that I have ambition to get ""Solutions Architect"" ASAP. Only problem is that Cloud Practitioner is mostly for sales and marketing and might not qualify for the position

2. Go study insanely hard for Solutions Architect, but it will at least take 1 month. Pray to god the job offer is still there. 

I would really love some input from you guys. I might oversimplify things and think ignorantly, but I'm just so pumped up after finding that internship opportunity..."

Currently, I have a RedHat internship that will begin on June 1st. I also have received a call from Intel regarding a similar position. Both the salaries are the same. However, I have received an offer from RedHat whereas as I am yet to complete the interview process with Intel. Given that I need to get my CPT approved by June 1st(should take about a week), is waiting for Intel worth the risk? The comparison would be based on full-time pay, conversion rate, work culture.

One assumption is that I am able to clear the Intel interviews and maybe have a joining date of June 8th as opposed to June 1st at Red Hat. Thanks for your insight!"

***Reflection:***   
My biggest weaknesses were: GPA (most who get into T10 schools at my school have \~95/100); ECs (kind of all over the place, no clear narrative, few significant awards); not updating my schools about senior year accomplishments in February/March before decisions (got into a selective summer program, national awards, internship, research); waiting until the last minute to write my essays

Advice: Don't take on more coursework than you can handle and do well in. T10 schools, by and large, don't care if you don't take every single AP or honors class your school offers as long as you challenge yourself and have a reasonably rigorous courseload. Also, don't spend a ton of time worrying about how your college resume looks. Pursue what you love doing without holding yourself back from opportunities for fear of failure. And start writing your essays the summer before senior year. Do \*not\* apply to more than 15 schools if each has supplements -- you will regret it. If your EFC is too high, APPLY FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, starting at least in junior year. You will thank yourself when you don't have to take on massive amounts of student debt or are able to afford your dream school.

This sub was both really helpful and really stressful during my college application process. I hope this post gives y'all some idea of what to expect during senior year, or is helpful in some way. PM me or comment with any questions. Good luck to all the rising seniors!

I have a question for you here.

I just graduated with my degree in Computer Science a couple days ago. I plan on going back to school this Fall to take some more premed classes, and apply to medical school next year. My question is about working this summer.

This summer, I currently plan on working part time doing construction work, as I have done for several years now, and continuing my part time IT internship at my city's hospital. Construction is paying my $20, and the IT internship pays $13 an hour.

My question is, can I apply and accept a computer science job, work there for 3 months until the fall semester, then quit? I am not afraid of being underpayed or working somewhere I am overqualified for (such as doing a helpdesk job), and I don't necessarily need the job to give me a recommendation letter or anything like that, I mostly just want to get a little bit better pay over the summer that is more consistent with my degree. Will taking on and quitting a job like that look bad if I try to apply to other places in the future? Is doing this too much of a dick-move to the company I apply to work for?

I don't mean to sound conceited in saying Im going back to school to continue my pursuit of med school and I don't mean to act like Im too good to do construction. I just feel goofy that I have my degree in Computer Science and am working IT for $13 an hour.

Only for clarifications, I will just say that I am pretty deep into game dev for a college student. My resume has about 7-8 projects, all related to game dev in some way. 2 of them happen to be a 2d and a 3d game engine and the rest are pet game projects and libraries.

I was thinking of doing this for the rest of my life till I heard about why I shouldn't go into game dev. I am sure everyone on this sub knows that game devs are not respected by their companies enough and indeed the pay is less as well. Specifically in my country, game dev is seen as a freelance job, and getting into the AAA scene here has the same downfalls and is hard for fresh grads to get into. And going abroad is unrealistic for me (for now).

**My main point:** I managed to get an internship amidst the lockdown though. It's in a fairly reputed company and the pay is VERY good both for an intern and if I were to get a job here. But it is what you can call to be a ""generic SDE intern"". No graphics, no realtime application dev (not that I know of), basically nothing aligns with my passion.

**And I find it incredibly disheartening for me to accept this situation.**

I feel like I cheated myself into doing all this continuous hard work for the past 4-5 years and it's going down the drain. People tell me the ""all that hard work is not waste"" and that ""skills can carry-over"", I think that is not relevant here because given a choice between a React, Java, MySQL full-stack dev and a guy with a bunch of toys that can do fancy images on the screen; I think most professional hiring managers would root for the former person for the kind of job profile I have now gotten myself into.

So now I need to turn my profile into something like that. I need to put in work to maintain 2 different profiles for 2 reasons:

1. To do my job/intern properly
2. To finally do justice to stuff I learned in college.

Do you maintain two different profiles like this? One for your passion and one for your profession? How do you manage them? Do people ever combine them in the future?"

I graduated in 2016 is a bachelors in Computing science. I took a job right out of school dealing with CRM, because I don't have a lot of financial support and needed a job within 2 months of graduating. The pay was lower than a freshgrad for Canadian developers, but it was job security, I could work off my student loans, and work experience can only help. I interned for 3 jobs, and while they did help, I never had a coding senior to mentor me to write better code, so I just wrote whatever to get the job done and shipped.

Fast forward to today and I really hate my job. I'm mostly consulting and trying to mishmash Microsoft products that should be compatible but only on a good day. I've spent very few time with coding that I feel worse than when I graduated, I'm barely if ever, solving problems or building things, just helping out with clients and sitting in meetings. My salary improved, but its still lower than the average for my Canadian province. I discussed with my employer my issues and while they say they would try to throw more programming my way (1 year later, nothing changed), my salary was in a good place (it wasn't, even after showing him statistical averages for people in my role). It feels like I need to start moving onto something I want to do, but I have a few problems.

1. As the title states, I suck at coding. During my internships, I never had a mentor or code reviewer, they just took my code and said everything works (I was a sole programmer in a bunch of non tech companies like goverment). And this job is hardly different, while my boss is good at coding, he passes the coding problems mostly to other members and I'm stuck with customizing. Whenever I do code, he just comments that I should do better and I have to squeeze it out of him on where I went wrong.
2. I was lazy and complacent by having a job and didn't work on my skills or build any projects of my own. It wouldn't be hard to argue that I'm likely WORSE than when I was in school. I feel like despite having almost 4 years work experience, that I'd likely be shown up by fresh out of school juniors.
3. While I still the get occasional Amazon and Microsoft headhunters...that's all I get anymore. I don't follow the trends as much as I should, but I would guess Covid-19 hit companies hard, so my disadvantages just got worse.

Despite all this I have been working on my web development skills. I took some online courses for web dev, as well as been refreshing myself on data structures and coding interviews. It is hard and slow because I still work 40+ hours a week. And even though I'm doing all of this, I still feel trapped because I'm likely to end up in another scenario where I'm not getting the mentorship to improve my skills in the direction I want. 

To sum up, my question is, what is the path I should be taking? I'm trying to improve but I'm lost on how too spend my free time. Part of my wants to quit my job so I can focus on being a better Software developer with more hours in the day. Is it better to focus on landing a job and work on skills on the side? I'm really lost and directionless so I could some guidance."
gmeomv,81,2020-05-18,How do I get over this “What’s the point?” feeling?,Eldah_Tee,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmeomv/how_do_i_get_over_this_whats_the_point_feeling/,"I attend a poor public high school and our average scores for almost everything are awful. I spoke to my college advisor and she told me that the school’s average SAT is about an 830.  I was happy to hear that I passed it with an 1100 and that I could retake the test to heighten my chances. As someone who has worked through many obstacles, I was going to make my Mechanical Engineering dream come true!

Then I joined Reddit.

Sure, I know that there’s more to applying to colleges than just test scores, but holy crap. The amount of stuff I've missed out on has knocked me off my game completely. I thought Extracurriculars were just school clubs and sports. Engineering internships, blog publishing, and math competitions? Lol, never at my school.

I've read through various posts of people trying to go to the same university I'm interested in (umich) and have LOADS of ECs, a great GPA, and a 1400+ SAT score only for people in the comments to say:

”Aim for at least a 1520!""

“You need to do more ECs!”

“3.8 is too low for that uni! Try to get it up!”

I get it, the school is hard to get accepted to but damn. I am in no way shaming these people who managed to experience all these things and build such an amazing profile. However, I'm now at a point where I'm constantly telling myself when studying for the SAT “What’s the point of applying there? If that high ranking student can’t get in then what makes you think you can? You can't compete.”

I know this isn’t the case because my best friend who attends the same school as me got in. Our SAT scores and grade point averages are very similar. I can’t apply yet since I have to do something called my 5th year which basically gives me another free year at my local community college. I have 40 college credits but I still feel like I have no chance.

How do I overcome this feeling? It’s really hindering my ability to study and I kind of think it’s making me a bit depressed. I am so stressed out."

I had a mindset that finding a job with this degree wouldn’t be difficult in a city like Toronto. 

Fast forward third year - I apply for internships and absolutely blew them all out the water with my lack of skills in coding and theory behind Data structures, etc. Finally complete my undergrad with a mediocre GPA and begin applying to jobs.

I then land a consulting job for a manual QA role at a bank which I got sick of really quickly because of the industry, coworkers and growth of this role. I end up quitting within 3 months and begin setting up a plan to be a web developer.

I then enrol to a bootcamp (which is arguably a bad move) and expected to get a more trending and sustainable role. I graduated around the same time as covid hit. I was on sort of a roll doing interviews - I felt like I was making improvements after each and every one for 3 months of interviewing. 

Then I get a role through referral for a QA role - pretty much on the spot. I was super skeptic but with the current economic situation I thought it’d be smart to just take it and apply for others while I get some sort of income. 
It’s now been almost two months and I absolutely hate the workload and responsibility of my role. It’s around 60 hours a week of just mindless scripting plus various other testing tasks.

My question to anyone who’s reading this is:
1) is Toronto really that competitive or is this normal everywhere? I spent 3 months for each unemployed gap to only land QA roles.
2) when can we expect more companies to start hiring again? It’s been quite dead for junior level roles in this city. 

Thankful for any input."

Hoping this is the right spot to post.

TL;DR - Backend developer for 3 years, I don't enjoy the work I do anymore. What options do I have?

&amp;#x200B;

Details:

I have a computer science degree from a Tier 2 college (India) and have 3 years of work ex (2 years -  Java, 1 year Python + AWS). I feel my work has become monotonous - solve bugs, develop new features (which reuse the same tech/approach). I did not feel this way earlier, but since the lockdown I feel trapped in this never ending circle.

So, folks from the Internet - what do I do? Here's what I've considered

1. Change jobs - so that a new work environment and different product will bring about a change in routine (I will probably get saturated with this too - but I get around 6 months to a year before that happens)
2. Completely change my domain - seek out internships and then full time in something very different like finance, management, HR?
3. Do something else - part time/freelancing ? I feel I am not skilled enough to achieve this at a good enough scale and that fear/feeling makes me step back every time.

If my post seems scrambled, it would perfectly depict my mindset these days. I do not have any idea what I should do :/

Super confused. Please advice. Thanks a million a more in advance !"

For those people, and really, everyone else, a great way to spend summer is to pick up a skill - this isn’t an advertisement or anything, but keep an eye out for colleges that offer some fun free curriculum online. 

For example, I came across this class from Stanford, for those interested in learning iOS development in SwiftUI. I’ll see if I can find anymore, and others should contribute if you come across anything online too!

It's also starting to creep in to other areas of my life and I don't know how to make myself change. 

For background, I've always found it difficult to put a maintained effort in to most things that I do but I feel like its gotten worse the last couple of years. I've historically been fairly academically successful and get by on being naturally bright, I guess, because I don't honestly study and I half-ass or rush through most of my homework at the last minute. I wasn't a straight A student growing up, but i was more than good enough. I tried college right after high school but fell behind because I couldn't stay motivated and ended up dropping out. 

I decided to go back go school around five years ago and I was doing really well at my community college. While i definitely struggled to stay motivated, had some challenging moments, and didn't go above and beyond, I managed to pull through as a straight A student and was really looking forward to transferring to a university. I've been transferred for three quarters and my grades are slipping each quarter and I don't feel like i can keep up. I look at the productive people around me who are juggling classwork, employment, side projects, research and i just don't understand how they do it. Trying to keep my todo's in order just to get my homework done is a lot for me.

Outside of school i don't really have the motivation or will power to engage much. In my personal endeavors I tend to get bored really fast, or loss interest, or just fail to figure out how to complete anything i start. I can't think of anything in my life that I've followed through on. I have plenty of half started projects and partially explored interests but I never seem to be able to actually finish anything.  On one hand I'm a mostly functional adult, like I can hold down a job, feed myself and keep up my house, but on the other accomplishing that bare minimum feels like so much to me. Much like school, I look at family and friends and how much they accomplish and it doesn't even make sense to me.

I wake up every morning and tell myself that todays the day I'm going to turn it around. I'm going to be focused and productive. Then i spend the next 4-5 hours on reddit maybe I eat then I  catching up on youtube and by that point the day  feels gone and I move on to tomorrow. Making it to all of my lectures is a win for me. Doing a little bit of homework is a HUGE win. Anything extra doesn't really happen. Even right now I'm putting shit off. I know I need to be doing school work, responding to some important emails, and looking for internships. Hell I *want* to do those things. But theres this like, huge mental block that i just can't work through to actually put in the work and I don't know what it is. At this point i just feel like I'm broken. I'm at a loss and I just don't know what to do to help myself. I've thought about seeking out help but I'm not sure who can even help me or whats really wrong with me.

Sorry I know that was long but does anyone have any advice?"

Company A: Offered me an internship on the spot but it is a small start up. It is a little related to what I want to do but not directly.

Company B: They are my first choice because their work is more related to what I am interested in, but I am not sure if I got the position. It is a well known international company with branches in HK, Singapore, Taiwan, USA, etc. 

The problem is, Company A is making me decide whether to commit to them or not by tomorrow afternoon however Company B will not get back to me until the end of this week. 

I've reached out to Company B to see if I secured the internship however they just told me they are still ""internally processing my application"" which I am unsure what that means.

I've also already agreed, twice, to get back to Company A by tomorrow so I don't want to rub them the wrong way and ask for an extension.

Should I take my chances and wait for Company B to decide or commit to Company A?

There is so much to learn...every day i sit at the keyboard i leave a more educated person, although i will admit, i'm no instant computer genius like id hoped id be. I am self taught, but have a friend who studied CS and got a nice paying job thru an internship before he graduated.

My friend suggested i try Codewars, to help me with coding questions. From my understanding, Codewars attempts to train you on algorithmic concepts.

SPOILER ALERT: i'm not very good at Codewars...took me 3 months to answer the entry level question (and that is because im so used to console.logging my functions because of my udemy classes, if you get it hehe). Even when i passed the intro test, i can only understand the problem answers by hitting the ""solutions"" tab, and reviewing others answers.

My question is...How important are these algorithmic type problems (and algorithms in general) in relation to someone like myself who is studying the web development field?  I've always been bad at math, however the way my mind thinks while learning programming seems to be slightly different than math class (although painfully similar at the same time)"
gmjiq8,73,2020-05-19,Information Technology Industry in Nepal - An overview and what to do. (Brief),HimanshuJBista,Nepal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/gmjiq8/information_technology_industry_in_nepal_an/,"I am creating this post due to a lot of you requesting me to share my experiences in and around the IT field in Nepal. 

**Here is the current scenario:**

1. There are more than 700 big and small IT companies in Nepal, currently providing products &amp;amp; services - who are working both nationally and globally. 
2. Increasing number of IT colleges and a surge in number of IT graduates looking for a job is too high compared to what companies can currently accommodate.
3. The thing that mostly affects the IT education domain, is the number of students ""settling"" for IT courses (Not applied to Computer Engineering - Will discuss it later in the thread).
4. Decreasing level of competence among the students and seeking internships just for academic qualification (without prior knowledge of programming/database/networking/testing and do not contribute to the company at all).
5. Smaller IT companies, increasing in a large amount cannot afford interns or trainee staffs or even extra developers. They mostly make do with consulting full-stack developers (according to my experience working as a PM/PR) . 
6. Larger IT companies are difficult to get into as their larger aspirations and expectations are too big to be fulfilled by an average IT student. 
7. More and more companies have adapted international techniques for HR management, which have reduced the intake of a larger number of interns/staffs. 
8. The pay is not as attractive as it is shown in most companies and facilities are rare to come by (Even working in a big corporate, I had to spend money from my own pocket for lunch and had to walk a fair distance for it despite the company having a kitchen and kitchen staffs). 

It sounds very demotivating but it is just a small collection of negatives about what is happening. People are still getting internships and jobs along with attractive salaries and facilities. Here is how we can ensure better results as individuals to shine in the IT market.

1. **Developing personality:** We all have to admit that in our country, we do not take interviews seriously. We do not maintain ourselves enough or have the knowledge of general ethics of a professional worker. I have suffered in interviews as well but it was when I started taking interviews that I understood the definition of personality. Keep simple but keep it clean and attractive. Have ethics of eye contact, addressing the officers, ending answer to a question, posture and gratitude towards the company. And please ask question at the last (if you feel confident you have done well) about what expectations can the company fulfill to make you stay. 
2. **Robust conceptual knowledge:** When I first started, I was inexperienced in the field of IT business. When I interviewed for a company in Satungal, I was selected instantly, even when there were far more qualified people than me. After a month of working, I asked what made them select me. The boss said that ""I can shape you because you are like a wet clay. It is easier to shape wet clay than to reshape a pot."" Do not worry because you have no experience. Keep your knowledge healthy. Be ready to unlearn and relearn. And always make sure that your concepts on various technicalities are ready to go. Work hard for it. 
3. **Maintain Versatility:** Jack of all trades is what sells in the market today. That is why full stack developers are well paid and in high demand. Always make sure you specialize the best in one area be it coding/networking/testing/database but always make sure you have knowledge from every aspect of IT. A versatile player will fit in any team and you can also gain wider experience. I used to code Java with no knowledge of other area. That weighed heavily on me during my mid-phase of the career as I was confused with everything that didn't involve the code I was used to. 
4. **Project/product Showcase:** Be proud of what you have created even if it is a simple game of tic-tac-toe. Upload your projects on Git and always make sure you link the Git repo onto your public portfolio. Show people what you are capable of. Demonstrate how good you can code or how good you design a system. 
5. **Purpose of Internship:** Do not seek internships just for the marks. PLEASE BE SERIOUS ABOUT YOUR CAREER. Do your tasks, learn as much as you can and CONTRIBUTE TO THE COMPANY. 
6. **Take a stand:** Stand up for yourself. If promises are not fulfilled by the company hiring you, move away. If your desk is not ready, if you are not treated properly on the first day, the company doesn't deserve you. 
7. **Become curious:**  Ask questions and try to research as much as you can. Make a habit of organizing your time properly.

**How to code in a controlled environment?**

Coding is not for everyone. Some people are in it for fun, some because they have to be. Either ways, here's how you can create a controlled environment for coding. 

1. Install Linux or install VM station for creating a Virtual Machine where you are away from the distractions of your computers (Games, Movies, YouTube....). 
2. Organize where your software are kept. Keep them in a reachable place. Always within a few key strokes for faster working.
3. Utilize external monitors. I do not code very often but when I do (Even for office work) I use two extra screens along with my laptop. I use an Ipad for references, Laptop for coding, and an extra 32'' display for outputs. For office work, I use the 32'' screen for googling and researching, Laptop screen for doing the work and the Ipad as a dock for music, client calls, or watching a reference video on the side. 
4. Document your code. Try to keep track of code functionality (what code performs what actions). This will help you get reference. 
5. For new coders, try to begin by reverse engineering simple projects. Before that choose a language you want to learn. Remember, choose it to achieve why you wanted to become a coder in the first place. Do not become influenced by others. I do Java so obviously I would recommend it or shrug it off because it is hard. Make your own decisions. 
6. Use backups to protect your code in case of a system failure. Never take your KLOCs for granted. (KLOC - Thousands Lines of Code).
7. For collaboration, use slack, trello and other similar software. Use software like Odoo, Jira, Hubspot for pipelining. You can use Sublime, VScode, Netbeans, notepad++ as text editors. 
8. Make sure you have ample knowledge of System Modeling, Architectures (in course) and learn about Agile methodologies. That should be really helpful. 

I quickly compiled these three list. I will keep adding to it. 

    Note: This post comes from my experience and these are all my personal findings. You might agree with or you might not. Please share your experiences too so that it would help aspiring IT professional. 
    
    Note: I will be happy to give free of cost counseling on behalf of my company every morning starting from today. Please PM me and let me know your interest. I will also provide materials and services totally FREE for individuals who want to pursue IT entrepreneurship. 

A request for high school graduates looking to find a course. Do what you love but do not become confused with faculties. Most people have an idea that IT is easy and well paying. Hence it becomes their last resort. But please only study IT if you are into it."

I have two options:
1) Take 1 or 2 summer class this summer. In that case, i will have to find an internship for Fall 2020 or I will have to take classes and graduate by December 2020. 

2) No summer classes. As I need to take only 2 classes per semester and currently 3 left. I am still going to be able to do an internship in Fall 2020 or Spring 2021. 


My issue is I am going to turn 25 and I already took a semester off for a family issue last year. I am not sure how hard it would be to find a full time in January 2021 if I start to look right now. 

In term of work experience:
- Reservist for the Marines in my country (2 years)
- 2 investment banking internships 
- business developper for a start up for 8 months (full time).


Projects (school) 
- WW2 search engine. full stack: python, ElasticSearch, css, html, js). 

- Geographic project (team project, can’t five much details but it’s currently available on the web), i mostly worked with spring boot testing and the user service (OAuth2). 

- Plagiarism detector (team project - full stack). Was working on one of the algorithms (java) 


Projects (personal)
- designed, builded and deployed a job search platform for a start up (they paid me 1500€). This is a full stack project, the back end is pretty big.
- designed, builded and deployed a very basic (with minimal design) website for my uncle’s clothes shop. It’s only front end right now, i added all articles manually (we didn’t want to have a back end). 


Other informations:


- GPA 3.25/4.00
- Leetcode: been practicing daily during the last 3 months (over 50 questions solved)

The field is obviously incredibly competitive and I have talked to dozens of people at dozens of large companies who have all told  me their research teams have reached saturation.

I have also been advised by professors that in order to get a PhD at a top department I would need either some good papers and/or multiple years of relevant experience.

Here are my choices; either continue educating myself on computer vision by dedicating long hours to it. Or focus on developing my engineering skills. Or switch subfield and go into more general datascience (also super saturated) or maybe even SDE.

The problem I have is that I don't think I would enjoy SDE. I hate the idea of writing software that doesn't solve a problem that is interesting. For example with research you are always working on new and exciting topics and learning. I don't know if I can achieve that with SDE or whether my mathematical background would go to waste.

I just don't really know what to do if I don't find a good job. There is 0 guarantee that if I work super hard I will get a CV job. And what happens if I don't? My computer vision knowledge wouldn't really be transferrable... I would be back to square 1.

Well I think that's normal knowing that most people lost their co-op/job due to pandemic. What funny it is that the last day to add a course is May 25 while the last day to drop a course with %100 tuition is June 1. There are obviously some students enrolled into these courses because of the uncertainty of summer co-ops/jobs. Well some co-ops got cancelled some turned into remote but I'm pretty sure there are few students out there who have an offer now but still not dropping the course until the last second.

I've been trying to get into courses and spamming my quest account since my summer internship got cancelled. If I can enrol into 3 courses I will graduate a term earlier. I already talked to advisors and they told me there is nothing they can do about it since there are other students in my situation too. 

Idk maybe it doesn't make sense to put the last day to add classes after the last day to drop classes but this situations sucks peanut butter."
gmldsh,0,2020-05-19,Fresh Out of College Engineer with Lack of Experience. Am I going to be okay?,DubM3ister,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/gmldsh/fresh_out_of_college_engineer_with_lack_of/,"I'm 25, and I just graduated college with a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Engineering. Sort of in the middle of the pandemic here so haven't been able to apply to anything as of yet. 

It's been a week since school ended and I'm starting to get some post graduation anxiety. No homework, no classes, no projects, no work, and no direction. During college I never did any outside research, internships, projects or jobs besides being a tutor teaching the fundamentals at my college. I got into a no pay internship this last semester, but the beginning of quarantine ended that abruptly before anything was really done. 

In the short term, I'm just going to do what I need to do to make sure I have some sort of money flow coming in until quarantine is lifted. However, I'm also looking ahead, trying to get an idea of what to expect, where to apply, etc. I looked up old job listings for Electrical and Computer Engineers in my area and saw majority, if not all, had skill requirements beyond me such as AutoCad, PCB Design, RF Experience, so on and so forth. I've either just touched on any of that in school, or have little to no experience with it whatsoever. The only real experience I've had were with some projects in school, and even then I've sort of forgotten how I did any of those. It leaves me wondering if I'm even good enough to find and land that initial job compared to, say, other applicants. Even if I were to get hired, I have that fear I'll be fired for incompetence and having that follow me wherever I go.

So I guess I want to know from all those ahead of me,   
Has anyone else gone through this?   
Will I be able to find a job with my lack of experience?  
What was it like applying for that first engineering job?   
Have you ever applied for a job that you didn't actually qualify for?  
Do some of these jobs provide the training to do the work necessary or were you expected to know what you were doing the moment they hired you? 

I know I'm going to end up having even more questions once I get answers, but it'll give me a better idea of what I should do from here."

I just finished my master degree and want to look for a job in the area of deep learning/ computer vision.  I already have some hands on experience in this field, via a research internship and my master thesis. For these projects I used python (Keras, PyTorch, a bit Tensorflow). However, industry doesn't seem to care much about python, they want C++!

I am nearly a complete C++ newbie, had a course at the beginning of my bachelor, but this was long ago and I never used it again since then and pretty much forgot everything. Which online course do you recommend me for learning C++ for use in computer vision/ deep learning industry? Is there some C++ stuff, that I should ignore for no, because it doesn't have a high priority for the field I am interested in?

Is there a course that is an especially good match for my needs? Or do you think it doesn't matter, I should just do some online course for getting the basics in C++ and then start learning OpenCV?

Thanks for you help!"

Bank B pays more than Company A by about 15000$.

I’m a new grad so I do not have any experience other than internships. Since this being a 6 month contract, if it doesn’t lead to an extension, I’d have to look for a new job. I am not sure if I would have a hard time after a few months if I move forward with Bank B.

Big Bank B appeals because it being a remote job but a stack (React, Node, Python, Express) I’ve never worked with professionally, just a few projects of mine.

Small Company A has the same stack(Angular, .NET Core(C#)) I’m comfortable with and have experience in. Remote until the situation gets better. Small company A is a drive towards modernization and to kill the legacy.

Both are Full Stack positions. I don’t know at the current point of my career what would be the right decision, a full time role or a contractor position which pays more?"
gmty41,36,2020-05-19,Our company creates and raise creatures - The Sirens and my fucking joke report (Part 1),[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gmty41/our_company_creates_and_raise_creatures_the/,"Wow. Okay, this actually works.

As I mentioned in [my first record](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gm5jgk/our_company_creates_and_raise_creatures_and_i_got/), Smarty's not even considered dangerous in our company even though I think it is. Any creature in here *can* be considered dangerous since us humans cannot control what they do most of the time. It's us caretaker's job to try to control the creatures.

Someone in the last record asked me what we, Smarty, and I did. Well, after *this* event, I reconsidered to accept and understand the creatures in this company to be more of a fatal wild animal than friends, except for Smarty.

To be honest, I thought they should just call a full SWAT force than hire people and expect them to learn how to take care of something that can kill you. A *lot* die in here anyways. It seemed like a waste of time and money to me, but Levol told me later that this was actually way cheaper than calling military force and weapons to babysit monsters that people on the surface know nothing about when I asked her this.

I hated myself for silently agreeing with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Our shelter building, located on... fuck, I forgot where we were exactly. Anyway, the company has a lot of branches and buildings located in other places too, but I happened to work here, NOQ-12 branch building.

NOQ-12 branch is the twelfth branch shelter building of our company, and we specialize in keeping creatures relating to short and partially recorded myths. Whether it's ancient and forgotten, too famous to ignore, or even some crappy internet urban myth, we have it all here. Well, to be specific, not *all*. The longer or powerful ones are made kept somewhere in the Pacific with more security force.

They do make creatures in here, but those jobs are for staff called creators, not caretakers like me. Those creators, I tell you, are *mad*. Mad beyond what I can understand. They're the ones that made Smarty and all other creatures in here and everywhere else. I don't know or have permission on how the living hell they do it, but they do it.

&amp;#x200B;

Like Smarty, each creature needs a unique shelter room. It's supposed to resemble an environment that's close to the creature's habitat and keep them inside there. Smart's one was similar to a small study, but every creature made in the company has different tastes on what and how they want their rooms to be like. Us caretakers try to meet up to their expectations. If a creature requires its caretaker's head, then their need is, unfortunately, more important than our own lives.
&amp;#x200B;

The creatures that I'll write about probably has the third biggest shelter room out of all creatures in this company. And just because it wants to. They still scare me to this day. Their looks, voices, movements that resemble something like a very sick fish, human, and bird at once - It's horrible. Nothing else terrifies me than them for now. The **BM-0333.**

&amp;#x200B;

***Sirens***. *Those fucking Sirens*. No, it's not those small red machines that make alarm sounds, but those singing monsters from Greek mythology. I never knew what horror was until I saw them. It's not that they look creepy or gory, but... there's just, this weird ambiance within them that makes me panic most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

To take in-depth about those hideous creatures, I have to say a few things about Hilton, the caretaker of BM-0333.

&amp;#x200B;
Hilton is a tall, built middle-aged man in his early 40s with blue eyes and wet, brown locks tied back to a short ponytail with black, tinted glass. He has small scars all over his hands, arms, and probably up until elbows too. Always smells like ocean and fishes whenever you're near him, but he doesn't wear perfumes. He has a daughter called Maggie, but I don't know about his wife. Just heard rumors that he's been divorced for some years.

He' the one that takes care of the Sirens. All seven of them since they were created. To say that their bond is strong is an understatement. It's just pure force. I've seen it with my own eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

In our field of work, when something happens to the original caretaker, a substitute has to go in to do other cares if they are not yet done so. Whether it's an emergency call from a family, losing a limb or more, being controlled by supernatural beings, or even death, someone else has to get works done if they can't do it.

And because most of the staff can even barely manage to keep their own creature from going berserk, no one really wants a substitute to work for them. It feels like shit when they die from not knowing what to do, even with all those stacks of documents and manuals are made to properly care for each creature.

&amp;#x200B;

On that day, Hilton had to go to his daughter's elementary school graduation ceremony. For some reason, he totally forgot about it until the day before and needed a substitute. I happened to become a substitute caretaker for him since, well, Smarty doesn't really need a lot of time to care. It's just that I like to hang out and spend time with him, but simple cleaning was all I did as a proper work, so our general manager just made me become the substitute for Hilton.

I think I was supposed to be glad and excited, but I panicked instead. I mean, I know that caretakers are hired to take care of creatures, but just from few days that I stayed in this company with Smarty, I saw some of the most disgusting, cruel things that ever lived. Other creatures that my colleagues had was... full of discomfort. The Sirens had risk level of 3. Suddenly thinking about those death announcements that were made whenever a scream was heard didn't help calm me down either, so I asked Hilton how I can be alive and well tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

""Just chill. They're quite a lot in numbers but not that bad of a company if you follow the rules. My daughter liked them too when she saw them."" Hilton passed me a few documents that were supposed to have all the rules and reports of BM-0333, the Sirens.

""Your what saw them?""

""Maggie, my daughter. She came here a few times before, and the Sirens totally loved her for being adorable. Even though there are rules, they tend to just tease or prank on you now and then. Just don't act as you hate them, and they'd probably like you enough to let you out alive and in one piece.""

I flipped through the thick stack of papers and just stared at the *Caring Rules for BM-0333, The Sirens*. And only the first ten of them. ""I don't know. Don't they usually sing to lure and kill humans to eat them? That's all I know of.""

""Our Sirens don't do that, and get sore throats too if they sing to much, especially Aglaopheme. And no, they don't just sing to prey on humans as known in the myths. Read the documents, feed and play with them for a while, and stay alive as much as you can. I should go.""

And just like that, I had to take care of the Sirens.

&amp;#x200B;

When I entered the room with two buckets full of live fishes, a burst of childish laughter was what welcomed me first. Second, a huge lake that almost resembled the Mediterranean beach environment- olive trees, golden sand shore, hot and wet weather that made me sweat and take my lab coat off proved that I was, indeed, in the Siren's room.

The laughter kept getting louder as seven human-like figures rose from the water, creating small waves that splashed on my barefoot. They were quite different from what I remember from Greek mythology, but that was just because they were created by our company, not by the beliefs. They had a human upper body, the lower limbs each resembling sea creatures or fish, and had wings. Real, flying wings that sprouted from their waist.

I was taken aback by their glorious appearance. It was amazing that these beautiful beings truly existed and I get to see them with my bare eyes. I almost got emotional for just looking at them.

Almost.

&amp;#x200B;

They just splashed a huge wave of water on me and made the fishes jump out of the bucket.
I was, at least, entertaining to them. That was the only relief I had.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**^(Rule #1.)** ^(When meeting the BM-0333, also called the Sirens, try to not wear outerwear, shoes, socks, and wool. All seven entities have different personalities, but they all like to play in water.)

*""Look, it's not Hilton! Who are you? What are you?"" ""Manners, Ligeia! Straight out questioning and playing with our guest is rude. Wait until our guest introduces themselves!"" ""Is she going to feed us? I want a mackerel."" ""You say that, but you don't even like mackerel as much as Molpe.""*

In my first meeting with the Sirens, it was just basically them hoarding up on me, a fucking intern and newcomer, asking questions and talking by themselves nonstop, and me trying to shut up and feed each one equally as I tried to catch the fishes jumping everywhere.

I think they just liked how clumsy I was in my job and took it as something like a stand-up comedy show just for them.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was almost running out of fishes to throw into the lake, a sound of the iron door opening was heard.

""Hilton? You're back? I'm just finishing up the feeding-"" I turned around, trying to calm another excited Siren as they all whipped their heads to the new visitor, but Hilton was not there.

It was a staff that I don't really know, but I recognized him faintly. He was a new intern caretaker like me.  He came into the company on almost the same day as I was accepted.

&amp;#x200B;

""H, Hi. You're R, right? I just wanted to ask a short question about rule number four in this report-""

He was holding Smarty on one hand, and a report paper on the other.

&amp;#x200B;

""Wait, what- What are you doing?"" As I was trying to grasp the situation, the man just rambled on. ""I mean, like, you were busy and I wanted to help? Not as a substitute but, you know, as the same intern. So I tried to take care of your creature.""

""You... what?""

""This typewriter didn't want to get out, and I thought that meant it wanted to get out since it doesn't speak the truth, but it just started spilling this, um... It's not blood, is it? I thought that I should ask you about- Oh god, it's doing this again.""

&amp;#x200B;

If you are planning to work at our company, don't fucking write half-assed rules. Don't joke around. I think I should've grasped this on my first day, but I just didn't know that anyone even cares for Smarty, let alone try to take care of it.

Remember that crappy report that I said Smarty and I wrote? It was supposed to be a pure joke. A sarcasm that Smarty barely got any attention from the company other than me. A sort of joke that only we cared and knew. Half of those rules I didn't follow because it was all fake, but some were based on true facts.

First off, Smarty *does* hate getting oil on it. *""The greases are horrible. I'd prefer thick dust than a single drop of oil to get on me,""*  it said. Smarty also hated any form of water pool or too much moisture. Exposure to moistures and water make it uncomfortable and rusty. He hates getting liquids on its body the most. I had to apologize and clean all the red inks off coffee table literally *flowing* on it after Smarty threw a tantrum for spilling coffee on its paper.

&amp;#x200B;

And that stupid staff took Smarty inside of the Sirens' shelter room, which had a huge chunk of water area that resembled a rocky lake, and atmosphere of stuffy Mediterranean climate.

Smarty was furiously moving its keyboards on the paper until it was soaked in the ink. The red ink first dripped, then flowed, and soon tried to flood everything. That meant it was angry, wanted to go back to its shelter room, and stay in peace. Smarty's keyboards make disturbing clacking noises loudly. It was *totally* pissed.

Then, I remembered one of the rules written in the report.

&amp;#x200B;
&gt;**^(Rule #8.)** ^(The Sirens all hate one thing in common. They don't like any white noises, fast-pitched sounds, and bothering noises. This includes screaming, rattling, making constant clicking sounds, or even trying to outsing them. Try to not make any loud or harmful sounds in the Siren's room.)

&amp;#x200B;
Risk level of 3 meant that the creature could harm you physically and probably lead you to fatal organ failures if they want to. The Sirens, all seven of them, started to lowly growl. Their voice was nothing like I heard in my lifetime or a few seconds before. There was no playful laughter anymore but only creepy, eerie, ice voices that gave goosebumps on all bones, muscles, and organs of your body.

It was very similar to the feeling of having a brain freeze all over your body but far worse. You just can't move every single muscle in your body. It felt like I was frozen to death alive just by that sound.

&amp;#x200B;

I couldn't move. I couldn't speak. That other stupid staff couldn't do so too, but Smarty was still making that clacking sound of keyboards. I didn't even understand what was going on as the Sirens crawled up to the surface and slowly walked towards me and that staff. They still kept growling-


No, *singing*. Yes. They were all singing at once. Singing a low, eerie and alien song that made me barely standing and hard from keeping my mind clear as I heard it unwillingly. I could feel red, cool inks pooling near my toes. I wanted to close my eyes and ears, I wanted to run away. I wanted to scream.

I didn't realize that I was doing exactly. Nothing made sense and my body just moved without me having any control of it. I covered my eyes and ears. I spun my feet and tried to run away from the Sirens. I screamed, I screamed and didn't even know I was doing so. I was too frightened, too afraid. That cold, freezing feeling and sensation felt too close to what I imagined death to be like.

 I was so scared that I forgot about following Rule #8 for Sirens at time.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, what would you expect?

&amp;#x200B;
Everything lost their shit at once."

I've worked front desk in an office on my campus so I have experience working with people and answering phones. Right now I work as a social media aide (posting content, fixing up a templated website, photographing events) which I enjoy but am starting to feel lost because I realize I don't have any direct internships in what I eventually want to do.

I've seen helpdesk is the normal suggestion here but being that I am going for a degree are there other jobs I could look into while searching. I am still up for a helpdesk job but I just want to know my options. I also have an interest in Data Science and analytics so would looking for a job in this field help reach my security goals?

Also if anyone can tell me about some topics/free courses to look into so I could beef up a resume as well since this summer I plan to do some self-learning. Possibly in Kali Linux, networking, or whatever you think is best. I don't know if I'm behind or is it still too early in my career to stress this too much.

[Business Field]",wtawtathrowaway,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gmvd5a/is_there_a_way_to_leverage_my_academic/,"I graduated college a year ago with a 3.9 GPA.  I won multiple national scholastic awards in my field.  I was probably average to below average in my networking &amp; work experience.   I was a VP for my major's student org.  I accepted a job well below my career job at my target company, thinking I could use it as an internship-like experience work my way up.  Almost 18 months into the job, I've gotten nowhere.  In fact, I'd say I'm viewed as middle of the road on my team. Furthermore, my company hired a former classmate, who was less academically qualified, to my dream job without even opening it up for application (they had interned there).  However, I've added to my resume with a respected industry certification, and I'm going for an even bigger one (arrival date: Feb 2021).  

 I'm making about 25k / year less than what someone with similar credentials to me is making.  I'm working a job that hires people without any degree at all, while I have a degree in the industry + a certification (not that I think any less of my co-workers, I like them all, and it's the only thing keeping me sane.  I just wanted to give a reference point to where I'm at).  Hell, almost everyone who graduated from the same program as me is making at least 15k more than me annually, and working in the type of job I want (even those who got bad grades, didn't have an internship, &amp; weren't super involved).  Even a senior employee at my company told me they think I should easily be able to get the job I want with my resume (they had seen it while reviewing it for a scholarship while I was still in college).  They had offered to help me get exposure within the company, but I missed a meeting they invited me to because a certification exam I was taking ran overtime, and I lacked the requisite social skills to salvage the connection after that.  I feel everyday like I'm one key person within my company seeing my resume away from reaching my goals.

Worse part of this is that my self esteem has taken a huge hit.  In college, I prided myself on being the man with a career plan, and being successful at my studies.  Now as an adult, I feel like I'm struggling to just get by.  I don't enjoy my job anymore, and I struggle just to get the work done.  I'm struggling to get energized to study for certification exams I know I'm smart enough to pass.  I want to start to recapture my potential.  Problem is, I'm going for kinda a niche role, and I feel like I've applied for every company in my city that has openings for the position, and not even gotten a phone interview at a single one.   I feel kinda stuck.

I really want to recapture my potential, but I'm feeling super discouraged and I don't know where to go from here.  But lately I've been energized to improve myself again, and I want to ride that wave to a new job. Any advice?"

Just wondering if someone could give me advice on becoming a software engineer. I’m a petroleum engineer by degree, but I really hate this industry. I got pushed into the oil industry by my family and I’ve tried really hard to like it and stay in it, but I’m burnt out and I need out. 

I’m really interested in learning coding languages and I’m in the process of teaching myself python too. I think being a software engineer would be cool, but I don’t know what all I need to land an entry level job, well at this point an internship I suppose. Also if someone could maybe give me some insight into different aspects of software engineering that would be great.

I’d prefer not to go back to school, as I would have to take out loans and it would be a huge financial burden. I also just think college is an overhyped waste of money (for pe’s it is). I will most likely be laid off soon in this downturn so it’d be an even larger financial burden without a job.

Also, maybe some female software engineers can give me some insight into how it is being a female in the industry. The oil industry is definitely a “good ole boy” industry which makes it very difficult for women to advance in technical roles (they mainly switch to sales, admin, hr, etc.) and I’d prefer to stay in technical roles.

I did several interviews (\~10). They all said that they had no doubt that I was able to do the job and that I would be competent, but that they were looking for a ""different type of people"".

I was finally able to get an internship that turned into a real job. 2-3 years later, in a x-mas party, my boss which is not the boss of the company told me that at first they didn't really want to hire me but they really needed someone and i was the only one who has applied.

She told me that hiring me was the best decision they made and if for what ever reason i would leave the company, she would leave too.

I will probably not work there forever but i'm scared of the day i will need to find a new job."

I originally was going for a AA in IT but I thought that getting a AS and then going to work quicker would be better for me to gain experience in the working field. I only have a little bit of experience but its not a full IT place really, during my schooling I took a internship job it was a repair place that did computers, phones, consoles, any type of electronics, that's the only experience I have in a job.

I want to get my certification a CompTia A+ but will have to save up the money to do so I do have a study guide I bought a while ago from somewhere but if you guys have any recommendations like YouTube videos or free websites, idk anything I'm down to check those out. I want to be prepared.

But any other tips someone may have to give me? I know right now is a interesting time for everything cause of covid but anything is appreciated. I don't know what to do really, go back to school and get a Bachelors or something"
gmwj7y,6,2020-05-19,Should I start applying now,Creative_Angela,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gmwj7y/should_i_start_applying_now/,"Currently I am on my last semester and will have a completed Btech degree end of July. I can work July but not before. Also my husband is in the military and he has orders to move at the end of this year. The orders are for Germany but obviously covid-19 might change that last minute so I am think why not get a job from July to December. Will it be bad to also not tell an employer I am moving and after the remote work is over quieting. I am in Network Security ( Junior Cyber Security Analyst ) and have an unpaid internship that became unpaid because of covid-19 and I am there basically to watch and they let me join workshops but I am no longer an official intern. I stick around for experience on trouble shooting. They are well aware I am looking for a paid position else where though.

gmwudj,6,2020-05-19,Google Intern conversion interview?,ConversionIntyGoogle,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/gmwudj/google_intern_conversion_interview/,"Anyone have any experience with Google Intern Conversion interviews? How tough and how much are they weighed against intern feedback? I had strong internship, submitted 80 pull requests, 1 mega design doc, 1 major design doc, 1 doc for experiment rollout and 1 small doc for a temporary solution to a problem.

In addition, I finished my project around 60% of the internship and spent 40% on a new project with completely technologies.

Now that being said, I am super worried about conversion interviews. I haven’t gotten the luckiest in interviews and ironically I feel I got in the internship with luck, how worried should I be going forward?"

Ideally it would be great to get some experience as a research assistant/technician, even if it isn't bioinformatics based, but there is limited availability for such roles and I assume they would be highly competitive.

I've seen some graduate data analysis schemes looking for people experienced in Python, R, linear models, machine learning and statistics. I've also seen some data science and ML based internships looking for similar candidates.

Obviously I won't be a maths, data science or computer science graduate, but since I am proficient in everything listed, is it possible I could have a chance in securing these jobs/internships? 
 
Does anyone from a bioinformatics background has experience in applying for these kind of roles?"

I wrote back asking if I could pick up a desktop from their (currently closed, but will be allowed to reopen soon) office because my laptop isn't particularly reliable. 

Is this a normal thing? Is it weird for me to expect them to provide me with a computer to work on? It's especially strange because all the companies I've worked for have been very strict about not using personal devices for work for security reasons. 

If they say I have no choice but to use my personal laptop, I'm kind of worried. During the virtual semester it had trouble with zoom calls and running multiple programs at a time. Thoughts?"
gmxkzu,1,2020-05-19,Extending PhD a year without funding?,prehysteric,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/gmxkzu/extending_phd_a_year_without_funding/,"Hello all! I am currently a 4th year in a clinical psychology doctoral program. I am supposed to collect data and write up my dissertation next year while also applying for post-doctoral internship (a full time year-long placement somewhere else in the country and a requirement for completing my degree) which would begin in Fall of 2021. 

COVID has kind of wrecked up university finances, as I am sure most of you are experiencing on your own. 

I have emailed my primary advisor to see what he thinks about extending my time a year in order to push out more publications, potentially be able to collect in person data for my dissertation or at least for another study (COVID turned my in person psychophysiology proposal into an online only study), take a stats class that I need and is not offered (otherwise will take a throwaway class to meet requirements), and give me more time to be in my current location as a bunch of different personal issues would make moving next summer rather difficult (i.e. selling house, moving several elderly animals, some family stuff). 

He said he believes sticking around another year would be good for me in terms of my career goals (continuing to do research, teaching, some clinical work, preferably in a university setting but not necessarily shooting for R1 at this point). However, he does not believe that TA funding will be available for a 6th year. 

My questions are... Should I try and figure out a way to push through and go on internship in Fall 2021? Should I take out student loans to supplement a 6th year? Should I work to make up the money (it looks like I would need at least 20 hours a week at $20 an hour to make what I do now)? Should I... I don't know, apply for grants and fellowships like a wild person and see what sticks? Other thoughts?"

gmxxra,938,2020-05-19,"Admissions Journey Timeline -- Looking at you, Rising Juniors and Rising Seniors (Updated Spring 2020)",admissionsmom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmxxra/admissions_journey_timeline_looking_at_you_rising/,"This is basically an abbreviated version of pretty much everything I say throughout the year; hopefully, it's organized in a way you can find useful.

Junior year is where your college admissions journey starts for real. You now have quite a few items to tick off your to-do list, but don't freak out if you're already a spring semester junior — or even a rising senior -- (or even a fall semester senior for that matter if you’re reading this much later). **You have plenty of time** to get all this done.

Please note that my views about this might be different than the advice you hear from other sources or even other students, counselors, or consultants. My philosophy is that it’s good to hear different thoughts and ideas, and then you can make decisions about what works best for you.

Here’s how I suggest you tackle this list. If you are new to admissions, no matter where you are in high school, start reading here from the beginning. Don’t panic if you haven’t done any of the stuff on the list. Most kids haven’t. I’m just providing a timeline for “an ideal world” situation. 

# Rising Junior Summer (Summer before Junior Year)

**ENJOY YOUR SUMMER:** This is super important. You need to take time to recharge your batteries. That’s part of being involved with yourself. Be sure to take some time completely off from school and college admissions stuff.

**ACTIVITIES:** I love what MIT Admissions Says: ""Some students feel so much pressure to get into the “right” college that they want to make sure they do everything right—down to their extracurricular activities. Fortunately, the only right answer is to do what’s right for you—not what you think is right for us.

Choose your activities because they delight, intrigue, and challenge you, not because you think they’ll look impressive on your application. Go out of your way to find projects, activities, and experiences that stimulate your creativity and leadership, that connect you with peers and adults who bring out your best, and that please you so much that you don’t mind the work involved. Some students find room for many activities; others prefer to concentrate on just a few. Either way, the test for any extracurricular should be whether it makes you happy—whether it feels right for you.

College is not a costume party; you’re not supposed to come dressed as someone else. College is an intense, irreplaceable four-year opportunity to become more yourself than you’ve ever been. What you need to show us is that you’re ready to try.”

**GET INVOLVED WITH STUFF**

* Yourself (Exercise healthy habits, engage in personal hobbies and projects, READ real books, get a job, learn something new that’s good for your brains like guitar or Italian, practice mindfulness and meditation).
* Your family (Help with sibs or grandparents, grocery shopping, clean up around the house, or take care of dinner one night a week).
* Your community (Community service can be totally individual projects and/or organized group projects. Volunteer to play your instrument or play games at a retirement home, coach a kids’ team, make sandwiches at a food bank, or make comfort bags and drop off healthy snacks and water to the homeless).

**GET A SUMMER JOB:** Just an old-fashioned summer job. This will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.

***COVID 19 UPDATE:*** [***Some ideas for what to do during C19***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQ4NSiaLI1dwXMYhF_6gyOMZKftnN_e4/view?usp=sharing)

**TESTING**

* **PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE PSAT:** You take it in October, and it helps you qualify for National Merit if you score high enough.
* **PRACTICE AND PREP FOR THE ACT and SAT:** Take a couple of practice tests and see which one feels better to you and which one you score higher on. Then move forward with that one. Consider taking one in December of the junior year. Definitely take one in the early part of the spring semester. It’s nice to have testing completed before you start senior year.
* **TAKE SAT SUBJECT TESTS:** Especially if you are considering applying to highly selective schools. Take one or two in June or August that fit with classes you’ve just studied.
* ***COVID 19 UPDATE: Even though many colleges are moving to Test Optional for the next year or two, I encourage you to continue to prep for and take the tests if you can. If you can’t, then take it off the list.***

**START YOUR RESUME:** If you haven’t already, make a list of all the activities you’ve been involved in since freshman year. [Here’s a spreadsheet to keep your activities organized. ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pgkOnQboEOy4Yu2Yylvjau4UdZP6ztiREvwhfYwVMVE/edit?usp=sharing)Keep in mind that basically anything you do outside of class time, homework, and test prep counts as an EC, so that includes old-fashioned summer or part-time jobs, home and family responsibilities, elderly and child care, personal projects and hobbies, and independent research, in addition to more traditional research, internships, and in-or-out-of-school clubs and sports.  For your resume, create the following categories: Education, Extracurriculars, Work Experience, Community Service, Interests and Hobbies, Awards, Honors. 

**EXPLORE THE WORLD OF ADMISSIONS:** Read some college admissions websites and blogs. Some of my favorites are Georgia Tech, MIT, Tulane, Harvard, UVA, Swarthmore, Vandy, William and Mary, and Tufts. They are open about the realities and anxieties of college admissions. 

[**RaiseMe**](https://www.raise.me/) \-- Check out this website. You list all the stuff you're doing and grades you're making and their over 300 partner colleges will give you micro-scholarships if you attend their school. It's free for you and seems like a great way also to let colleges know you're interested and to keep up with your activities and grades too. 

# Junior Fall

Pretty much all of the summer stuff applies still.

**TAKE THE HARDEST COURSE LOAD YOU CAN:** Colleges say that your course rigor counts for more than your GPA and test scores. Remember they evaluate you in the context of your school. So don’t worry about classes that aren’t offered. I recommend that you take four years of:

* Science (including Biology, Chemistry, and Physics)
* Foreign Language (many highly selective colleges like to see four years of a foreign language ***during high school.*** I know you don’t want to. It’s also good for your brain)
* English
* Math (ending in calculus if it’s offered -- or higher)
* Social Science (History, Gov, etc)

Check out the course requirements or suggestions on the webpages of some colleges that might interest you.

**GET TO KNOW YOUR TEACHERS:** Visit them at office hours. You will be asking them for teacher recommendations later. Speak up in class. Ask for help when you need it.

**KEEP UP YOUR GRADES:** I know you know this is the most important year for you as far as grades go. That said, an A- or B in a class isn’t going to kill your chances of going to college. In fact, there are hundreds of truly amazing colleges that are looking for B students. Just keep doing your work. Go to tutorials if you need tutorials. Meet with your teachers after class. Ask the smartest person in the class to tutor you if you need help. Watch Khan Academy and other Youtube videos if you’re struggling. Don’t wait and get far behind. Be proactive and start trying to bring up those grades now

**READ READ READ:** Reading will improve your test scores and your essay writing. Read real books, magazines, newspapers, and more real books. Read books that are required for school and books just for fun. I can suggest lots — just ask.

**KEEP PREPPING AND PRACTICING FOR THE ACT AND SAT:** Start your testing in the late fall or early spring of Junior Year.

**STAY INVOLVED:** Keep up with everything I listed for summer (involved with yourself, your family, your community). Also, get involved with your school. Join a club or two that interests you. Create a club if you don’t see one that interests you. Or simply do individual activities that add to your school environment. Sit with someone new at lunch once a week. Make an effort to say hello to two new people a week. Find a need and fill it. Or, as [this Georgia Tech blog says, ](http://pwp.gatech.edu/admission-blog/2019/04/12/which-activities-will-make-me-competitive/)find what makes you happy, and do it.

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** See what they have to advise and how the process works at your school. Every school is slightly different.

# Junior Spring

**BINGO:** Here’s a link to my [Junior Spring/Rising Senior Checklist Bingo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h6au-TtrrKlmi0ibEP8sK2v5x8NsnzCK/view?usp=sharing). See if you can mark all the squares by the end of the summer :)

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Ask two or three teachers who know you best to write your letters. I encourage you to ask junior year teachers who teach you in core academic subjects. I prefer one from a STEM subject and one from a humanities subject, but some colleges have certain expectations, so be sure to read college admissions websites about what they are looking for. Ask your teacher in person (if possible in a non-global pandemic year) or by email and then follow up either in person or by email. Be sure to include a basic info cheat sheet about you for them and a resume. Now’s the time to start thinking about which teachers you should approach for LORs.

LOR Cheat Sheet has your resume with your most important activities, awards, and honors on it, and then it also has your answers to the following questions:

* What was your favorite part of the class?
* What was your most memorable activity or project
* What part of the class did you find most difficult?
* What did you learn that you will carry with you after class and why?
* Be sure to write a thank you note to the teachers who say yes.
* You can find more info and links [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IpbWyBU2uXdHyXvxz1G_3d3L6tdnK_nR/view?usp=sharing)

**COLLEGE VISITS:** Start visiting colleges if you can. Look around in your city or town. Visit large schools and small schools. It doesn’t matter if it’s a college you think you might consider or not. Just go to start thinking about what feels right to you. Hang out on campus. Then, if you can go on college visits to schools you might find interesting, do so.

* Be sure at this point to sign in and go on the tour and info session, but also wander around.
* Sit on a bench and eavesdrop on conversations. Do you like what you hear?
* Talk to students. Ask them what they’d like to change about their school. Or what they do on a Wednesday night. Don’t be shy. They remember what it was like to be a prospective student and, even if they are annoyed by your questions, who cares? They don’t know you and won’t remember you. Move on and find a kinder person.
* Check out the dining hall and the gym.
* Look for the area near campus where kids hang out if there is one. Lots of kids try to go on spring break trips to visit colleges if it’s affordable.
* If you can’t afford to visit out of your area, at the very least check out the colleges near you to get a feel for the kind of vibe that works for you.

***COVID 19 UPDATE:*** *While we are practicing social distancing, colleges might not be open to your being on campus. Most colleges have really upped their game when it comes to virtual tours, online info sessions, and their social media presence, so be sure to check out all the ways they are bringing their college to you on their websites. I have tried to compile all the virtual tours I’ve discovered and other important info  -- with links to colleges’ admissions pages and maps on*[ *CollegeVizzy.*](https://www.collegevizzy.com/)  *You can also find some checklist items of ways to approach your virtual tours and keep up with your thoughts about what you find while virtual visiting there. You can find more info and links* [*here*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hVa-lHsexAJ80piOvz-8MFho4VFLCYSx/view?usp=sharing)*.*

**COLLEGE LIST:** Now’s the time to start coming up with your preliminary lists. If you can visit colleges, that’s the best way to learn about them, but also you can also learn a lot on the internet, social media, and by reading books.

* Reddit: A2C, colleges’ subreddits, and reverse chance mes.
* Colleges’ websites. Sign up to receive info and get on their mailing lists.
* Common Data Set. Google “college name” and “common data set”
* Colleges’ social media accounts. They are putting tons of info out there on Instagram, twitter, facebook, and snapchat. Clean up your account and use your real name and then you get brownie points for interest with those who consider demonstrated interest -- and it’s also super helpful to know more as you write your Why College essays!
* Virtual tours like [CampusReel](https://www.campusreel.org/), [YouVisit](https://www.youvisit.com/), [YOUniversityTV,](https://www.youniversitytv.com/) and more. You can find these tours and more linked on [College Vizzy](https://www.collegevizzy.com/) for over 500 colleges.
* Colleges’ newspapers and news feeds
* [Niche.com](https://feeds.niche.com/)
* “Colleges that Change Lives” by Loren Pope (book and [ctcl website](https://ctcl.org/))
* “College Match” by Steve Antonoff
* “The Best 300 Something Colleges” by Princeton Review
* “The FISKE Guide” by Edward Fiske
* “Insider’s Guide to Colleges” by Yale Daily News Staff
* “Where You Go is not Who You’ll Be” by Frank Bruni
* PSA for LGBTQ+ kids: be sure to check out [Campus Pride Index](http://www.campusprideindex.org/) for updated info about LGBTQ+ friendly campuses.

**SOMETHING TO CONSIDER: Your SureFire Safety School** \-- Make sure you have at least one Sure-Fire Safety School and a selection of other colleges with a variety of levels of selectivity. A sure-fire safety school is a school where your stats, scores, and grades qualify you for automatic or direct admissions AND you would like to go there, AND they are a financial safety. Any school that does holistic admissions is not a sure-fire safety until you have already been admitted. I like to see kids apply to a few schools with rolling admissions early on, so they can have that safety out of the way. You must LOVE your safety. Research it and imagine yourself there.

**COLLEGE FIT:** Start thinking about what you want in a college and compile a big old list. Having a ton of schools on this initial list is ok. As you explore yourself and the colleges more as you go through the admissions journey, you will naturally begin to filter some of the schools out. This includes thinking about and potentially creating a spreadsheet for:

* *Financial Needs:* Will you need full financial aid? Will you qualify for any aid? Do you need full merit aid? These are crucial considerations. You and your parents need to spend some time thinking about this and going through net price calculators on various college websites. If you can’t afford the price of a school, it’s not a good fit.
* *Geography:* What areas of the country appeal to you? Open your mind here, too. I can’t tell you how many kids say no to the Deep South or Midwest without really thinking about it, and in doing so, deprive themselves of some excellent options and merit aid. Also, do you want urban? Do you want rural? Do you want an enclosed campus or one that’s incorporated into the cityscape? Do you want beaches? Mountains? Corn fields? Do you want to get out of your comfort zone here or stay with the familiar?
* *Weather:* Also important. If you really, really hate the cold, then moving to Boston or Chicago or Maine might not appeal to you. If you have to have four seasons, then the Midwest or the northeast might have good options.
* *School Culture and Vibe:* Are you looking for that stereotypical American big college experience with the big game on the weekends? Or are you looking for the quirky school? Or something that has it all?
* *School Size:* Do you want a big ole state school with loads of options? Or are you looking for something smaller or even mid-sized? Do you want discussion-based classes where you can develop strong relationships with your professors or are do you want to be in big lectures where you can take notes or go to sleep?
* *Potential Major:* If you don’t have one, don’t worry. You have plenty of time to figure that out, and it actually frees you up a bit. If you do think you know, research some schools that might be strong in your major. Maybe touch base with a professor or two.
* *Your Stats:* Where do your grades and test scores fit in? Are they right there in the middle? I like my students to be well above the 50% for most of the colleges they are applying to. This requires putting a lot of thought into what you want out of your experience and about who you are and who you want to be. It doesn’t require pulling out U.S. News \&amp;amp; World Report and listing the top twenty schools.

**ADMISSIONSMOM'S COLLEGE BOOK CLUB:** (I don’t actually have a book club, but I wish I did. These are just a list of books you should read.) Here are a few of the books I recommend: *The Fiske Guide*, *Colleges that Change Lives*, and *Where You Go Is Not Who You’ll Be*, [*Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1COB0wFzXc96yjzyvX8BfR3ViKZ-sj0yg/view?usp=sharing) \- (this is  link to the pdf for free, but you can also buy it at your fave booksellers). See my list later in this post for a full list.

**COLLEGE RESEARCH SPREADSHEET:** Include info like test score averages, requirements, distance from home, school size, programs that might interest you, climate, and anything else you feel might be important. [Here’s the one I use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMpILydhBJ53BdF8FIyh_luRzFaVFtsT0awEP_QUSY4/edit?usp=sharing) (Be sure to change the title with your name so it doesn’t get mixed up with others who use it.)

**NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE OR TIME:** Make a No College-Talk Zone or Time in your house. In my house, our kitchen table was a NO COLLEGE-TALK ZONE. That’s hard to do when you’ve got a mom who’s pretty obsessed with college admissions, but we worked at it. For other families I know, it might be all day on Sundays. This will help you and your parents keep your sanity during the next year. Otherwise, your house and family will be consumed with talking about college admissions from dawn to dusk in every room in your home for the next year. That’s not healthy for any of you.

**NET PRICE CALCULATORS:** Sit down with your parents and do the net price calculators for a few colleges on your list. Begin those tough financial conversations. Be sure to use the one provided on the college page itself. You can usually find it pretty easily by googling: “College Name Net Price Calculator).

**NEW COLLEGE EMAIL ADDRESS:** Make a new college-only email address to use for college applications and communications. Make it appropriate! I recommend this because then all your info from colleges won’t get mixed up in your other emails. I encourage you to allow your parents to have access to it if you feel comfortable with it. Be sure to check your junk, trash, and spam inboxes, so you don't miss important info!

**CHECK IN WITH YOUR HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR:** They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**COLLEGE INFO SESSIONS:** If a college comes to your town or close to your town or school, go listen. Make sure you sign up and sign in.

**COLLEGE FAIRS:** Go to them! Talk. Ask questions. Learn.

***COVID 19 UPDATE:*** *Go to virtual tours, info sessions, and college fairs.* [***Be sure you’ve signed up for “more info” on the college’s websites with your new college email address,*** ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)***so they’ll send you updated info about what they are creating and putting out there.***

**WRITE:** I know you hear so much about the Terrifying College Essay…. But guess what? It’s not! Even the timidest of writers begin to like writing the college essay and experiencing the soul searching. My advice is a little different than most college essay coaches and counselors in that I don’t think you should start working on your essays too early. I DO think you should practice writing. Here are my tips for getting ready to write killer college essays.

* Write Every Day. Even if it’s just a sentence or two.
* Read and listen to essays on [This I Believe](http://www.thisibelieve.org/). These aren’t college essays, but there are hundreds of amazing personal essays about all sorts of subjects. I like that they aren't college essays.
* Check out [College Essay Guy](http://www.collegeessayguy.com/). His website is brimming with tips, hints, and suggestions about writing college essays.
* Practice just writing in your voice--like you’re writing to us here on reddit. Admissions counselors want to get to know you in your essays, not be impressed by you. 
* Try to avoid reading college essays or “essays that got in.” There is no set formula or way to write these essays, and often when you read those, you can get trapped in the “this is what a personal essay should look like” mindset. It’s not pretty, and it causes great amounts of stress and, quite frankly, a lot of repetitive, boring essays for the reader. I will be writing a lot more about what I feel like you need to do for strong personal essays and supplements. I’ll be happy to share my essay resources with you.

**READ BOOKS:** Seriously, reading is the best way to write well, write deeply, have good interviews, and be prepared to do your standardized testing. You should make yourself read every night or day. Even for just five minutes. Reading good fiction and also self-help books will help you learn to discover your voice. Here’s a list of fantastic books to read. Some are just for fun, and others help with stress, but all of these writers have a strong voice in their writing, and you feel the person on the other side of the page. That’s an important skill to think about as you prepare to write your personal essays.

* *The Mindful Twenty Something* by Holly Rogers
* *10% Happier* by Dan Harris
* *Meditation for Fidgety Skeptic*s by Dan Harris and Jeff Warren
* *The Happiness Equation* by Neil Pasricha
* *You are a Badass* by Jenn Sincero
* T*he Year of Yes* by Shonda Rhimes
* *Brave Enough, Wild,* and *Tiny Beautiful Things* \-- all by Cheryl Strayed
* *F\*ck That - An Honest Meditation* by Jason Headley
* *Catcher in the Rye* by JD Salinger
* Anything by Vonnegut, Faulkner, Steinbeck, or Hemingway
* *Me and Earl and the Dying Girl* by Jesse Andrews ( I like his voice.)

**TAME THE ADMISSIONS STRESS MONSTER:** Dealing with your stress as you go through this next year is key. There will be times you feel overwhelmed, frustrated, angry, and sad. So, how do you deal with it? What do you do -- besides post and comment on a2c??? :))

* Be involved. And be involved for you and what you want and like to do, not just to create a list for your apps. The kids who are the most disappointed and stressed out are the ones who feel like they’ve sacrificed their lives for their college apps.
* Practice gratitude 🙏. Make a daily list of 3 things you're thankful for. Even during all your stress, what is good? Are you happy for air conditioning or heating? Are you grateful for ice cream? Or for that amazing teacher who sparked something in you. There’s nothing too small here.
* Be like Elsa and Let. It. Go. If Disney Cartoons aren’t your style, maybe this story about monkeys and coconuts will resonate. Hunters attach a coconut to a tree, cut a hole in it, and place a banana inside. A monkey comes along and puts his hand through the hole and grabs the banana. The unfortunate thing is the hole is too small for his fist to get back through, so he is stuck sitting by that tree holding on to the banana. To be free, all he has to do is let go of the damn banana.
* LEAN IN. Lean into your fear, frustration, anxiety, and stress. Right now this is what it is, so tell it to come on in. Sometimes, just saying that makes it ok. It’s ok to be stressed and worried. It’s normal. Don’t try to run away or suppress it. Instead, face it and embrace it. If something is making you afraid, that can often be an indicator that you’re doing the right thing! I know this drives some of you up the wall bat-shit crazy when we say it, but remember this experience is so much about the journey and not the outcome. And you will learn more about yourself from any perceived “failures” or disappointments than acceptances to a particular school. 
* Mindful Meditation. Take three minutes every day and focus on your breathing. That’s all — no need to clear your brain. Just focus on your breath. Be mindful of what’s happening to you. Is your mind wandering? Cool! That means you’ve been successful with your mindful meditation because you discovered that your mind had wandered away from focusing on your breathing.  This is such a simple practice, and so many people get caught up in the “I could never clear my brain. Or I can’t relax” part, but that’s not what it’s about. You don’t have to clear your brain or relax. There are no rules. Just focus on your breathing for three minutes. It’s that simple.
* Equanimity and Stillness. This is my favorite stillness meditation. Sit quietly, take some breaths and say to yourself: *I am who I am, This is what it is, May I accept things as they are, May I trust in the unfolding.*
* Move. Exercise. Go outside. Get Fresh Air. Eat Healthy Food

**OTHER…** If you are a low-income applicant, I want you to be aware of and explore these amazing programs and possible options, if you’re not already:

* Questbridge Program:[ https://www.questbridge.org/](https://www.questbridge.org/)
* Jack Kent Cooke Foundation Scholarship Program:[ http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/](http://www.jkcf.org/scholarship-programs/)
* The Posse Foundation:[ https://www.possefoundation.org/](https://www.possefoundation.org/)

Juniors, you are in for the journey of your lives. By this time next year, you will know far more about yourself than you ever thought possible. Keep in mind that failure, disappointment, frustration, and feelings of being overwhelmed are all part of this journey -- just as much or maybe even more so as the excitement, anticipation, and dreaming. Every stumble, and bump in the road will make you stronger.

I'm looking forward to watching your transformations! This is a prime opportunity for you to take advantage of digging in and getting to know who you are. 

# Rising Senior Summer

(Please be sure to read the suggestions for Rising Junior Summer.) This is an important summer for you, but there is no magical formula of what you need to or have to do to get into any colleges-- even the most highly selective ones. Sure, you can research in a lab (you get those positions by emailing any and every professor you know or who you can find doing research you’re interested in). Or you can get an internship (you get those the same way as research). Or you can do a program somewhere on a campus or around the world. Those are all great ways to spend your summer. You can also do independent projects - and I think you should (see my rising Junior Summer section for suggestions). But, don’t forget the good old fashioned summer job. You can actually stand out from the applicant crowd these days by making a smoothie, flipping a burger, or scooping ice cream. These kinds of jobs allow you to learn about taking care of others and listening to what the customer wants, learn about organizing your thoughts and activities, learn to work with others and gain some experiences you might never have the chance to gain again. Here’s what William Fitzsimmons, Dean of Harvard Admissions, has said about summer: “Bring summer back... Activities in which one can develop at one’s own pace can be much more pleasant and helpful. An old-fashioned summer job that provides a contrast to the school year or allows students to meet others of differing backgrounds, ages, and life experiences is often invaluable in providing psychological downtime and a window on future possibilities. Students need ample free time to reflect, to recreate (i.e., to “re-create” themselves without the driving pressure to achieve as an influence), and to gather strength for the school year ahead.”

***COVID 19 UPDATE:*** [***Some ideas for what to do during C19***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZQ4NSiaLI1dwXMYhF_6gyOMZKftnN_e4/view?usp=sharing)

**FINISH TESTING:** SAT, ACT, and SUBJECT TESTS (if possible)

**BE INVOLVED:** (see above in Rising Junior summer)

**RECHARGE YOUR BATTERIES:** Take time to care for your mental health and your body. Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Breathe. 

**WRITE:** “Write like a motherf\*cker,” as one of my favorite writers, Cheryl Strayed says. Write about yourself.  Just write. Everyday. Get used to your voice. See my WRITE from Junior Spring. 

[Here’s a list of questions to get you going](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LviZQkEwVd6_SY4-XlCMRpVRiCDL_rdC/view?usp=sharing). This will help you get that Personal Statement ready to go by October 1. Use this super cool website that some of the A2C kiddoes have taught me about-- [themostdangerouswritingapp.com](https://maebert.github.io/themostdangerouswritingapp/). Start asking yourself some hard and kinda silly questions. You can practice answering these in themostdangerouswritingapp.com! I’ve had students write stunning essays just by answering these questions:

* What do you think about when you wake up in the morning?
* What do you worry about?
* What’s your secret sauce?
* What’s your superpower?
* What’s the last thing you think about before you go to sleep?
* Who are your role models and why?
* What’s your favorite comfort food?
* When you’re in your room at night, what do you look at?
* What makes you smile?

**THINK ABOUT AND PRACTICE WRITING THE PERSONAL ESSAY:** Remember — no matter which prompt you choose or which kind of vehicle or conceit you use to relay your message — the topic is YOU. Focus on teaching the admissions officers about who you are. Don’t worry about standing out; worry about sticking with the reader. You do that by creating connections and bonds. Those are created by opening yourself up and letting them inside. They want to know what you think about, what you believe, and what you value. They don’t need to hear a whole lot more about what you’ve already told them in other areas of your application. I'll be happy to share all my essay resources with you, including the essay chapter from my new book, ""Hey AdmissionsMom: Real Talk from Reddit,” if you email me at [admissionsmoma2c@gmail.com](mailto:admissionsmoma2c@gmail.com).

**MAKE A COMMON APP and COALITION ACCOUNT:** Start filling out the details like activities, family info, and educational background. Those roll over when they update the website in August. DO NOT fill out college specific info. It could be lost.

**UPDATE YOUR RESUME:** Or create it if you haven’t done so yet. See info and links to activity spreadsheet above in Rising Junior Summer or in the JUNIOR BINGO

**VISIT COLLEGES if you can:** See information about College Visits and Virtual Visits in Junior Spring section.

**START YOUR COLLEGE LIST:** Start narrowing down your list — including a wide range of selectivities. Make sure you have at least one SFSS (SureFire Safety School). What is a SureFire Safety School you ask? As a reminder, a SureFire Safety School is often your most important school. It’s one:

* Where you have direct/auto/guaranteed admissions based on your stats
* OR you’ve already been admitted via ED, EA or Rolling
* AND you can see yourself being happy there
* AND it works financially for you and your family.

**KEEP IN TOUCH WITH COLLEGES:** [Sign up to ""request info"" from every college you’re interested in ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ty7_vngLwrCNpbmCmdpCjgP5pxS8agzA/view?usp=sharing)— even if you’re already getting info from them because they bought it from a testing company. Also, I recommend that you follow the admissions offices on Instagram and Twitter for the colleges on your list or potential list. They often put out a lot of helpful information for what's happening in their offices. I suggest following Common App, too. Also, it’s  ok to occasionally contact your regional college admissions officers or the general admissions office with questions.

# Senior Fall

All of the above....plus:

Finish up any **college visits (or virtual visits) especially for EARLY DECISION POSSIBILITIES.**

[**Here’s a Senior Fall Checklist to help you keep you organized.**](https://admissionsmom.college/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/AdmissionsMom_College-Admissions-Checklist.pdf)

**COLLEGE LIST:** Begin to narrow your college list. Make sure you have one or two SureFire Safeties (see above) that you love and that will be good financial fits, as well as a collection of matches, reaches, and lotteries (if that’s your thing).

**COLLEGE APPLICATION SPREADSHEET:** Make a spreadsheet for all your colleges. Add application deadlines. Supplemental Essay topics — and look for overlap. Testing info. Contact info for your regional officer. [Here’s ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMpILydhBJ53BdF8FIyh_luRzFaVFtsT0awEP_QUSY4/edit?usp=sharing)a link to the spreadsheets I use for research and organization.

**FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS:** Start with the details if you didn't do it in the summer. Fill out activities, family history, etc.

**EARLY ACTION:** Try to apply to as many schools by Early Action as are available and that you can by following guidelines. Make a calendar of deadlines and essay requirements and work through them one by one.

**FAFSA AND CSS:** Make accounts and start gathering and filling out information.

**FINANCIAL AID:** Reach out to the financial aid offices of schools on your list and establish a relationship with them. Do the net price calculators on the college websites with your parents.

**LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION:** Check back in with your recommenders. Send them a reminder email and stop by if you can. Be sure to give them a big thank you! (Also give them a resume and ""cheat sheet"" if you haven't yet.)

**YOUR HIGH SCHOOL GUIDANCE COUNSELOR:** Check in with your guidance counselor or college counselor if you aren't in regular contact. They have a lot of knowledge and can guide you along the way. And they will be writing about you. If you haven’t stopped by to meet them yet, now’s the time. Keep in mind that every high school might have their own processes you need to follow.

**SAT/ACT/SUBJECT TESTS:** Finish up any testing you have left to do. Be sure to check colleges’ websites for their last accepted testing dates. ***COVID 19 UPDATE:*** *Colleges are aware of the challenges for this year, so don’t let the testing situation stress you out. If you can test, do. If you can’t, many colleges are going test optional for the next year or two and they should all be understanding if you need to write about why you couldn’t test in the Additional Info.*

**SUBMIT TEST SCORES:** Submit your test scores in plenty of time for deadlines to the schools who don't allow self-report. Be sure to check the colleges’ admissions websites to find when they need to be submitted and whether they allow self-reporting or not.

**ESSAYS:** Start writing your essays for real now. Focus first on your Personal Statement. Then categorize your supplemental essays by due dates. How many [“Why College” Essays](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mevoYJi-mzDBiDOCqh4Sotiu_Bjz5mOpy7_Hc3zhQ0/edit?usp=sharing) do you have? When's the first one due? Then, organize the Why Major Essays and the Extracurricular Essays. Think about whether you want/need to write an Additional Info essay. Try to get the Personal Statement done by October 1. Use an app organizer for this. See link to mine above.

**INTERVIEWS:** Be sure to check your email (and voicemail and trash and spam folders for interview invitations). Every school has a different method for signing up, so read their websites carefully. For some, you are automatically signed up when you apply. Others require you to sign up yourself or to apply by a certain deadline. In most cases, they are optional and sometimes you might not be given the opportunity.  I do suggest that you do them though — even if they’re optional and you’re nervous. Lean into your fear, admit it to them if you want, tuck in your button shirt, comb your hair and wash your face, and go.

**LOCI:** If you are deferred Early Decision, be sure to write a LOCI (Letter of Continued Interest) if you are still interested in attending that college.

# Senior Spring

**FINISH UP APPLICATIONS:** Add any schools to your list that you need. There are plenty of colleges still accepting applications throughout the spring (and summer). I usually post a list throughout the spring on A2C.

**SUREFIRE SAFETY SCHOOL:** Make sure you have a SureFire Safety School. If you don't have one yet, look for good fits for you that are still accepting apps. Read above to see what that is if you don’t yet.

**KEEP THOSE GRADES UP:** Being rescinded for grade drops is a very real thing. Don’t panic about it, but you don’t want your average to drop more than 2 letter grades or so, you don’t want to make any Ds, and try to limit your Cs.

**TAKE TIME TO CARE FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR BODY:** Learn more about meditation, mindfulness, or yoga. Get outside and walk or run. Listen to music. Have dance parties in your room. Waiting for those acceptances can be brutal. Breathe. Acknowledge that once those little baby applications have flown away from your computer, you no longer have control. (see all my suggestions above for Taming the Admissions Stress Monster)

**EMOTIONAL PLANNING:** Plan for the worst, but hope for the best. Recognize that many colleges you might be interested in are extremely selective, and even if they're not, they might be holistic. Don't get too bonded to any college except for your SureFire Safety. Keep in mind that there are far too many amazing yous to fit into the tiny teacup of colleges you’re all trying to squeeze yourselves into.

**GRATITUDE:** Think about what you are grateful for. What are the good things in your life? Try to make a mental list every day. Be sure to write thank you notes to all those who have helped you along the way: counselors, teachers, parents, admissions officers, and interviewers to name a few.

**ENJOY THESE LAST FEW MONTHS OF HIGH SCHOOL:** Connect with friends and family.

**WAITLISTED?:** Write a LOCI (see sources on A2C)

tl;dr

* Junior year is when the college admissions prep really kicks in, and you got this.
* Follow this guide while adapting it to suit your own needs
* Check with your high school counselor.
* Be involved. Figure out what makes you happy and interested, and do it."
gmyvsu,1,2020-05-19,Anybody worked for the company they Summer Interned with over Winter break?,Jefferson-not-jackso,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/gmyvsu/anybody_worked_for_the_company_they_summer/,"So, my school announced that they are pushing the semester forward a week and shortening the semester to 14 weeks. This means that we will be out of school by Thanksgiving. That gives me a long winter break.

I am interning for a local company this summer and if things go well and I get a job offer, I want to see if I can potentially work for them over winter break.

Anybody have experience with this type of situation? Are interns ever hired back between Fall and Spring semesters? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

I've never done a software internship, so I'm doubly unsure about how to get into this. What are general things (other than be curious and ask questions) that interns should do to learn as much as possible and make good networking connections? Networking especially because I haven't a clue how that's going to work over the internet. It's going to be at IBM in case that affects how you know the culture would be surrounding a virtual internship.

Thanks!"
gmzgd7,2,2020-05-19,325 + 344 together as a full-time student or not?,GlassSculpture,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/gmzgd7/325_344_together_as_a_fulltime_student_or_not/,"By Fall 2020 I'll have taken 161, 225, 162, 271, 261, 290, and I'm trying to decide between two different schedules.

I plan on taking CS406 Projects for 4 credits for which I have an external project lined up that I have to do in either Fall 2020 or Winter 2021 term, and will occupy 15-20 hrs/week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schedule 1**

* F20: 325 + 344
* W21: 340 + 361 + 406 (projects)
* S21: 475 + 372 + 362
* Su21: 467 (+ potential internship)

&amp;#x200B;

**Schedule 2**

* F20: 325 + 406 (projects) + 361
* W21: 344 + 362 + 340
* S21: 475 + 372
* Su21: 467 (+ potential internship)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm aware that 325 + 344 isn't advised against but I thought as a full-time student with a decent math background (most of 225 was review and what wasn't was pretty easy for me) 325 wouldn't be tooo bad.

Any feedback on which of these looks more sane?"

The thing is, IT interests me a lot more than CS.  I enjoy scripting and web development, but I’m not particularly interested in making my whole course load centered around programming.

In any case, I frequent r/ITCareerQuestions, and there are a small handful of users, maybe two or three, who show up in a lot of the type of threads that I made here and say that IT degrees are seen as useless and for lazy people and that hiring managers look down on IT grads.  Furthermore, they say IT grads get last picks when it comes to internships.  So this might be true, but there seem to be a lot of successful people with IT degrees.  

Is this everyone’s opinion here?"

My only prior experience was a software engineering intern last summer."

I'm only now, graduating college, trying to get my dating life together and expand my social circles (although I did have friends just not as many as I'd like).

But now I've had some time to think about it, I realize that while a lot of people would consider my position to be ""successful"" for where I am in life, I'm still not content a lot of time. I guess my career has always been what I've had to rely on, so I sort of always want to get better and look for the next best thing.

I remember in high school I got rejected by Stanford and MIT, my dream schools, and wasn't completely content with going to the school I go to now, although it's still top 20. There, I majored in CS, chased internships. Got a decent one at a well-known, although not top, tech company, still wanted more. Sophomore year, I interned at a top FAANG and another well-known Bay Area company. Didn't satisfy me.  Junior year I interned at a Unicorn. Same thing. Graduating, I'll be at a top Quant firm (think Citadel, Jane Street, Jump, HRT, etc.). I still have those same feelings. I know people from my class joining the company and I just feel so out of place. A lot of these people were at the top all their lives, from winning international math competitions, to getting these top quant internships their freshman years (not even exaggerating). Some of them interned at VCs as well. Some of them started their own companies. While I take any time I have to sit home and watch some Netflix, learn how to cook, get into fashion, etc. I struggled and grinded to get where I am today. It didn't come naturally to me. I struggled till the end in my actual classes while I know people who didn't need to study much and were having side jobs/projects all the time throughout college and still got a 4.0.

I know this is a first world problem. I'm thankful to be in the position I'm in, but I can't deny that I still have these feelings and thought Reddit might be a good place to ask. Am I just not cut out for this field/lifestyle? What does it take to truly be successful in this field? Do you need to be a genius? Who ends up at the top, being MDs, being directors, being C-Level Execs, starting their own funds, being the decision makers at VCs, starting their own startups, etc. at the end of the day?  Is it the guys who were at the top their entire lives?

I don't have pressure from my family or friends. I'm already more successful on paper then most if not all people I'm close to. The pressure's coming from myself for some reason. But I really don't know why."

First time redditor throwing his hat into the ring with a call for career advice in making a extremely difficult decision

I'm 29 and have got myself into the prickliest pickle I seem to have ever been in and unsure how to proceed.

I went to uni in 2008 and graduated in 2012 with a 2:1 in History and have since worked in various roles from Wall street banks to Car sales but really struggled to find anything that seemed to really offer a CAREER plenty of jobs. But I always seemed to be in positions that were dead end offered little in the way of security or any form of meaningful development. I really felt that while I could make decent money and hold down a job easy enough what i really lacked was direction and long term plan to succeed.

4 years I discovered film production and developed a love for it and its wild craziness and inherent learning curve. I found an environment of constant adventure and learning and found myself drawn to the people and world of that industry and so 2 years ago at 27 I enrolled in technical college and over the past 2 years I have built a very strong TV CV and built an enormous network of colleagues and contacts across the entertainment industry through freelance work, internships and networking meetings and felt confident I could jump and start really making money and progress this year.

Then Covid happened and the entire entertainment industry is dead. I have been reading up on the industry and keeping in contact with people but it honestly seems like it wont be up and running again till at least next year and who knows how accessible it will be.

At 29 I really feel I should be in a decently paid secure job at the moment I have worked constantly for a decade but my CV while comprehensive looks quite schizophrenic with the amount of different industries I've worked in and with a major recession on the horizon I'm unsure how to proceed.

I have narrowed down 3 options

Commit to TV and do a Factual TV Masters degree (Factual is unscripted TV my area of expertise and passion but the industries in such a flux I don't know how worth while it will be particularly if social distancing remains in force making accessing the kit room a non-starter)

Do a computer Science Conversion Masters and walk into a decently paid job (Tech is thriving and lucrative and easily taught remotely, but I'm worried I might have the same job jumping problem as before)

Return to the Job market and see what I can pick up (who knows)

Any advice would be appreciated"

The project that my team (3 other interns + some supervisors) is working on is building a cloud-based web application for employees to request/access company cloud data. This is my first internship ever, and it is completely remote. 

Honestly I have no clue what I’m doing. On top of that, I can already tell that my teammates know way more than me, based on the experience listed on their linkedin profiles. I’m watching tons of tutorial videos of Git, Azure DevOps, Flask, and other technologies/frameworks I’ve never touched but have to use, just trying to keep up. Nevertheless, I have this looming sense of doom that my supervisors are gonna be like “who tf hired this guy”. 

I’m relatively inexperienced as I’ve only been coding for a year now because I switched into CS after my freshman year, and I got super lucky landing this internship, as there was no technical interview to weed me out of the group of candidates back when I got interviewed last fall. 

If any one of you been in this position, could you share your internship experience and how it all went down fo you?"

gn2g6n,3,2020-05-19,TIFU by not asking for help,SilverStormer3,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/gn2g6n/tifu_by_not_asking_for_help/,"I just started an internship for my states department of transportation. It is a really nice job especially in the country's current situation and all. It's my second week of the job and my coworker who taught me everything is off for the week.

My main job there was taking in concrete cylinders made out on job sites and breaking them in a hydraulic press. These cylinders consist of two sizes: 6x12 and 4x8. Earlier in the day I had to break some of the bigger ones and then a couple smaller ones after.

The machine was set up for the big cylinders and to switch to the small cylinders you have to add in a 40-50 lbs piece of metal to lower the breaker head. I had not done this by myself yet so I went to go get help. One of my supervisors came and changed them on his own pretty easily. So I proceeded to finish all the cylinders and started filling out some paperwork.

Later on in the day another supervisor comes in and tell me that some more cylinders came in and I have to sort them and then break two that were supposed to come in the day prior. I start sorting the new cylinders and get ready to break the two new ones. So I think it's a good idea to change this piece by myself because I watched it happen and was confident.

So I begin to change the piece by putting my left hand underneath it and loosen it with my right. Now here is where I messed up: instead of pushing the piece upwards until it loosened and then grabbing it with both hands, I just hand my left hand underneath it thinking I could easily catch this piece of heavy metal. So as I loosen it,  the piece falls on my hand and it gives way. It falls about a foot onto the metal below and the edge of metal hits the tips of my fingers and crushes them.

At first I thought my fingers just got badly bruised, but after I pull my hand away I see it is bleeding quite a bit. I quickly react and run around the corner to the sink. I try to rinse it out as my hands are still covered in some concrete and I grab some paper towels to apply some pressure on my hand and stop some of the bleeding.

I yell the my office to see if my coworker is there but realize the my are in the next room over so I run over to there and tell them I'm cut pretty bad. They open the first aid kit and give me some gauze bc my paper towel is completely red and run to get some help across the office. Now I'm left alone in my office room and then It starts to hit me and I get a bit faint since I'm not great with blood so I lay on one of the desks and try to get some water. My coworker comes back and helps me across the office to my supervisors and they give me an ice pack to put on my head.

They decide to take me to the ER to get stitches because the cut on my left middle finger is pretty deep. I also cut my left index finger just not as bad. They admit me and take a look at my hand. Turns out I'll need to get stitches on the middle finger, but first I need to get some x-rays to make sure I didn't break anything. Those come back and I thankfully didn't break anything  but all my fingers except my pinky are pretty bruised.

After waiting a while I'm finally helped and I have to get a new tetanus shot which fun. Later on they finally start to do my stitches, but not before they number my finger. So I have to get two shots to the base of my middle finger. This ends up not fully working so I have to get two more and then one additional one along with a bunch dropped on my cut. About 3 hours after I was admitted I finally got my stitches and thankfully didn't hear them at that point.

After the stitches, I ask for some glue to be put on the index so it doesn't sting as much and they also put some on the middle. It's now four hours after I got there when I get to leave having middle the rest of the work day and having not eaten in about 8-9 hours so I was a bit light headed. Finally get home and take some Advil and then a nap. Turns out I'm going to have to stick to desk work for the next week or two and can't really use my left hand for a while.

Glad that's all over and I'm laying down watching Ferris Bueller before going back to work tomorrow.

Tl;dr-Tried to change a metal machine part by myself, ended up dropping it on my finger and having to get stitches for a deep cut."

I was just wondering if anyone here experienced within the industry could explain to me, what to expect? 
A lot of my experience and understanding (which is very limited as you’d expect from an undergrad) is obviously limited and was tailored greatly towards M&amp;A/sell-side, so I have even briefer knowledge of asset management.

I was just wondering if anyone knows what I should expect, if there’s anything I should brush up on prior, etc etc.

Here is the twelfth installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

You’re likely thinking about the college admissions process that lies ahead. Sure, it’s super stressful, but there are ways to deal with it and improve your mindset as well. As a senior who has just completed the college admission process, I’m here to offer advice on staying sane during the whole ordeal. Some of these points seem like common sense, but having browsed this subreddit for over a year, I still see so many people(including myself) failing to adhere to them. Some of these are my personal points, and others are influenced by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/a7c5rp/stressed_anxious_overwhelmed_depressed_this_is/) post from u/ScholarGrade and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e9tdm7/worried_that_early_admissions_wont_go_your_way/) post from u/admissionsmom, but please check their posts out as well since they have many awesome ideas.

**Don’t procrastinate!**

This is something everybody says not to do but people rarely go through with it. It’s so tempting to procrastinate, especially if you always procrastinate in school or there’s a nice TV show on at the time. But please, for the love of God, resist the temptation to procrastinate on your college applications. u/LRFE made a nice [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmsh86/juniors_bored_at_home_heres_what_you_can_do/) on things juniors can get started with already, including drafting essays.

Essays are probably the most time-consuming part of your college applications, and if you shotgun schools as I did, you can easily be left with 20+ supplements to write. During my application process, I procrastinated my 20+ essays until mid-November, when they were mostly due on January 1st. It was not fun. I spent almost ten hours a day trying to make my supplements as good as possible. It was just so much unnecessary stress that I would not have had if I had begun my essays during the summer, which is a good time to start.

A good timeline would be to begin your Common Application essay near the end of your junior year and hopefully be finished by mid-summer(You can still make edits later, but have a draft you are happy with complete). Next, you should work on your college list. You don’t have to finalize it until senior year, but you should have a few schools that you are certain you will apply to. Even though supplement prompts usually aren’t released until August, they hardly change from year to year so you can begin working on the supplemental essays earlier.

**Don’t freak out if you have subpar grades or test scores.**

We see types of posts like this a lot: “How I got into UPenn with a 1300 on the SAT!” or something similar. Usually, they’re from applicants with massive hooks, but I, an unhooked senior, am here to say they are often correct. Sure, near-perfect scores are super helpful for schools, but they won’t ruin your application if you don’t have them. Browsing r/collegeresults, there are tons of unhooked people with subpar test scores and GPAs who got into awesome colleges. I know of an unhooked Asian male who got into Stanford with a 3.7 GPA(Not bad, but relatively low for a T5). Earlier today I was adding flairs to some old posts on r/collegeresults and found an unhooked(besides instate) Asian female get into UC Berkeley with a 2.95 unweighted GPA for a pretty competitive major. So bottom line - don’t freak out if you don’t have a 1500+ or a 3.8+ or stats not in your school's middle 50%. Even if you do have a *bad* GPA or SAT score, there are still tons of amazing schools where you will receive a wonderful education, bringing me to my next point.

**Remember that prestige isn’t everything. You don’t have to go to a T20 to succeed, and even if you can, it might not be the best option for you.**

Ah, one of the most controversial and discussed topics on this subreddit. I see many people post this as an *unpopular opinion* yet they attend some top-notch ivy league school. Well, as someone *not* attending a top 20 school, I’m going to try to cement this philosophy into your mind, even if you've already seen it a million times. Yes, prestige is important for some finance-related careers like investment banking. **But that’s it**. It’s not even completely necessary; Take a look at [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gb18pt/list_of_colleges_where_fortune_50_ceos_attended/) post listing the colleges where fortune 50 CEOs attended college. How many ivies or T20s do you see? If this doesn’t help prove that you can succeed without going to a top school, I don’t know what will.

Another thing is that people sometimes get so blinded by the prestige that they forget about fit. Check out this quote from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d3wehk/letter_from_an_ivy_league_student_and_former_a2c/) post:

&gt;Never in my life have I been so swamped. Everything here is stressful. Clubs take less than 5% of applicants, greek life is brutally difficult to keep up with, classes are not easy, shit is hard. But that’s just the culture, and quite honestly that helps me thrive. But that’s just not right for lots of people, and I see that every single day when people crack. Kids kill themselves at college. It happens. These places are absolute pressure cookers.

Some people fail to do research on their schools and end up miserable in college. Maybe it was for the better that you got rejected from your dream school. Don’t let the prestige blind you.

[This](https://www.financialsamurai.com/what-if-you-go-to-harvard-and-end-up-a-nobody/) is a great article I found that challenges our unhealthy desire for prestige.

**Fall in love with a safety school BEFORE the regular decision results come.**

I’ve seen many posts on this subtitled something along the lines of “Help me like X school.” Often it’s a safety school that the poster did no research on and didn’t get accepted anywhere else. We can avoid that awkward scenario: Do research on some safety schools and fall in love with at least one. Maybe you don’t have to fall in love with it, but make sure you can see yourself attending there and actually enjoying it.

It’s also a good benefit to apply to your safety EA, or if they have rolling admissions then apply before RD decisions. Trust me, having that first acceptance, no matter how small, feels *amazing*. A week after I got rejected by my ED school, I got accepted into my safety school and I was ecstatic and found the motivation to grind the rest of my RD supplemental essays.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/awwplc/fell_in_love_with_my_safety_school_last_night_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is a great post I found about falling in love with a safety school. One last bit of advice for this section, please make sure your *safety* school is actually a safety!

**Do NOT get overly attached to a top 20 school.**

I’m not saying it’s wrong to have a top choice, but don’t obsess over a reach school to the point where you dream about them and stalk their social media daily. I’m going to use MIT as an extreme example here. They have somewhere around a 7% acceptance rate. This means that there is a whopping 93% chance that you will get rejected(Maybe less if you’re super qualified, but definitely not below 50%). If MIT was your absolute dream school that you drooled over, there’s a good chance you will cry and be depressed. Do you really want to fight the odds of that 93% chance? Most T20 schools have acceptance rates below 20%, so that’s an 80%+ chance you’ll end up crying and depressed. Please don’t do that to yourself.

**Please, just try to relax while waiting for RD decisions.**

I know many people on this subreddit have tiger parents who pressure them tremendously about the college process. It can be hard to escape that, so what I’m asking is for you to relax while waiting for your RD decisions to come back. Don’t relax too much during applications, of course, but after you’ve submitted everything just lay back and be glad everything is out of your control. Sure, prepare for interviews, but don’t think about decisions 24/7. Go enjoy some time with friends, or if we’re still quarantined then play some games online or facetime with them. Life is too short to stress all day about college decisions, so do your favorite hobbies and have fun. Do anything that will free your mind and make you forget about college. Don’t even talk about it, unless someone asks you about the topic.

**Failure is a part of life, so never let one or two failures derail you.**

From u/ScholarGrade’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e9tdm7/worried_that_early_admissions_wont_go_your_way/):

&gt;Most successful entrepreneurs aren't very successful with their 1st or even 2nd and 3rd attempts to start a company. Most students get rejected from some colleges or internships. Well qualified and even over qualified candidates get rejected for jobs all the time. Researchers find ideas that don't work after years of pursuing them. It's part of being human. Don't let failure or rejection bring you down or defeat you. Just remember, you can only go to one college, so it only takes one college to accept you. You only have one job or summer internship, so you only have to get one offer.

One of my favorite movie scenes is from *Batman Begins* when Alfred tells Bruce Wayne, “Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.” Use these rejections not to depreciate your self-worth, but instead to make you stronger. It’s so rare to not have any college rejections, so it’s best to learn to deal with rejection in a healthy and productive way. Of course, this is easier said than done, but if it was easy I wouldn’t be making a post on doing it.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dst5po/i_didnt_get_into_my_dream_school_and_i_couldnt_be/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/eae4zx/rejected_from_columbia_ed_and_could_not_be_happier/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) post are two great reaction posts I found that deal with rejection in a healthy way.

[Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e8jwlz/rejection_sucks_but_not_as_bad_as_you_think/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) another great post that explains why rejection isn’t as bad as one might think.

**Once you go to college, you won’t care as much about what other people think.**

Maybe you want to go to a top college to impress people. Many people want to get into ivies for bragging rights, but this will change once you get into college. Especially if you attend a school you love in the fall(It could even be a safety school), you will care less and less about what people think. If you do your research and take advantage of things that attract you on campus, the school will feel like home(Maybe not completely, but you’ll feel comfortable there). So rather than waiting until college to develop that mindset, you can start to work on it now. Many people on this subreddit go to toxic competitive schools, so it will take lots of practice. Talk with friends and help each other forget about what other people think of your college. Good friends will not care about where you go to college and will still enjoy conversing with you.

**Appreciate the journey of how much you’ve achieved throughout high school.**

From u/admissionsmom’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e9tdm7/worried_that_early_admissions_wont_go_your_way/):

&gt;Applying to college is stressful, and can be overwhelming. But there’s also something really amazing about the admissions journey.  
&gt;  
&gt;And here’s why: Some stress is good for you. You aren’t going to live long, full, absolutely stress-free lives and the sooner you learn to handle it, the better. I’ve heard this called stress inoculation before.

College admissions is a crazy ride of emotions. There will likely be more sadness than happiness. But forget about the results for a moment. You’re finally graduating high school! You worked your butt off for four years and deserve to celebrate. Your time at high school is coming to a close. Maybe you did some clubs, played a sport, or had a favorite teacher. Once you leave for college, everything will be different. Please, take a moment and just think about everything you’ve accomplished - big or small - in high school. What are you grateful for? Take another moment to appreciate your parents, teachers, and/or opportunities given to you. Another u/admissionsmom’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/87rhfd/dear_wonderful_seniors_hold_on_to_your_hearts/) explains it very well. You can do this at any time during the college admissions process, and definitely do it more than once.

**Bonus: Post or browse memes! :)**

It worked for me, maybe it will work for you, too! You may have had a chuckle at some of my memes, but it felt just as great to make them. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/A2C_circlejerk/comments/f3g3nu/me_when_i_see_someone_with_a_1570_40_uw_16_aps_5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) is one of my favorites that I made; it doesn't have to be super creative. I made a lot of memes while waiting for decisions, and it felt great to be able to joke around about my upcoming decisions and it honestly lowered my expectations. Remember, have high hopes but low expectations!

u/Smokie_Bear also has tons of amazing college-related memes that you should check out.

Thanks for reading this awfully long post. A lot of these points were from personal experience that I either successfully maintained or wish I could have done better. I hope I was able to offer some good advice!

gnbmpo,1,2020-05-20,Need Some Advice People,averagej0e28,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/gnbmpo/need_some_advice_people/,"So because of this whole corona thing, I have had several potential internships canceled this summer. I'm not going to say I was going to get them, but I had somewhat of a chance for sure. Regardless, because of coronavirus, I am now stuck in what I see as a massive hole. I am going into my senior year after this summer, internship-less, as a Finance and ISIT (Information Systems Information Technology) double major. My GPA is above a 3, but not good enough to mention on my resume in my opinion. From what I can see, I have little to no chance of getting a finance internship for 2 reasons.

1) I have no connections in the business world. My parents are in more coding related fields, and I did not make too many connections to older students going into the workforce.

2) I don't have any finance related experience work wise, aside from course work. I was going to use this junior summer to get an internship for some much needed experience, but that has gone out the window completely.

So, because of this bad situation, I have done a few things. I have decided to focus a bit more on my ISIT side because I can't see what I can do to get a finance internship. So now I am practicing basic codes all summer as of now. Like SQL, python, R, and maybe Java if I have the time, SQL being my main bread and butter. The plan was as of now, that I was going to get certifications in at least SQL if possible this summer. On top of that, I was going to apply for winter internships and manually network through LinkedIn with alumni at firms that I apply to. That way I can at least try to connect somehow. Also I plan on asking a few professors I became close with for rec letters; unfortunately none of them are for my Finance courses, but better than nothing.

Now that I have typed out my self dug shit situation, and what I am currently doing about it, I have a few questions:

1) What in the world do Finance Internships look for? Like what what do recruiters look for in entry level finance internship applications, because I have no connections in this field. I am fighting an uphill battle alone, and I don't know what I am doing wrong.

2) What do you suggest I do at this point? I'm not giving up, but more like lost as to what to do to get a much needed finance internship. Should I scrap the finance, and focus hard core on the ISIT side? I am open to any suggestion at this point.

I would really appreciate some much needed advice, thanks in advance."

My school preferences: 

I'm really leaning into smaller schools in bigger cities/not far from big cities ( Barnard, Tufts, etc), but I'd be willing to drop everything and live in the middle of nowhere for a prestigious school. For safeties, even though my preference is smaller liberal arts schools, I think it would be more financially viable to go to a state school if the school isn't relatively highly ranked. For match schools, I don't really care about sports or school greek life at all - I really do care that theres an emphasis on people with diverse interests, talents, and experiences. Program-wise, I'm confident I can find a program I like at pretty much any school. I don't think I'm academically qualified for the schools I consider my top choices, but they are the ones I know the most about their culture and environment because they are prominent- I'm hoping to get some suggestions on schools that reddit thinks I have a shot at!"

I hope everyone is doing well.

I am currently a university student studying Computer Science (also minoring in Statistics).

Fortunately, I got a **one-year** tech internship offer for Fall 2020 (hoping it doesn't get canceled due to the pandemic). If I accept this offer, I will have to delay graduation by one year.

Also, I choose to do more internships in the future, if possible.  
So, I am expecting to be in school for about **6 years**.

However, I am worried that staying in school for too long might affect my chances in the future.  
(e.g. an employer might devalue my degree due to the fact that my graduation was delayed by 2 years)

I just wanted some inputs from anyone so here I am on Reddit.

Examples:

* Keeping employees as contractors to avoid paying taxes or benefits.  I came to this conclusion when the Office Manager is a contractor after 9 months of being in that position.  This violates the part where contractors cannot be involved in the day to day operation of the business.  I am currently a contractor after 6 months, but I am in charge of several internal business decisions that affect day to day work flow.
* Frequently requesting off hours work or consultation.  Namely being forced to respond to almost daily emails and phone calls during off hours.
* Forcing 'contractors' to punch out for travel home from job sites.  This means that for upwards of two hours we are unpaid.  This one is debateable in the sense that 'contractors are expected to provide their own transportation', but then are offered transportation for use.  Also bleeds into the fact that 'contractors' are actually employees.
* Keeping an unpaid intern on staff after this person accepted the position.  This is being disguised as on the job training, but the laws seem to indicate this would be illegal.  The new hire in question 'has not asked for payment' and is 'volunteering' but this is a for-profit company.
* Although our business is not necessarily essential, we were marked as such for reasons I would rather not get into.  This then turned into my employer abusing this classification to perform non-essential business.
* Not providing PPE to facilitate the aformentioned non-essential business.

 My question, and why I am nervous to do anything is am I required to report my employer?  If I do not report him, am I legally responsible for any of his actions?
 
 Side Question: I am afraid to leave this position or report him for fear it will tarnish my reputation in my area.  There isn't a huge market for what I do, and I am afraid that by reporting my employer for the numerous infractions I will be shunned and unable to work.  Am I able to gracefully leave this position while also requiring my employer to provide a good reference?  I'm afraid my employer will simply say that I wasn't playing ball or I was being insubordinate for not breaking the law repeatedly.  I want to avoid having to protect myself in court for slander if possible.

gngzm9,12,2020-05-20,What to strive for?,AntiWorkWeapon,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/gngzm9/what_to_strive_for/,"I've been a long time lurker here but made a throwaway to vent a little and hopefully develop some optimism. I'm in my early twenties, I worked some shit jobs like everyone else before and after college, only temporary stuff here and there for low pay. After college I got work in my field of study right out of the gate, it seemed great. I worked for a small but well established and respected local business where I was treated no differently to anyone off the street, my two bosses loved to act like I didn't have 3 years of study and countless hours of internships behind me until I screwed up, then they reminded me I should know better. The rest of the staff didn't fair better, blatant favouritism meant that the staff bootlicker was held higher than the manager above her and her decisions often outweighed the manager's. Another staff member told me a story of how she was being bullied by a previous manager and when she spoke to the owners she was told ""we'll give you permission to bully her back if she does it again"" and that was the end of it. It was my first real job and it felt like the constant overtime, low pay, high stress both physically and emotionally were the toll I knew I had to pay to get myself a better position. I worked hard and well, my bosses basically said nothing other than ""keep it up"" during my probation meeting. Coming on one year I was unfairly dismissed, no warnings prior, just told that my work wasn't good enough and they were letting me go, in the same breath they told me they wanted me to work another two weeks before I leave, they would give me good references and they would give me a few week's pay (aka don't take us to court money). I feel they let me go as I was due a raise and there was someone new who started that was willing to work weekends when they knew I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

That gutted me and it lead me to being unemployed for five months. Five months of sending off job applications every single day, landing maybe 15 interviews and in each one being assured I did well but that they wanted someone with more experience, while also being turned away from jobs that required no experience. I loved the free time but missed having money and a sense of independence. In January I started a new job, a complete 180 to what I was doing before, this is an office job where people treat me like I actually know what I am doing, the job is easy, the pay is great, they never expect overtime, my manager is understanding and accomodating, it really feels like I'm working the best possible job I could ask for compared to what I was dealing with before. The problem is my anti-work feelings have only gotten stronger despite my situation improving, every day it's a lottery of wondering whether or not I will be too busy to pay attention to these feelings or if I will sit seething at my desk thinking about how unfair it is I have to give up five days a week and how I am supposed to be grateful for it when I never asked for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Like most people on here I'm dreading social distancing's end, it goes without saying I don't want people to be ill or to be dying but when I see the numbers for my country fall all I can think of is ""shit I have to get up an hour earlier, spend two hours travelling every day, fake small talk with people I don't like, spend ages prepping meals for the week, etc."" Work from home is amazing and I never want to go back but I know I will have to, even if this has proven my job can be 100% done remotely there's no way they'd be happy to leave employees at home and away from the grasp of middle-management. As much as I love WFH I feel even more anti-work now than when I was in the office. What's upsetting me is that it appears all the benefits of my job seem to make me hate it more and more, I had a much worse working situation before and most days I hated it but not to the extent that I do now. Part of me wants to stop looking at subs like this as it feels detrimental to my mental health but another part of me feels like I am ignoring the problem that way.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm feeling lost and very disillusioned with the future, you can't opt out of this way of living, atleast not easily. I don't have a dream job, any hobbies I have will stop being fun/interesting the second I start thinking of them as a means of making money, I hate feeling that I need to quantify my worth by how much money a skill or interest can make me. I don't know what plan to have or what goals to aim for, the usual response is to go the FIRE route but this is an awful lot of effort and isn't suitable for everyone, definitely not to me. I want to feel like I'm not just counting down the days to something nice happening only to bookend with ""well I have to go back to work in x hours/days"". I hate the culture of work being your worth and hate how unacceptable it is be against it, that you're lazy, you're ungrateful, etc. It's feeling like it is too much."

I'm currently working at another company as a software engineer intern but can put in hours whenever I want so it's pretty chill. 4k/mo is something I am comfortable with, but with the nature of this field, I feel like the amount is kind of average when the position feels more than average. Google and co. pay around 7-8k, and I heard that your target hires should be paid 75% of the competitor (ex: 7.5\*0.75= 4.75k\~)

Is this something I should negotiate more for?"

gnhaa2,42,2020-05-20,Why you should apply to USC,usctrojanyahh,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gnhaa2/why_you_should_apply_to_usc/,"I am an incoming freshman at USC. I originally applied to this school not really knowing much about it. However, I did a lot of research before committing and am BEYOND glad I applied. Here are some amazing things about USC and some advice for applying: 

- USC is good at..... everything. You like film? That’s great we have the best film program in the country. You like business? Marshall has insane connections and is going up. You like engineering? Viterbi has crazy job placement and super generous curves. Unlike other schools, students can SUPER EASILY move between majors; you can literally transfer into viterbi from any major. If you ever want to change your major, you can do so easily and since every major is good at USC, you won’t be screwed. 
- USC is rising really quickly. Near 2000, USC was ranked around 30 and now it is commonly seen as a T 20. Due to the scandal, the acceptance rate rose FIVE PERCENT this year, meaning getting into USC has been easier. THIS IS THE BEST TIME TO APPLY. It is relatively easy to get in AND your degree will be worth more in the future.
- USC job placement and alumni connections are unparalleled. No matter your major, USC has great job placements for it. Most people can find jobs super easily in socal. Even in silicon valley, which is in NORCAL, we are the 4th largest feeder of engineers, behind stanford, berkeley, and carnegie mellon. This is INSANE when you think about it since 1) USC is not even in norcal,  2) it isn’t known for engineering (unlike the three other schools) and 3) there are fewer kids in engineering (compared to the three other schools). Don’t even get started on Marshall job placement. 
- USC, like other private schools, gives you so much guidance. A lot of my friends at UC’s tell me how they might delay their degree because they can’t get the classes they want. At USC, this is extremely uncommon. We also have great advising resources. I am a business major in Marshall and I am in this program called glp. In glp, they invite a bunch of super cool business people to talk to you and you get to go to china during spring break. There’s a special internship you can interview for and there are 20 spots reserved JUST for USC students AND if you get the internship, USC gives you a stipend for travel/rent/food (this obviously does not include your earnings from your internship). The USC stipend is so large that if you use it conservatively, you can take home extra.
- USC takes care of their students. You might’ve heard that the area around USC isn’t the best (which is true). However, USC students get free lyft within a two miles radius of the school. THAT’S CRAZY.
- USC financial aid is no joke. I know we all think of USC as super expensive and stuff which is definitely true. However, when compared to other private schools, it’s actually affordable. Most private schools are around the same price as USC but USC has better financial aid and scholarships. For families making under 80k, USC tuition is FREE. Run the net price calculator on a couple private schools and you’ll see how USC is very generous compared to others. Also, USC gives merit scholarship to high schoolers. You can even apply for MORE scholarships during your time at USC. The USC merit scholarships stack on the financial aid, so if you qualify for 20k aid and get a half tuition scholarship, you get 50k off. 
- We have this thing called a progressive degree where you add a year to your undergrad to get a master’s (usually it takes two years to get a masters at USC so staying just one more year is a good deal). You don’t need to go through the crazy application process or take the GRE; most majors let you in from GPA. This is super great for saving a LOT of money and time and headache. 
- Also, AP credit is a joke at some schools but at USC it’s actually helpful. If you bring in 32 units (8 AP exams) it can help you graduate a FULL year early and save you a years tuition. 

Here are some tips on applying:
- Apply by the december deadline which automatically considers you for scholarships. USC is one of the few “elite” schools with merit scholarships and they’re super generous. You also get automatic half tuition with national merit finalist if you put USC as your top school. If you get one of these scholarships, you’ll get to live in the McCarthy dorms, which are arguably the best dorms in the country. Here’s an article about them: https://news.usc.edu/trojan-family/top-usc-freshmen-find-home-at-mccarthy-honors-college/
- If you are unsure about what you wanna do, apply for dornslife. Dornslife is the general college at USC. From there, you can choose from many majors or switch into a different college easily."

For one of my internships, I’m still working from home but I’m having such a hard time handling the quarantine ending. 

When I’m working from home I end up crying pretty often. I even cried the first couple times my boyfriend had to go to work. When I’m working from home I just stare at the clock hoping for him to come home early or for the quarantine to start up again. 

When I’m at my second job, all I think about is my bf and dog and how badly I want to be home with them and how terrible life is right now because we’re apart. 

My bf seems to be handling the adjustment fine on the outside but he’s said a few times that the worse part of quarantine ending is that he can’t spend the day with me everyday anymore. 

Idk how to handle this adjustment and would like advice on what I can do because distracting myself obviously isn’t working at all."
gnisfy,0,2020-05-20,Too early for engineering management?,shesko12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gnisfy/too_early_for_engineering_management/,"Hi All, (sorry for the long message)

I recently got promoted as an Engineering Manager and I’m concerned that I may have shifted a bit too early. Let me give some context to explain what I mean.

I graduated in 2016 and thanks to a couple of internships during my summer breaks and attempting to start an IoT based company, I was able to get a job in September as a Software Engineer. I worked at that company for two years and then had the opportunity to join a renowned company also as a software engineer. I was lucky and was able to participate to a couple important projects and proved to be senior engineer worthy so I was promoted 6 month later. I then had the chance to lead a pretty big and important project for that company which my team was able to complete successfully. Through that project, according to my manager and my peers, I proved to have strong leadership and technical skills. One year later, I was promoted as an engineering manager. 

I do believe I deserve being where I am and I am really grateful for the opportunities I got. However, having 3.5 years of industry experience as a software engineer, I am concerned that if I were to find a job elsewhere my CV would portray me as someone who doesn’t have enough technical experience to lead teams of engineers. I am also wondering wether it is the case that I don’t have enough technical experience and that this might catch up with me in the future. 

I thought I’d write this message here to see what people think. Was this shift a bad move and should I try to move back to an IC role for some time? Has anyone had a similar experience in the past?"
gnjald,16,2020-05-20,"Transition into Software Engineering from Electrical Engineering, looking for advice",BuddyGuyBruh,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/gnjald/transition_into_software_engineering_from/,"I have recently finished my EE degree. 

I have gotten very lucky early on with my institute which allowed me to get a good internship which allowed me to quickly get a decent amount of jobs under my belt. I have about 5 years of work experience split into 4 different companies full time while finishing my degree part-time (7 years total from start to finish, 25yo now).

I worked very hard in EE and honestly loved it, I had great experiences early on, spent probably close to $20k buying equipment like scopes, PS etc to get a really good lab at home for hobby work and contracting.

I loved it but recently I want to go more into software engineering since I see the world moving in that direction (the salary definitely is). I do have some basic knowledge of coding as all EE do I guess but this is mostly limited to C and assembly. Personally I do have some experience in python and javascript but it is nothing I even feel remotely comfortable putting on a resume.

My question to software or computer engineers out there (or maybe some EE that transferred), what is the best way to go about learning and getting yourself into the software field? 

I am looking for some sort of structure I can look at like, here are these books, courses etc you need to learn and I 'll go to town. It is difficult when I got no clue where to even start.

I was planning to also just try to make some easy projects, that was the way I learned about electronics, had an idea or a problem I wanted to solve then googled my way (and used my course material) to get the skills needed, after about a 100 mini-projects, school labs etc I started to get a hang of it.

Would appreciate any advice, guidance or any links to books or course material, boot camps etc"
gnjdyy,0,2020-05-20,Not graduating cum laude as an undergrad; is grad school even an option?,hotline-be-blinging,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/gnjdyy/not_graduating_cum_laude_as_an_undergrad_is_grad/,"I don't know if this is the right place to even post this and I apologize for how long and soap boxy this might be. THIS WILL SUPER LONG I APOLOGIZE! I think I'm just really ""going through it"" (as the kids say) alone right now and feel like my work was for nothing, so please skip if you're not into that! I know a lot worse things are happening in the world right now and perspective matters, but I need to get this out and also get some advice. 

I found out today that I didn't graduate with any honors, not even cum laude, from my university with a 3.75 GPA. I'm most frustrated by this because I've worked incredibly hard and received straight A's and been on the Dean's List for 3 years. I'm completely positive that my first year grades ruined my chances of graduating with honors. 

Before I went off to college my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. He previously had a benign tumor that was re-occuring over the course of my junior year and into the summer into my senior year in high school. I still went off to college because it was a wish of my parents as a first generation college student to get an education and graduate, plus a mix of us not really knowing the severity of the situation until well into my first year. Over the fall of my first year he was diagnosed with a glioblastoma and his condition as being terminal. Unsure of the timeline and with his worsening condition, I bounced back and forth between going to school (out of state on a scholarship that made it affordable) and having to travel back home. His condition got exceedingly worse over the course of that year and from February until he died in early May, he was in multiple hospitals, ER's, physical therapy facilities, and then hospice. I was under a lot of pressure from my family to return home often to support my mom (as I'm an only child) and also to be there for my dad. There were several instances where an emergency situation would happen and Dr.'s were sure it was the end; my mom would call me and I would drop everything and go home. I'd be in class, work, in my dorm wherever, and would have to just leave immediately. I grew up in an environment where I regularly hid my problems and issues at home and didn't know how or when to ask for help so I didn't until I couldn't take the pressure anymore. Around March of that year when things were basically spiraling out of control I told the Dean's office of my College and Advisors, and they told me I could either take incomplete's or finish my classes on campus. I knew if I took incomplete's I would not finish them over the designated time of the summer and would have to drop out, due to having to go to work at home and also how emotionally draining and toxic my relationship with my family was at the time. My dad died my finals week, and ""finishing"" was a bit of a disaster. While some professors were accommodating in letting me have take-home finals or take exams early so I could get home for the funeral and be with my family, some were adamant I had to turn every assignment in on time or get points deducted and wouldn't schedule a final exam outside of the original allotted date. I was able to finish all my classes and took one incomplete (that I unfortunately bombed over the summer). Regardless, that year was a GPA disaster. I felt guilty for not being home with my family and supporting them as much as I could, and I felt guilty about not doing well in my academics and struggling to stay afloat. I was extremely depressed, angry, bitter, and just a toxic person to be around. I had a GPA of 3.33 at the end of my first year but I was spiraling from my family situation too much to care about school. 

To cut an already long story short, I returned to school my sophomore year determined to try to make up for all of my mistakes (familial and academic) in honor of my dad and myself. I excelled in my classes that year, got my first internship while also holding a job (I only worked 10-12 hours a week or so in my job, and then 16 hours with the internship) and made it on the Dean's List both semester. Over the following two years I reformed relationships with my friends, family, and worked on my emotional growth and dealing with my own trauma and emotional baggage. I of course still have a ways to go emotionally and personally, but I'm proud I'm not the angry person I was that first year. 

I know grades aren't everything, but I was never a ""star student"" in my life. There was always a family matter, an illness, a death, that seemed to weigh me down (not blaming them of course, but sometimes life just really hits you with a hard deck I've learned) or I just didn't perform to my potential. I wanted to make a radical change in college and try my hardest and become the most I thought I could be. Since that first year I got straight A's each semester, studied abroad, I got published in a peer-reviewed journal, I did research with professors, I had 10 internships (2 on Capitol Hill, one while abroad with the EU), two independent studies, and my senior year I worked 30-35 hours a week between two jobs, was the Lead Editor of a student-run peer-reviewed journal, and received straight A's. I don't say this to brag but to show that I was trying my damnedest to make myself proud and become that ""star student"" at the top of the class I never thought I could be. I was honestly proud of myself come graduation this past Sunday, as a first grad given some of the obstacles. I was hopeful I'd graduate cum laude to at least cement my progress and achievements. 

I learned I didn't qualify as I wasn't in the top 10% of the class. I know this is trivial, and there are SO many other hardships people are going through right now that are more important. But I can't help to feel that I failed in a way. I know everyone who gets these honors tries their hardest, so saying ""I tried my hardest"" doesn't really mean much. But I truly did. I wanted to work for a few years in DC and then apply to grad schools for an MPA. I wanted to apply to some of the best programs in the country (Ivy, Georgetown, UCLA, John Hopkins, UChicago) but now looking at my academic record - it seems foolish and that I haven't a chance. It seems most everyone makes cum laude, and not having that on my transcript or resume really undermines and delegitimizes what I thought my accomplishments were.  

Do I even bother studying for the GRE and applying to these schools without ""cum laude"" on my transcript and my average GPA? If the chances are impossible, I would rather face reality rather than waste time and limited money I have to apply to these schools. 

TL;DR: My dad dying my first year in college weighed down my GPA and I didn't graduate with honors; do I bother trying to apply to ""top/prestigious"" grad schools?"
gnjeby,1,2020-05-20,How to move out of parents house,UnwantedFirstBorn,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gnjeby/how_to_move_out_of_parents_house/,"Hi there I am 21 and currently live at home with my boyfriend (21), mom (45?), dad(49), little brother (18), and since September, my moms childhood best friend (40’s?) and her son (5). Life before my moms friend wasn’t absolutely horrible but it definitely wasn’t the greatest. My dad is a marine and an alcoholic and chronic weed smoker. He is a functioning alcoholic and can get up and go to work everyday but he comes home and drinks all night. He gets triggered very easily (it could be over something he misheard) and after that there is no coming back from it. I love my dad but he used to terrify me as a child and make me think I was going to die/get horribly beaten, causing me to sleep with a hammer under my pillow for many years. He never beat us but he always got extremely scary for hours on end and would throw things, slam doors, and scream for hours on end. My mom was more supportive in most things when I was younger except she used emotional manipulation tactics as punishments for me that give me anxiety I struggle with to this day. She also always blamed me for how my dad acted because “I should of known better.” 

Now her childhood friend and son have moved in everything is worse. She previously was living at her parents house but left because her mom slapped her in the face during an argument. She’s been here since September. Her son is 5 and is cute at times but doesn’t understand the word no and behind on a lot of things. For example, he doesn’t wipe his own butt, dress himself, if you give him a pizza lunchables he would have no clue at all what to do with it, he can’t open a bag of chips (doesn’t understand how and doesn’t want to learn he wants you to do it for him), has peed all over the bathroom multiple times (I sat in it once and my whole butt, legs, and feet were wet), slapped my grandma in the face on Christmas (his mom laughed), he wants you to compliment him when he’s naked/ in his underwear and will completely interrupt me talking to someone o try and get a compliment, is really rough with all the animals in our house (3 dogs, 2 hedgehogs that I rehomed a month ago, some fish, and a cat. He jumps on our dogs and has put his fingers in their eyes, tries to feed them chocolate or legos, probably more), and was caught by my dad 2-3 times now fondling my male dogs penis. My mom doesn’t care and won’t listen to any of us about how unhappy we are because this was her childhood friend and her ex husband/kids dad was abusive but they haven’t lived with him in two years. They use that and his age as an excuse for his actions, they don’t tell him it’s wrong or discipline in anyway. Needless to say I am very unhappy. 

So, how do you move out of your parents house? I know you obviously need money and good credit (mine is bad from hospital bills I have a chronic puking condition.) My boyfriend works but I currently don’t because I’m scared to leave my pets alone while the child is here and I also get sick a lot. Does anyone know of any government programs I can apply to while still living with my parents? They make a good amount of money and still claim me on taxes so I’m not really sure how any of this works. My mom as of the past 3 years has been too busy to notice my existence more for than a few minutes and even when I ask her for help on official things I don’t understand (like taxes, bills, signing official documents, how to apply for stuff, etc) she is too busy. I needed her tax information to apply for charity care to help with my hospital bills but she was always too busy to help me and wouldn’t give me the information to see our taxes, now I have probably close to 10k against my credit I guess. I’m not really sure how it works I’ve been getting letters in the mail for months saying my payments are late and that I need o figure something out. I don’t think my parents would help me and I honestly would rather be able to leave without them knowing. This living situation is causing a deep dark depression for me and I have struggled with thoughts of suicide for over a year now. Idk how any of you guys can help with advice. We do have some money saved already but not a bunch.

Edit: I love both my parents and try to do stuff for them especially since I don’t work because of my puking syndrome. I try to cook, clean, run errands for them, do their laundry, organize the house/their lives (they always lose birth certificates and shit so now I hold on to it all), make my mom coffee in the morning, get them food or drinks when I can. I honestly really love both my parents but I have felt more like an intern than part of the family. The other day while my bf was at work I was leaving to get him and when I went outside to let my family know they were all out there at a bonfire with food and even invited my moms one couple she is friends with over. No one ever told me or invited me. I will admit I’m not the easiest to live with im an angry person and have had my moments, but I don’t lose my shit on people for no reason. My mom tells me I’m dramatic about the whole situation and to let it go and shut up about it. Being told that about this situation (and kinda every situation in life. She always told me to “let it go” or “it wasn’t that bad” including when I said my friends older brother who was 5 years older than me raped me and when my cousin molested me for months at 12.) has caused me to have such an incredible amount of anger built up towards her friend and son. I honestly never met her son until they moved in. I have one memory of my moms friend when I was super young (3?) but after that age they stopped talking and didn’t start again until 4 years ago maybe. I only ever saw her in person 2 times in that time period before she moved in. So I honestly feel like her and her child are just ignorant strangers living in m house. There is a lot more they have done but I mentioned some of the more annoying and bad behaviors."

My main interests are in the aerospace/space industry (SpaceX, NASA, Blue Origin type jobs) but so many internships and jobs require a 3.0. Am I just doomed to failure now that I've failed a couple classes and that my GPA has been set back? 
If you are in the pre-mentioned industries at all I'd love some advice as to how to move forward and get the most experience possible to be successful in this field. Especially if you also had a lower GPA as I did. I just need motivation now to make me keep working at it.

This is going to be a rather lengthy post and I apologize for that, but I heavily desire to share my story so that any others in my shoes may avoid any self imposed vices and despair that are similar to my own.

So, to begin with, I am a 20 year old male with no job experience approaching his final year of College. It is difficult to ascertain when and where my fuck up began exactly but I shall try my best. 

I completely regret my time in school. Elementary, Junior High, High School and College I consider to be complete wastes of time. I made no lasting friendships, I have no interests in anything to do with academia and I felt miserable entirely. Now, my fuck up begins somewhere in the midst of my early years of schooling I suppose. I began to realize how much I detested school since I never felt any sort of fulfillment from learning anything in it, and I just constantly felt lonely due to lack of friends and coinciding interests. The only reason I chose to major in Creative Writing is because I have more trauma with math and science than other subjects. I was humiliated in Junior High by my teacher for failing an Algebra quiz which made me detest math. The same happened with science. My family highly values school and while we are not poor, home schooling was out of the question. I have two sisters who have gone through College with careers, friendships and fulfillment of their own so the same was expected of me obviously. Unfortunately, I also have a stutter and despite several years of trying out therapy, it amounted to naught. My stutter gets worse the more stressed I am, and considering how stressed school constantly makes me, it is an easy recipe for disaster. This, coupled with how my interactions with my family have made me incredibly fearful at the mere mention of school as well as jobs, interviews and internships made life feel taxing.

My family is not necessarily terrible but they do not understand me. I know that is a very cringey, teenager thing to say but it is the best way for me to describe them. I have always been the blacksheep of the family. I am very into video games and anime which they have judged me harshly for. They are very anti Japanese media and considering how I adore JRPGs and the like, you can imagine how well that has turned out. They also can not fathom how I detest school and do not find an interest in anything to do with academia. My sisters constantly criticize and demean me for my disinterest and lack of proactive action in finding jobs and such.

Due to my hatred of school and the way I have barely challenged my family, I have grown to feel incredibly fearful of just the mere mention of any sentence containing school, jobs, internships and interviews. My stutter and troubled interview experience have made the thought of future interviews cause me distress, and my lack of passion and desire for any career has left me in a place of nothingness for my future. 

Moving on from school and the like, another aspect of my life that has led to this instrumental fuck up is my time on the internet. When I was younger, I viewed the internet as a sort of safe haven from dealing with my family and school and it was to an extent. I was very much a lurker online but that alone granted me serenity. Watching let's plays, listening to music and other such activities granted me peace. However, when I began to talk to people online during my early years of College, I fucked up majorly. I joined several Discord servers and became active on Twitter and it was around that time where I realized how weak minded I was. Interacting with one community in particular broke me beyond belief and as much as I would want to solely blame them, I am also to blame.

There is a very niche gaming developer called Nihon Falcom. They create rather captivating JRPGs. I interacted with some of its fanbase on Twitter last Spring and it resulted in me getting blocked, mocked and harassed by dozens of members. While they are certainly to blame, I pulled the trigger. For context, one of franchises created by Falcom is the Legend of Heroes: Trails series or as I and many others call it, Trails. It is a series currently 9 mainline titles in that all take place in the same world. They have truly great writing, character dynamics, etc. There are currently three arcs of games. The Sky saga which is comprised of three games, the Crossbell saga which is comprised of two games and the Cold Steel saga which is comprised of four games. The Crossbell games however have never been localized but have received fan translations. They take place in between the Sky and Cold Steel arcs. I played through the Crossbell games during the Fall of 2018 and honestly found them to be quite awful for a number of reasons. This earned me the ire of many members of the fanbase. I was not taken seriously and despised vehemently for this. Eventually, I let the hate get to me and composed a tweet stating how just seeing profile pictures of Crossbell characters annoyed me. This lit the fire and I was mass blocked by dozens of people and mocked. I entered a state of depression over my fuck up there and it is still on my mind everyday. I really should have had the common sense to not stir up trouble in a fanbase that was already sick of me. I have had other negative experiences in other fanbases but this is the one that truly broke me. To this day, it is difficult for me to enjoy gaming in general because of that incident and I can't let it go. I have been depressed more than usual ever since that day and I do not see myself recovering. I attribute my obsession with this event to pent up negativity that has overtook me from school and the like. 

I had no idea that negativity in one part of my life could affect me everywhere else.

There are other areas of my life that I could discuss such as how my negativity is likely the reason why I do not enjoy working out at all but I feel as if my general point has been made. I was too scared and cowardly as a young teenager to challenge my parents and illustrate how I felt. I was mired in inaction and passiveness and let that determine my life. I fucked up bad. To anybody who has had or is having issues similar to mine, I implore you to seek out help before it is too late. I unfortunately feel as if I am far too gone for any help as general therapy for depression has not helped me at all. I apologize if my writing was messy to parse meaning from. I do not have much faith in my writing skills.

TL;DR: I let past failures and inaction towards my family and school cause an excess of negativity online that earned me the ire of many and put me into depression."

For most of college, I thought that I would graduate with my BS and get a software engineering job like the majority of my peers. However, recently I have been seriously considering graduate school for a few reasons:


* After doing two internships at well-known software companies, I'm not sure if I would be happy working in a software engineering role for the rest of my career. 
* Although I am passionate about CS/coding,  throughout college I've always been most interested in my theory / math-heavy courses, and in general, I've always enjoyed school/learning. 

Another thing I should mention is that I don't really want to pursue a masters as I don't want to pay any more tuition. While I understand doing a PhD is a massive commitment, I have enjoyed doing research in the past and I've heard PhD students can always drop out early with a masters if necessary. 

&amp;nbsp;

Given all of this, I just had a few concerns/questions:


* Firstly, my only undergraduate research experience was during freshman year, as I was focused on internships afterwards. As I am assuming internships don't matter a whole lot for graduate school applications, my only other undergraduate research experience will have to come during senior fall. At this point, how feasible is it for me to apply?
* Is there any merit to doing industry first after graduating, and then applying to graduate school at a later point?
* Has anyone else gone through a similar situation and could offer any advice? I really appreciate any help!"

I'm not 100% sure what my goals are but I definitely want to get a Software Developer role at a big tech company like FAANG; back end or front end. I have some connections at Google so I most likely will reach out to them at some point.

I can potentially **graduate during Summer 2021** with a Bachelor's in Computer Science, which would be the end of my 4th year at my University. This would only be possible by being a full-time student and taking the most amount of classes in between now and then. Not sure if i can get an Internship in this amount of time as I don't have much work experience related to Software Development, outside of school work. No personal projects as of now. Also, the workload for school would not allow me to work anywhere, let alone an Internship. ***Would having a Degree but no Internship hurt me in the long run and make it more difficult to get an entry level role?***

On the other hand I could spread out the classes I have left to take, and **graduate sometime in 2022**. This would give me more time to work on personal projects and apply for Summer 2021 Internships, but prolonging my stay at school. Not sure if it's worth potentially wasting time at school, when I could have already been graduated and working. I've also heard that companies won't hire Seniors that are still in school, at that point they'd prefer candidates who have recently graduated.

I'm conflicted. For now, I've set course for graduating ASAP *just in case*, I've been registering for as many courses I can this school quarter.

Willing to listen to any advice, good or bad, or even criticism, I'm all ears. Thanks for reading, stay safe.

**TLDR: For someone looking to become a Software Developer, is it better to graduate early without an Internship or later with an Internship?**"
gnl3er,3,2020-05-20,"Work related stress causing significant anxiety, depression, and sleep deprivation",strong__throwaway,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/gnl3er/work_related_stress_causing_significant_anxiety/,"**TL;DR:** I have anxiety, depression with prior evidence before working at a corporate job, and the corporate job is kicking my anxious butt.  I've been thinking about getting a disability form, but I feel my condition is nothing to be considered to be a disability.  Is this common? Will I receive flak for submitting a form for less strenuous/stressful work?

Hi,

  
I work at a bank that permits working from home. When Covid 19 struck, I had intentions of being able to function from home as effectively as possible.  There were on an off days in which I would be able to function during the day and I began slumping and drifting my schedule later and later until my time would reset to 6 o clock in the morning and I would be finished by 3.  Even before the lockdown and shelter in place, I had already been having trouble with my new-manager because my former had taken a better job for his current situation (child, locality) and just being a new manager I felt threatened that he was someone that saw me as useless.  This was not reinforced until the day he began insulting my work experience and prior lack of knowledge of work flow. I was trained through an internship that taught us the basics of business communication, coding, and etiquette for young adults trying to abridge into the corporate world.

I never had the confidence to explain where my past is, because of my managers demeanor that causes me to step back and not want to explain why I'm like this because who would when they're faced with someone who questions their past year of what they've experienced.  I unfortunately lost my father as I transitioned from contractor to full time.(This was where my panic attacks started coming in)  I stupidly went in 2 weeks after and some guy working there uttered that someones father died which I didn't think much of it because I was numb, until further down the line I brushed it off as someone else and I felt compassion to feel bad for the person, but maybe they  were saying it to my face. 

I've had previous experiences and cases where I would have overblown anxiety and panic attacks and suicidal and depressive thoughts and I hate the fact I have to explain that I am more prone to stress inducing anxiety and panic attacks that trigger me to becoming unstable.

Recently, I volunteered for helping out with loans for the shelter in place caused a high rate of unemployment and people are coming to ask for our hand.  It's selfish if I would not do anything at this time of critical effort and I want to be able help in any way I can.  I put my best effort with the stress and anxiety breathing down beneath me.  When ever that occurs I have a massive feeling that I want to just lay on the floor in fetal position and just stay there until it subsides. 

I got rewarded for my efforts in volunteering, but when I read the reward my stomach turned and my gut wretched.  I didn't feel like I could accept a gift even when I volunteer because I dont feel like I deserve it.  Never would I not accept a gift especially from work.  But the constant thought of my manager breathing down my neck causes me to think fetal position on the floor I think its clear I have stress induced anxiety.  I have been trying to simplify why I'm feeling these forms of anxiety and the best reason I can come up with is my manager.

I explained to him, the manager above, and the managers, manager that my anxiety has quantifiably changed based on my sleep schedule.  With the amount of effort I put in, and the lowest amount of recognition for my work. I am stumped to see why my work is even worth putting in the effort other than simply bringing in the checks.  I stress over my manager 24 hours a day.  my sleep schedule has changed within a 2 year span (tracked on my iphone) from an average of 5-6 hours (functional) to naught .5 hours.

I'm beginning to research on how stress induced anxiety increases the rate of suicidal and depressive thoughts and its mind boggling how work ethics have become so stonefaced (maybe im overexaggerating) but I think theres a stigma for HR where they think that the small percentage of people who come in to discuss their private matters such as anxiety, depression, suicidal tendencies are similarly like the jet fighters who come back to the airfield from the war that shows bullet holes, but don't show the whole story of all those who don't make it back.  

I'm scared for my job.  I'm scared for my life. I can't sleep thinking that my life will end the second my job ends.

This is a throwaway so any responses, be prepared to wait."

Here’s What You Can Do,LRFE,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gnl9zt/rising_juniors_bored_at_home_heres_what_you_can_do/,"Yesterday, I made a similar post for juniors that seemed to be pretty well received. (You can find the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gmsh86/juniors_bored_at_home_heres_what_you_can_do/)). Some of you asked for a similar one for rising juniors, so I made one. It’s very similar to the one for juniors, with the exception that sophomores won’t be ramping up for college apps in the fall. 


**A disclaimer**: This post isn’t meant to make anyone feel guilty, but rather just help those that are feeling a little bored or lost. I spend plenty of time relaxing and recharging (especially since I’m a senior now), but I also do try to do some productive stuff throughout the day. 


&amp;nbsp;


**Start studying for standardized testing, especially the PSAT.**

Although colleges may place less emphasis on testing next year, I’d imagine once COVID-19 blows over that testing will regain its importance. I would start preparing for the PSAT (taken in October of your junior year). Qualifying for National Merit not only is a dope award (although lots of kids have that), but it even qualifies you for certain scholarships--a full ride (or almost) at UT Dallas, half tuition at USC, and many other merit scholarships. Or perhaps you just want to get your SAT or ACT over with. In any case, r/SAT &amp; r/ACT are great places to find advice or other free resources. You can also study for any SAT IIs whose content you just covered in class--take it in August when the content is still somewhat fresh.

&amp;nbsp;


**Spend all this free time that you have.**

One thing you can do is **find something you’re legitimately interested in, and pursue it**, even if it’s for an hour a day. I imagine you guys have a lot of free time. Personally, I’ve been improving my cooking &amp; baking (free time = lots of breadmaking), working out a lot, exploring my town through biking, and a little bit of Python coding. “Sure,” you say, “but that doesn’t even sound like an EC to me.” For what it’s worth, I literally put cooking as one of my ECs (I spent a decent amount of time on it last year), and was able to talk about it in a meaningful way. Plus, it’s an extremely valuable life skill.


Working out may not be an EC in and of itself, but you can certainly make it into one. I founded a fitness club at my school to coach other kids, and talked about that as an EC. “Well, I can’t do that now.” Obviously not, but I actually saw a reddit post on A2C asking if anyone wanted to get in shape and keep each other accountable. I asked OP if they wanted to make a groupme, and now we’re at 80+ members and counting. I’ve also helped set up a google classroom to keep group members accountable and to help coach others. That, combined with working out, can definitely be counted as an EC. (If any of y'all want the link, please chat/PM me).
 

There are certainly other things you can be doing. One of my friends was doing shopping with InstaCart (relatively safe, the only risk is when you go shopping, the delivery is contactless) and making $20/hr. The downside is that hours are not consistent. **Also, a part-time job is always an EC!** And if your parents feel safe with it, there are grocery stores and local businesses hiring. You can look on online job sites such as Indeed to find any openings. According to u/admissinomom,


&gt; An old-fashioned summer job will give you all sorts of skills you won’t gain by volunteering and also demonstrate leadership, diligence, a willingness to step outside your comfort zone. A summer job also shows determination and resiliency. Make some smoothies or scoop ice cream or fold sweaters. It really doesn’t matter what it is. Being responsible to a boss and customers for a paid job requires different skills than an unpaid internship.


Or maybe you’re interested in reading (if that’s fanfiction, I don’t judge and AOs will never know if you just list reading as an coronavirus activity), or writing, or drawing, or painting, or woodworking, or learning a language, or anything else you can think of. **The best thing to be doing is learning something that you’re interested in.** COVID-19 has given us a gift in the form of a shitton of free time to take a breath and slow down.


&amp;nbsp;


**Don’t stress about college admissions just yet.**

At the same time, it’s important to enjoy your summer. I’d try to limit my time on A2C (I was never on here as a sophomore, only browsed occasionally as a junior, and wasted too much time senior year). There’s a lot of useful stuff, but more often than not you’ll end up wasting more time than you use. If you’d like to stay in the loop about college admissions, I’d suggest reading admissions blogs: specifically, the blogs of MIT, Georgia Tech, and Tufts. They offer a lot of insight and a lot of good advice about admissions.


&amp;nbsp;


**TL;DR**: Study for standardized testing, pursue your interests, try to relax.

I worked hard and pushed myself to do well in every course I took. I contributed to team projects and even lead teams to meeting deadlines on assigned projects. Sadly, being a poor test taker hurt my GPA a bit and limited my opportunities at internships during my tenure as a student. I was able to land one early in my student career, but the experience doesn't appeal to most jobs I've applied to. I keep getting told I have good skills just lack experience in interviews. I'm taking jobs now I didn't really want to do but had no choice to make ends meet. I graduated a bit older than most students (29), and would've been earlier if my transfer credits from one college to another were accepted.

I've been working hard to get into projects again, but my job schedule is demanding and I find myself resting more on my off time. I'm working on pushing myself to get out of that. The most success I've found so far is working with friend from school on mock interviews. I'm hoping this will help. Here's my two questions about improving my career...
   
       1. Any tips on getting into the software field being a CS grad in this situation?
       2.  Say have skills in some particular areas you've known for many years (say 11 years for example), but never got a chance to get professional experience in them. Can you still count the time you've known said skills? One of example is 11 years of Java programming (academically and one competition event), but no professional experience.

No biggie right?  I modeled it up in Inventor and did some basic stress analysis on the static weight of the motor which made me modify the design but ultimately I finished the drawing package and it got sent to the fabricator.  No reviews with the other engineer (yes 1).  No reviews with management.  I basically designed this thing off a welders napkin sketch and everyone was like ""ok, sure. Lets order some metal.""

So, the crazy part is this was a 20,000 hp electric motor.  Giant beast that barely fit on the flatbed.  The diameter had to be around 5 ft so you can see how high the CoG would be.  Also, it had to be under a certain width to fit on the highway without wide load restrictions so you know how skinny this skid had to be.

I did zero analysis on acceleration loads, braking loads, side loads, tie down supports, crash safety, vibration etc.   I don't work in DOT so I'm sure there is a whole slew of things that have to be analyzed and approved.  My analysis was also as if this thing was made out of a piece of billet and nothing was welded.

I kind of forgot about the project but 2-3 years later I was in a different internship during my final semester (yeah, it took me 6 years...) working for the power company and we just happened to stumble across this thing in the yard at the steel mill.  I immediately came to the realization that this thing was woefully under-designed and asked if I could talk to the guy who was in charge of that if it was ever needed.  The guys I asked (mill guys) laughed it off and basically told me ""it got here didn't it"" so don't worry about it.

I even contacted my original internship and let my old manager know the situation but he said the company wouldn't touch it.  The product was already out of their hands.

Still haunts me to this day.  Imagine a 20,000 hp electric motor coming loose on the highway at 65 mph..."

LOR:
• My AP World and AP Euro teacher from sophomore year who has also been my coach for the UIL Social Studies Team. I was one of the few sophomores who took Euro. he always had a liking for me since then, and I did pretty well in both of his classes overall. He also has a huge reputation in both the school and the state in general as a very respected teacher when it comes to History.

• My Journalism/Newspaper/UIL journalism team teacher. She’s the best, and by the end of next year, I will have had her in a class for 3 years straight. She knows me very well, and has helped me improve mightily in my writing skills for journalism. 

• (possibly) my sophomore year English teacher. One of the kindest souls, she had a liking for me almost immediately because I did so much better than everyone else in my class when it came to writing essays, partly because I was one One of the few that cared. She gave me a handful of student achieving excellence awards through our online grade book, and even messaged my parents at the end of the year to tell them thank you for raising me. (I am considering her partly because she’s a UT alumni, if I’m being honest)



Besides UT Austin, I’ll apply to:

• TAMU (my sister just graduated from there, very familiar with the campus and I love the vibe in general)

• Baylor University 

These are my main targets ^

Very hard possible reaches:
• Vanderbilt
• Georgetown

I'd love to get a general consensus and hear how far along you guys were in the program when you secured your internships and which classes you would consider to be essential for a software engineering internship. 

Any tips and advice on internships or just in general are also much appreciated!"

How Do I Move Forward?,DIAMOND-D0G,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gnv5ji/having_career_regret_how_do_i_move_forward/,"My career trajectory has been a total mess so far. I graduated with an economics degree from a decent state school over a year late with abysmal grades and no internships. I actually never liked my major and I had no clue what I was going to do with it. In my junior year, I became interested in computer science, but doing poorly in school I lacked the confidence to switch and felt like I didn’t have enough time. In my senior year, I really started a panic about my future because of this so I kicked things into high gear. With an absolutely insane amount of work and networking and completely dumb luck I somehow managed to get a job as an investment banking analyst at small boutique investment bank located in the suburbs of a major US city. Around this time though, I had some personal issues start to bubble up which would only get worse over the next year or so. Regardless, I was excited to get to work and what could be a seemingly high end career. Well, it turned out that it was a complete dumpster fire. The place I got hired at was more or less a dysfunctional and amateurish boiler room type place, filled with office drama, and psychopath behavior. Here I was. I had moved to the suburbs hoping this would be the launch pad I needed and it ended up just being a spiral into something worse. I lasted about a year before I basically had a breakdown quit. With no prospects, I returned home to my rural little hometown feeling defeated and with no more interest at all for my field of choice or for ever returning to that industry. 

I was extremely depressed and tried a couple of really radical things that in retrospect were probably even dumber. None of them lasted for longer than a week but eventually, I got a low tier job working as a financial analyst at a university in a tiny college town near where I grew up for about half my original pay. The plan then was to just pull myself together and figure out what I want to do next. Fortunately, the university offers paid tuition so if I wanted a degree to help make a change, I could get one for free as long as I go part time. 

Well, nearly 2 years later I’m still here. I’ve succeeded in pulling myself together but still have no clue what to do besides still wanting to work in STEM, wanting to move to the city, and wanting to move abroad. I’m completely miserable here and I want out. I’m struggling with the fact that I have all these things I wanted to do before 30 (I’m 27) and I’ve achieved none of it despite working so hard. I never worked in STEM, moved to the city. I never moved abroad. I’m still working a low end job in a place I don’t want to be and I feel like the clock is ticking. I’ve started an undergraduate computer science degree part time but it’s almost impossible to get classes which fit my schedule and progress is slow. At this rate, if I wanted the degree I’d get it at nearly 30. 

I just feel like my trajectory has been an absolute mess and I’ve wasted so much time. I’ve built up no real career capital at all and I’m 27 years old. I don’t see how I can change into something else before I’m 30. Should I just cut my losses and go back into finance? Any advice?"

I need advice.,_octaneTwisted_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/gnwuff/i_cant_keep_up_with_learning_programming/,"Hello. I've been in comp eng for one year now, I'm about to turn 20. I have a hard time keeping up with self learning (I'm completely atrocious at this) because I want to get a job, I don't want to wait until I get to third year of comp eng in order to get an internship. Besides, you don't learn much at uni. 
I have a very complicated story with programming, I started learning Python at age 16 and been stuck with the basics since then. I'm tired of learning the basics over and over again. I'm learning Java because I want to get into app dev. Anytime I get into OOP (by myself, not at uni), I start losing my focus and have to start all over again. I'm tired of doing array exercises and the like (had a crazy amount of them at uni already). All of this proves that I'm really bad at self learning. I thought that it wouldn't be a problem because I learnt English and many other things on my own, but I'm specially bad at this, specifically. I love programming, but it's really weighing down on me. If I hated it, I wouldn't even be posting over here, so don't say this isn't my thing. I know I can fix this, though. 

I found some courses in my country that have teachers and stuff. I could try out some of them, but I don't think it's cool to pay for something that you can potentially learn on your own. 

Would paying for a personal teacher help me in any way? All I've been doing is follow books on my own, and as you should know now, none of them improved my skills. I'm not a lazy person, I've been studying for 6 hours every day since I was 16, so I'm not a procrastinator. 

I know I've been in a ""tutorial hell"" for years, I can't seem to apply the skills I know to programs of my own, maybe I'm not being 100% creative.

This feeling became so much more evident in the past year after meeting lots of people in college who came from different backgrounds (some seemingly better than mine, or more unique than mine), watching Youtube videos of beauty gurus and fashion gurus online, and going on social media and just stalking random strangers' posts b/c they're pretty or rich or whatever.

I feel like my life is, for a lack of better word, boring compared to everyone else. But I did almost everything right in my life (for me personally) -  I got good grades in school, I went to college, graduated college a year ago (I'm 23 now), got internships and a job, a fiance (my high school sweetheart), and have a house of our own (rented, of course - not bought).

If I had to sit down and think, I could point out all the things in my life that I should be grateful for, or are unique to me - for example, I'm a first generation college student. My parents are Vietnamese and Peruvian, so I grew up in a very mixed culture and traditional household. I have lots of brothers and sisters who are successful (who I also compare myself to).  I have a dog I've kept since high school that I love. I have a stable job. A roof over my head. I have a car. A good savings account.

But when I don't think about these things, I still feel unfulfilled and I keep comparing myself to people who might have it astronomically better. For example, here's my thought process: I see someone who's rich, and my thoughts instantly spiral to ""I want to be rich. I wish I was rich. I want to be them. I should start acting like them."" I envy them so much. But I'm not poor - though I feel like it compared to these people. But why am I complaining or being ungrateful? I have money in my bank account. My credit's good. My family's not poor. It could be worse. But nah, none of that matters, I still want to be them and I should start, or aspire to buy the things they buy, etc.

I see a pretty girl walk down the street and they're gorgeous. My mind goes, ""I wish I was that pretty. I wish I was them. I hate myself. I need to start doing what they're doing."" This also goes for people I watch on Youtube or whoever I see on social media randomly on my explore page. I love their videos but I just can't stop watching because it's fun and inspiring - and at the same time, self-deprecating because I wish I had this or that, like them. Overall I can't help but almost be inspired by them, but in a negative way (if that makes sense) - where it just makes me want to be more like them, but I don't even know them!

Why can't I just be happy with myself? How can I just not give a shit about what other people do, and just do my own thing, instead of obsessively wishing I was someone else, or trying to imitate someone else's life? How can I be okay with just me, or practice being more grateful for what I have? I'm sure I have a lot to be thankful for - but when I think about those things, I still don't feel great about it. I don't feel like my life is all that great or exciting. How do I get out of this rut that I've been feeling for the past year, and really just take everything in for myself?"

\-

Their voice kept getting louder, vocalizing screeching and singing at once. It was horrible. Horrible, terrible sounds pierced through my very soul and tear my neurons apart. I could just feel the wave of sounds trying to devour me. Eat me until there's just bones and blood left. The Sirens’ singing didn’t stop. My screams died when a cough came out and my legs gave up.

Small sand grains felt wet, rough, and sticky against my legs from how much they absorbed the red ink. The inks started to pool around and surround me, and I could barely see Smarty laid on the sand, still typing and making inks flood.

Another uneasy sound startled me. The other intern's scream. As the Sirens' scaly lower limb slithered towards him, it only got louder. The Sirens spread seven pairs of wings, surrounding the intern as he continued to cry out, and the sound of tearing flesh was heard.

&amp;#x200B;

*No, no, no-* Uneasy breathing leads to a panic attack. Every single pulse in my body went wild. Visions started to blur from tears, and I couldn't think coherently.  *Red, red, so much red-* where did it even come from? A tang of iron scent spread in the air as I felt my vomits coming up until my neck.

That was a smell of blood. Smarty's ink never smelt like iron. It never had a smell. That’s why the blood-like ink color never bothered me this much. This ink pooling around me was not blood. But *that,* that crimson flow was blood. That leads me to only one possible scenario I could think of.

The Sirens were trying to eat that intern. No, they're *eating* him. From the legends, all Sirens ate humans. Heck, they even sang to prey on humans. I desperately wanted to run, but the fear kept my legs to stay where they were and blinded my vision. I should’ve done something, something to help him but my body didn’t move. It refused to move. All my senses were taking too much information at once and my brain couldn't stand it. I couldn't stand it.

&amp;#x200B;

“Alright- y’all calm the fuck down or I’ll throw this whole room into the incinerator. Wait, would you like that instead? Please say you would, it'd make my job tad-fucking-easier.”

Irritated and sardonic words were spoken as another sound- a clear, transparent whistling sound cut through the shelter room. It sounded something similar to a bird's chirp but more fragile. Almost like a warning of a mockingbird, but soft and smooth.

With their arrival, the Sirens, all of them, immediately stopped what they were doing. Now they were the ones frozen in their spot as uneasiness loomed in the atmosphere. Half of them had blood dripping from their mouth, hand, and hair as we all looked at the sudden intruder. 

Through the rapid blinking to gain clear sight, I saw a very tall person dressed in a white suit, covering their face with a black veil walked inside. A bright light shone behind them as glass pieces floated - why did it float?

&amp;#x200B;

“Enough, Cullet.” With a snap of a finger, all the Sirens made sharp screech and hastily splashed back to the water. The scattered drag of blood and flesh was evident on the sandy shore as they returned to where they belong, and this revealed the intern that brought Smarty in here.

His left arm's flesh was half gone, broken neck barely connected head and body, and a chunk of his thigh was ripped, bleeding everywhere as he barely managed to breathe.

I can't even say that it was a horrible sight. It was just straight up *unbearable*.

&amp;#x200B;

The stranger walked up to the intern but sighed instead of helping him right away. They kicked him on the waist and made a disapproving sound.

“See, this is why I hate stupid, oblivious humans under my watch. No value as meat sack nor chaff, causing problems and not even solving them. Bloody hell, what *use* do you have like this?"" With a strong grip, they then grabbed and pulled the intern's hair. The intern made a painful whine as he gurgled up more blood from his mouth.

“Quit bitching. You violated Rule #34 of NOQ-12 branch, *caretakers will never bring a creature to another creature's shelter unless we have the right instructions, special forces, and documented records to keep them safe even during experiments*, and will be punished accordingly. Why do I have to repeat this all over? Do you humans never learn?” With a scoff, they suddenly diverted their attention to me. The eye symbol drawn on their face made me uneasy with sudden pressure.

""And for you-"" She pointed a finger at me and tried to say something, but the inks suddenly shot up and created a red liquid wall between me and the stranger. Though the opaque ink wall, the stranger's finger slightly twitched.

“You *seriously* want to keep that one alive? Whatever, fine with me. You, stand up, get 0212 to its shelter, care for it, and go wash. You two look filthy.”

With a grumble, the tall stranger just dragged the intern out of the door, gone as quickly as they came.

&amp;#x200B;

I stayed where I was for few more minutes. Everything happened so fast. The lake's water surface stayed still. No more laughter or scream was heard but the sound of sands moving along with my footstep as I gained strength and stood up slowly. I picked my lab coat and Smarty up and went out of the shelter room's iron door. The lock automatically activated as I closed the door, and I made my way back to Smarty's shelter room. Some caretakers in the hall glanced at me but continued with whatever they were doing. No one bothered to care for us, covered in red, and looking out of mind. At least, that's what I imagined I look like.

Smarty's shelter room's door lock opened when I walked in front of it, and I opened the door slowly. The study's fire was still burning, but documents were nowhere to be found.

""That fucking- Damn it, I forgot to bring it back from that intern."" I cursed as I placed Smarty on the coffee table, trying to whip sands off of his inky body and keyboard with my coat. After five minutes, most of the sands got off, and I changed Smarty's wet, crimson paper to a new one.

&amp;#x200B;

It was just a simple cleaning, but every part of my body and soul was worn out. Exhaustion overwhelmed me as I slowly leaned onto the sofa, trying to keep my eyes open. I tried to stand up and go wash in the shower room, but a calm, clicking sound was heard.

*""You're tired, R. Anyone will be after that mess. Stay in here and rest, it's safe now.""*

Smarty wrote the letters. ""Just... few minutes then..."" I never finished the sentence. My eyes become heavy as Smarty made more calm and distant sounds of keyboards clicking. It lured me to sleep, but right before I fell to slumber, I saw another sentence written on Smarty's paper.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Red has always looked good on you, dear R. I'm glad it still does.”*"

go2n15,1,2020-05-21,"PLEASE HELP ME, I'M LOST! (robotics engineering)",rygex,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/go2n15/please_help_me_im_lost_robotics_engineering/,"Hey guys, I've always lurked around reddit without making an account since I've never seen the need to make one until I found this awesome subreddit, which I found at the exact perfect time in my life. I am currently starting my first internship and I desperately need your help.

Three semesters in and I have discovered what the main difference between  bachelor of science and bachelor of engineering tech and I feel like I have been misled this whole time. It wasn't after my first semester that I found out my degree was a bet and not bes. (silly I i know) but instructors left and right had always assured me of the type of work I would be going into. However, I start my first internship and ""engineering tech"" is DEFINITELY NOT what I want to do in life.

The worst part is that I love my coursework. Currently I'm working on a Robotics communication systems engineering technology bachelors. To put it simply, 1/3 of the program is electric theory, HF/RF, analog and digital... etc, 1/3 is programming and microcontrollers and 1/3 is marrying the two. With, of course, some other stuff in between. We go into much deeper theory topics than an average technician course ever would but not as deep into it as electronic engineers would. (although from what I've seen so far, it seems like electronic engineers are more industrial oriented) And call me crazy, but I love sitting at a desk designing calculating, and programming or sitting at a bench setting up my breadboard, building amplifiers, logic circuits, or just testing circuits. I could do either one all day long. 

My problem is that my internship is an engineering technician internship and it does not feel stem related at all. I love stem. This doesn't feel like stem. Tightening bolts, using drills, and plugging in wires for test equipment doesn't feel like stem to me. It feels like every other warehouse job I've worked at in order to be able to afford school so that I never have to work in that environment ever again. I feel like I'm a disposable worker that has to be on their feet all day working in labor. Working with hazardous, volatile materials and guys that call you a ""pussy"" for wearing the correct safety gear makes me feel expendable. At the very least I was expecting to work on fixing some type of circuit problem or at least using a multimeter. 

Don't get me wrong, I am ever appreciative of this opportunity and the pay isn't phenomenal but it will definitely help pay my next semester off. But this is not for me. I don't mean to sound like a pompous asshole but I feel extremely over qualified for this line of work. This type of work applies more to someone with an instrumentation degree. Which I guess makes me feel under qualified? Given that we have never worked with guages, test equipment and plc ladder logic. Under qualified or over qualified, you decide. Either way, theres no problem with an instrumentation degree but this stuff is simply not for me. I want something a little less physical and a little more mathy.

These aren't my people. The guys around me are your typical hot headed ""know-it-all"" welder types that  who, quite frankly, mostly tend to be assholes. And honestly, it's really killing my morale and attitude being around these guys. I'm getting a sense of dread knowing that this might be what my degree accumulates to and I'm kinda freaking out about it.

Again don't get me wrong, I appreciate everyones position and what they're there to do but I know what I want to do, and I know it's not this. Everything I read points to me needing to switch over to a bachelor of science degree but I don't know which exactly to switch over to.

The bad new is I love my coursework and I'm already 25 years old. I'm a bit of a late bloomer. I dealt with a lot of personal issues and depression when I was younger, that really took up a lot of my time and now I'm scared that it might be too late for me (in relative terms) to even think about switching degrees.

Our program is well known for being intensive and delving deep into theory topics. I just don't know why, then, the end goal is to work a job like this!

 Every intern I read about in their intranets homepage that is working on things that i find interesting is studying for something like a bachelors in electronics engineering or computer science. My penultimate goal is to work somewhere like Boston dynamics designing and working on projects like the quadruped or bipedal robots and my ultimate goal is working in the biomechanical engineering/bionics field involving cybernetic prosthetics and hopefully some AI design. I'm unsure of what route I need to take. In the long run, I know I'll need some biomedical and bionics related degrees under my belt but for the short term, I guess I'm kinda lost now and don't know where to start to get my career going. I'd like to finish my course as it covers a lot of useful stuff both hands on and theory. The programming courses in it really aren't super intensive but we learn a lot of VB, LabVIEW, and a tiny amount of embedded C. However, I know this course is meant to cover a broad range of topics in a short amount of time and therefore we don't delve into topics as deep as I'd like to. I've read computer engineering is where I want to start but the more and more I read, the less sure I am of the course of action I need to take. Computer science? Computer engineering? Which one should I look at? 

I know financial aid only covers up to your first bachelors degree so I don't think I want to use it on a bet degree. I just don't know what school to look at, what program, where to start? Sorry if I'm a little sporadic and all over the place, I'm just kinda freaking out and any direction from experienced engineers would help a whole hell of a lot. I would ask some of my instructors but I can't really get a hold of them during the summer and a lot of them scoff at bachelor of science degrees. Let me know if you have any questions for me. Thanks in advance. 



Tl:dr, (you should probably read my novel above to get a better understanding of my situation. There's a lot) I got an internship and just found out my program is an engineering technology bachelors degree and I'm worried it's not enough. Engineering TECHNICIANS seem to do all the dirty work (at least here) and I would like to work in design. 
I've only spent three semesters but a lot of money and I'm unsure if I should continue. I'm interested in biomechanical engineering, bionics, mechatronics, electrical engineering and heavy programming. I don't know exactly what to change my major to but I now know it needs to be a bachelor of science."
go38os,249,2020-05-21,2.6 GPA Job Search Results - Civil Engineering,whatsagirltodo123,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/go38os/26_gpa_job_search_results_civil_engineering/,"My husband just completed his job search for a civil engineering job, so I thought I’d pass along some statistics and some insights on what worked for him. He was really concerned about his job prospects due to not applying himself in college, but he’s really happy with how it turned out. We consulted with reddit a lot for advice from people with similar experiences, so we thought we’d pass along his experience to maybe be helpful to others in the same boat. 

A little background on him:
- He graduated from Texas A&amp;M, which is a top 20 school in terms of engineering programs. He thinks this helped distinguish him a bit in his search.
- He did have a summer internship at a small environmental consulting firm the summer before his senior year of college. He got it through a family member. He did some work pertaining to engineering while working there, so we were able to craft his experience accordingly for his resume. 
- He actually graduated in August of 2018. For the past two years, he has been teaching math in a Title I school. He was recruited for Teach for America our senior year of college, but couldn’t do the program because of his graduation time. (Who’s to say if he would have actually gotten the TFA gig, but it helped form a story that made sense in his interviews when making the career switch.) He ended up pursuing the opportunity on his own because he was interested in the field and experience and because at the time, he wasn’t too confident in how much he enjoyed engineering. Being two years out of school may have made his GPA less relevant, so we wanted to note this. Teaching for two years also may have at least raised some eyebrows and gotten some initial interest because it was different. 
- likely goes without saying, but he did not include his GPA on his resume. However, he did have one semester that he got Dean’s List, so he did have this written on his resume. 

Job search stats:
- he applied to 45 jobs: these applications were a mix of job board submissions as well as just sending his resume to emails on websites 
- he heard back from 8 companies (18%)
- formally interviewed with 5 companies
- he had interviews set up with the other 3 companies but they were about a month delayed due to COVID, so he didn’t end up going through with them because he decided to go ahead and accept an offer
- he received job offers from 4 of the 5 companies he formally interviewed with
- the company he did not receive an offer from was 1 of 2 companies who asked for his GPA in the interview. They explicitly said they decided not to move forward with him because of his GPA, but the other one still offered him a job even knowing his GPA so must not always be a dealbreaker
- 6 of the companies he was offered an interview with (75%) were companies he “applied to” by sending his resume to an email listed on their website aka no filtering softwares being applied to his resume
- the offer he accepted was with a small company, but was a really good offer. On par with entry level positions at bigger companies in terms of salary and even a significant signing bonus. Standard office engineering job with normal hours (not technician work). And work that interests him!

Job search tips - what worked best for him:
- after a couple days of applying on job boards, we weren’t confident with how good of a response rate he’d be getting from those. So I started just googling “civil engineering firms near me” or “environmental engineering firms near me” and going through 10+ google pages of company websites to find emails he could send his resume to. This was by FAR the best approach and the tip I’d give to anybody with a low GPA trying to find a job. He had a great response rate doing this, and these smaller companies also never asked for his GPA.
- after sending an initial email, always follow up a week or two later. I know this just sounds like something we’re told to do that doesn’t matter, but the company he just accepted a job with is actually a company he followed up with after not hearing back initially. 
- when emailing a company, put together a thoughtful email. My husband always pointed out a project that interested him from their website and gave some background about him to connect the dots about why he would be a good addition the company. I think putting a little more effort into the email distinguished him from the usual “please find my resume attached.” application. 
- tailor your resume for every single job application! To the extent that you can without flat out lying, make sure each resume aligns with the position / company you’re applying for 
- he included that he was scheduled to take the FE in July and always made sure to emphasize that he was confident he’d pass. Employers seemed to really appreciate he was already scheduled to take it. 

I hope this is useful to some of you guys! I know it is a stressful position to be in, but clearly, GPA is not the end all be all, especially not with smaller firms. Don’t be too picky and apply to everything - something will work out! Let us know if you have any questions about his search, he’s happy to provide any advice he can."

I am an opinionated first year college student from India and am pursuing my bachelor's in Political Science. I have a lot of interest in Geopolitics, Globalization and Supranational Organizations and intend to work in that field. As of yet I have no idea where to go about from here. 

I can speak two languages (English and my native tongue) and am learning German. I also intend to add up another language or two (preferably French/Russia/Mandarin or Arabic). I am also learning some coding. I am quite active in my University student life in organizing events, attending seminars on international relations and joining clubs. 

My current priority is to serve in an international organization (Like UN) or foreign services. However these two are very competitive and I'd like to have a backup plan. I was wondering what should I pursue for my Master's (the only one I currently have on the list is international relations.) I also don't know what are the jobs associated with that degree. There are way too many different job titles so naturally it's a little confusing to me.

Lastly I have as of yet got no internship experience (my first year has just come to an end and well I am unable to apply for them due to the lockdown) but I intend to work on that after this lockdown is over. 

I'd appreciate all sorts of help/advice/constructive criticism from this community and would love to have a chat with someone (if possible) who is doing quite well in the field.

Thank you

I was wondering if it was a smart decision to go to Michigan state for a computer science degree and go into a lot of debt as well? It'll be around 60k ish but that's a really rough estimate. The have a good program and I've heard the opportunities are pretty good there along with a lot of positive things in general about the school. 

And then there's Wayne state, everything about them is mediocre when it comes to computer science from what I've heard but I'd love to be wrong. The only upside is that it'll be really cheap and I basically wont be in debt after I leave. 

I don't know if the opportunities like better program and internships would justify going into debt and work out at the end and i was wondering if anyone else was in this sort of situation in past years or even now."

So if you can bear with me, I would really appreciate any help I could get. 

Just to start off, I’m going to list all my ecs here:


Debate: Doing well on my local circuit and moving to the national circuit next year 

Speech- Qualified to state in two speech events

MUN- First place at PACMUN, large national conference on the west coast

City Youth Council - I’m the secretary in a youth council of a relatively large city. There are around 90+ people in the council and we have support from our city government

Co-founder and co-president of an organization that writes and passes bill in state congress: We also do voter registration and phone banking as volunteer work. 

State Youth Court - I am a member of my county’s youth court system and am often a representative for youth who come to court

Writing: I write mostly for fun and occasionally submit my writing for contests. I qualified to state in literature in the PTA reflections contest.

Piano: I’ve been playing piano for 7+ years and have been part of my school’s pit orchestra. I am working towards getting an ABRSM 8 certification and competing internationally.

Internship at the Mayor’s office: I just started this but pretty much I’m doing outreach work and running/beginning community service projects. 

Things I do for fun:
Teaching book club: I run a book club for 10 or so elementary school kids and have been for three years now

Volunteer: I’ve logged around 100 hours so far through working at food banks and organizing different events. 

Starting next year: DECA (an individual event, most likely not a writing event), joining my state’s youth council, being a state senate or house page.


So pretty much this year, I’ve been working on extracurricular and when I asked for advice a couple months ago, I just got told that I am “off to a good start.”

So my questions:
1) At this point with my ECs, what should I do to make them better and more solid? 
2) Am I doing too much to actually have some sort of profile? 
3) What seems to be my strongest and weakest ec?
4) What would you recommend to manage stress with school work and outside of school work?
5) When should I finish the SAT by?
6) How do you get internships?
7) Any other advice or critiques to offer?

Thanks so so much to anyone who read through this and even better, can give me advice."

go9848,1,2020-05-21,Highschool CS Internship,MeekZeek,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/go9848/highschool_cs_internship/,"I'm currently a sophomore near a major city (NYC). I'm currently learning data structures and algorithms in Python along with doing some leetcode, and I already have a portfolio with projects along with a resume and GitHub. My grades are also good and I have a slew of clubs if any employer cares about that stuff. I still need to create a couple more projects that are actually decent and polish up some stuff along with doing more DS/A, but I feel I'm gonna be ready to be applying for internship positions for summer 2021 soon, (I want to spend this summer studying for some tests, learning more DS/A and creating projects that are actually a least a little impressive).

What should I do to try and get internships as a high school student? I look on [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) for inspiration but everything I see has a requirement that you have to be in college pursuing a CS degree. I've thought about reaching out personally to start-ups, which may work. I've also thought about prestigious free summer programs like the ones Google has, but I'm not a genius and I don't want to bet my whole summer on getting in when my chances are slim. Is there anything I'm missing? Also, what time would I apply for a summer 2021 internship?"
go9d1v,245,2020-05-21,Students are so fucking entitled,obvthrowaway1288,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/go9d1v/students_are_so_fucking_entitled/,"I want to preface this by saying I am in no way minimizing what students and people all over the world are going through due to the pandemic. Before people make assumptions about me and my privilege, I am a low-income minority student whose family has been affected by COVID-19. I even lost a paid internship this summer due to the pandemic. Times are rough, this crisis is unprecedented...

But I honestly am fucking appalled by some of the demands made by students during this pandemic,  and honestly I feel like some people are just using it to try to manipulate faculty (not all, but **some**).

Firstly, the fact that there was even a demand made by students to adopt a double A grading system was fucking absurd. NO ONE is entitled to an A, and the sad truth is at any point in our lives, throughout any crisis, people (particularly employers and those who rely on us) will expect us to be productive. Not knowing material enough to pass will work at your disadvantage. Not only that, but persevering through any crisis is not easy, but it is the only option people often have at any point in their life. You do not get accommodations or automatic As in the real world! And you shouldn't be encouraged to try less hard because there's a safety net. It's not fair but it's true. Outside of this pandemic, if you are going through something (say you have mental health issues, or your parent dies not related to COVID-19), that shit sucks but there is still an expectation to work hard and, hopefully, still be able to produce the results you want. If everyone gets an A, that shit is meaningless. throughout all of the difficulties I've faced in my own life, I've never wanted or expected my teachers to reward me with an A simply because I had to go to McDonalds to use the internet, or had a shit computer. If I didn't know the material, I didn't know it! It's unfair but true.

**I found it absolutely ridiculous that a group of students let alone the SGA supported that policy. Students work hard for their As, I know many other students including myself who had to really push through to earn their As, and it would be just a slap in the face if someone got an A- or A without putting any effort.**

Please don't conflate this with me saying there should be no understanding or accomodations for students who may have lost parents due to COVID-19 or really cannot be successful this semester. I think a more realistic option would have been allowing those students to withdraw if they could not pass without incurring debt, maybe changing the letter grade system in each class, allowing more students to receive incompletes, extensions, etc. I think employers and grad schools will remember this as an unprecedented time. But the idea that **all** students should be entitled to an A because **some** may be seriously struggling is ridiculous.

I know people who applied for emergency funds and got them when their parents weren't laid off, they weren't laid off or struggling with finances, and they just did it because ""they could"" or ""its their last semester anyways."" I know people who were so glad to have a P/F semester, who still tried using the pandemic as an excuse for late work to their professors when the real reason was that they were drinking with their friends. And honestly, when I see students complain now about how umd extended the deadline to change to P/F or letter grades (yes it should have been earlier) too late for them because they didn't ""try hard enough"" on their finals and would have if they knew they had more time... do they not hear themselves?

My god it's so fucking annoying.

gobksv,3,2020-05-21,Internship changed role last minute,BraveLittleLinda,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gobksv/internship_changed_role_last_minute/,"First off, a little background. I go to a well known state school for information sciences. What I love about my degree is how many credits I get to choose for a specialty and what they call a support option (with electives its over a third of my total credits). After a few prescribed courses like an intro to major course, database design, networking, an IT business course, math courses like discrete/calc, some writing courses, and two basic programming courses I'm largely able to decide what I want to do with the rest of my degree other than gen eds.

I've really started to take to programming and software development so I have chosen to pursue software development with the large amount of wiggle room my degree gives me. I may not be a traditional CS student but I personally know two graduates with my same degree specialty that have gone into software development roles with great starting offers so I'm confident I will be able to gain the needed experience with this degree and a good internship or two.

Earlier this year I was very excited to receive an offer to intern for a software development company that works on government contracts for the upcoming summer. I was assigned to work closely with two of their developers on one of these contracts when the current COVID crisis hit. Since then the company has gone remote and will be hosting their internship program online. As far as I understand, I drew the shortest straw out of all the other interns and I've been pulled off the project I was on and put into the IT department under a system admin where I will help them with IT support and migrating some of their systems online (the other interns are still where they were before).

Now don't get me wrong, I'm very grateful to still even have an internship experience this summer but I do not have the slightest interest in becoming a systems admin or doing IT support in the future. Nor do I know much about any of this at all. I felt very prepared to be a software development intern but not this. I also feel as though they only chose me for this because my degree says information sciences even though I have done very little coursework relevant to this new role. Can anybody offer me any advice? How do I make the best of this situation?"

I am a beginner-ish in the data science industry; I have a master's in computer science, I completed a six month data science bootcamp, did several DS projects on my own, some Kaggle competitions, completed a four month internship at Fellowship.ai and worked as a ML engineer for two months building a recommendation system for a jewelry company. I decided to leave my job after I had a major disagreement with my former manager, and i thought I'd land another job easily but I didn't. I almost got into an AI Residency program but failed in the last round, and then Covid19 arrived and everything collapsed. Now, I don't know what to do next. Should I go for a PhD, should I wait and apply next year for another Residency, should I keep applying for jobs (I apply for 4-7 jobs a week and nothing so far) or is there something else that I'm totally missing? Everything is an option now. But I think I'm stagnating and not moving forward. As I said in the beginning, I don't know what to do."

UCSD is also 100% free for me since I'm 24 (Blue and Gold Opportunity Program).

UCSD pros:

* Free tuition
* Great computer science program
* Know where to live and can prob avoid buying a parking pass lol

Cons:

* They're making me repeat my CIS courses (won't transfer them from my cc)
* I'm looking at 2.5 to 3 years. Most transfers I spoke to said they still had 3 years after they transferred ):
* They're only covering tuition, no additional grants for living expenses

USC pros:

* It's USC lol
* Viterbi is a great engineering school
* They'll take 100% of my cc courses, most likely graduate in 2 years

Cons:

* I literally can't afford it, nor afford moving up there
* I'll be graduating with sososo much debt

In the end I know both schools would be great and I'll be able to get internships and find connections and do hackathons and all that fun fun stuff. I'm hoping to hear from people who transferred to these schools and let me know how long it took for them to graduate! Thank you!"

In the four years of engineering, I could get a good grasp on the theoretical concepts of computer science. I really enjoyed learning about OS and Databases etc. But I haven't really done any good programming, all the projects that I did were mostly a rip off.. taking code from various websites and tweaking them to get things done. So I feel that I don't have any real skills with which I can even get an internship. The existential crisis happened when I was going through linkedin and I saw dozens of people having internships and work exp and a lot of credibility.  I had applied for a masters degree in the US and got admits from Good universities and I was supposed to study on campus from this fall i.e The fall of 2020.  But due to the corona thing it has probably been delayed. So I started solving problems on hackerrank and I've got a 4 stars. But  I have 0 confidence that I'll ever be able to get an internship. I am scared about what will happen when I join grad school, will I be able to cope up with the pace etc. Will get my skills upto date and get an internship there.  Its soo bad that I just get paralysed by the thought of it.  Being a good programmer, being able to solve problems is what I really want to do. Be good at this skill, but now I think Its too late and I've wasted a lot of time and Everybody is ahead of me. I am on the bottom of the food chain.

If someone gives me advice, I think that this person already is ahead of me and how will I ever be able to be soo good at this. And I just get depressed an disturbed about it.  I wanna be successful and good and get a good internship, good job.

I am also doing a python course on udemy and it has 2 big projects one where we have to make a black jack game and I have no clue how to start with the game and that makes me miserable. Like there is an internal fight going on..

I wish it wouldn't be this hard, and I could feel good about myself, that I also can do this and make it big.

Please shower your advice so that I can change my perspective and get better at this."

It works perfect with my school schedule but some of the work gets repetitive, and I just entered my senior year of college and wanted to get out of my warehouse and transfer to another. I found a new location opening near my parents (hour from my apartment by uni), and applied, interviewed, and got the offer for Mechatronics and Robotics Apprentice.

The job description looks, and sounds amazing. Plus amazon would be paying to fly (and for my living costs) to Texas or Indiana for the classroom type training for 3 months, then back to the new facility to shadow one of the techs for the hands on portion for up to 12 months.

Now the one problem with this is, that it would be full time 40 hours a week, and it looks like it’ll be Monday-Friday, and I don’t know if they will be able to adjust for me going to school.

I’m in the first week of 2 online summer classes now, and originally planned on 15 credits during fall. If I were to pursue this apprenticeship further, I think I’d have to take a break from school... 

Being close-ish, about 36 credits, from graduating, I’m not sure if this is a good option. Yeah I’d gain a lot of experience on the technical side, but would be pushing my degree back a lot, plus my scholarship only pays up until middle of 2022. Also idk if this experience would add enough to my toolbox to qualify me for much higher positions as a new grade when I finally graduate. But I’d be living with my parents, so that’s a plus I guess? Lol

I don’t know if I’d be able to handle 40 hours a week working plus school full time in my heavy classes... I did it last semester with an internship and Amazon it but was tough.


TLDR; 
Received Mechatronics and Robotics apprentice position, would need to take a break from school for a bit. In my senior year. 
 What are everyone’s opinions on this and how I should proceed?"

I'm a Computer Science student who has taken a few programming courses, and will be a Uni freshman Fall of 2020. 

I wanted to intern at a few companies looking for student interns, but I am literally terrified. 

I have a good advantage for nailing these positions because my highschool is a engineering based school. I've taken a decent amount of beginner CS courses, and these companies always keep an eye on our school for new interns. The only problem is I don't know if I can do it. Interning sounds terrifying, let alone fully working in the CS/IT world. I'm just afraid that my course work was so basic, and I'll get there and not know how to do a single thing. There's just so much to learn, and I want to intern for the experience to jump start my career and see what the workplace is like. I think what makes me kind of worried is I'm not like this. I'm pretty out there and always willing to learn, but I guess cs is my weak spot and I just feel like I'd never be prepared to work in any position in relation to the field.

I know a lot of 2-in-1s suck at note taking, so I need feedback who's used them. I'll basically just use it for cs school work/ internships/ projects, taking notes, and watching stuff on Netflix lmao. 

So what laptop would you recommend that in your opinion is good enough to last 4 years of Cs and can be carried everyday/ used to take notes?

Also, does anyone have experience with an AMD processor? Are laptops with AMD instead of Intel good enough for Cs?

The announcement led to many cheers from workers but the details are leaking out, and they aren't pretty.

This will let the company cut salaries, office rent and benefits (free meals, massages, etc.). It's also likely that Facebook won't be the only company to do/try this so make sure you read the fine print if you're offered the opportunity to work from home long-term. 

 [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tech/with-remote-work-plan-facebook-dashes-hopes-of-paycheck-arbitrage-idUSKBN22Y1IA](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-tech/with-remote-work-plan-facebook-dashes-hopes-of-paycheck-arbitrage-idUSKBN22Y1IA) 

&gt; SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With Facebook’s adoption of permanent remote work on Thursday, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has untethered one of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies from the place that incubated it.    
&gt;  
&gt;But he also dashed a Silicon Valley dream: that tech workers would be able to take their generous salaries with them as they flee the Bay Area’s crushing housing costs, dirty sidewalks and crowded roadways.  
&gt;  
&gt;As lockdowns dragged into their third month, message boards popular with well-paid tech workers have lit up with fantasies of working long-term from tropical beaches and spacious houses in affordable small towns in the Midwest.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Does that mean I could apply for a job in Silicon Valley and work remotely from, say, the Caribbean? Asking for a friend,” wrote one user on Blind, an app designed to let workers swap information anonymously.  
&gt;  
&gt;Afraid not, Zuckerberg said, addressing employees in a publicly broadcast livestream on his Facebook page.  
&gt;  
&gt;The company, one of Silicon Valley’s biggest employers, is giving U.S. staffers who are approved to work remotely until Jan. 1, 2021 to update the company on where they plan to base themselves, at which point their salaries will be adjusted to reflect the local cost of living.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zuckerberg said he expects half of Facebook’s workforce to take him up on the offer over the next five to 10 years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Employees who attempt to wiggle around those compensation adjustments will be subject to “severe ramifications,” he said, as the company needs to account for employee locations to avoid violating tax laws.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zuckerberg said Facebook will monitor adherence by checking where employees access its VPN. Facebook also uses its own apps' to track employee locations, according to CNBC [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/facebooks-security-team-tracks-posts-location-for-bolo-threat-list.html,) one time using the data to find interns who failed to show up for work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even as many tech workers dream of a future in low-tax states, others on message boards fret about how the shift to remote work could exert downward pressure on salaries across the board and warn that being far from headquarters could steepen the climb up the corporate ladder.  
&gt;  
&gt;One former Facebook employee, who in his 20s lived in Silicon Valley’s suburbs for the short commute, said the change would open up opportunities even for employees who stay in California.  
&gt;  
&gt;“A 25-year-old maybe would rather be in San Francisco, while someone looking to raise a family might prefer to move outside the city,” he said.  
&gt;  
&gt;A Facebook spokesman said the company was not planning layoffs, compulsory moves or salary adjustments for employees who opt to stay in the Bay Area.  
&gt;  
&gt;FILE PHOTO: A Facebook logo is displayed on a smartphone in this illustration taken January 6, 2020. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo  
&gt;  
&gt;If the experiment is successful, Facebook’s move could prompt other tech giants to compete for engineering talent by embracing remote work - and other states to compete for Californians.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The warm, sunny states with affordable housing and zero taxes will see an influx of educated, rich workers. States will need to cut taxes to keep up,” Chamath Palihapitiya, the chief executive of venture capital firm Social Capital and an early executive at Facebook, said on Twitter.  
&gt;  
&gt;The biggest loser, he predicted, would be California."

In the last two years of my undergrad, I mostly pivoted to machine learning and other CS stuff. I also did more math than what my major required. I even have some data science and NLP projects under my belt. All these I did because I wanted to go into a more quant/computation heavy career in finance.

Several banks stopped hiring. Some startups closed or went to 'hibernation'. Since this pandemic basically knocked out my chances at my target jobs, I have no choice but to accept the equity research job offer from my former boss at my previous internship. I felt like it'd be arrogant for me to turn down a job when it's already being given to me especially in these times. 

My question now is, what kinds of tasks in equity research would require computational stuff? I'm thinking of building automated tools to scour the net for news articles, sentiments and such, and maybe use more Python than Excel in handling data. Would any of the skills I invested in be of any use in equity research? 

Maybe I should also point out that the finance industry in my country is slow at adapting to technology. Even I can't create my algotrading bots as there aren't actually any broker APIs I can use. That's why I'm clueless on the actual applications of tech in equity research. 

I would appreciate any input. Thanks!

I apologize if this has been asked before but after stalking a wide number of threads I couldn't find the information I was looking for. 

I am a 3rd year undergraduate student completing an Honours in Conservation Biology at a Canadian University. Since opportunities for a lot of jobs I was interested in have disappeared, I am taking this summer to learn R and GIS skills, essentially treating it like a job and spending \~6 hours a day working on it. This is sometimes challenging due to the unstructured nature of the internet- there's so much out there! 

So far I have been mostly focusing on R, and I have learned some basic Habitat suitability analysis, occurrence/species density analysis, movement data, etc, as well as just basic R syntax (I had only learned a little bit of R beforehand). I recently downloaded QGIS and am trying to access ArcGIS Pro, although that is turning out to be difficult. I intend to try and find some opensource data and continue to explore it in R and produce some analyses I could present to future employers.

I will also be taking a Python course during my next winter term at university and may undertake some learning this summer; I see many people recommend learning Python alongside GIS. 

With regards to QGIS and R, however, I wanted to know what types of skills/ analyses I should focus on developing? I intend to work in the fields of Conservation / Environmental work (not 100% sure exactly what yet, but that's where my interest lies) and I would like to be proficient enough with GIS that I can reasonably put it on my resume in the future and create a portfolio. There is so much out there to learn with GIS, and I feel I need some direction on what is actually relevant to my interests. 

Additionally, I am interested in perhaps applying in future to a GIS internship with SCA (Student Conservation association - I am a US citizen as well as Canadian). How much does one really need to know to apply for these? Would it be possible to know enough after a summer of dedicated learning? 

Thanks for any and all advice.

First of all, the fact that classes are likely to be online just glorifies Community College. This makes it feel pretty dumb to choose to attend a 4-year institution in terms of finance. I feel like the only justification to a 4-year institution is the internship opportunities or research experience (especially for a UC)

Second of all, I only hear people say ""You will miss the college experience"". Does that even matter? Idk what to think right now...

Third of all, I feel like seriously impacted majors (like Computer Science) are much more of a risk transferring. The major is so difficult to get into, and there are mixed responses onto how importance college prestige is. This just pushes me toward a 4-year institution again.

TLDR; I'm just in this mess between justifying my decision to attend a 4-year institution, when the fact that online classes and this 2nd chance at prestige glorifies Community College. Any thoughts?"

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Background: i want to become a programmer and have been trying to do so for a few months, slowly learning new stuff. I started with python and then did some flask and jinja for a project(didnt finish it because finals started and not much free time). Now, starting this summer i want to work and have 3 options but not sure which one is best.

&amp;#x200B;

**A data reporting analyst,** which would be a full time job and probably pay a decent amount, but i dont think that i'll learn anything there. At no time during the interviews was i asked to write any code or prove any technical abilities. I asked if i could write scripts and work on code, but their response was pretty evasive and mostly revolved around ""you'll begin with excel, but we use scripts and code in out team and would be more than happy to see your input"". Sounded quite sugar-coated tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

**An automation testing engineer,** which is a paid internship. They did not say any numbers, but its probably a symbolic amount. I was asked to write some simple code(check if a train can fit in a space given some coordinates), but then the interview switched to what inputs can i give a code written by someone else to check if it has errors. They explained that both manual and automated testing is done, but i will probably do more manual testing from what i could gather. A friend had a job like this and said its mostly just giving inputs to some code and see if it has errors.

&amp;#x200B;

**An unpaid internship at a small company** that does software development. Compared with the previous 2 jobs(both part of international companies), this one is local and has significantly less employees. They mostly do embedded programming with C and C++ development. I am familiar with both C/C++, but still beginner by all means. Even though it's been a while since i worked with C/C++ it wont take me long to get reacustomed with either. One thing that might be an issue(if some of you work in small companies, please confirm/dismiss this) is that if there's a deadline coming soon or a lot of work, there wont really be anyone free to guide me or help when i encounter an issue. Also, because its unpaid they might not push me to do stuff(i tend to be lazy sometimes too), so even if i dont do much there wont be an issue with them.

&amp;#x200B;

Would like to hear your opinion and thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

&amp;#x200B;

LE: I forgot to mention, but money is not that important right now. I'm still a student and campus accommodation is free for me. I still have one year until i finish school, during which time i dont have to pay anything."

I grew up in a safe neighborhood with a stable, middle-class family. I have always done well in school, and I was over-involved in extracurriculars throughout high school. I got into a good university, got involved in an a cappella group, and worked a part-time job throughout. I have a language minor and studied abroad to improve my skills. I eventually became the director of my club, and worked in a research lab one summer to learn more about developmental psychology. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety before I went to college, and while in college was diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder which did not greatly affect my everyday life, but definitely contributed to my depression  and low self-esteem. 

I went three years of college trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I have an almost perfect GPA, but I didn't volunteer, I wasn't able to get a job related to my major, and my only extracurricular involvement was in something completely unrelated to psychology. Now, I'm about to be a senior, and I finally figured out what interests me in psychology. I now know what graduate program I want to apply for, after I graduate and take a gap year. But I still feel so unaccomplished.

I grew up privileged. I know so many people who grew up similarly, or in much less privileged situations, who have done so much more with their lives. I know people who graduated with double majors, three years of research experience, and multiple internships. I go to a competitive school and my only accomplishment is having good grades... for an easy major. I feel a tremendous amount of guilt for not having more to show for myself by now. I got a job for my last year of college that is more oriented to my degree and will give me some clinical experience. However, this is just a baby step and I am unsure of how I am going to find a job post-graduation with only a year of experience. I'm still incredibly ashamed for not having done more with my life. I don't know how to live with myself knowing that I could have done more by now. What should I do?"
got6ik,3,2020-05-22,"About to get fired from my job as full stack dev.

However, I received little mentorship on the job, my CS degree gave me very little real experience for the job world, and I never got much of a chance to get internships prior to my full stack dev job because I worked full time. Benefits of that was I didn't go into debt, but also didn't have much time to do much outside my classes or do internships.

So, what I'm left with is a year experience on my resume with a job that wants to fire me in a month or so. I frankly don't feel super comfortable being a web developer right now and don't think my school did me any service in educating me on anything real world. In fact, probably hurt me as it taught me many things web dev doesn't use at all now.

So, I am seriously considering going into a bootcamp. The job market sucks right now and I have gone job hunting, but I also realize I am not as good as I feel I need to be to be competent at my job. But I like coding and know I can get good at this stuff given enough time and starting off on the right foot.

Has anyone on here gotten a CS degree and then went to a bootcamp? Did that get held against you when applying for jobs? Also, is their alternatives to doing a bootcamp or the best bootcamp that may meet my specific needs (aka, I already have a CS degree)?

I realize people are going to say I don't need to do a bootcamp. But the reality is that I need to do SOMETHING. What I am doing is not cutting it at all. I need a new way going forward.

I would really like some help with this."
gotbxg,2,2020-05-22,"Sanity Check: writing a python script to parse PDB files and automatically ""detecting"" multiple chains even if they have the same identifier",kookaburra1701,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/gotbxg/sanity_check_writing_a_python_script_to_parse_pdb/,"My background: I'm a new orphan bioinformatics intern in a proteomics wet lab, all of my previous experience is in genomics, so I'm still working on getting up to speed with proteomics file formats and conventions.

My goal: I'm tinkering with a python script that will parse a PDB file and return residue pairs (either inter-chain or intra-chain) that are closer than a specified cut off (default is going to be 5 angstroms).

It will have a number of options, such as being able to specify whether you want the distance to be calculated from C-alphas, C-betas, or the COM of the side chain. Optional arguments can also specify chains to calculate the distance between, etc.

My problem: I want the user to be able to just specify the input file, and the default behavior of the script will be to output a script of all inter-chain contacts between alpha-Carbons less than 5 angstroms apart (if using a biological assembly file). If they are using a file with just one chain, the script would output a list of residue pairs &lt; 5 angstroms apart in the same chain.

The snag I'm hitting is the various ways .pdb and .pdb(n) (where n is an integer specifying the biological assembly number) specify chains, especially in homo -multimers and -dimer biological assemblies. Some have only one chain ID (for example, biological assembly 1 for 1YQG, a homodimer) in two ""models"", while others have only 1 ""model"" but have multiple identical chains in that model. An example is 6FHL biological assembly 1, where model 1 has chains A-E.

Here is where I'm asking for my sanity check, and possibly some input if there are cases I am not accounting for, or if my assumptions are wrong:

Assumptions:

* .pdb (asymmetric unit?) files never have ""MODEL N"" lines, so I can automatically detect the chains contained therein by using the chain IDs in the SEQRES section. The ""COMPND N CHAIN: A, B, ...;"" sections are too potentially spread out in the header to use to populate the chain list.

* .pdb(n) (biological assembly) files all have ""MODEL N"" lines, and will either have all the identical chains under a single model denoted with the chain letter, or will have one chain under multiple ""MODEL N"" lines. (Can they have multiple chains under multiple model lines?)

Logic:

* My script will first check for the file extension.
* If the extension is "".pdb"" it will check lines beginning with SEQRES and populate a list with the unique chain IDs found there.
* If the extension is "".pdb(n)"" it will look for ""MODEL N"" lines.
* The script will then iterate through the ATOM lines under MODEL N looking for unique chain IDs. In this case the chain list will be populated with tuples, 1st value is model number, second is chain ID.
* When the script hits a new ""MODEL N"" line, it will continue populating the chain list but now with the new number as the first value in the tuple.

Does this make any sense for how to go about the problem? Am I overlooking another case in .pdb/.pdb(n) files that this won't work for?"

Advice needed:(,tropicaltuesday,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/goux74/should_i_look_for_an_internship_or_a_full_time/,"Hey all, I currently have only one more course to take in the Fall semester before graduation. I had originally planned to take it online and was hoping to find a full time job and work at the same time during fall.

With the way the job market looks now, I can instead do an 8 month internship in the fall/spring and delay graduating until next summer. (I'm from Canada, and 8 month internships are typically easier to find than 4 month internships).

Why would I do this? 

First, it seems easier to get an internship compared to a full time job. The Canadian government subsidizes a lot of wages for interns, so it does makes sense for companies to hire interns.

Second, I have a really solid resume for an intern. I've done 2 internships at a mid sized tech company with a solid reputation in my city, an internship with the federal government, and have been an undergrad teaching assistant for a year. While my resume should be super competitive for an intern position, it definitely isn't as good compared to full time competition.

My thinking is, I could probably land an internship at an SAP/RBC/Samsung type of place for 8 months and it would be better than being underemployed (or unemployed) somewhere else as a full time employee.

The only thing that worries me is that I have just finished my 5th year of university and will be 23 in the fall. I don't want to keep dragging out my degree and for it to look bad on my resume.

I'm curious what you all think?"

I only managed to get one internship while I was in school (related to historical GIS), and even that was just for the history department.

Initially I wanted to go to grad school to teach history at the college level, but after seeing the realities of that career path there’s no way that I would be able to make that work (frankly, most people don’t). By the time I realized this, I was already over two years through school, and all of my professors and advisers told me not to worry about it, that I would be fine when I graduated. I’m not completely naive and I knew I was heading for a bad situation, but I didn’t know what else to do except finish college.

College here is very expensive, and literally no one I met at my school got any kind of scholarship, including me. So now I’m 100k in debt and have no immediate job prospects. I’m considering going back to school for something more practical and starting at a community college so that I won’t accrue even more debt. The ultimate kicker, though, is that before I even started college I got a large hand tattoo. Nothing offensive, it’s just a large laurel wreath and it’s well done, so it’s not awful to look at. I also have some small dots around the edges of my fingernails from this same time period. I understand that I have gotten myself into a sticky situation here. I’ve been applying to jobs for months, and have gotten nothing but rejections so far, which I assume is due to my lack of experience and my degree. 

What kinds of fields would are open to me despite my hand tattoos? The two main things I’m looking at are plumbing (but I would prefer not to to a labor trade) or accounting (which I doubt would be open to my due to tattoos). I am open to pretty much any possibility though. Preferably something that requires more education, or something that I could do with the education that I already have. Is there something I could do outside of the trades, or is that my only avenue now? My student loan payments are going to be way too high to allow me to work at a job that pays anything less than like $16-17/hr.

I would appreciate any advice at all, I’m in a pretty bad spot and am starting to panic, frankly. Thanks."

I'm a 23 year old male. I'm relatively fit (been lifting weights for around 2 years, around 13% bodyfat was my last dexa scan), and I'm very sociable. I just haven't found the right girl for me yet. 

When I was in university, I went full gung ho on the self improvement train after having an awful high school experience from being very chubby. I picked up all sorts of fun hobbies (drawing / painting, throwing, rock climbing), lost a ton of weight from CICO, got an internship at Google, a 3.8 gpa, and published 2 papers on a topic related to machine learning. I snowballed all of this into a phd acceptance from a lab I really wanted to work in. However, throughout all of this, I never really met a girl I really jived with that liked me romantically. What would always happen is that I would ask them out, I'd get rejected, then we'd either stop talking or become friends from acquaintances. Granted, no offence to these wonderful ladies, but they weren't insanely attractive. I mainly judged girls based on personality and how well we mesh on a first impression, with the presumption that looks fade as I get more and more familiar with a person.

Don't get me wrong, right now I love life and I wouldn't change very much for the world. But, it's hard hearing all of my friends talk about their girlfriends, especially in the time of covid, where there's almost no hope for all my awesome single dudes / ladies. Online dating for me is very hard, as I'm a very short man (5'3). It's hard to hide that even with photos, and unfortunately it seems like it's a deal breaker for a lot of women using dating apps.

Prior to covid, there was never really a fear of being alone for extended periods of time; my will to become a better person, to seek out discomfort and conquer it all to become the awesome human being I know I'm capable of and thus probably finding my equally awesome other half one of these days kept me warm even though my pillows were cold. But now, that fire seems to be dying, and it's having very adverse effects on the rest of my life, especially my work. i'm finding it incredibly hard to sit down and study or do research, as my brain inevitably drifts to my lack of intimacy, forming feelings of inadequacy. I mainly feel like I'm not the way a man should be, which makes me think that there's something wrong with me. 

I know it's irrational, as I've made such great strides from the man I once was, but I feel like I'm never going to be enough for anyone. My mind often tries to ""prove"" this to myself, such as: Suppose I am attractive enough (in terms of my whole package, not just physical appearance) to find girls that are interested. Then, it would be that a certain percentage, say 1%, of women I meet would be interested and express interest in some capacity towards being in a relationship with me. But then I think, I must have surely met around 500 women total since I was a freshman! If that's true, then the probability of failure is approximately 0.99\^500 which is very small, so this statement is most likely false. How can I possibly argue against this in my mind? Logically it makes sense to me, and this is the part that by far hurts the most. However, the main thing that I think is undesirable about me is my height, which I cannot change. It just leads to this very fatalistic and defeatist mindset, which I have a hard time shaking once I get into it. Especially at night, I can't help but cry a lot, until I'm thirsty and my throat hurts. It's even worse now, as I've done almost everything I can do to help me become as attractive as I possibly can.

I moved back in with my parents and siblings when the lockdown hit, and I cook with my mom, so I get enough social interaction. I tend to hug my parents every day, so I'm not touch starved. Thus, I don't think it's either of the things aforementioned. So, ruling out those two plausible causes, I think this is a problem with my mindset or outlook on the world. So, how can I fix this? How can I stop these negative thoughts from plaguing my life?"

I’m 20 and just got into a great university but seem to get little credit from my peers and family. I have a paid internship but am in fear of losing it. It’s a state job at a department in Human Resources but I’m planning to major in communications instead so I don’t know if that will work for them. I have diagnosed anxiety and depression. Here is a little summary of my current issues:

1. My biological who I do not see often almost died from undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and is a former/ or current drug addict at the moment... I’m not sure? He is let’s just say very unstable and it has caused me a great amount of stress. I’ve tried to help as much as I can but feel worn out and like I’m taking care of a child.

2. I am in fear of losing my current job due to university/choice of major issues. I get no support financially from family so this is huge. I need to pay my bills. 

3. I don’t feel close to my friends and or family and feel like I have lost all connection with them. 

4. I don’t know what to do with myself and keep going day by day but know I’m going to break soon. I keep everything bottled up usually but whenever I drink I feel overcome with these emotions and it’s beginning to form into a habit.

Is it just me? This is only the tip of the iceberg of my problems... things I have been thinking about on a daily basis. I don’t know what to do and feel like I am slowly deteriorating.

Tldr; I am under a lot of pressure and feel like I am going to break down and can’t cope with my problems it seems? I feel like I am going to go CRAZY with all of this stress and want to see a doctor but with COVID I cant. IM LOSING MY MIND"

First of all, I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub who are willing to lend a hand if needed. I learned a lot from you, which helped me a lot in getting my admission to OMSCS.

One of my goals, while taking OMSCS, is doing some exciting internships, and getting more hands-on experience in the software industry.

I wanted to ask people who were successful in getting internships while doing OMSCS:

- How did you build your resume? What projects to build or hackathons to get into?
- What made you able to get callbacks from recruiters? 
- And how did you prepare for your interviews?

Finally, I was wondering if anyone was able to get the attention of FANG companies?

Thank you in advance"

The internship will last for about a month. I'm looking for internships that take place in July too and hopefully I can get another paid offer.

This is a Web Development Internship position. I will definitely be using front end programming languages/ tools (like WordPress, HTML, CSS, JS) and maybe some backend programming languages (like PHP) depending on the projects I am given to work on.

Would it be lying if I said I was a software engineer intern on LinkedIn and that paper which starts with an R?  

I feel like web development is a form of software engineering - I'm developing apps for the web. 

Also, I may be wrong about this, but I feel like having ""software engineer intern"" would look better than having ""web developer intern"" on my LinkedIn and the R-word. I feel like since software engineer is a more broad term than web developer, having ""software engineer intern"" on my resume could help open up internship positions in other fields (like desktop app development or mobile app development) rather than making it seem like web dev is my only forte. 

What are your thoughts? I'm totally cool with saying I was a web dev intern but just want to know if it would be advantageous and/or ethical to say I was a software engineer intern.

According to [a A2C subreddit census](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/6a6i00/rapplyingtocollege_census_results/), and [another straw poll](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/e0a1it/class_of_2020_survey_results/), this subreddit leans very much to the wealthier side, so I want to just give another POV of college admissions from someone that goes to a poorer high school (over 50% free &amp; reduced lunch, 1000 average SAT). I tried to include as many sources and studies as I could, so please check them out if there's a fact that might seem iffy or if there's a subject that seems to interest you. **TDLR at the bottom.**

Inequality inside of the United States is arguably most seen in education and [thus](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/the-growing-wealth-gap-in-who-earns-college-degrees/479688/) [college admissions](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html). Differences are opportunities for test prep, resources, extracurricular activities, good coaches, college counselors --- the whole nine --- are shown among richer and poorer students. I'm not talking about the obscenely rich. Just making over [100k in family income](https://books.google.com/books?id=9fWMfVIyvm4C&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=100,000+AND+sat+score&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zLX4xWtxI3&amp;sig=ACfU3U1KclV3Rf3hRPUnZYOV099FaeH8Vw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj8tICf7sjpAhW7knIEHRumDR0Q6AEwD3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=100%2C000%20AND%20sat%20score&amp;f=false) (pg. 212) drastically puts you in a better position than lower-income students.

1. [**Obviously**](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/05/17/students-need-more-than-an-sat-adversity-score-they-need-a-boost-in-wealth/) [**Standardized**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/03/05/these-four-charts-show-how-the-sat-favors-the-rich-educated-families/?utm_term=.1abef1ae0568) [**Testing**](https://bit.ly/2WSUtQt)

This is pretty much widely known: SAT score is the [biggest](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/54227/impact_of_income_on_test_scores_dadasheu.pdf) indicator of your income. Being directly correlated, as your income goes up, so does your SAT. By the averages, being born richer puts you at an advantage at birth other people not in that position. This mainly because of [better quality schools by zip code](https://apnews.com/1d856cd98d4c491e8443576b3a817740). People are in such a different school environment that prepares students for tests. Also, many students can simply get a tutor much easier compared to others. Inequality is even seen in just the [testing environment](https://blog.prepscholar.com/sat-testing-center-problems-proctor). Worse testing environments, often in lower-income areas, could affect how well you do on the test-- something other (rich) students wouldn't have to deal with.

**2. Extracurriculars**

In more wealthy areas, there could be more resources for certain EC's and that [affects educational outcomes](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/the-activity-gap/384961/). Often competitive activity programs will be better at better schools. Looking at national winners in debate, virtually all previous ones are from top/rich schools. Not only in this extreme most successful example, but also in just regular resource money, sponsorship, and dedicated coaches. This inequality can also manifest when not having to worry about a ride after school or for meets because Uber money is easy, or when there's no sibling that you must take care of, etc.

This might lean more towards the more wealthy, but just the ability to garner things on your resume, such as internships, research, etc, via family connections obviously is another example.

**3. Summer Break**

Not much to say here, but this is one thing that most people probably don't know; l[ower-income students](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/13/5891583/summer-slide-achievement-gap-vacation) [lose more knowledge during summer than wealthy peers](https://www.brookings.edu/research/summer-learning-loss-what-is-it-and-what-can-we-do-about-it/). Bad effects of this in early childhood have snowball effects in high school.

**4. Flat out leniency**

This is more for people in the top top prep/ private/boarding schools. I learned about this from wlliamthereader's (former admissions officer at T5) AMA. [People from top high schools are held to lower standard than other students from regular high schools](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/9f8zl3/ama_top_5_usnews_university_alum_worked_in_alma/e5vwj48?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Pretty nice hook.

Point of this post? Try to watch yourself when you complain about other people and their supposed ""hooks"". Recognize your privilege. This isn't an attack post, just an awareness one.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in quite of a dilemma. I was accepted last minute into an REU with a CS professor at my school. However, quickly I realized that this was not what I was expecting. In fact, I'm not even working with the professor but with a grad student who just gives me random ass tasks from previous code he has done. The fact is I have no idea what the fuck his code is doing or how it works. And he expect me to put in 8-10 hours a day on this project. And weekends. This is shit but it pays 6k.

Every day I wake up in sweats since I have not completed what was asked of me. And I just can't figure out what his code is saying or what he wants me to do either too be honest.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However I could also choose to go to my previous lab that I worked in last semester. Current plans for the summer are to use machine learning techniques and machine vision to analyze a large datasets of videos and general coding based tasks. This will be much more chill, in a team, and allow me to spend time with my friends,family, and work on side projects I have wanted to do. Would only pay me 3k but it is a lot less work. I really enjoy the work and will have my name published on a paper.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The point I am trying to make is that. I a rising junior next year. And my ultimate goal is to go into industry. Will choosing the 2nd lab and working on my personal projects be seen as a disadvantage/hinder me from being able to get a job after I graduate?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? I can't stand the stress of working for something and then not figuring it out. The grad student is no help as he is working at an internship and seems to be only doing this because his advisor made him. In fact, the first week he tried to give me an easier task but the professor made us change the entire course of the research since it was ""more interesting"" for the professor.

I have been thinking a lot lately about what the future holds given all the craziness that is happening in the world these days. Lots of opinion articles online paint a kind of dark image regarding the future, especially when considering job hunts for new grads.

I would like to sample your opinions about a slightly more specific issue which is a bit more related to my own case. What do you think awaits new international PhD graduates? For instance, I have been a PhD student in electrical engineering at the University of Illinois for 5 years, I expect to defend next year, I have a rather strong publication record with a 3-digit citation count, and I have gone on a couple of internships and made quite a few connections. Basically I have been working very hard in order to maximize my chances of securing a good job once I graduate. Before the pandemic, I was very excited and looking forward to go on a job hunt (which I plan to do in the upcoming year) and I was not at all concerned about the availability of opportunities or the next steps in general (getting an OPT and etc..).

However, with everything happening these days the situation has changed greatly and I honestly am overwhelmed by the uncertainty the future holds. This is causing a great deal of anxiety because I am even having a hard time identifying what could be a worst case scenario so that I could prepare accordingly. The added amount of stress, compounded with the of the very long lockdown we have had is even dampening my research productivity which isn't ideal either.

Anyway, my purpose is not to rant, but rather I would very much appreciate hearing your opinions on the topic in the hope that it would help paint some kind of realistic picture as to what to expect in the next year or so. Hopefully that can be helpful to myself and others in order to carefully plan out our next steps.

Thank you very much for reading and sharing your thoughts, it's much appreciated."

We all do.,honestly_tho_00,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gp9kdh/unpopular_opinion_just_deal_with_it_we_all_do/,"Partially a response to [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/gp5uxg/your_upper_middle_class_family_income_is_the/).

When in fact coronaviruses historically has originated from live animal markets, no country officially blamed China despite the fact that this wouldn't have happened if not for certain practices, for political purposes or otherwise.

Before COVID was deemed as serious, young people in America bought cheap flight tickets to impacted countries, confident their age group is barely affected by the virus, contributing to the initial panic outbreak. Amidst that, I swear seniors were more worried about having their graduation ceremonies cancelled than tens of thousands of people literally dying from a pandemic.

Then, people started blaming and mugging Asian-Americans who haven't stepped a single foot in the Asian continent for years, and yet Asian-Americans, including my parents, told their children to say sorry for everything you are not responsible for. Similarly, many unhooked applicants never thought much into admissions disparities and instead found only their unexceptional selves to blame, choosing to push themselves even harder. Many of them were disadvantaged in some sense too, just not on record (at least not on record that mattered to the eyes of admissions officers).

Obviously I can only speak for my own experience, so here goes an example: being international/ESL basically gives you the same disadvantages and takes away all the advantages one may have as an FGLI and URM. Some of which I've come across throughout high school--summer camps and internships (most heavily target these demographics, but some literally prevent you from applying if you don't identify as such). Coincidentally these are usually the most prestigious bunch (paid NASA internships that partner with LI schools, MITES, TASS are some places that literally prevent you. Other places only just give them a significant boost). Sucks to be upper-middle class who doesn't have rich man connections or poor privilege, I guess.

And then there's college and graduate school admissions, and jobs. SATs have consistently been watered down (particularly in certain sections) to screw over certain demographics, and that in itself is a statement of its own. And that clearly wasn't enough for achievement gaps to close and a facade of upward suasion to appear, so Collegeboard decides to implement landscape. You'd think it ends in college. Haha, no. Professional schools like law school, B-school, and med school still care. Companies care. In other words, it doesn't end here. Some people have a lifetime of support systems, and others don't. Frankly I don't see enough of us complaining half as much about it. Instead, most simply choose to spend additional time learning academic English that their parents simply could not provide, practicing for the SATs, and overall honing their application.

Also, the real beneficiaries from ""top top boarding schools"" actually happen to be only the hooked applicants. Literally everyone I know who identifies as such in my school is going to HYPS because colleges think they're the cream of the crop FGLIs they can find in the entire country. When in fact every unhooked non-URMs I know has 1500+ on their SATs along with some craziest ECs (and I repeat, crazy), they're the ones who get fucked over in college admissions thanks to more desired, hooked applicants. These are people who would have easily gotten into T10 institutions had they been attending normal schools.

In addition, colleges reward poor financial decisions, and families that care about education gets fucked over in the process. Everyone, including poor people, deserve education. If that means additional financial support, so be it. But to reward even those who screwed their own lives over with great aid packages and admission boosts is beyond absurd, knowing that families who actually CARE about their children's education live frugally and save every dime for college had to give up all those opportunity costs feed the rich institutions and pay subsidies for families who chose hedonistic lifestyles over their children's education. What kind of an educational system punishes people for caring about education? I couldn't tell you.

Yeah, I can whine about all my problems too. But I choose not to. Why?

My long-winded point here is, everybody is put at a certain disadvantage in college admissions and life, and not all of them are as transparent and quantifiable as color or socioeconomic status. And complaining about how unfair life has been so far isn't and shouldn't be how society functions. I'm happy college admissions works out for certain less fortunate people, but I also know just that interest-convergence plays a heavy role here with with desperate institutional needs for re-branding, and that it is never about them truly acknowledging and empathizing with your disadvantage and struggles. In fact, the world as I know of never seems to operate on a metric of justice. And sometimes, you just gotta suck it up. We're not kids anymore. You don't whine about having their graduation ceremonies cancelled when tens of thousands of people are dying from a pandemic."

Late 20s. 
Live in a small city in midwest, relatively affordable COL. 
Originally learned Python, have basic web development knowledge, learned some C++ in school. Know basic vanilla JS. C# at work.
Long term interest in data science/machine learning.
In school online for undergrad in software development, 1 year remaining. 

Almost a year ago, I was hired as a Software Development Engineer in Test 1 (SDET). I had an awesome summer internship in 2018 where I used Python and got a lot of mentoring, but this is my first regular full time job with benefits. 

I mostly write and maintain the UI automation using Selenium with C#, jquery, occasional JS, run through Jenkins and Testrail. I caught on quickly, and have learned a lot working with a team on a larger codebase. Recently when we took on some overseas contractors to help us with site updates, I took a somewhat unofficial role in training them in our system+code, and did a LOT of code review.

As I said, I'm about to hit the 1 year mark. My annual evaluation was 100% positive. I'm starting to get bored doing the same things every day, and feel like staying at the company will hold me back or slow my progress long term. I'm salaried at $40,000, which feels on the low end with my experience, but I realize I don't have a degree yet, and my decent downtown 1 bdr apartment is $700. I happened to find out through sources that the person I replaced got 45k by negotiating, which I didn't do because I was so eager for a fulltime local relevant W2 offer. All raises are put on hold for 2020 d/t covid, I am grateful to still have a job right now. I've considered striving toward a regular non-SDET position at my company, but I don't want to stay there longer than I have to, the work is decent but in no way ground-breaking or too interesting.

We've been completely work from home since mid-March d/t pandemic. I love working from home, and don't want another in-office job in my small city. Do I have a decent chance at a higher-paying remote development job with 1 year experience? Should I go for it? Thank you in advanced for any feedback, positive or negative."

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. International Finalist for DECA (2018)
2. 2nd and 3rd place for DECA at States (2018 and 2019)
3. Selected to present as a high schooler at an undergrad research conference at Duke
4. 1st place medium delegation at GCMUN in NY
5. National AP Scholar

**Letters of Recommendation**

First one was by my ted-ed club advisor.Probably really good. we worked well together for 3 years

Second on was my Apeng teacher. Wasn't the best kid in the class, but he was the judge at my Ted-Ed showcase. He's also a great writer himself.

Third was my App state mentor. He showed me the rec. It was very obvious it was a copy paste template. Not that good.

**Interviews**

Penn interview was okay. Princeton, Harvard, and Yale interview I though were spectacular, especially Princeton.

**Essays**

My main essay was how i sucked at public speaking my whole life, but accepted it as a permanent flaw cuz no one was perfect and I was good at math and other stuff. Then at high school I saw kids good at math and speaking. I either had to accept I was lacking or prove to myself I wasn't. I wrote about how I put myself in situations like speaking at parents birthday party and siblings graduation. I got better was nowhere near perfect, but also realized its something I can work and perfect for the rest of my life. also led me to start Ted ed in 10th grade. I worked really hard on it. It was well-written. I tried hard not to make it cliche, but i fear i didn't put enough twists on it.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Duke University (RD) (attending)
* London School of Economics (BSc Finance)
* NYU Stern (off the RD waitlist)
* CMU (Tepper RD)
* UCLA
* UC Berkeley
* Indiana (Direct admission to Kelly RD)
* UNC (EA with honors, 3k scholarship, and a 7500 grant that they only gave to 10 kids, not assured to kenan-flagler tho :/)
* NC state Engineering (EA)
* Warwick University
* University of Edinburgh
* Cass Business School
* City University of London

*Waitlists:*

* Uchicago
* Michigan
* Cornell Dyson

*Rejections:*

* UPENN Wharton deferred- then rejected (ED and RD)
* Harvard
* Princeton
* Yale
* Stanford
* Northwestern

**Additional Information:**

Overall, I'm happy with the results. I wish I could have broken into the HYPS tier, but its alright. I spent two long weeks researching talking to people, I eventually narrowed it down to Duke, LSE, UNC, and Stern. Stern's quality of life wasn't too appealing. I never visited London and I couldnt do any double major there either. Plus LSE has little alumni connections in America. Its really good for Europe, but I couldn't see myself living there, epecially cuz i couldn't visit. It was hard to say no to tho cuz it was 200k cheaper then duke. UNC i kept in cuz it was so bloody cheap, but at the end of the day, prestige matters for finance and cuz I don't plan on doing an MBA my parents said to splurge on Duke. Duke I love, it was my number one cultural fit. The vibe is just so nice. Wharton was my number one academic fit, but I'm happy I got one of my number ones."

I got them to drop the non compete, but they have a works made for hire clause that is concerning.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically,

""  such Developments relate directly to the business of the Company or to the Company’s actual or demonstratively anticipated research or development ""

&amp;#x200B;

This could include almost any tech or AI work on my own time. The company has assured me that they interpret this clause much more narrowly and previous court cases do too, but I don't want to risk going to court. Could this affect my ability to work on my own projects or am I just being paranoid?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I'm in the US, specifically Kansas, but the company is in Missouri. The contract says that it should be interpreted under Missouri laws, but because of work from home, the actual code will be written in Kansas."

It's my goal to find a software engineering job in NYC after I graduate next May. My grades are good, and I have had one year-round internship.

Most of my family say that I should stick around here for a year or so and get some experience before trying to move away. I acknowledge that this is not such a bad idea, but I really want to try to make my goal happen if I can (after all, it's not impossible - people do it all the time).

And yes, I understand the cost of living is high there - as long as I have a job, I don't care. It's where I want to be.

Do you have any advice for landing an entry-level position in NYC? Are there recruiters I can reach out to? Any tips are appreciated."

Jumping from SWE in the Automation/Controls world to a more traditional SWE position.   


I'll have 4 years of professional experience (1 year of it as a co-op) and have lead multi-million dollar projects successfully. Still had a project manager above me on but majority of the design work/day to day was left to me.   


Mentored several interns as well.   


Not sure if I should be applying for SWE or Senior SWE positions. Since I'm jumping industries there will be a lot I'm unfamiliar with or haven't done in a while. My current job my ""stack"" changes per project and new and old technologies that I've never seen before pop up quite often. So I've gotten good at figuring out the right questions to ask to learn something quickly (or when a sales rep is BSing features that can't exist).   


I'd rather not start on at an entry level position but with the industry shift I'm not confident I have the hard skills to be senior level right out of the gate. I plan to spend some time refreshing my more traditional SWE skills but I will need time adapting after the industry change.   


Which level position should I aim for?"

Math grad student here. Both for my research and my intended career path (quant finance), C++ is becoming more and more important. I have a good amount of programming experience but mainly with high level languages such as MATLAB. I've also dabbled with C++ here and there but nothing past writing a few trivial codes. With that said, I've decided to devote this summer in learning it as best as I can. I have three options for doing this and was wondering what you all think is best.

1. Get a C++ certificate by going through a course on QuantNet ([https://quantnet.com/cpp/](https://quantnet.com/cpp/)). The benefit of this is it is very tailored to what I am doing and also can serve as some time of proof on a resume. The bad side is it comes at a cost of $1450.
2. Self teach using some of the books recommended on this reddit. I'm no stranger to self learning, but the way I've learnt to code is through problems and this will be hard to do with self teaching. If I do go down this path, given that I have a good amount of MATLAB experience, it seems Accelerated C++ might be a good book, but I figured I would check with you guys first is my MATLAB experience alone is enough to go through that text.
3. Just wait until the fall and take the C++ course my university offers. I would prefer not to do this as I would rather take other courses and it would be nice to have the C++ experience under my belt for research and also for applying to internships.

Thanks."

The skills I do have are the certifications; ITILv3 foundation, MTA-98 365 Server fundamentals, CompTIA- A+ and net +.

1) Are there many CS internships to go round. Do lots of people who apply come away with no internship at all. Particular if I haven't got amazing grades in my CS classes so far? I'm worried that against some of the competition I won't have any chance at all?

2) When should I start seriously searching. Should I be looking as soon as the fall semester starts? I saw the latest post of summer 2021 internships being advertised already.

3) Are most internships paid?

4) Is having an internship while at college a relatively important thing to have when trying to get a job after graduating?

That's all I can think of for now. Any answers to any of these questions would be mush appreciated :)"
gpnfjg,7,2020-05-24,I accidentally put my savings in a Tax Saver Fixed deposit instead of a normal FD in SBI and now I can't break it for 5 years. Help!,tatallynote,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/gpnfjg/i_accidentally_put_my_savings_in_a_tax_saver/,I'm in final year of college and made 1.5L on an internship like a year ago and put it in an FD and that was broken sometime ago. So I thought I'd keep the interest as pocket money and put it in a FD for another 6 months tilll I graduate so that I could use the funds for travel or settling in a new city. So this where where things get absolutely ridiculous. I used the YONO app by SBI for banking and it has horrible UI and the app is all around shitty. So I know how to create FD and I've done it multiple times and like any normal day I create an FD. Then I check the FD and I can't see the option to break it and see the maturity date in 5 years and that's when I realized I put it in a Tax Saver FD. The ridiculous part is that it's a small checkbox which comes while creating the normal FD and I might've accidentally clicked it. It doesn't say anywhere that it's an unbreakable FD unless you click the small info button near the checkbox. I know I was stupid to be careless but I'm in need of that money. I've approached multiple branches and they all said it can't be broken and I'm kind of in need of the cash. Is there anything I can do in the position I'm in?

in the fall, i am going to be in my second year at a top U.S. state school studying computer engineering. currently, i am interested in data science and quant. this summer, i am doing a remote SWE internship at a fortune 500 finance company. i did not apply for this internship in the traditional way (offer at a hackathon), so i have some questions regarding the internship application process. 

applying:
i have seen sankey diagrams with people applying to 100+ companies. how do they time the application process properly? when i received my offer i had 2 business days to respond. i know that asking for an extension is an option. how long can you get an extension for usually? how long does it realistically take to go through the whole interview process for selective companies - i am sure it depends from company to company but could anyone provide a range? do you wait to apply to jobs that you think you have a better chance at until later? i know negotiation is common and encouraged for full time jobs. is it common to negotiate for an internship salary? does an extension help for negotiation? can asking for an extension hurt me? 

graduation dates &amp; graduating early:
i can graduate in 3 years, but i think i am currently leaning towards taking 4 years. there are a few reasons for this:
1. i would like to complete minors in physics and math. 
2. i can space out courses a bit more. i am considering grad school in the future (probably PhD, probably after working in industry). my gpa is currently pretty good, but i know that taking heavier courseloads will get harder as i progress through the degree program. basically, i don't want to hurt my grad school chances by graduating early.

can i still apply to jobs that ask for graduation in 2022 (which would be a 3 year graduation)? is this likely to be an issue? does anyone have experience with graduating early for a job offer? was it worth it - academically, socially, professionally?"

Funding: Self-funded (my company doesn't sponsor in general unfortunately thus far). It would be great if you could point out if any certs are worth taking given company funding too :)

**1 CompTIA and EC Council**

(1) Should I pick Sec+ or CEH? My understanding suggests both are DoD-compliant. Is it true that Sec+ has a better standing amongst IT people, and CEH amongst HR? I am very inclined to Sec+ for now but CEH has many more page listings on Indeed.com for my region...

(2) Should I try A+ / Net+? I am not terrific at hardware (closest think I done was replace hard disks at a data center and configured RAID for a tiny server). Do these certs help in that kind of aspect?

(2 continued) If your answer is no, do I start from Sec+, CySA+ or go to CASP+?

(3) If I do eventually get a CASP+, does retaking the CASP+ exam every 3 years renew every single lower-level relevant certificate (e.g. A+ / Net+ etc.) or do I only retain the CASP+? Additionally, is there any comparison on difficulty of OffSec. v.s. CASP+?

(4) Are any EC-Council certificates notably worth taking apart from CEH?

(5) What do you typically do to get your CPEs in for CompTIA and CEH? Are there free CPE opportunities available from either organizations?

**2 Project / Service / Process Management**

(1) Is there a point in furthering ITIL / PRINCE2 or is the foundations sufficient? PRINCE2/PMP importance is relative don't really see a big preference in my area.

(2) Is lean six-sigma yellow belt worth considering? I know the DMAIC model mostly applies to manufacturing sectors but don't know if it helps in IT. A green-belt is obviously preferred but my job scope probably doesn't provide me the chance to have a LSS / SS project to get ASQ-equivalent certified.

**3 ISACA and ISC2 (I know I lack the work experience part but just curious for now)**

(1) I get the impression that CISA / CISM / CISSP are the top-tier certifications to go for in terms of information security management, but I obviously lack the required number of years. Is this impression correct or are there other equivalent certificates?

(2) Practically speaking, which is easier to maintain (in terms of both cost of time), and why?

(3) Are there other certs from ISACA/ISC2 worth pursuing (e.g. CRISC, SSCP) etc.?

**4 The Movement to Cloud**

(1) AWS has definitely has a longer history but Azure seems to be picking up a bit of pace. Is there a preferable route? I am not a big fan of AWS so am leaning towards Azure but AWS seems to be more recognized just for the first-mover advantage (of sorts) + number of features...

(2) Any thoughts on Redhat openshift certification / Cloud Kubernetes Administrator / VMware VCP-DCV? Is it possible to even get practical training on the associated software e.g. vSphere without investing in some infrastructure somewhere?

**5 OS Related**

(1) Is there any point career-wise to getting LPI-X / LFCE certifications? I know basic bash scripting and stuff but haven't seen the strong need for these certifications thus far. RHCSA is a different thing altogether but might take lower priority given my limited budget.

**6 Data Science Training**

(1) I learnt most of my AI / Deep learning stuff in school but was curious if there was any particularly recognizable professional training not by a university? (might as well phd if it is from university but its too time-costly) I took the IBM data science professional on Coursera and was wondering if there is more.

**7 General**

(1) Are there any particular certificates for which you felt the re-certification process was truly worth it for you (apart from employment prospects and compliance to some ISO / ANSI)? Why or why not?

Again, so sorry for the many questions, and thank you so much once again for reading all this and helping me out (would be great if you can answer any non-empty subset of them, really)\~ Am looking for personal opinions/recommendations since most questions aren't really about information.

Feel free to ask me anything at all if you think I can help out too :)

I am looking for online courses since I have some experience with web dev and would love to learn more.

gpqsxe,6,2020-05-24,Should a CS student do an internship after the second year?,thinkhardthistime,Indian_Academia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indian_Academia/comments/gpqsxe/should_a_cs_student_do_an_internship_after_the/,"I am a CSE student from a tier-1 college. My fourth semester will be officially over in a week. I haven't done any internship until now. Now many students I know are looking for internships or working on research projects under professors, even my parents are after me asking me to look for an internship. However, I am not sure if it will be a good investment of time. 

Many companies visit the campus in July (unless that changes due to coronavirus) and offer internships that students will do after their third year. Since a lot of good companies come, many even offer PPOs, and relatively fewer students prepare for internship interviews (as opposed to placements interviews after third year) I think it will be a better idea to focus on interviews. I plan on doing competitive programming and interview prep sites like LeetCode for the next couple of months. If I take up an internship now, I will have to devote somewhere between 5-8 hours to it every day, which leaves me with very constrained time to focus on interview prep. Also, note that if I don't take an internship, I have some projects in mind that I plan to work on.

I remember one of my professors in the first semester said don't run after internships, just enjoy the college life while it lasts. I am confused. I am not sure what the best approach is here. Does a second-year internship matter? Does it ""look good"" on the resume? Any advice is welcome! :)"

I figured if they didn't come back for it at the end of the night, they wouldn't come back for it again (dumb decision on my part).

Long story short, I am now fired from my job, and law enforcement has given me a citation for theft. I just had a few questions regarding that.

&amp;#x200B;

1. If I job search currently (part/full time or an internship) is that going to appear on my record?
2. Is there any way that I can work towards taking it off my record if it does show? I think the officer mentioned aversion which I can try to request on my court date? I don't have any past criminal records at all, so what are my chances of receiving it?

Passionate about electrical, electronics in general but skeptical of how, the hard coursework and learning amounts to little pay when compared to other majors like, Comp Sci, IT, Software Engineering etc. I have perfect GPA and SAT scores, moderate extra curriculars. Hoping to get admitted to one of the top 10 schools in the US. if I hardwork in college and maintain perfect GPA and perform decently in assignments and projects, get internships graduating from a top school, what salary prospects can I expect long term. I researched and found that mostly core engineering branches are pretty underpaid. So Im think maybe I should drift my focus to coding and programming to make the big bucks.

Also, I have witnessed through endless binging of career advice on reddit, quora and monitoring salaries at payscale, glassdoor, indeed, seek is that a lot of core students in EE/ME/CE etc drop out of them and try to aim for CS whereas vice versa, would be rarer. Again, I know it boils down to passion but what I believe is I need to devote time and effort in the first place, to develop passion. So, if I do practice 4k-5k hours of learning code, I would definitely not hate coding. I would have developed a certain amount of passion."

gpv2g6,15,2020-05-24,Advice on getting into embedded development,TheAlreadyThrownAway,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/gpv2g6/advice_on_getting_into_embedded_development/,"Some background, I graduated in 2018 after doing an internship as an SRE (Wasn't the title I interviewed for, but for internships you kinda take what you get, so w/e). My first job out of college was at a big American company, great money ""Software Engineer - Distributed Systems"", turned out to be another SRE/DevOps type job working on prometheus 99% of the time.

Quit this after 10 months to work as an embedded developer in Galway, this was great, loved it, but unfortunately my landlord ""decided to sell"" the house after 5 months and I couldn't find anywhere to rent in Galway. Decided to try my luck in Amsterdam since finding rent in Ireland was so difficult and found a developer job. Unfortunately this also turned out to be an SRE/DevOps job. I've been here 5 months and I've written about 20 lines of Go code, but what feels like a thousand lines of YAML for jenkins, kubernetes, cloudformation, and prometheus.  


Now, I know this kubernetes/DevOps stuff is good money, and monitoring systems is a good niche, but the problem is I really hate it. I don't mean that it's ""not my passion"" but I really really hate this part of the industry. I wake up every weekday dreading the day ahead and spend my evenings looking for jobs.  


I need advice. First problem is that I now have a big red flag of ""job hopper"" as my work history. Second problem is that I'm massively far off what I want to do, my skills are sorta useful for backend, but it seems that every backend job I apply for turns out to be a DevOps job in disguise, and the longer I spend in this field, the harder it is to explain why I'm applying for a junior embedded role.  


Would going back to college for a masters help? Should I keep applying for embedded roles? Or should I stick to backend and see if I can switch maybe 5 years from now?"

They are classified as an essential business because they essentially help keep the lights on for the local area. 

I’ve been working remotely for the past 6 weeks or so without much trouble. In that time, I’ve gone back to live with my family on the western side of my state (which has WAY more COVID than the eastern side). 

The state has recently allowed certain counties on the east side to reopen (including the one my company is in). A few days ago I got an email from the company saying that they are reopening their office in 2 weeks and calling their employees back. However I’m very nervous about going back to the office at this time. 

Im NOT immuno-compromised or anything like that. I just don’t want to bring back any COVID with me from the west side. 

My question is:  From a legal standpoint is the argument of “I’ve been in a hot-zone for the last few weeks and don’t want to bring any covid back with me” enough to justify refusing to return to work?"
gpvx76,0,2020-05-24,Master degree in Germany?,_sinking_star,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/gpvx76/master_degree_in_germany/,"Hello everyone, I’m an Italian girl with a bachelor degree in physics from University of Milan (recently graduated). I’ve been thinking about getting a master degree in Germany for quite some time (great universities and good way of learning the language), but I have some doubts in regards to the application process. 
I don’t really care about going to a specific university or living in a specific city, to me it doesn’t really make much of a difference as long as I can find programs taught in English ( I’m interested in astrophysics/mathematical engineering/data science/computational science/physical engineering).  
What I don’t understand is what the selection process is based on; how much does GPA actually count? And job experience? 
In Italy we’re forced to take our university exams in June/July/September and we spend the whole summer studying, so it’s almost impossible to do internships if you’re a full time student, especially with STEM faculties. My GPA is also not that brilliant, more than acceptable in Italy for physics but I’m not sure how that would be translated into the German system. 
Any information is highly appreciated! Thanks in advance"
gpw16y,578,2020-05-24,Why is on-campus recruitment so much easier to get in than off-campus for the same role by the same person?,infiniy_1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gpw16y/why_is_oncampus_recruitment_so_much_easier_to_get/,"Top companies like Google and Microsoft end up taking freshers and interns from my university but they don't care about the skills you have or projects you've completed. But if I apply outside, they sort of expect you to be an expert in the field and list down a wide array of skills necessary.

So the process is also very short on campus. We have a maximum of 2-3 rounds per company and at most 2 one hour interviews but off campus, people usually have 7-8 rounds involving DSA, system design and even behavioral rounds.

Why is there such a stark contrast? Why do companies even take people who have nil projects and skills just because they passed the much easier and shorter interview rounds but reject people who aren't simply but the best off campus who could end up doing much more work?"

I recognize that they're both amazing schools and I'm incredibly grateful to be able to choose between them, but I'm very conflicted about this choice and I'd appreciate any advice.

I'm primarily interested in math/compsci/econ and want an entrepreneurial environment, which seems like it would be better at Penn, but at the same time I'm not too keen about basically being second-tier to the Wharton kids when it comes to recruiting for internships/jobs. However, if I go to Penn I'd apply to dual-degree with Wharton and I should have a good chance of getting that if I plan it out, so this might not be an issue.

For Columbia, I definitely would have more opportunities to do internships throughout the school year and would be on a level playing field w/ everyone else in terms of recruiting, but because of the Core curriculum I wouldn't be able to go in-depth into advanced math/CS courses (although I do think I'd enjoy the humanities classes in the Core since I really like learning about philosophy &amp; literature as well).

I feel like Penn would provide me with a traditional college experience and more academic freedom, but Columbia's location and better math dept/research opps is pretty appealing too.

Overall I'm just very confused atm and don't want to make a decision that I'll end up regretting later. Any advice would be appreciated!"

I function like a homeschooler but they give me a 2k yearly stipend for curriculum and stuff and I get a early college advisor and an educational facilitator. (15/F)

Everything before freshman in highschool: (chronological)

• Invited and attended a Whitehouse conference about women's rights in 2016
• attended an environmental science focused middle school in 6th grade
• VEX robotics for a year (never continued bc of how sexist the competition was)
• TAG student (tested wildly high in 6th grade) 
• Switched to the rural charter homeschool so I could be challenged; 7th grade (I was shoving pencils up my nose in math class because I had already finished the math curriculum for the year in april, the twat decided to fail me and three other students because we did so)
 • Tedx youth talk in 7th grade about inclusion for kids with disabilities
8th gradewas chill bc of spinal fusion recovery, I'm bionic

Freshman: 
• Alongside my regular hs classes, I took a fall semester bio-med engineering class and a spring semester urban design class 
• Classroom assistant in a preschool-2nd grade science class at a local science museum 
• job shadow an employee at hanger prosthetics

FUTURE--

Sophomore:
• Model U.N 
• Mock trials
• Starting ""early college"" program in the spring semester with one American sign language class at a community college
• Helping with outreach for a program called Crip the Vote (election year)
• Hopefully going to be a classroom assistant again
• ornithology college class
• electronic textiles semester class

So far..

Junior and senior (nothing specific yet)
• continue college classes to earn an associate's 
• continue model UN 
• continue mock trial until senior year
• intern or job shadow at OHSU hospital

College: attend Oregon State for two years and double major in business/computer engineering receive honors bachelor's 
Continue at ivy for masters while working.

Should I add anything? Anyone in the cascadia region know of any cool job shadow opportunities? Former/current OSU engineering students?"

I have recently revisited a psychiatrist. I’ve been diagnosed wit BPD, am on meds and will be getting therapy soon, so on with my point. 

I (22f) always was a more chunky person. Heavily overweight but nothing serious that people would share concern. When I turned 18 and went to university I decided to go vegan for a bit because of the healthy benefits of it, and because I wanted to finally lose weight. I wasn’t overly obsessed, just ready to make a change. I started going to the gym and lifted weights, did cardio, the works. 

As the weight dropped and I became fitter, my body turning to chunky to a curvy woman, I became more self conscious. I became so critical of myself, thinking I was just as fat, if not more so than before despite knowing I lost weight and am thinner. My self hatred began to manifest over the years. 

Cut to graduation of university, July 2020, life began unwinding and going from messy to hell. I became severely depressed from losing everything I cared about. I gained weight, more than I had in years. I wasn’t fat anymore, but I wasn’t who I constantly wanted myself to be. The previous summer I resulted in starving myself to 1000 calories a day to lose weight, sitting in ice baths and doing cardio before heading to my internship with coffee as my breakfast. 

I developed body dysmorphia, finding myself being critical of people with great bodies, and catching myself doing this regularly, and I’d wonder... why do I think they’re fat? They’re not. 

Now, whenever I return to social media, which is filled with fitness influencers and people in crazy amazing shape and I just cry instantly. I feel so horrible and gross. 

I feel so damn worthless. I want to enjoy social media but it nothing but a trigger for me now. I know with time I can get help, but somehow, I just want to end up being as good as them. I just want to finally be like them, even though I know deep down, it’s not realistic for my type of body. At least not for someone who does anything fitness related professionally."

**Reflection:**

* ·  Most of my results went as expected. However, I was extremely happy with my NYU Stern, UT Austin Business Honors, and Georgetown acceptances. I chose UT because of the scholarship (yay no debt!) and I really liked the campus/program.
* ·  I honestly ran out of time on applications and so my Amherst, Duke, Penn, and Cornell supplements were not nearly as good as they should have been. I focused on the schools that I had a good shot at and ended up falling behind on my dream school applications.
* ·  I should have taken more help from others. I tried to figure out college admissions on my own for the most part, and it resulted in me doing things that didn't help my application.
* ·  I missed a lot of opportunities in high school. I am in an area with a lot of universities and companies, so I had ample places to do research and get internships, but I either started looking too late/ had no idea where to start.
* ·  Since I went to a very competitive high school (50 kids/ 10% of the class are going to t25 colleges this year), I compared myself too much and always though my grades/scores weren't enough. I wished I didn't spend so much time stressing out about this and focused more on extracurriculars.
* ·  **Overall, I am very happy with where I am going, but disappointed that I missed many opportunities. If I could do it again, I would take more help and figure out how to manage my time better.**

**Advice:**

* ·  **Explore your interests and find your niche.** I think its important to spend your days as an underclassman trying to explore what you are interested in. Try things but don't be afraid of quitting them or trying something completely new. This is how you find your ""niche"" or a common theme/interest that you follow through your activities. The things that make up the bulk of your application usually occur during late sophomore/junior year.
   *  I did a lot of activities like Tae Kwon Do, Science Olympiad, Model UN, Robotics, and DECA in freshman/sophomore year. I continued in these activities that I was clearly not succeeding in or enjoyed. They helped me a lot in figuring out what I liked, but they didn't end up on my application and took away valuable time from activities that would have helped me a lot more.
* ·  **GPA matters**. This doesn't mean all A+'s, but I think in general getting \*mostly\* As and taking 8-12 APs are important. GPA undeniably indicates long-term hard work and is the best way for colleges to weed out lazier students, since EC's/test scores can be based on luck/resources. I think SAT/ACT scores matter much less than GPA and EC's once you get to 1480+/34+.
* ·  **Take help from counselors, teachers, and older students.** You can learn about a lot of opportunities from them. They have actual experience and can tell you exactly how to pursue and opportunity or at least point you in the right directions.
   * At a parent teacher conference, my history teacher told my mom about a program that became a key point in my application, simply because my mom talked about my interests to her.
* ·  **Get your college list down early. And have dream colleges. And demonstrate interest.** Application season is the final stretch and the last thing you want to do is fail this part because you ran out of time. It is important to select your colleges wisely and fall in love with the schools, so you are motivated to put in your best effort into the application and demonstrated interest.
   * I just planned to apply to most of the T20s as well as a bunch of targets/safeties for scholarships. Reality hit in the fall and I ended up only applying to four T20s. And a lot of those applications were half-assed.

Overall, I think **colleges are really looking for initiative** from students. Test scores/GPA show that you are hardworking and smart, but colleges want students who can lead a group and actually put their ideas into motion. This is why leadership is important, but you need to demonstrate that you took initiative for leadership positions to matter. Personally, I held a lot of leadership positions and demonstrated initiative in them. I think that's why even without any major awards I was still able to get into some pretty good colleges. You can demonstrate initiative beyond leadership as well. Students who publish research and start non-profits show colleges that they can turn ideas into action. Of course, awards/recognition validates this initiative. This is why some people get into amazing colleges without anything insanely special."
gpzv8n,69,2020-05-24,How much should I get paid?,sharhar,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/gpzv8n/how_much_should_i_get_paid/,"I was lucky enough to be able to get a tech internship where I can work remotely and now I have to negotiate my pay, something which I have never had to do in my life. I worked for this startup last summer and I was paid minimum wage (15$ an hour where I live), but now that I'm not an inexperienced highschool student my dad says that I should be payed more. In order to help me negotiate I was wondering how much other CS students at Berkeley get payed for summer internships so I could hopefully have some data to back up my demands (currently I'm thinking of asking for 20 to 25 and hour, but I honestly have no idea how reasonable that is)

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

I need to get a 3.0 in order to qualify for most decent internships. I wanted to spend this summer gaining skills like coding languages and some databases. So, in order to get a 3.0 before fall/winter application season (since most good companies hold applying in NOV-DEC), I need to take a summer class and get an A or higher. 

I was wondering, if this is overkill or if getting that 3.0 before internship application season + my coding skills will give me a real chance and a decent internship. Is 2.9 enough? Why are 2.9 and a 3.0 so different. What can I do? Thank you for all your advice, truly!"

Are non-summer internships common? When does recruitment happen for those?

**TLDR;** 

* **General background info for my situation**
* **How important is an internship junior year?**
* **How should I go about securing an internship with me (possibly) going to study abroad in London from October 1- December?**
* **I am extremely confident in my brother and I's ability to make something out of our business. Am I making a mistake in possibly not wanting an internship for the summer after my junior year?**

I've been grinding away as most as I can while at home during the quarantine. During this time, I have been given more thought to my career and I realize that I should be preparing more for the future, and begin to think long and hard about my decisions.

The most relevant work experience I have right now was being a TA for Intro to Programming in Python this past semester, which was a great experience. However, I have no internship experience. In terms of projects, I have been doing a lot of game development with my brother both individually and collaboratively. We're working very hard on starting a business mostly surrounding that. This has become very much a reality, and more so for him

In fact, he has realized that college isn't for him, and he's straight up going the entrepreneur route. For me, I very much want to stay in college and finish my degree. I also am keeping my mind open to other possibilities, which the main reason for this post

I am uncertain on how to proceed this upcoming semester. If my abroad doesn't get canceled, I will be going October 1, over a month after my university will start classes. I know that I will be missing October-December, the time when employers will be hiring for internships.

While I am focused on my brother and I's business, I am just as fixed on internship prospects for the work experience and for the possibility of changes in the future for senior year and beyond. What is the best way to go about securing an internship with me missing October-December?

Of course, there is also the possibility of me going even harder on my brother and I's endeavor, meaning I would pass up on trying for an internship junior year? Is that a mistake?"

gq7taw,2,2020-05-25,Are these red flags for a position? Should I leave my job while in for clearance (situation described)?,icodemydreams,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gq7taw/are_these_red_flags_for_a_position_should_i_leave/,"TL;DR: Graduated this month, waiting for clearance at current position. No additional work provided while wait for clearance is making me look for externally for work. One position raised flags due to requiring employee to pay their internally developed boot camp/training program if one leaves prior to a year. I am obsessively applying to jobs and family think it’s unhealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

I finally graduated at the beginning of this month and like many of you, am having a tough time finding employment. I am currently an intern at government contractor that I have been with for several years. My work sponsored me for a security clearance roughly 1.5 years ago. Because of this, I am trying to stay with the company, if possible at all, but since I am not receiving any new work and my attempts at finding a new position internally are not going well, I have decided to venture out for more opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done two external interviews recently. One company has me worried, as I have read the Glassdoor reviews in which the employee found travel requirements to be a lot more than stated, a three month “company boot camp” must be done, salary is capped at 50k until the first customer which is about 6-9 months after being accepted and if you leave prior to a year of work you must partially repay some of the training. This is something that was not mentioned in the interview and I find a bit concerning. Is it common to have these restrictions? 

&amp;#x200B;

The second job, I am very excited about, is a full stack position, I got through two rounds and the interviewers stated they liked some of my answers. However, I know that I messed up in some fundamental concepts and was noticeably nervous. I followed up with the recruiter the day after, stating my interest and was told I would get a response after the hiring manager makes a decision. I feel that my chances are low because of the aforementioned details and the fact that candidate from 0-5 years of experience are allowed to apply, thus there must be way more experienced developers applying.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I search and apply for jobs almost daily. My mom and girlfriend stated I am doing so in an unhealthy way but I feel a bit useless here at home, plus I want to help pay bills have a pup to take care of financially. Can I ask how you are/would handle this situation?"

I’m wondering if I should start looking now? I’m halfway through the math series, physics series, and starting OChem soon. I’m not really sure how being further into my degree would impact my eligibility for internships (free or paid) and was wondering if I could get some advice on it? When do you guys start looking for internships? Does my internship need to be specific to my degree? I’m a chemical engineering major and I imagine it will be harder finding an internship for that in my area since it’s a lot less common so I was figuring I may have to settle for a mechanical engineering internship or something"

gqbece,28,2020-05-25,Things to Never Do When Talking to a Current Student [Rant + AMA],sneakiesneakers,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/gqbece/things_to_never_do_when_talking_to_a_current/,"Disclaimer: most of my interactions with prospective/admitted students are totally fine. I've just had a string of bad ones lately and felt the need to vent. Enjoy!

Inevitably stupid questions

You might think, ""I thought there were no stupid questions!"" This is very wrong, at least when talking to someone who carved out time in their schedule to meet with you. Offer them something in return - at least the pleasure of knowing that they gave back in a meaningful way. Don't let them hang up the phone thinking, ""there's another hour of my life that I'll never get back, and I didn't even give them anything they couldn't Google.""

Examples of stupid questions:

* Q: What's the weather like?
* A: How is this going to materially impact your decision to attend or your application strategy beyond what you can Google? Don't ask this question. A better question would be, ""I'm from Brazil and I've never seen snow. How do students from tropical climates handle the New Hampshire winters?"" or something.
* Q: Are there any entrepreneurship opportunities on your campus?
* A: You can literally start a business at any time in life. No one is stopping you. The better question is, ""Can you tell me about the exciting entrepreneurship support that your school uniquely offers?"" An even better question is, ""I saw online that you have X program to support entrepreneurial students. How cool! Can you tell me any more about it or connect me with a student in the program so I can learn more?""
* Q: Can you negotiate your internship and full-time offers?
* A: This is incredibly dependent on a number of factors, including what you recruit for and your own comfort with negotiations. If you aren't recruiting for the same thing I'm recruiting for, then I likely have little insight into the former, and I definitely have no insight into the latter. Also see the weather question - how is this going to impact whether you attend or apply to this school? It might impact your decision to pursue your MBA at all, but honestly that's a pretty superficial reason to turn away from this journey.
* Q: How hard are the classes?
* A: Guys. The class that I think is the hardest is one that my classmate thinks is the easiest. We all come from different backgrounds, abilities, natural inclinations, willingness to put effort into academic pursuits, etc., etc., etc. I have no good answer to this question and I really don't know what you want me to say. You can choose your classes. Know yourself, know how hard you want your academic experience to be, and choose accordingly.

Bonus (negative) points if you do all these questions in a monotone and full of filler words (like maybe you're coming up with them on the spot and don't have them prepped in advance??)

Aggressive LinkedIn invitations

There are several things you need to do before connecting to someone on LinkedIn. A cold invitation is not beneficial for you. First, have the conversation. Second, decide if the conversation went well. Third, decide if you're going to stay in touch. Fourth, ACTUALLY stay in touch. And only after you've demonstrated multiple touchpoints with this person who is now invested in your future should you send them a LinkedIn request.

Note: there's absolutely no obligation to turn a ""tell me about your school so I can write a better essay"" call into a longer term relationship. My feelings aren't hurt if you take 30 minutes to pump me for info and then never reach out again - I honestly won't remember your name a week later, and that doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Read the room (phone call) - and know how to work it

First, let's take that last part literally. Don't send me a Zoom invite if you've never hosted a Zoom call before, because it's not the most intuitive technology and you're going to waste about 10 of our 30 minute call trying to find the unmute button, figure out your video, etc.

Second, please don't send me a video chat link unless you specify that your webcam is broken and we should just do a call. As you may know, Zoom fatigue is real, and I find phone calls to be a welcome break from being on-camera all the time. (You can video chat if you truly are willing to invest in developing a relationship with this person, but know this ahead of time and plan accordingly.)

Third, plan your call, agenda-wise. Don't ask ""one more question"" at the 30 minute mark unless you get confirmation from the student that they're okay with running over, because after you ask the question, then I answer, then you summarize to show understanding, express thanks for the call, ask for a referral, I promise to send along and wish you luck, etc....we're at the 40 minute mark. (If the conversation is flowing naturally and you have good chemistry, then it could be appropriate to run over time, but make sure the person on the other side of the phone feels the same!)

Spell my name correctly...

...but if you're not going to do that, at least get your OWN name right?

WHY is your first name in the Gmail contact card spelled differently from your first.last@gmail email address which is different from your signature at the bottom of the email? How does that happen?!

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, if you've gotten this far in the essay, feel free to AM(A)A. I'd love to workshop ideas for good questions, make the networking with current students thing less painful, help out with application strategy, etc. I won't reveal school/identifying info, but otherwise happy to help in any way I can - truly!"

gqbhqc,0,2020-05-25,Coworker calls himself a python expert but he has less experience than me,HegelStoleMyBike,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gqbhqc/coworker_calls_himself_a_python_expert_but_he_has/,"My Coworker joining the team today was introduced to me by my manager as a ""Python expert"" but I looked at his LinkedIn and he has about 1 years of internship experience and this is his first full time job.

gqby7q,27,2020-05-25,My mom found my birth control and wants to kick me out ...,[deleted],AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/gqby7q/my_mom_found_my_birth_control_and_wants_to_kick/,"To start off my bf and I are both 20. I’m full Vietnamese and my bf is half black, half white. We starting dating towards the end of high school so we’ve been together for around 2 years. We’ve been sexually active probably for a year and a half. We always try to use protection and I started going on the pill around October. 

I’ve been ordering clothes, makeup, etc. ever since I was 16 and once they arrive, no one opens my packages but lately since this winter, my mom has been opening my packages without my permission. One time I ordered menstural cups online and she literally kept my menstural cups hostage from me because she was like why the hell are you using these, it’s going to ruin your vagina and give you cancer (literally threw away my box of tampons before). I was going to have my birth control deliver to my bf’s place but since I’m almost always home due to corona I thought it would be fine to deliver to my place. HUGE MISTAKE. I’ve been keeping a close eye with the tracking single everyday and it was supposed to arrive on Tuesday (May 25th) but it arrived yesterday (Sunday). I was out with my bf (also yesterday) when I randomly decided to check the tracking number on my birth control. It said it was delivered at 12 pm and by the time I checked it, it was around 3pm. I frantically call my 16 year old brother to hurry up and bring my package inside. He picked up the 1st call but once I called and texted numerous times to check if he bought my package inside, I didn’t get a response until he texted me probably an hour later that he was walking back inside when my 33 year old sister snatched the package before he could even get it back inside. Of course I don’t blame my little brother, he did the best he could but my sister on the other hand is a different story.

My sister is 33 and still lives at home with us (typical Asian thing). I have no problem with her staying with us because I mean I’m 20 and I have to commute an hour to college everyday to help my family save money. It’s just that she’s the biggest bitch I’ve ever met. My sister just brings the worst out of my mom and even influences her decisions. I even have a theory that my sister has been the one who tells my mom to open my packages. Of course I know it’s going to be hard for my Asian parents to respect my interracial relationship, let alone any relationship. My bf isn’t the best the richest or smartest person in the world but I see something in him. He’s going to community college, which is fine, but that was a big no to my family. He also had to stop school for a little to save up for a car, which you know of course just didn’t look good for him at all. I mean I’m not naive and of course I know I’m not dating a future CEO or a doctor but I always push my bf to try harder to be more successful in life. Every time my mom slowly starts to like my bf a little, my sister completely shuts it down and says he’s a loser and will never amount to anything and makes sure that my mom is even MORE strict on me. I remember one time I asked my mom to let my bf over for Halloween. Now before I even finished the fact that we were going to be at home inside the house the whole time (at my house, not his), my sister butted in the conversation and said that  I was going to go to the club on Halloween which was completely false and something she came up in her head. 

My sister’s also a huge petty bitch to me in general. She cusses at me all the time, in person, and over text. I never say a word but one time she texted me “get your ass home” after she noticed I went out. I got mad and said “I’m at fucking work”, which I really was, but she got super mad at me and said I was being disrespectful towards her (first time I cussed her at all). When I came home later that night, my mom yelled at me for being rude to my sister. My mom said that my sister told her that all she asked was where was I going and that I was the ONLY one who said a cuss word, which was COMPLETE lie. I corrected my mom and said that my sister was lying and she cusses me out all the time. When my mom talked to sister about what I said, she completely disregarded the fact they she lied about cussing at me and her argument was that she said “ass” which was a better cuss word than “fucking”. 

When I came home I was looking everywhere for my package. When I couldn’t find it, I asked my little brother where was it and he said that it was under the table in the family room. My mom was asleep when I came home and grabbed the package ,however, when I was eating dinner (the kitchen and family room are connected), she was awake but my dad was sitting in the same room so all she said was that she opened the package and I was old enough to make my own decisions. I had a suspicion that my mom didn’t say much because my dad was present but I was just glad she didn’t throw my medication away because even though I have insurance, my bf paid all my birth control and also plan b in full (around $70). 

Early next morning (today) I hear a knock on my bedroom door. It was at 7 am so I was half asleep when I opened the door. My mom barged in and said that I’ve amounted to nothing and that I’m worthless. She said that she will throw away all my birth control and to never see my bf again or she’ll kick me out. I had an older brother that passed away about 5 years ago to cancer. She said that if I don’t choose her over my bf she will disown me and see me as if I died just like my brother. 

I need some time to think about what just happened before I do something I regret. I could let her throw away all the birth control and just be more secretive about my relationship so I could stay in the house to save my ass or just move out and be disowned. I mean  I have an okay job and I have 5.5k in my savings. Of course, I’m not stupid and I know it won’t last long if I move out. I probably would have to move in with my bf and his family, but I mean eventually we’ll both have to move out. I can’t just keep free loading his parents. I would also lose my car and I’ll probably have to get my bf drive me around for work and stuff. A huge benefit with my moving out is that I won’t be questioned every time I go out, I know this sounds dumb but I have horrible attention span at home so I always study in the library or cafe (I mean better than not studying at all). My parents would always yell and question if I’m really at the library/cafe whenever I tell them I can’t study at home. They would also get mad at me for coming late from work after I work double shifts. 

I would love any input or suggestions about what I’m going through but please don’t be rude. I just wish my family could understand that I’m an adult and I need freedom too. They can’t just keep me locked from the world and expect me to remain a virgin for the rest of my life. I mean all I want to do in life is be successful enough to be able to take care of them but they never think I can amount to anything. I mean I admit I’m not getting super good grades but I try so so hard and I even had an internship at a clinic over the winter. 

I mean you would expect that since my parents are so strict, they must be well educated and have really good jobs but that’s not the case. We’re not dirt poor but I definitely didn’t have an easy childhood so I’m always happy to help them with English translations and technology because they’re very limited in their English skills. Now I’m not 100% fluent in Viet and nor can I read or write in it but literally one time NONE of my cousins or siblings (some of which know even better Vietnamese than me and speak English fluently as well) would come to my grandma’s Glaucoma surgery appointments and I had to literally had to use google translate half of the time to explain what was going on to my dad and my aunts so the surgery could go smoothly. Since my Vietnamese is somewhat limited and I get emotional because I can’t communicate effectively. I was thinking I could use google translate to help me get my point across with my mom by texting her a paragraph or something. Also I have no idea why they think I’m nothing when my sister makes less than 30k a year. She has a bachelor’s in accounting or finance I don’t remember but she couldn’t find a job with her degree (it’s been 10 years since she’s graduated) so she’s literally a receptionist at a medical office. I’d have to go to graduate school after I’m done with my bachelors so I can get my dream job (physical therapist). My sister is snappy and has a horrible attitude with my parents but at least I try to help whenever I can but of course I’m not perfect. My sister also has an advantage because she’s fluent in Vietnamese since she lived in Vietnam until she was a teen. So that’s how she can persuade my mom so easily."
gqcrak,1,2020-05-25,Advice on life,Notwars_star,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/gqcrak/advice_on_life/,"  Hi, if this gets posted it will be great.

Well to cut to the chase, I got kicked out of my course for failing a module 2. Hence I appealed to my school and ask the director of my school for an interview so that I try to convince them to let me in. Ofcourse that led to nothing as I got no interview with them and got my appeal rejected. Ask the director for another way and he said to go for my NS and get a Recommendation letter from my officer and come back and appeal as some of my seniors have done and have been accepted without any complications.

Now as usual I was expecting it but it took me awhile to let it Fully sink in. After it did, I started to plan my life again. In order of what I think i should most likely do
 
1) Do as the director say and serve my NS and after that continue the course I'm in. Work for the intern company

2)Change of course? Which is a problem because I heard if u get kicked out u can't go to other polys. Also the reason behind wanting to Change to another course is because I have started to lose my interest in the course and hence my demise from the course. Also if I went back I'm not sure if I will be able to go to the UNI I want(SIT) as my GPA after was 1.3. However this choice also means I need save up a lot of money as my tuition fees and subsidy will not cover if I change course and have to pay the full amount. Another con is I'll be almost 27-28 with no work experience and a diploma which makes me worry more as I feel like companies will not hire me due to my age.

3)Same as number 1 but this time I continue working with the company I intern at and work a minimum of 3-4 years and then take a part time degree or maybe a full time degree. Either way I'll be earning and trying to progress instead of being stuck at something I might not like. Like I'll have a goal still to push forward to. 

4) Private diploma but only problem is im from a not well to do family which means money will be a problem.

5)Sign on with Navy? I'm keen with being in the navy and ok with taking orders but the only problem I have is if I decide to work for the public sector I might not have any certification and work experience which means I probably won't get a job. Also if I do sign on I want to be an officer but ofc we all know with a diploma your pay will be better. 

This are my plans so far. I have come to accept I have messed up my life with my own bad habits and now I'm trying to make up for it before it's too late. I knw it might be too late to follow my passion but even if it's something I might not enjoy the most I knw its a need for me to push on so I can have a better life then what my family has and make sure my future family will live comfortably. I hope all your advice and tips can help me
With my journey of life."
gqdomj,3,2020-05-25,Not actually sure why I'm doing this,Noobuberrider,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/gqdomj/not_actually_sure_why_im_doing_this/,"I'm just a random bipolor queer guy who never fit in growing up. Middle and high school sucked and I had very few friends. I feel like that's instilled in me some insane complex of falling like I'm always being left out of stuff, even things I don't like (well, then I feel like I'm left out of the things I don't like).

College started better, somehow I made a couple good friends. But soon after the beginning I started to feel shitty again and for all the same reasons. At this point I think it's just my brain and I don't know if I'll ever change. I've been in two relationships and my second one ended like 6 months ago yet of course I'm not over it. I really thought we were going to be together forever. And even though I still felt just as bad at times, that's what's given me hope. I was an idiot and moved away for a period of time to do an internship before coming back to school. Of course, one day they tell me they've realized they are poly and, well, we broke up. That's not unlike what happened in my first relationship and that gave me such a negative association with things that I just couldn't do it. I really, really, wish I could.

If my mind worked right, my life would still be salvageable. I got fine grades at a fine school and already have a job offer. My family, though not physically where I am, are incredibly supportive. I feel like my friends are less close than they were but that's surely my fault. I have not don't a good job at being a good friend, or relationship partner imagine (and who knows if the poly thing was just an excuse). Point being, I could get through all that if I could fix myself now. But I'm too lazy and I've always been.

I've fantasized about suicide for so many years. I don't know exactly when it started but I have a distinct memory of thinking I could do it by shocking myself on a standard American power outlet, so it had to be when I was young enough to think that would really work. But now that I'm living alone, it just seems so much more accessible. I wrote a will (still need to put it in handwriting for a legal reason) and drafted (for like the 5th time) a note. This time though I also ordered a shotgun which is now ready for me to pick up today.

Literally the only consideration I've got about this is how it will effect my family. There's also one friend who's always been so good to me, who I know goes through similar mental issues, that I am worried about.
Part of me thinks this would be the ideal time to do it because I'm separated from people, but I think a counterargument could be made. It would be such a selfish thing to do though. But I've never been much short of a sociopath in life so far, so why is this any different?

Any advice on mitigating my family's suffering would be appreciated. Would something like a drug overdose look better? Or is that again just me being selfish and trying to lie?"

gqe549,5,2020-05-25,Keeping coding skills sharp while working towards a PhD,20yowithnolife,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gqe549/keeping_coding_skills_sharp_while_working_towards/,"Hello! I’m a recent grad who recently made the decision to go for a PhD in computer science. There are a variety of reasons that I decided to do this, including the current job market, the specific research being done, and just the fact that I really enjoy research and discovery and found myself gravitating towards those kinds of jobs when job hunting. I’m also genuinely really excited to do it, the way I wasn’t when I thought I would be going straight into the workforce. I did a research experience the summer after my freshman year, and though I really enjoyed the two internships I did at tech companies the following two summers, I loved the lab environment and the feeling of working with others to discover something new even more. This was another big factor in my decision, despite the fact that I’ve heard some advice from industry professionals against pursuing a PhD. 

One thing that I’ve consistently heard from people who have advised against a PhD is that your programming skills won’t grow the same way they would at an industry job. I completely believe this, and it definitely contributed to my initial hesitation about doing a PhD (even though I know that you gain a lot of other valuable skills while working towards it). I plan to do internships at tech companies during my summers, and my PI encourages this, so I’m hoping that will help. However, I was wondering if anyone had any other suggestions for improving/maintaining my programming skills? I should (crosses fingers) have some free time during the school year, and this summer is pretty open for me, so I’ll have time to potentially do LeetCode problems or maybe work on a side project. I’ve heard that a lot of people come up with ideas for start-ups while working for a PhD (e.g. Sergey and Larry lol) and would definitely be interested in that.  I guess my main question is how I can best spend my time in order to sharpen my programming skills.

Thank you all in advance!"

gqefqy,0,2020-05-25,Please Help me Understand my Friend: Lazy or Overwhelmed?,cheeseypita1994,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gqefqy/please_help_me_understand_my_friend_lazy_or/,"I (25 F) have a friend ""K"" (32 ish M) who has an unusual living situation. It is not my business or place to judge, but I DO want to understand. 

K lives at home and always has. His job history consists of having worked at a grocery store for 6 months several years ago. His parents pay for his college, new car, and everything else. 

K is going to community college and will be transferring to a university next year to finish his bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. He often remarks that his classes are too easy, exams aren't hard enough, and so on. On more than one occasion he's made statements like ""maybe I should just teach this class next semester, I think I know more than the professor does"". From what he says, K seems to be having a pretty easy go of it in school. Bear in mind that K is also EXTREMELY smart, he's got years of experience in coding, working with circuits, and other technical skills.

On the other hand, K complains about living at home, particularly with his dad. When K complains about his home life, I try to suggest ways he can make himself happier. I have suggested he look into internships or a job in his field so that he can get out on his own. I kind of assume he has the time, based off the fact that he goes to Disneyland at least once a week, attends numerous clubs that have nothing to do with his major, goes to several farmer's markets each week, and so on. 

Without fail, K becomes defensive and kind of scoffs off the idea, saying how he couldn't possibly get an internship or job without his grades suffering, how he's already spread way too thin with his studies and he doesn't just want to cheat his way through school like everyone else, he actually cares about learning the material, and so on. K will also remind me that it's crucial he continue his ritual of spending 40-50 hours a week studying at his local Starbucks. 

I am really confused by this, and I would like some objective opinions. K says his classes are too easy and he's more knowledgeable than half his professors, or that they don't expect enough of students. On the other hand, K also says his major is so demanding that he can barely maintain his grades, and he needs every ounce of time to do so, thus making a job laughably out of the question. Which is it?"

I’m (21M) a senior in college. This is my last semester as I am graduating at the end of the Summer. 

I’m writing this because I need some advice on what to do about my emotional and mental state. 

My productivity has tanked since the quarantine started. I’m finding it so much harder to be motivated and to be as productive as I usually am. The fact that I haven’t left my house to interact with the university people, commute to the university, and go to the gym and library is seriously taking a toll on my mental stability. I also had to break up with my girlfriend. 

I like to think of myself as independent and disciplined, but this quarantine is really testing the extent to which I hold those qualities. I have to take care of my online class, put in the hours for my internship, and study for the GRE so that I can get a good score. I don’t think I’ve been able to study for the GRE effectively this past month and I’m scared that I won’t be able to before exam day comes. It wouldn’t be so much of a problem if I hadn’t taken the internship, but I took the internship well before I understood what effects this pandemic was gonna have on me and now I need to stick it out. I was expecting to be able to handle these 3 things all at once, I can usually do so much more, but now I’m really struggling to be effective. 

I feel like between my break up and the quarantine, I’ve just been bombarded with how limited my capabilities as a person are. I need to find a way to brute force my way through the psychological impact of what’s going on with me personally and with the world.

gqm8e5,0,2020-05-25,Choosing between fellowship vs internship,purple11762,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gqm8e5/choosing_between_fellowship_vs_internship/,"So I was offered a fellowship and am internship this summer and I am trying to figure out which one to do. I am currently a sophomore in college. 

My first option is a fellowship which is  40 hours a week 12 weeks long and I get $6k. It seems to be more of an independent research project related to critical intelligence with a professor as a mentor . I would be working on training ML models for rapid modeling of data and to simulate population behavior. The organization that I'm working with is affiliated with my school and has received funding from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.

My other option is a part time 8 week internship with a wireless communication lab associated with my school and I get $2k. I would be working on using machine learning to design self driving cars for a smart city scenario. I would be in a team of undergrads and grads, and the project would be lead by either a graduate or a professor. I would also get a mentor who would either be a grad or a professor. The lab I will be working at is also affiliated with my university

I was wondering which opportunity would be more impressive/useful when trying to get a future internship at some of the big band companies(like Google etc). I think both projects are similar, but the fellowship seems more independent, but has a higher pay out. I have heard that companies typically like when you are working in a team. I have asked some people about the internship who have previously done it and they sometimes it can get a little stagnant and it relies a lot on how much you put into it. I've also considered doing both but I feel like that probably isn't a smart idea due to one being full time. 

Which one should I choose? My main goal is to get set up for a big name internship for junior year summer."

I'm a rising junior in biomedical engineering, and unfortunately, I didn't manage to get an internship for the summer.

What are some programming languages/certifications/project ideas I can learn and work on this summer that are relevant to the device industry? Some of my ideas include improving my skills in SolidWorks and buying a kit to build a 3D printer (although I'm not sure what I would print..).

I mean I’ve looked at posts on here because I feel like it’s an unbiased place where people give there honest opinion. I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I really just need to get shit off my chest. I feel so alone. There’s nothing I do that makes me feel better other than smoking, which usually only helps about 30% of the time, and the other 70% I just get more sad and in my own head when I’m high. I’m the middle child in my family, yet I’ve always taken the role as the leader. My father died when me and all my siblings were young. I’ve never realized it up until these last few years of my life (I’m 19) but it’s left a huge hole in my life. I constantly feel empty and alone because I always feel like I need to be perfect for my mother yet set an example for my siblings because I am the only one who seems to be doing well in life. I have amazing grades and internships in line. I have so many friends. So many people genuinely care about me and love me, yet I feel so alone. I don’t know why. I just want to be happy in life. I sit in my room and think about everything I have and wonder why I’m so sad. My mother has done nothing but be incredibly wonderful to us and has done the absolute best she can to raise us. She makes good money, and has provided us with everything we will need in life. I feel like I can never come to her with anything because why would I? She’s done nothing but work hard and care for us so why would I stress her out even more? And it sucks because I don’t even feel like I can talk to my brothers because of how immature they are. I’m constantly having to remind them (especially my older brother) to do things like clean the dishes, turn off the TV, do things our mother asked us to do, and just about every other basic house hold task most humans can do. I feel so pathetic for venting about something so trivial, but I feel like I have no safe space because I’m either trying to impress my mother/get her attention or trying to make sure my brothers do what the fuck their supposed to do. It’s been weighing on me for years, and it’s just all built up and I’m tired of it. I’m tired of trying to parent them because it’s not my job. The highlight of my week is getting fucked up with my friends and going to parties. The only thing I care about is forgetting my life and just absorbing my friends attention because it’s the only thing I have in my life that I know won’t fail me. The other day, my younger brother came to my room to give me something and as he was leaving, he accidentally said “thanks dad”. It sounds so minuscule, but why would he call me that? We don’t have a dad. We never have. Why would he suddenly decide to use that word. I love that I can be somebody that my brothers look up to, but the responsibility weighs on my shoulders like a truck, even though it shouldn’t. I know I should be grateful for my life, and I am extremely grateful, I just wished all the eyes weren’t on me to be doing my best. My mom had 5 siblings, so that means lots of cousins. I love them, a lot, but I know what they think of me. I am younger than most of them, and a lot of them look at me as just a drunk college kid who is too into himself. I don’t know how to describe it, but I constantly feel like I’m being judged around them. This doesn’t apply to all, there are a few who I genuinely feel 100% comfortable around and trust, I just wish I could feel that way about all of them. Again, I know how stupid that sounds but we were always with our cousins growing up because as siblings our parents were very close, so I just wished they wouldn’t look at me the way they usually do. I try so hard to be the best I can be for my mom. I really do. I make dinner most nights for our family. Again, I’m about to sound pathetic and stupid, but I hate it. I cook alone in the kitchen for usually 2 hours because I want them to like what I cook. It’s so important to me. But I hate being alone. Just cooking and knowing it’s only for them. I don’t know if just makes me feel even more alone. I know my brothers likely also struggle with similar feelings given that we all experienced the same losses and struggles, which makes me feel weak for complaining so much about it. I’ve just never said any of this stuff out loud so I just felt like I needed to put it somewhere. My youngest brother was born with a heart disease and had to get a heart transplant because of it, which occurred simultaneously with my dad getting cancer and dying, which made everything 1000x worse for my mother. It’s stuff like this that makes me never want to tell my mother anything, because I absolutely hate the idea of her worrying about me. It just doesn’t sit right after everything she’s done, she doesn’t deserve to stress more. I don’t know. Again, I’m sorry if this is not the right sub reddit. I genuinely just don’t know. If you have actually read this far, thank you. That means more to me than you know."

gqv31t,24,2020-05-26,MBB Dubai Exit ops: PE - SWFs / Regional Tech HQ?,Nem3sisS,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/gqv31t/mbb_dubai_exit_ops_pe_swfs_regional_tech_hq/,"Hi all,

It's been just over 1.5 years for me at an MBB based in Dubai and have been thinking more and more about exiting - I feel seriously burned out (hours in the region are much tougher the global average - finishing at midnight is considered a good project), had to work \~1/4 of weekends this year (full day if not 2) and starting to get really sick of all travel. The lifestyle started taking a toll on my mental health, personal relationship and at this point I don't really think it's worth it. On top of all with C-19/Oil price crash it seems the one thing that kept me going - promotion - might be not be as safe as it seemed 6m ago. 

Am I quitting too soon? Probably. I am aware the best exit ops come at manager level, but I just don't think it's for me and right now I want to make the best exit possible.

Unlike some of my peers I did not join consulting having a post-consulting plan or dream job - I  quite joined consulting naively thinking this was my dream job. The result is I now find it difficult to have a specific industry as target in mind. I am attracted to the region - really good pay with zero income tax, high quality of life, superb weather 7-8 months of the year - and would like to stick around. Looking at the overlap of what is in the region and what I'm interested in, 2 industries come up: PE (more specifically Sovereign Wealth Funds that do PE and Family Funds as there are few true ""PEs"") and regional tech HQ offices (AWS, Facebook).

I tend to lean towards SWFs, but anticipate a much more difficult transition (what I hear is they preffer IB alumni). On the other hand, while I am really interested in tech, the scope of the work would be regional and likely more operational, rather than proper global strategy - which I do not expect to be as exciting.

My background is somewhat suitable for both: After my MSc in Economics (with minor in Technology Strategy) and before joining MBB I completed two 3-month long internships - one in Real Estate Investment Manager/Advisory in London and another at a Tech Series A VC fund operating in CEE. As per my MBB experience the most relevant project was a massive asset divestment strategy for a O&amp;G giant.

What do you think in terms of pros/cons of regional PE vs tech? Would a transition to a PE / Sovereign Wealth Fund be doable? Any advice on how to approach the SWF &amp; Private/Family PEs? I know the region is very headhunter-based and I am a bit behind in the game with that.

Thanks!"

I learnt basic C++ as it was an introductory course. Then, came the vacations, so I took a Data Structures course and started doing competitive programming. I was enjoying all of this, but then one of my friends build a really cool website for sharing notes in the college campus and I thought to myself I also have some ideas of my own, so I started learning web development. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and as I was planning to begin my web developer journey, I saw my whole college rushing and running towards the conference hall, so I also went in to see if we are getting free pizzas. There I saw Andrew Ng with a mic in his hand who was creating all the buzz. Sadly I sat hoping for a pizza at the end but that 50 minutes blew me completely. I literally had no idea about the power of machine learning and those neural nets of Andrew trapped me completely.   

I left everything, completed his courses and started building and training my models. I was loving all of this and on top, it was also bringing some amounts of money from the hackathons and competitions. That year, bitcoins prices shot really up and the curious me got into blockchain and even went to China for internship in a blockchain company. 
Then came the college job placements and I got the job as a Software Developer in a really big firm. 

Since the joining got delayed due to the current lockdown, I had nothing to do, so I decided to complete some of my previous projects that I left in the middle because of some other project.
As I began looking through them, nostalgia started hitting me, I remembered those times of learning it the first time and all the fun that I had through that journey but then I felt really awful. I started feeling that I’ve missed a lot of things in a particular domain just because I wanted to do something new. I stopped doing competitive coding for web, web for Machine learning, machine learning for blockchain and whatnot. 

I look at my friends and some of them are ranked among the top competitive coders, some are full stack developers and now I’m feeling that I should’ve had stuck to one thing and be really good at it, instead of doing all of the things. 
I sure as hell know about all of those things but I’m not an expert in any of it and now I think I’ve made a fool out of myself and my college years.

What should I do? Should I start focusing on one thing from now on or is it too late?"

A little bit about myself:

* I have a pretty average GPA of around 3.3.
* I haven’t really had any internships or relevant experiences, avoided &amp; procrastinated with applying for jobs back in my earlier years due to my declining mental health. I should really visit the therapist, but I can’t really afford it at the moment.  
I would use the excuse of building my resume before I apply for jobs, but I’d end up not doing anything. Or sometimes I’d give up after the 2nd or 3rd rejection email.
* I’ve only got around 2 years experience as a low level IT support at my local library.
* I haven’t written many projects. I have issues of not being able to decide what projects to do, then I would forget about doing it at all, and then its back to indecision, and the cycle continues.
* I can be quite a recluse when my mental health is not at a good state, which is why I don’t really have many friends to ask for support or advice.

Initially when I started studying CS, I wanted to become a quant dev (still really do!), but it seems like a real longshot in my current situation.

Now I’m just trying to get my life back on track. Can anyone help me hatch some sort of plan to perhaps put my life back on track to getting a ‘fulfilling’ career?

Also I’m not sure on what I should be prioritizing in the next 6 months. Should I be working on notable projects? Or sending out my resume to as many companies as possible? Or should I be grinding leetcode 24/7 and reading coding interview books?

**My Background:**

1. **8.0/10.0 CGPA**(I major in Chemistry, Our institute has one of the most stringent grading principles, especially so in my pre-major: Mathematics) in an Indian Institute(well known, wont name it here because I’m anonymous). I graduate in 2021 so I still have 2 semesters to pick this up higher. I am scared of my GPA really, because I know it could have been better, but some courses I took really took the piss out of my GPA.
2. I have **3 co-authored papers**(a couple more coming up soon) in very reputed international journals, **1 first author is currently submitted**(2 more coming up soon) also in similarly reputed journals.
3. I have **recommendations from a senior professor and a PI in Cambridge** and have a couple more **recommendations from very well known professors in India**(in my institute and it’s sisters).
4. I have done computation and experiment and have had internships in Cambridge and in India(again within the Indian Institutes) on several niche topics in chemistry and materials science. By virtue of which I have first hand experience in several analytical, synthetic and computational tools that might come in handy in conducting research.
5. I have **won 2 poster awards**( 1 where I got the award out of 1100 posters in the biggest conference in our nation, and another in our department at the institute) and **attended a total of  6 conferences**(3 of them with a travel and accommodation bursary)
6. My thesis is likely to get a distinction or similar grade in the institute(which should massively bring up my GPA as well, but the grades will probably be out after I apply with my unofficial transcript).
7. Extra Curriculars: Been a member and head of student E-cell organizations and institute student committees.

As the COVID-19 pandemic rages my head is filling up with these questions and it would be nice to have a realistic understanding of what my chances are.

Here is the thirteenth (***spoooky***) installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That's completely up to what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.

All the best,

gr3p5z,9,2020-05-26,Failed an important professional exam-going to retake it years later. some encouragement would be helpful,need2focus_throwaway,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/gr3p5z/failed_an_important_professional_examgoing_to/,"I don't know if anybody could relate to this-kind of feel I screwed up things for myself big time but trying to be compassionate with myself and do what I can.

When I was in undergrad, I got into a pretty competitive program based on good high school grades that I got because I worked extremely hard-not because I was smart enough to do well and get by with minimal work. I would pull all-nighters and spend 24/7 focusing on schoolwork. I'd bring my textbooks to parties lol! Very terrible imbalance. 

The program I got into was one of those accelerated ones, like right out of high school. I was on the fence about even doing it because I wanted to spend time in college taking a bunch of classes and picking something I actually enjoyed doing-I wasn't sure if this program was it, but it sounded like too good of a program/opportunity to pass up. 

I guess the best way I can describe what ended up happening is a combination of terrible luck and depression/burnout. I did fairly okay in classes like chemistry or biology because you read the textbook and material and take the exam. For the classes in the program I got into-you need to have experience to make sense of the material. Most students were working while taking these courses. For me, I started applying to jobs and ran into multiple roadblocks trying to get a job without a solid explanation: I did everything my peers did-contact the same people, send multiple emails, phone calls,  interviews with no response, etc. As you can imagine, the tediousness of waiting made me want to just give up, but I went through. I went in person to places and introduced myself. Talked to professors about the situation. Etc. Nothing came out of it. What perhaps made it worse was once when I did have an interview (and practiced beforehand with a neighbor who works in interview prep), the lady interviewing me broke down and talked about how much she hated her job. I was shocked to say the least-I came prepared but was unprepared for that lol.

I researched online and found out there was a job market saturation just kicking off causing a bit of competition for some of these positions, but it was weird that almost all my peers were able to find jobs and I was struggling. It wasn't even that their resumes  were better, we all were applying to these jobs for the first time without prior experience and nobody asked about grades, but I knew my grades were just the same or even higher than some of my peers who were working. It honestly felt like a matter of luck. As a result, my confidence started to plummet: I felt like I couldn't keep up with the material. I was considering dropping out, but with no other solid options, I pushed through the program and managed to not fail any classes (though got plenty of Cs for the first time ever). 

Now for all of us-we have one year which is an externship and we gain experience through there. It was the only hope I had to prove myself or really network for post-graduation job opportunities. But my first opportunity was a disaster: the person in charge was bullying me (and another student) to no end. There was one time she said I was doing a pretty good job and she sees progress, but later she'd change her mind and constantly yell, which would lead me to make some mistakes out of nervousness. I felt defeated, like I could never do this job. Despite that, I still applied to post-graduate positions during my school career fair, ended up meeting one of the ladies who interviewed me a year before for the internship I was applying to and asked her if I still have a chance as I'm in my last year. She's like no, it's too late to be an intern by this point. And I'm like ok, well what about working after I graduate, could I work with no internship experience? And she said likely no. I was in such a conundrum. What was left for me going through this program and anticipate to not getting employed?

After I graduated, we have to take an exam to get licensed. Almost all my peers had jobs lined up and the last thing they needed was to get licensed. To get licensed, you need to know what state you'll be working in, because otherwise it's all different based on state. So I applied to jobs first-I'm not lying, 400+ resumes sent out to various positions. I worked really hard on my CV and cover letters, so I felt like that couldn't explain the situation. No response. I networked with people. Nothing. 

So finally, I decided to suck it up and pick one state to get licensed. During the exam, I broke into a cold sweat because I deep inside there was a feeling I don't know anything and ended up leaving 20 questions blank. I failed the exam by literally 1-2 points. 

During this time, a close relative of mine passed away, and I tried to retake the exam. Failed again by another close margin.

So then I decided to just give up and try something else. There was nothing really going for me. But it was painful to see everybody I knew, including my friends, all pass on the first try while I failed (which is kind of considered a big deal). I was not a bad student-I passed some of the hardest classes, but I couldn't pass this exam. 

I found myself in an alternative career path that doesn't require being licensed and it's working ok for me-finding any job that made a decent salary and was somewhat related to my field was enough after being unemployed for so long.  Which made me realize that I was actually more employable than I thought. I also started realizing how much I undersold myself because I just felt I was not good enough. Now that I think mentally I'm in a stronger place, and have been working with a therapist who will also evaluate me for ADHD in addition to anxiety/depression, I'm considering taking the exam again. It's been 6 years since the time I should have taken it, which is embarrassing to say the least, but I am feeling like passing the exam to provide me some kind of edge or opportunity would be better than not passing at all. 

But I've been obviously online reading about people who delayed getting licensed and people talking about how any employer would see it as a red flag. My stomach is tied into knots knowing that I'm one of the few rotten eggs who failed miserably and should have passed this years ago. I want to be in a good mindset so I can try to pass this time, but I still can't shake off this terrible feeling being an absolute disaster with my whole major and career. 

I'm somebody really sensitive and get triggered easily by my past failures. It sucks because I'm one of the few people who just had terrible luck and perhaps mental health issues that made all of it worse. I try not to compare, but it is a bummer sometimes knowing people have had way worse life situations than mine and still managed to succeed-I don't honestly know what went wrong. It's hard studying for this exam YEARS later, but sometimes I'm proud of myself for not giving up, but other days I feel like curling up into a ball afraid of failure again. My situation is rather specific, so I don't know anybody who's gotten through it, but some encouragement and tips, feedback, constructive criticism, I'm ready to hear anything. Thank you!!"
gr4gcf,27,2020-05-26,Dreams,Superfluous-Doge-2,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gr4gcf/dreams/,"&amp;#x200B;

So ever since I was a kid, I have had weird dreams. Not the type where you wake up laughing or semi confused, but the kind that comes true. You see, at the end of every dream, I would see a small clip of something happening.

Whatever I saw in that clip would happen. The things I saw were simple, like a stranger saying hi or getting a new puppy. It freaked me out at first but I got used to it. At least, until 6th grade. In this dream I was about 20 years old, I owned a black Honda Civic and I lived in New York. It was dark when I got out of work but the warm summer air was comforting.

I got off the subway and started walking down the street towards my car.

There were no people around but I got that strange feeling that someone was watching me. You know, that feeling of dread that makes the hairs on your neck stand up and your gut twist, I got that feeling.

My head started to hurt. About 20 feet from my car, I noticed the odd silence. No crickets, cars, ambient noises, just silence. The air turned cold, ICE cold despite it being a summer night. The streetlights up ahead shut off with a *clap*. One by one the street lights turned off. Closer…. And closer until I was engulfed in darkness. That same, sickening sense of dread came over me. The intense silence was broken by the sound of footsteps, coming closer, and closer until

I felt an ice-cold, skeletal hand on my shoulder. I turned around suddenly to see tall, faceless humanoid creatures who were like shadows against the night sky. Their necks were broken and their limbs deformed and mangled. Blood red eyes that stared into your soul and wide, too wide smiles with sharp teeth and blood-drenched lips. They kept twitching and jerking into more unnatural positions. I froze, I could not move no matter how hard I tried. They came closer and closer. 10 feet… 5 feet… I can feel the cold radiating off their body… 3 feet, I still can't move, 1 foot away.

I Broke from their gaze and ran towards the car, my heart pounding in my ears. I tried opening it but the door wouldn't budge. I screamed but my voice was swallowed by the darkness. The figures came closer and closer, each step- no each *movement* it made instilled a new stage of fear in panic within me. My body was frozen and cold. I was going to die here. *This is just a dream,* I thought, *JUST A DREAM!*

I frantically tried to wake myself up. They came closer until one puts its hand on my shoulder and opened its mouth to reveal, not teeth anymore, but avoid, a deep, dark void, the droning and screams of something ancient bouncing around inside it. Just then I woke up in a cold sweat breathing heavily. This dream continued for seven days, each time becoming more and more terrifying.

But on the last day, I didn't see those *things*. I got to the car, opened the door, and got in. That's when it came, that same feeling of dread, that worm at the back of my mind digging into my brain. I looked in the backseat and screamed. There they were, grinning wider than ever before. I didn't sleep that night.

I wrote that stuff down in a journal and Years passed and completely forgot about those nightmares I had. Soon enough, my weird future-telling dreams had stopped and about 12 years later I moved to New York to go to college. About a month into my fifth year I got a call from my job that I was an intern at

. I was hired. I was ecstatic. Everything was going great... at least until tonight. I was coming off the train I was looking at some old journals to get some nostalgia. As I flipped through the pages I saw it, my entry from 6th grade.  I was terrified as I read the words, “25 years old, worked in New York… Black Honda Civic” Everything, *everything* lined up.

Now before I get off this train I am typing this, frantically typing, trying to write down everything. I know I can't stay on, it's the last stop. I have to get off. I see the car now, that stupid black honda civic. How could this be happening? I know I’m just paranoid, delusional even, everything will be alright. It's probably the heat of summer that is getting to me. Shoot, I feel something now. I can't put my finger on it. That sense of dread, that pain. They're coming back and this time, I know its not a dream."

I'm 22, studying computer science and in terms of my career and where I'm going I feel so lost.
I'm currently on placement/internship and I go back this September to do my final year. During my internship I didn't really do what was advertised to me which was business analyst and was sat with no work but luckily I found someone in my office to give me a role in her team which was mainly digital marketing and social media; not something I want to do but grateful for the skills and responsibilities she has given and taught me. 

I know I'm going to be done with university so soon and since I'm doing computer science I feel like I HAVE to become a coder or a data scientist or something super techy and I do want to do something technical I just don't think I'm a strong enough coder to work in a business (I'd probably take their systems down lol). But I know a lot of people who do say coding in the workplace is different to university coding. I wouldn't say I hate coding as I did code in C++ at one point and I really enjoyed it but since I've started with Java I've just not found myself getting any joy from coding. 

So my main question is this; has anyone else felt like they weren't confident to program for work but did it anyways? How did it go? Is it true coding for work is different to how you code at university? And also what other careers besides a programmer could I do which is still quite technical? 

I greatly appreciate any response I get from this as I've been stressing about this since the new year :( Thanks"

So some details, this company is pretty small and only consists of a small team. They are offering only an unpaid internship at the moment in which I would be helping them test out their product if the customer has an issue with it. I also feel slightly out of my depth so I question if I can actually do what they require of me. On top of that the interviewer suggested a couple times that if I found something better I should go for it since something that they were offering was not exactly the best offer.

Currently, I have no internship experience, but I have done some personal projects.

I'm interested in data science but most of the job offers for data science and data analyst positions have experience requirements (mostly 2+years). So I think I might be able to get a job as a software engineer at a reputed company (since I can solve medium leetcode questions pretty easily).

So I have two options that I can think of right now :

1. Get a job as a software engineer at a better company than Infosys. While working there, take online courses related to data science , participate in kaggle competitions, do some personal projects, etc. and about 1 year later try to switch to the data science team at the company.

2. Try to get a job as a data analyst at a company that accepts data analysts with no experience. While working there, I'll be taking online courses, doing kaggle competitions, etc. and later apply to a better company. 

I prefer the first option more since most companies which accept data analysts without experience might not be worth it and also because of the fact that right now I can get job as a software engineer easily as compared to job as a data analyst."

I needed some help and insight from people in the industry and others in general so I thought to make a post here. I have 2 options on the table, Ryerson and University of Toronto.  University of Toronto is a high ranked school, prestigious and has a 12-16 month internship program where as Ryerson is practically unknown internationally but it has a 20 month co-op program. Both of the schools are located in Toronto. University of Toronto's down side is that they have a system to weed out students in the first year and defer them to other programs or make them transfer to other universities by having a minimum gpa and course mark cut offs, this concept is called POST and is used so they can level out the playing field due to mark inflation.

Ryerson:

* Easy program (more time for side projects)
* 20 month co-op (Guaranteed Job Experience )
* Will guaranteed give me a degree in cs
* good social life

UofT:

* Known for being very rigorous (Less time for side projects)
* 12-16 month internship (Small amount of students get a placement)
* possibly will get deferred to a different program
* known for work-intensive environment
* prestigious degree

Based on these facts what do you think would be the wiser route?

and how much do you think prestige matters in this industry?

Thanks."
grd0r2,2,2020-05-27,My boss has refused to sign a document that allows the state to pay me. (Disability program) Is there anything I can do?,Artsyconcrete,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/grd0r2/my_boss_has_refused_to_sign_a_document_that/,"I have had set up a government disability program that allows me to get paid for internship experience. This is in central Colorado. She agreed to it, and signed a document saying she would sign off every two weeks and say if I had been doing well and what I had been doing. 

Now this is an internet marketing internship so there are a few things you should know first

1. I began at 15 hours a week, she requested I work 30 as a lot of work was piling up. I agreed and for three weeks in a row I worked 30-40 hours Pro Bono. Then on 4/6/20 the paid internship began. Depending on the week I was from 8-30 hours a week, really irregular. 

2. She never said anything negative before shit started to go down. She never said I was taking too long or that 30 hours was too much until I was getting paid for it. She never compared me to the other interns saying my work was worse until I disagreed with her. 

3. She wouldn't tell me where to submit things but would tell the other interns. She did a lot of underhanded things and she would give my projects to other people when she was mad at me. 

Now chronologically what happened was I only had three days on one pay period so I waited until the next one. I have her 3 days and she gave me the signature a day before it was due. It was too light to read but she signed and have a comment sending it to me thirty minutes before it was do. I turned it on and the payroll manager said that I couldn't have more than one pay period per form so I would have to do it again. I redid it and then suddenly she refused to sign. 

She said I wasn't making 30 hours worth of work. You see this sucks because I'm disabled and work life that takes me a long time to do. Since I was working 30 before I didn't think doing 30 again would be a problem. So she told me to lower the hours on the time sheet and I said no. She got really angry and said she was doing this for my benefit and didn't appreciate that I was pressuring her. 

I backed off and decided to wait until the next pay period. So I keep working, the stress of this is wearing down on me. I'm extremely sensitive to the point where I've been hospitalized for weeks because something upsetting happened. I'm throwing up numerous times a day, I'm sleeping all day, my mouth is bleeding, etc etc. I keep working since it's a work at home but I won't lie, I had to work a long time and even then it wasn't as good as the other interns. That fact is making my health worse and I've stopped doing things like jogging, which I love, because I keep throwing up during jogs. 

It's time for the next pay period, the 4th one. I'm up to 130 hours. Which will be about 1700 dollars I haven't gotten a dime from. She is getting hostile. I'm screen shooting every email and bcc my case worker. He says we will set up a time for all of us to talk. He tells me she said to sped 3 hours on a project and I spent 30. What actually happened was she long me to ""take your time on this one"" and I did. I decided to make a day by day work journal. Not good enough

She tells me to lower the hours and says I'm not as good as the other interns and that they were picking up my slack. She said they had to take my work cause I wouldn't do it. What really happened was she have away my projects when I disagreed with her. This is becoming hazardous to me so I email her saying ""I'm going to hold off on working until we figure out everything with (case worker)""

She kicked me off all of the work software, email, everything. Luckily I have the screenshots I have already taken and the emails I forwarded to the case worker. She is now refusing contact and idk what to do. 

Thanks for reading that small book, I appreciate any help."

I just completed my sophomore year of HS, and as I transition towards junior year I’m hoping to build my ECs— however, there has been little to no prevail in my efforts.

I am currently a Level 10 Mens Gymnast, planning on competing in the elite level this upcoming year, but not sure bc this season got cut so short. If it helps my case, I won nationals last year and 2 others before HS (doesnt really matter in terms of college). Alongside this, I compete in varsity pole vault for my public high school track team. With these considerable time commitments, there were plenty of days that I would attend school for 7 hrs, sports until 9pm, and homework until roughly 2am :(( bad idea, I know.

With that said, I truly can’t find the time for other ECs during the year unless its something like a club INSIDE of school. I know very well that I am committed to my involvements, but I fear that in the admissions process I’ll be viewed as just another student athlete bound to be skipped over. Is there a lot of merit in being a great student alongside athletics or is it simply an expectation of top schools?? I currently have a 4.0UW, will take 12 APs by the end of HS, and I am prepping for the ACT right now in good standing for a 34+ (National Merit also feasible). Though this appears unmatched to many around me, I acknowledge that all other applicants at high tier schools will have these stats and probably much better ECs, which leaves me fearful.

Lastly, what is your advice on activities to participate in for this summer?? I looked for some internships, but they’re mainly only for college students, out of my interests, and require more hours than I can put forth. I can acquire an internship through my parents company, but that entails spending the summer at their headquarters across the country, and its more important now than ever that I put my uttermost commitment into returning to sports in the same physical and mental state as before the long break, so I don’t see that happening. I might begin to look towards a part time job instead, and I’m willing to look into any other suggestions that I’m given. As much as I love the sports I participate in, they can really limit other aspects of life :(

If it helps anyone in terms of determining chance of acceptance or devising ECs to participate in rn, I’m aiming towards math, business, and/or law. Thanks for the help!!!

edit— tl;dr: Wondering if elite level athletes/great students fare well in admissions despite their lack of ECs and uniqueness regarding them"

Occupation: Software Developer

Hey guys. I’m just looking for some advice as to an issue I’ve been facing/will be facing. I’m trying to figure out a game plan for the next 5 years (and the basis of everything else). The pandemic has added a dimension to everything cause I don’t know how the economy will look, so everything is being thought of with what I know and can predict right now.

Background:
I’m trying to figure out what direction to move in, and I feel stuck and unsure about everything I’ve been doing and might do. To preface this, you should know that I’ve dedicated my short life so far to my career in tech. I’ve based my entire social life, activities, almost identity around my career. It’s brought me so much happiness and has given me purpose. I’ve always strived to get to that next level, to “be on top”. I’ve given this so much, but I’ve gained this incredibly lucrative career where I had internships paying $15k + a summer. It allowed me to save like $20k over my college years. I’ve now graduated college and have a six figure entry level software developer job on a one year contract (don’t want to be one forever). As far as I know that job is still happening, and I’ll spend my year working. It’s what comes that’s causing me trouble.

Problem: I’m at an impasse as to what I want in life and what I need to do to achieve it, and how these choices will effect my end goal. I know that my ultimate end personal goal is to be married with a baby one day (preferably both before 35). Because of this, I want to be settled in my career path before this. I haven’t been able to really date because I’ve been so dedicated to my career, so I want to be in a more stable position in the next few years so I can dedicate myself more to advancing my personal life and goals then. So I know I want my personal life to look like this, but I don’t know what I want my professional life to look like in relation to this. I’ve got multiple different potential scenarios as paths I can go down. Obviously I know that life can change and anything can happen, but in 1 year I’ll be setting of on one of these preliminary plans, with it shaping how my life will look like for at least the near future. So please give me advice on these potential plans.

Potential Scenarios: 

1. Law School 
- One option I have is to go to law school. I’ve taken the LSAT, and I got a 160. With my 3.5 gpa and being a minority, I can get into a pretty good school. I’ve done well in all of my classes involving politics and writing, and feel that I’ll do well there and enjoy it. The thing with this is that my stats are in between what is needed for great and average schools. So if I get into a top school, I’ll have to pay full price, and I’ll get into lower ranked schools with even a full scholarship, but lose that prestige and potential earnings. I’m afraid of going into debt for a non top 15 school, as I may need to work decades to pay it off if I have a lower salary. My mother (really my father) just paid off over $100k in law school loans, when she quit to be married with children after only 3 years of practice. So my law school choice boils down to:
A.  - Attend a top law school.
- take out $200k in loans.
- strive for a big Law job that pays $180k + starting
- give myself to law and pay off my loans in less than 5/10 years post grad.
- put off having any personal life for the 2 - 3 years of big Law.
- quit big Law after 3 years and go for an in house council position from then onwards, still make well over $100k.
B. - Attend a lower ranked school
- take out under $50k in loans
- fight like hell to be at the top of the class.
- hopefully get a big Law job or any job that pays six figures.

Issues:
- potentially may make less than I did before starting law school.
- lose 3 years of time to law school, when I could be earning money or doing anything else.
- I’ll be so tired but I could achieve a dream of mine and put myself at a whole new level of prestige.

2. Grad School Abroad
- Another option I have is that I could attend grad school for either PoliSci or something related to Computer Science. Due to cost, I’d probably do this abroad, specifically Canada or the UK. With everything going on in the US, I’m really looking for another option. I love the calmness and stability of Canada. I’ve spent a lot of time in various parts of the country for work events and travel, and love the culture and atmosphere. There are a few places where I could see myself living and settling down there. I know that the pay is less for the same jobs, but I think it may be worth it for the lifestyle changes. Health insurance and costs are something that stresses me out so much here, and knowing that I lived in a country with socialized healthcare would be so comforting. I’m scared that I’ll miss the money I’ve got here, but I won’t miss that stress. With the lower salaries and social services in place, I feel like it’s my chance to live a different life. I could just be normal, not have to strive for greatness and basically kill myself trying to reach this level of prestige. I could just settle down, have a baby, be middle class, be normal. I’d pay a lower price for my degree and potentially even get funding for it. They are upper to mid range schools. Things would be hard when immigrating, but it I’ve studied abroad before, and overall it may be worth it in the end for an easier long term. But I don’t know how that lose of income attainability will effect me and how I “work”. I’ve spent my whole life chasing something, how will I be when it’s not there anymore, and will I even or should I even miss it. In Canada, I will never have that amazing great career, or be rich and “famous”. I will just live a simple life, and after a few years of working and studying, I’ll be Canadian.

Ask: So Reddit, I’m asking you for any advice. I want to know your feelings of if option 1, which is best, or if I should go for option 2 altogether. Leaving behind either option feels like a death of some sort, but it’s got to be done. I want to marry, have a child, in the next 10 years, and I want the stability of a career path set up well before that. Everyone tells me a different thing, but I honestly want your real opinions as to where I should lean. Like I said, I acknowledge the fact that life is never truly planned and that it’s insane to even plan for like 5 years from now, but I’m a planner. I started my career when I was 14 years old. I planned for my current reality, current picture of a career and salary years ago and it worked out. I’ve accepted all of my internship and job offers at least 8 months in advance. I plan, I manifest, I achieve. I need a plan, something to look towards, and everything is really only gonna work out if I have one and start early. So please help me, give me the perspective I’m lacking and guide me down the right path."

&amp;#x200B;

**UW/W GPA and Rank:**

**GPA 3.94 UW (our school doesn't do weighted) , for rank i'd say top 15-10 not really sure cause we don't do ranks either. I honestly  didn't care enough freshman + sophomore  so I got pretty bad grades (3.85, and 3.91 respectively).

4. national merit scholar: this literally does not count lol

&amp;#x200B;

**Extracurriculars:**

**Athletics:**

\- USA AAA Rank Swimmer, I only get to race there during the summer but I have regional and sectional cuts there for long course so i'd say I'm ranked pretty high in state.

&amp;#x200B;

**Music:**

\- ABRSM Level 8  + Shanghai Conservatory of Music Level 10 saxophonist. (both are the highest)

\- First chair Saxophonist in School: Regional, and Honor Bands. I'm a very avid saxophonist who's very involved in the school and outside music scene. I've been first chair for many of the bands that require selections which is pretty hard to do. I'm also the section leader for our school's Jazz band.

\- Community Performances: I've done multiple saxophone showcase performances outside of school which have all been solo acts for a big audience \~ 200 people. I've also performed as a duo with a friend of mine in front of \~2000 people. We were the opening act for a worker party kinda thing. Got paid!

\- Qualified Music Tutor for Kids: I helped teach kids how to play the sax for free. Very Fun despite what people think. I am technically qualified to be a full time teacher because I have passed the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Exam.

\- Music Performances for charity: I've performed at multiple Charity events and community service events.

\- Member of Community Service Club at school : We go to a local school and teach kids english and just hang out with them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Academic Enrichment:**

\- Internship at China's leading Next Generation Sequencing company:

\- Internship at a Big Data x Biology Company

\- Internship at EV company (Father affiliated business but it was formal, i wasn't under his management)

\- Member of Science National Honor Society

\- Wrote and published a formal research thesis regarding DNA synthesis.

&amp;#x200B;

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

Biology Teacher: 9/10 I have a great connection with this teacher. She sees me as a standout student and we have a great personal connection as well so I expect a very strong LOC from her.

English Teacher: 9/10 Probably have the best connection with this teacher. got to really know her from swimming w/ her daughter and have had her for 2 years in a row. I'm one of her favorite students (said directly by her) so I expect good things.

Harvard Professor: Idk if these LOC can even be submitted? But this professor was my mentor during the research process for my thesis and gave me a rec letter.

&amp;#x200B;

Although analytical english isn't my strong suit, I'd say that I'm quite adept at writing personal statement type essays where you're allowed to express yourself however you want.

&amp;#x200B;

**Schools:**

ED: Harvard: Dream Dream school. Honestly nothing else is even worth EDing to me, I UCLA and UC Berkeley are my second choices so why not. Father has great alumni connections with the business school but Harvard college is where I'm going to go if i'm going to be studying for bio/psych.

UC Berkeley: The best all-around school in my opinion. Awesome education, awesome state, awesome environment.

UCLA: My top 3 choice. Awesome all around school and father has legacy and alumni connections here. I've had dinner + exchanges with the dean of the engineering school but it doesn't matter because i'm not an engineering major :/

US San Francisco: A really good biology school but too small in my opinion.

Duke: Really great school but i'm not so sure about the state it's in. I'm also not really familiar with the campus at all.

Columbia: This is probably my fourth favorite school simply for the fact that its in new york. I've heard great things from a post-graduate student from here.

my list is really short, so give some suggestions. I've only ever wanted to go to my top 3 choices so i've never had the opportunity to see some others. Also with rona i couldnt go on any tours so...

I don’t know where else to post. A long back story about my mental health and what my mom is trying to do about it now.


Here’s some backstory first (please bare with me):
I had a rough time in high school, college and post college. When I was a freshman/sophomore in high school, I dated a guy (first “real” relationship) that ultimately sexually assaulted me and forced me to have sex with him multiple times, mentally abused me by saying things like I was stupid, fat and ugly (I was about 100 lbs at the time and have only gained about 35 lbs since then, almost ten years ago now, but still i see myself as fat), threatened to kill himself if I ever left him, and said he’s the only person that would ever want to have sex with me. I finally ended things, he then had to move to a different school, and then I found out he was stalking me for about ten months (that I know of) and had to be banned from my high school. I didn’t find out about the stalking until at least a couple months in. He even showed up at my friends house unannounced when I was staying the night and got in an argument with my friends parents because he wouldn’t leave. The whole ordeal caused major issues between my mom and I because I started becoming super distant, “hiding things” from her, etc. My mom read messages between him and I, found out I was having sex at 16, and called me a slut without knowing anything about her daughter being forced to have sex and then stalked. 

Two and a half years go by, and in that time, he starts dating a not-so-close-anymore friend, and I just can’t help but feel like he’s dating her to try and get to me, considering she hated him when we first started dating because she thought he was trying to tear us apart and control me. The rest of high school went by with lots of arguing between my mom and I because I became so closed off, and constantly felt like I didn’t fit in or have any real friends, just friends with my twin sister’s friends by association. 

I graduate high school, download a dating app (I’m going to college so I gotta meet guys right?) and start seeing this guy about an hour away. I’d spend weekends with him after classes finished on Thursday and come back home on Monday. After a couple months, he asks to have sex and of course I’m terrified. He coerces me and I reluctantly agree (because I was told by my HS boyfriend that nobody but him would ever want to have sex with me and I guess nows my chance to prove him wrong). A couple weeks later, he talks me into having sex again and next thing I know, it’s anal sex with absolutely no discussion, consent, lubrication, nothing. I pull away and leave the room. I go to sleep on the couch later that night, hiding my face under the blanket and thinking about what just happened. I wake up in the early hours with my first ever panic attack. Absolutely frozen in fear, couldn’t breathe, still under the blankets feeling trapped because I couldn’t even move to uncover my face. After what feels like an eternity, I’m finally able to gain control of my body, gather my things and get the hell out of there. My boyfriend texts me and asks where i went. We talk things over and be blames it all on me, saying I was the one who wanted to have sex and he never wanted to do it.

I get home, still panicking and unable to breathe, don’t remember the hour drive home at all, and somehow have the sense to realize I need to talk to a doctor. I spend the next week so shut off from my mom that we argue even more, but somehow have the courage to tell her that I’m 2 for 2 on boyfriends who force me to have sex and I need to go to a doctor because I’m still having trouble breathing and panicking. I see my doctor and she tells me it’s depression, severe anxiety and PTSD. She prescribes me with anti depressants and anxiety medications, and recommends I see a therapist, so I do. My mom throws a fit because she thinks I’m faking it and the meds will only make it worse.

My current school, a community college, was about 40 minutes away, and I only had school two days a week. I eventually decide I want to move out and go to a different college, which was only an hour away from home. My reasoning was mainly so I could get away from the place with so many horrible people and memories, which resulted in more arguing between my mom and I about how I’m not ready to live on my own. (Note: I originally wanted to go to a university in MN eight hours away, but my mom called and cancelled everything a couple weeks before school started, forcing me to register to the closest school. She said I wasn’t allowed to go to a university all four years because it’s too expensive, even though I’m the one paying for all of it. Spoiler alert: I ended up paying more for my education because of this than if I would’ve just gone to the university 8 hours away, and now I live six hours from my mom and two hours from that original university.)

Jump ahead a couple weeks and a girl hits me on the interstate, totaling my car. The first person I call is my mom. She comes to pick me up, and immediately starts berating me about how it’s my fault and thinks I’m lying to the cops about what really happened, even after the cops say that, based on the damage, it’s obvious I’m not at fault. She changes her reasoning and says it’s my fault for going somewhere. I get a rental car for a couple weeks while looking for a new car. Then I find out my mom gets a loan and buys a car in my name without even telling me anything about it. Obviously I get pissed and start a fight. She kicks me off her phone plan and car insurance and tells me if I’m going, to be ungrateful, I can pay for everything on my own, and thus I have to become completely independent overnight. 

Throughout that time, I meet a couple more guys that are also not great. One coerces me into sleeping with him. Another one sexually assaults me and ends up stalking me for a couple months. I finally meet another guy at school, the first guy to not force me into anything, and actually respects me when I say I don’t want to do anything sexually. It’s a relatively great relationship, he decides to move to Chicago for school, but we stay together (about four years), but the catch is he doesn’t want us to meet each other’s families because he doesn’t want to get married or have kids, blah blah blah. Serious enough to stay together for long distance (he eventually moved to San Francisco and I flew out to see him), but not serious enough to ever get married or live together.

Time goes by and at some point, my mom and I slowly start talking again. Still bickering because she wants to meet my boyfriend but he won’t let that happen. Graduation is around the corner and I decide I want to continue my education by getting a bachelors in marketing. Where I’m from (central IL), getting a job in marketing is nearly impossible unless you have 10+ years of experience, so I decide I want to go to a school in Chicago so I have internship opportunities and real life experiences through course work, but also because of my boyfriend. I hit a brick wall with my mom and she tells me it’s too far away, too expensive, and I’m not ready. At this point, my twin sister was already getting ready to move 8 hours away for school, only a couple hours East of where I wanted to go to school originally, and my new school I was going to was only three hours away from home. More arguing ensues and she decides the night before I move that she’s not going to help me because she doesn’t want me to go. I call my grandparents and they offer to help me move. We have everything loaded and ready to go by 7am and we are gone before my family even wakes up. My mom is PISSED, of course, and cuts me off again. Throughout my two years there, the happiest I’ve ever been in my life at that point, we slowly start getting our relationship back, but not without constant bickering about how I should move back and go to a cheaper university closer to home. 

I finally graduate, and have to start paying my student loans soon, so I decide to get a transfer at work (FedEx, so I had the opportunity to go anywhere as long as there was a position open) and move in with my sister to save money. The same sister that moved eight hours away for school, and of course my mom is completely okay with it. I shortly end things with my long term BF.

I live there for a year and meet a couple other guys. Another guy who not only forced me to have sex multiple times, but also asked if I’d be mad if he had sex with me when I was asleep and got mad for not having sex with him two hours after I got a call that my uncle passed away. I realize this is not something I can deal with because I had so many PTSD episodes because of him, so I break up with him and leave. End up getting a speeding ticket because I just wanted to get the hell out of there. My mom doesn’t let me forget about the ticket but doesn’t know the whole story behind it. I can’t tell her because she thinks I’m faking the whole depression/anxiety/PTSD thing. I get super depressed and don’t want to do anything with my life because, at this point, this is the fifth guy to sexually assault/rape me, and I’m realizing it’s my fault all of it happened rather than all those guys. My mom asks my sister and my sister tells her i’m acting depressed and my mom tells me to stop or she will personally drive up to get me and bring me back home to put me in a mental institution. At this point, I’m 23.

So I find another job and move two hours south, which is also two hours closer to home. Life is fine, and I meet my now boyfriend. He’s perfect. Never forces me to do anything I don’t want to, I can completely be myself with him, and it’s just overall a perfect relationship. We fell head over heels for each other the first day we met and instantly new it was meant to be. At six months, we decide to move in together. I was driving 100 miles a day, 50 miles each way to and from work, paying more than I should for a shitty apartment and literally spending more in bills than I was making, and used up all my savings to make ends meet. He was tired of living with his parents because he felt like a free loader, so we decided to get an apartment together about ten minutes away from my work. He also got an hourly job at a department store to pay bills, even though he really didn’t need one because he was doing free lance work online and has enough saved up to pay bills for a year. My mom “loves” my new boyfriend, but she thinks it’s all about her. She’s gets mad when we visit his parents regularly, who live an hour and a half away, but rarely visit her, who lives 6+ hours away. She got mad because he spent Christmas with his own family instead of coming home with me to spend time with her. 

Then comes covid-19. I lose my job. My boyfriend quits his because, not only can he not handle the stress from the coronavirus, but the job also made him so miserable that I could see him go from a happy go lucky guy to being so exhausted he didn’t even want to do school work (was working on his masters degree). 

Now here we are, two months after losing my job and my mental health is rapidly declining, and he just graduated with his masters. Neither of us can find jobs, which I know is partly due to the pandemic, but I’m taking personally because I haven’t been able to get a job in my field of study since I graduated two years ago. I’m regretting my decision of getting a degree in marketing, constantly feeling like I’m $80k in student debt and absolutely nothing to show for it. Our lease ends October 1, and we have no idea what to do. Every second, I worry about being forced to move back home to IL with my mom and him moving back in with his parents, being six hours apart. I can’t stay with him at his parents because I have two cats and they don’t want cats in their house.

I mistakenly mentioned to my mom that I was in a rut and don’t have any motivation because of the whole quarantine thing and not working for two months. Most days I can barely get out of bed. If I do, I just sit on the couch watching TV and scrolling through facebook and Reddit. The apartment is a mess and I can’t find the energy to do anything about it. My mom said to stop or she would drive up to get me and make me move back home, which is the absolute worst thing that could happen at this point. 

I’m just at a complete loss and don’t know what to do. 

TL;DR - I have mental health issues from being raped/sexually assaulted by numerous partners; my helicopter mom wants to rip me away from my current boyfriend, the only thing keeping me sane during quarantine, because I’m depressed after losing my job."
grl6o0,57,2020-05-27,TIFU by being too nervous for an internship interview.,DishsoapOnASponge,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/grl6o0/tifu_by_being_too_nervous_for_an_internship/,"In true TIFU fashion, this was actually about 4 years ago, when I was interviewing for an internship as a college student. I really wanted and needed the internship, so my nerves were sky high. I also was from a tiny little university in the middle of nowhere, so I didn't think I was very competitive.

About halfway through the interview, we moved on from ""get to know you"" questions to technically relevant ones. Have I ever done XYZ calculation, what did I know about ABC physics, etc. And here comes the FU.

""Which programming languages do you know?""

I was only comfortable with two or three ""easy"" ones, which in hindsight meant I was about where every other junior in college is for my field. But I was so nervous, I couldn't remember the names of any of them. That made me even more nervous, so...

""All of them.""

At this point, it was too late to back down and admit I lied for no real reason other than I was a nervous mess, so I stuck with it. I watched as the interviewer's eyes switched from ""a promising candidate"" to ""how do I end this kindly"". The interview ended about 5 minutes later, and I never heard back.

TL;DR told an interviewer that I knew every single programming language"
grltwr,1,2020-05-27,Electrical Engineer considering a return to iT,TeegLy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/grltwr/electrical_engineer_considering_a_return_to_it/,"Some background: I am 3 years and 2 engineering jobs out of school. During college, I had a student job for 4 years as an IT technician for the school. It was rocky at first, but I gained more knowledge in those years than I have at either of the two positions I've held since. I grew from an entry level tech all the way to tech lead working each summer full time en lieu of an engineering internship. I had genuine interest in technology and learning more and left the field because my degree had the words ""electrical engineering"" on it. Truth is, I've not developed a passion for any of the engineering work I've done. I've worked in building automation systems and automotive control systems and the most interesting parts of the jobs to me, is the technology and the customer service. For instance, delivering the finalized monitoring software for a BAS and seeing the delight of the customer being able to control the entire HVAC system from his phone. The coordination with IT to get such things set up on the network is tedious, but I've managed to thrive in finding solutions to make it work.

I'm very unhappy at my current job and looking at the current covid situation as a chance to make a career path change. My company went through a cyber security crisis a few months back, which crippled our production for 2 months. I volunteered my IT background to help our bare bones IT department and found myself in a role writing and directing device cleaning procedures and was even trusted to travel to our remote sales offices to QA devices before rejoining them to the rebuilt network. I felt a since of pride and confidence in my work and that's when the idea to return came to me.

-

-

I have the troubleshooting basics, networking and hardware, down very well across many common devices and OS's but lack any relevant certifications in IT. I've picked up basic networking principles on the job, I have strong motivation to self learn, a good coding background, and an engineering approach to problem solving but I know I will have to accept a role where I need to prove myself at the entry level.  I'm looking for others who have made a similar change in their career and their thoughts on the matter. I can survive the pay cut and have identified a few local MSPs that are hiring with great employee reviews and opportunity for growth. Do I seem misguided in my career approach?"

I've posted recently on this sub and received lots of helpful advice. This raised probably my most important question:

How much do side projects matter after you get your first bit of work experience through and internship? What begins to matter more?

All advice and responses are extremely appreciated!"
grn4ey,2165,2020-05-27,Finished with your first programming course and not sure how to go on? The Stanford Code in Place team shares a roadmap with what courses to follow and where to find information about them,s7oev,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/grn4ey/finished_with_your_first_programming_course_and/,"**Read this first:** I was a Section Leader for Stanford's Code in Place course (a free online offering of (part of) their intro to CS course as a way to support the community during COVID-19). The course finished, and one of the professors behind it: Ali Malik, shared this roadmap for how to proceed. It is the result of a shared effort of the people behind the course. Keep in mind that I have not made any changes to the original! So there's plenty of references to the Code in Place course. Just imagine it says ""your first programming course"" instead and read on :) And also, this was reposted with Ali's consent!

# Life after Code in Place

Having completed Code In Place, there  are many paths you might choose to take: this handout is intended to  provide a possible roadmap for some of them. Like all guidelines, this  is an approximate and non-exhaustive list on how to learn about a  subject. There are a plethora different ways to achieve mastery that  might not be represented here.

We have split up this resource into umbrella topics that students have been asking about. In reality, there are a lot more ways to apply Computer Science, such as music, healthcare, social good and education.

Each area has a list of **core topics** you need to understand to engage with meaningfully with that discipline. After you develop a solid understanding of these core topics, you can pick and choose whatever subareas you find interesting and focus there.

If there is any topic not covered here that you are interested in, ask about it in the comments! We will try to answer those as well.

**How to use this resource**:

Since we can’t cover the vast range of possible material in the world, most of the resources linked below are websites of university courses that cover the relevant concept. ***This doesn’t mean you have to take the academic course to learn that material***. Instead, the course syllabus can serve as a reference point for which topics are important to cover. You can then go about actually learning these topics however you want. Some potential ways to learn could be to search for the topic on google or youtube, read textbooks, or browse reddit.

# Foundations of CS

These are major concepts that are important to solidify, irrespective of what area of CS you are interested in. It consists of all the foundational concepts: programs, variables, loops, conditions, data structures, and core algorithms.

**CS106A:**

You have done most of this! Congrats :)

**CS106B:**

Stanford’s sequel class to CS 106A. In CS 106B, you further develop your toolkit by deepening your understanding of how a computer represents data and learning about additional problem-solving techniques and structures. The class is taught in C++, one of the most popular programming languages in history.

## Web dev (frontend/backend)

Web development is how we make websites and online applications to do useful things. It consists of two major areas. 

**Frontend**: This deals with everything related to what a website user can see and interact with such as the design, style, menus, text, images, etc. 

**Backend**: This deals with everything that has to do with all the logic and internal working of a website that is not typically visible to a user. This is stuff like storing data in databases, making a server, authentication, creating users, generating dynamic pages, etc.

These resources will generally cover both frontend (HTML, CSS, javascript) andbackend programming:

* [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/home)
* [The Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)

## Mobile dev

* Android: any Kotlin resources provided by [Google](https://developer.android.com/courses)

# General Resources

## Programming Tools

* One of the most wonderful things about the field of Computer Science is how collaborative and open a field it is. This is enabled by websites like [Github](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product), in which programmers can share and work together on their code. Underlying each of these websites is a system called Git, which allows you to manage the different versions of your program with minimal fuss. Learn the basics of Git using [Github’s tutorial](https://try.github.io/), or [BitBucket’s help center](https://www.atlassian.com/git).  Some SLs wrote up really great intros to Github. See this [ed post](https://us.edstem.org/courses/490/discussion/71024) and this other [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umvKOaRWz-A)!
* In addition to PyCharm and Ed, there are countless other editors and IDEs, each with their own strengths and which can be customized for your purposes. Two of the most popular editors are [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). 
* As you work on projects of your own, you are bound to run into bugs. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a question &amp; answer forum that is probably the single best resource on the internet to get advice on resolving bugs.

## Other Programming Languages

Python is a wonderful language, but there are many other wonderful languages you might be interested in learning:

* HTML, CSS and Javascript are the best tools for developing internet-based application. Mozilla’s [resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) are a fantastic introduction.
* C and C++ are two of the most commonly used programming languages, and are great for programmers who want more direct control over what their computers are doing. You can learn C++ from a combination of [CS 106B](http://cs106b.stanford.edu/) and [CS 106L](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106l/cs106l.1192/), and you could learn C [here](https://www.learn-c.org/).
* Rust is a more recent language that also affords programmers very low-level control of their computers. 
* [Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) and [Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) are great choices to build systems that must handle large amounts of data.
* [Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/introduction), [Scala](https://docs.scala-lang.org/learn.html), and [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/) are programming languages that promote a style of programming known as functional programming, which often is enormously helpful in processing data and is a fascinating intellectual endeavour. 

## Tech Interviews

Interviews for tech internships and jobs are kind of their own skill that really gets better with practice. These are some good resources to practice for tech job interviews. Remember, you don't want to be memorising these answers. Instead you want to develop your computational thinking so that you can figure out these answers on the spot!

* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X)
* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms)

grnx8p,4,2020-05-27,"Jack of all trades, Master of none. Would it work for a programmer?",drivecrux,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/grnx8p/jack_of_all_trades_master_of_none_would_it_work/,"This is my story and I really want to know whether it's good to know a lot of things or I should've stuck to one only.

I started learning to code 4 years back on the very first class of my college. I learnt basic C++ as it was an introductory course. Then, came the vacations, so I took a Data Structures course and started doing competitive programming. I was enjoying all of this, but then one of my friends build a really cool website for sharing notes in the college campus and I thought to myself I also have some ideas of my own, so I started learning web development. I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript and as I was planning to begin my web developer journey, I saw my whole college rushing and running towards the conference hall, so I also went in to see if we are getting free pizzas. There I saw Andrew Ng with a mic in his hand who was creating all the buzz. Sadly I sat hoping for a pizza at the end but that 50 minutes blew me completely. I literally had no idea about the power of machine learning and those neural nets of Andrew trapped me completely. 

I left everything, completed his courses and started building and training my models. I was loving all of this and on top, it was also bringing some amounts of money from the hackathons and competitions. That year, bitcoins prices shot really up and the curious me got into blockchain and even went to China for internship in a blockchain company. Then came the college job placements and I got the job as a Software Developer in a really big firm. 

Since the joining got delayed due to the current lockdown, I had nothing to do, so I decided to complete some of the previous projects that I left in the middle because of some other project. As I began looking through them, nostalgia started hitting me, I remembered those times of learning it the first time and all the fun that I had through that journey but then I felt really awful. I started feeling that I’ve missed a lot of things in a particular domain just because I wanted to do something new. I stopped doing competitive coding for the web, web for Machine learning, machine learning for blockchain and whatnot. I look at my friends and some of them are ranked among the top competitive coders, some are full stack developers and now I’m feeling that I should’ve had stuck to one thing and be really good at it, instead of doing all of the things.

I sure as hell know about all of those things but I’m not an expert in any of it and now I think I’ve made a fool out of myself and my college years. What should I do? Should I start focusing on one thing from now on or is it too late?"

I also knew that my job search would be difficult due to the fact that I didn't have any internship experience.

My main languages are Java and C++, and I've had a few android projects along with a spring boot project I finished earlier this week. I had a handful of phone screens / coding challenges but I either didn't pass them or the interviews got postponed/cancelled due to current circumstances. 

I graduated from a CSU in California and the entry level market here seems way too competitive for me and I don't stand out as a job prospect, so I've also been applying to jobs in less competitive areas with no luck. It's getting frustrating because I keep seeing the same job postings over and over that I've already applied to or have already rejected me on Linkedin. Even companies that this sub looks down upon have been rejecting me.  


I really don't know what to do, should I just wait things out until current circumstances get better?"

I passed CFA Level 1, I am a Finance major, and have been in Wealth Management for 2 years at a large Investment bank, with which I will have great references. I also had 2 prior internships in Wealth Management. I am largely cold-calling/sales right now, but have worked on many detailed financial plans as well. I have had success here, probably not enough to make it past the next 6 months or so, depending on how lenient management is, and if my team hires me permanently. Additionally, I'm way more passionate about my side hustle than Financial Advising, or finance in general.

If things take a turn for the worst, I would still need a way to have an income. 

With this resume, do I have a chance at landing a very entry level financial analyst job, if I aggressively apply and brush up on my Excel/SQL/Hyperion skills?

Just have no idea how the market is for this kind of role, and if I am at a huge disadvantage with my skillset/experience. This job search would happen if things go negatively, and I would begin my search 3-4 months from now if that does happen.

I don't struggle academically at all (3.8 GPA, on track to graduate early, leadership in a few CS orgs, doing active research with possible publication) but I feel like I just have no idea how much I need to know to be good enough for internships or jobs, especially since I want to be a Machine Learning engineer.

You might say that I should just sit down and code projects, and I do work on things that interest me and have a couple projects to which I can point, but I have no idea what's considered impressive or even good. My code works, but is it the best design? Am I leveraging all the features of a language or a framework to the best of its ability? Often I think that if someone asked me why I chose a way of doing things, I'd have no answer other than ""it works and I understand why this way works."" I could always explain what I'm trying to do, but I can't claim that this was the best way to do it - isn't that crucial for a programmer though? To choose the best design out of many?

For example, recently I put together a personal website using vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript so I implemented a few functions to make some transitions happen and learned about promise chaining in the process. But I have no way of assessing the quality of the code I wrote, what the industry standards for this are, or defending my design choice.

I guess this is only learnable through experience, but I can't judge the value of my own work without another person telling me how I can do better. That seems like what I'd get out of an internship, but it feels like I need to already be better than I am now before getting an internship.

TL;DR I don't know how to know when I'm good enough to pursue internships. How do I navigate these feelings?

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

Under $1700 would be ideal

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

Used is fine, as long as it's in decent condition

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

Performance is the most important, followed by battery life. Other 2 not as much

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

Not overly important

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 

N/A

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.** 

Graphic Design and Game Design, plus gaming. Running multiple Adobe suite applications is huge. 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

SWTOR, Fallout, etc. Ideally high settings with 60fps or better, but not hugely important as I will mostly game on my desktop.

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 

Would prefer a SSD, or even a decent sized SSD with another hard drive. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

Doing a graphic design internship this summer and then hopefully transferring to another college to get my bachelor's degree, so something with portability I can use for graphic design and some gaming would be great! I have a very good desktop already so I will mostly be gaming on that, but something that still works very well with good RAM would be great.

grsgfe,4,2020-05-27,Is this a good sign?,rban123,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/grsgfe/is_this_a_good_sign/,"Hello everyone! Just some background, I am a computer science student who has been looking for internships for a while. A few weeks ago I got an email from a recruiter at one of the companies I applied to and she asked if I was still interested in the roll (automation engineering intern). I said yes, of coarse, and we set up an interview. The first interview, a phone screen, went very very well. Me and the recruiter really got along and I enjoyed the call. It was scheduled for 30 minutes and ended up lasting for almost an hour. The next step was a coding challenge. She sent me an email containing three programming problems, from which I had to choose one to solve. She said i had to submit on Friday of that week. The problem I chose was probably the most technically challenging option, and I worked very hard on it over the following few days. I submitted it on Friday, and on Tuesday I got an email back saying the engineers really liked my solution and would like to interview me. This will be the final interview in the process, which would normally be an on-site interview, but because of the pandemic we are doing a zoom call. Here's the actual point of my question. When she emailed me saying that the engineers approved of my work, she also sent me a bunch of paperwork, and got me in touch with the security team. The security team also sent me a bunch of paperwork to fill out for the security pre-screening process. Does the fact that i was given all this paperwork they have to review mean that I am likely a leading candidate for the job? It just seems unlikely to me that they would go through all the trouble of reviewing all of this, and getting the security team involved, unless they were seriously considering me for the roll. Do you think this is a reasonable assumption to make? Do you think that all of the paperwork might be a good sign?"

This is probably going to be a long-winded post but I’m kinda stuck and overwhelmed right now, so I need to get some thoughts out of my head.

**There's a TLDR at the bottom if you want lol**

&amp;#x200B;

I’m technically a 3rd year student, transferring into Ohio State. I’m planning to be a CSE major, switching from Business. I love business but it wasn’t challenging me enough to stimulate my life, basically. I’ve always been a tech-nerd, not super crazy but more so than most of my peers. So I’ve been thinking about CS for a while, not just because “tech fan = comp sci” but because I’ve always been a creative, problem solver, who’s really good at math. Also, AI and ML are things that I have no idea how they work but I am super intrigued by them. I’m not trying to toot my own horn here, I’m just saying that’s what I think I have strengths in. I’ve also always been a really good student, and really well-rounded, so I got pretty lazy through high school and just breezed through everything because I could get good grades and test scores and not really have to try at all. I’m trying to change that though now that I’m in college. I’m trying to push myself because I know my ability and I want to actually put it to good use lol.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I’m kinda like a freshman when it comes to CS, but a junior in overall college, so I feel really behind everyone else that’s my age in my CS program. I see and hear people talking about things that I’ve never heard of, and it makes me feel stupid and like I’m underachieving.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I start learning some more foundational CS concepts and utilizations, so that I can actually start actually feeling like part of the CS culture? I have a hunger to learn and participate! But I just feel overwhelmed by all these things CS people talk about, and I have no idea where to start. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR : I’m transferring into a CS program after two years basically just Taking Gen-EDs. I feel behind all of my peers, I’m really eager to learn and catch-up. What are some good (preferably not boring) resources that I should start looking into so that I can help myself segue into the CS culture, and be ready to actually be knowledgeable and be a useful part of a team of interns next summer (2021).** 

&amp;#x200B;

Also: I’m currently taking CSE 1223, which is the intro to Java class at OSU over the summer.

&amp;#x200B;

If you took the time to read this and help me out I’m super appreciative, I really mean it. I just feel really lost right now"

In college and in my internship i had a decent amount of experience in Java and C#, but that was over several years ago. I’ve picked them up again, but not having recent work experience with them isn’t the best.

The job market in my area is just contract to hire or senior level positions. There are a bunch of high paying Salesforce jobs in my area, but the technology is just so stale and painful.

After a couple years of developing in Salesforce, there was basically nothing left to learn, so I started BAing, running projects, and learning the industry, while continuing to develop. These things aren’t really as interesting as developing though.

I recently graduated as a CS major and I got converted into full time at a rather well-known tech company. My internship with them was in a dev role, developing new features, and my manager at the time gave me good reviews. I got signed on as a Software Engineer, as clearly stated in the offer letter, but has not been assigned a team at that time. Team has only been assigned recently and when I got assigned a team, I tried to ask for more info but didn't get anything back, but I have had my suspicion that it is a DevOps role (or they call it Site Reliability Engineering but its basically DevOps).

An email today confirms it, half a week before my start date. I'm trying to ask if I can possibly change team but I'm really just lost, it's not what I expected at all, and I'm not remotely sure if I'm ready for this, not in the sense of learning new things since I don't mind that at all but having a new lifestyle that revolves around on-calls and not being able to get SWE experience. I will acknowledge too that maybe some will find my rant entitled since there a lot of Americans without jobs right now, and I'm an international student complaining, but I honestly feel very trapped at this moment since this is not what I study for, not what I expect during negotiation and signing, not how I expect my work life to be (since DevOps have very high off-the-clock commitment), and this is not a career path that I want to pursue long terms, all of this only known half a week before the start date so I hope you can understand.

I have a few questions for you all:

\+ Is this a normal thing, or at least not an unheard of thing, to be assigned a DevOps role after you have signed on as a software engineer? Has anyone experienced this before and how did you respond to this situation?

\+ Is this going to affect my long-term career if I want to go into SWE roles in the future?

\+ How should I approach this situation if I want to switch team before start? I have already sent an email to HR but got no response so far. If it would not work, how can I approach switching teams later on down the line?

\+ If I have to end up going into this role, how should I approach it and how should I spend my time if I want to go to a dev role later on? Any advice for going into devops as a new grad?

Edit: Thank you every for their responses so far. Just to clarify, I understand that there's a difference between SRE and DevOps, and SRE if done the Google way can have a lot of coding. However, from what I was given, the duties listed are:

\+ I will be working along with the product dev team (but not in it) and other SREs

\+ I will have 24/7 on-call rotation responding to outages

\+ The tech I should know are typical devops stuff (azure/aws, terraform, Jenkins, python scripting, PowerShell, ARM templates, etc.), no Kubernetes or Docker however

\+ Nothing that was described fit in a traditional dev duties, the duties are more like monitor, fix errors, resolve incidents, etc.

Which looks like its gonna be more heavily on the ops side of things.

grwpb8,28,2020-05-27,"This semester was my highest GPA outcome, but I come out more disappointed",magic_snowflake5,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/grwpb8/this_semester_was_my_highest_gpa_outcome_but_i/,"TLDR; at the end cuz this is really long rip. Also sorry about the title, I should've worded it differently.

I was lucky enough to have permission to stay at Rutgers until the end of my housing contract, so I recognize how fortunate I am to be able to have a quiet environment to do work. But like others, I lost motivation to study and had to force myself to keep going because I was adamant on only using one Pass if I needed it. And I was able to do it. I got a 3.8, but in order to do that, I had to do a ""P"" for Data Structures.

And that's where the disappointment lies. I decided in the beginning of my junior year to minor in Computer Science because I was tired of taking classes that didn't teach things that could be applied immediately. I'm a psych major and I hate how easy the major is compared to other majors, so I took up business admin as a minor. I'm sorry if I offend my fellow psych majors because that's not my intention at all, I personally don't enjoy it a lot anymore and, TO ME, the classes aren't difficult at all. But I still wasn't happy with what I was doing in college. My parents were worried about my future job prospects because having a BA in psych really can't get you any job unless you continue on with grad school, and even then, the jobs are pretty restricted to counseling/therapy/MD to become a psychiatrist. So, my dad encouraged me to also minor in CS.

He works as a database administrator, so growing up I was surrounded by a ton of CS books on Java, C, C++, HTML, Hadoop, you name it. That man lives and breathes CS. He works from the moment he goes into the office to when he had to go to sleep for the night. Failure and slacking off are not an option in his mind and he constantly pushes himself to do better every day and learn more. Meanwhile, my CS major boyfriend made himself crazy with stress to graduate in 3 years and endured all the crazy shit the CS department is composed of (I'm looking at you, Menendez, and that time you lost P4 grades and only regraded them when people complained to the department).

I remember very clearly the disappointment on my dad's face when he found out how much I was struggling with CS. He encouraged me to keep going and believed that I could finish the minor. I remember my boyfriend taking his time to teach me Java the summer before I took CS 111, as well as his disappointment when I struggled so much in the class. Sure, the department made 111 harder compared to when it was two years ago, but that's not an excuse to get a C+ in it. Yeah, I admit it, I got a C+ in the easiest CS class. The one that looks like an elementary school-level class compared to Data Structures. I hadn't taken any problem-solving classes since my freshman year in college when I took Calc 1. So that's a good 2 years of barely using any logical problem-solving abilities and CS 111 hit me like a mf-ing train.

I was doing well in the class before everything shut down. I stayed focused in class and took notes. I understood the material. But I crashed and burned the moment Rutgers went online. I have no one to blame but myself and I should count myself lucky I got a C+ in Data Structures. But I can't keep going on with this minor. It's only going to continue getting worse and worse and I need my GPA to stay up for grad school. I was thinking about just auditing CS classes instead of counting it towards my GPA.

I'm from a very competitive town in north NJ, so I can't stop comparing myself to how others are doing. I've been on LinkedIn a lot recently and I see so many people from my high school that are getting internships as software engineers/developers. I could feel jealousy and competitiveness bubble up inside of me when I saw this. I got more angry at myself that I couldn't do or understand something that so many people I know can do. I'm just completely disappointed that I failed myself, my dad, and my boyfriend.

But more importantly, I wanted to prove to myself that I'm capable of taking on a challenge and doing better than people expected. Now, I'm left with only disappointment in myself and I have to admit that I can't do it. I can't understand CS easily and I can't stay afloat in this minor anymore. I could barely swim in the intro courses, and if I keep going, I'll drown.

TLDR; I'm straight-up not having a good time right now in CS and dropped the minor in frustration and I wanted to rant because I've already exhausted my bf enough about my disappointments and self-pity/anger."

1. Industry: If you’re going into industry, what companies are you/ your friends working at? How many internships have you worked so far?

2. Masters/ grad school: Are you coming back to UofT? If not where are you going? Have you done any research projects during your undergrad? And if you don’t mind disclosing, what was your GPA?

Thanks in advance. I hope you guys are in one of the two options and aren’t homeless &lt;3

grxx4s,28,2020-05-27,Success Story - Starting FT in InfoSec as a Career Changer &amp; New Grad,thorgi_lokitty,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/grxx4s/success_story_starting_ft_in_infosec_as_a_career/,"Hi all, I've lurked in the security/IT/CS subs for a long time and thought I'd share my journey to bring some hope and positivity, especially with everything that's going on right now.

I got my BS in Accounting, worked in the industry and even got my CPA before realizing this isn't the career path I had hoped for. I jumped around different jobs hoping to find my passion and ultimately went back to school for MS in CS. Then had another self-discovery and found cybersecurity/infosec once I realized coding wasn't for me.

I worked part-time as retail tech support while in school until I had a year left till graduation last May. I decided to get my A+ cert and look for jobs that would provide more enterprise/corporate-level IT experience and a foundation to security from what I've learned in these subs. I lost count on how many applications I've sent out; I applied to anything from Helpdesk, Jr SysAdmin, Jr NetAdmin, to InfoSec roles. I heard back from 2 places and luckily landed an InfoSec summer internship.

I worked primarily in the 'people' domain of InfoSec during this internship, so things like security awareness and phishing campaigns; plus some MFA and compliance side things. While this did not provide as much technical hands-on experience as I had hoped, I asked to be a fly on the wall any chance I get and this had provided invaluable insights into what real-world InfoSec is like. I was also incredibly fortunate to have met my mentors. With their help and encouragement, I kept up with current security trends, participated in a couple of CTFs when I can, and also managed to pass Sec+ during this time. My internship was extended through Fall then Spring; and I had hopes that I would be converted into a FTE.

However, the company wasn't sure if they'd have budget to hire me as a FTE so as a precaution, I updated my resume and started slowly applying around end of February. The fact that job posting qualifications are more of a ""wishlist,"" coupled with the following stats, pushed me to apply for any and all security positions that are not management-level, even if I didn't check all the boxes:

* Women feel the need to meet 100% of the criteria while men usually apply after meeting about 60%
* 84% of companies are willing to hire and train a candidate who lacks required skills
* 62% of employees have been offered a position when they are underqualified

Then COVID-19 hit. I continued applying to new postings each day but it definitely got discouraging; I've had interviews cancelled due to corona, recruiters ghosted me after one call, and jobs where I was sure I was more than qualified for but got no response. Then the cherry on top was when the company I was interning with confirmed that they wouldn't have the budget to hire me, again thanks to corona. I felt my depression crept back. I cried, and continued pushing forward.

Then later that week, I got an email from a recruiter requesting a phone screen for a Senior InfoSec Analyst position I had applied for! I second guessed myself and was sure that they would realize my lack of experience, if they didn't already, and move on to more experienced folks. But the hiring manager was very transparent and let me know that they're considering either hiring someone experienced, or someone green with a security mindset to train, as long as there is eagerness and drive to learn. Long story short, I was offered and accepted the position! I even timidly negotiated successfully for the first time in my career, thanks to my mentors.

I just wanted to share my journey since I've read a lot about the common path to security through either Helpdesk or SOC, which I was prepared to do, but I wasn't ready to settle just yet. I realize that my journey is an uncommon one and I am incredibly lucky to have someone willing to take a chance on me, especially during this pandemic. But it CAN happen. Don't give up and keep pushing forward!"

I have found that I don't like the hardware side of things, and embedded engineers often work long hours with little flexibility. I have always enjoyed my CS classes and really want to transition into software engineering, but don't have enough experience with my minor, and am not even sure what sub field I would be interested in. 

My goal over the next couple years is to find a software engineering career where I can work at least partially remotely. My CS class experience includes 3 terms of an intro series that was done in c++, data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, and computer networking. 

With my background and goal of working remotely, does anyone recommend what sub fields in CS would be easiest to transition into? I want to work on some personal projects this summer that would help me get my foot in the door, so any project ideas are welcome as well."

I am starting my first day at my first job (backend software engineer) after graduation in 1st June. I will be joining virtually and I need some advice on what I should do.

I fear that I won't pass the probation period of 4 months as my skills are pretty lackluster compared to other friends that will be starting with me (multiple internships and part-time job). I had only one internship in the past, though it's very bad and pretty much a sink or swim situation and is not really related to this job (Android, this job is Backend).

When I interviewed at this company, I did okay but for the coding exam (implement a github api caller in 2 hours, can Google), I pretty much blew it. Though I still passed. When asked, they said that they didn't expect much from a to-be graduate and I didn't give up right away and still keep searching so they let me pass. I think the main reason that I got in is because of my English skills. (It's an international company in a SEA country)

Right now I am very anxious about whether I will let the team down or not. From the interview they said I would be doing some Scala stuffs but that's pretty much about it. So, for the last two weeks after my last exam, I tried to learn Scala on my own, but I'm still confused about some stuff. My Git skills is mediocre. I know some Java, Python, and pretty much forget about JavaScript. I can write some SQL queries. Also, I will be using Mac but I never used it before as I can't afford it and I fear that it will lower my productivity as I will be fumbling around to set up some stuffs.

What should I do in order to not let everyone down and be a dead weight or get fired? Do you have some suggestions that I should do? Should I worked overtime or on the weekend to catch up with others? This is a very good job with very good salary in my country as it's an international company and I don't want to lose it.

Was curious if anyone has experience or is familiar with the internship process at AMD. I have a couple questions.

Brief summary of school/work exper/technical knowledge:

Computer Engineering undergrad (senior) at state university, 3.7 GPA. Not a lot of hardware experience outside of into to logic design and circuit design courses, my main hardware knowledge comes from my Embedded courses writing device drivers for beagle bones and raspberry pis. My school experience is mainly embedded and traditional programming courses.

For work, I did a summer internship with Lockheed where I worked on the integration and test team (high level systems engineering, nothing low level).

I do research at my university where I write in a lot of C/C++/Python and work in Linux/Windows writing test vectors. The research is starting to focus on ARM based processors and JTAG, so I’m learning about that now.

BUT NOW MY QUESTIONS:

1.) Does AMD even hire new grads for embedded software positions? Do they even have embedded software positions? I was looking through their jobs and it seems like most of the internships/co-ops are hardware based with not a lot of coding

2.) Even with my minimal hardware experience, would I even be qualified to get one of the more hardware based internships/co-ops? And if not, do you know of any intern/co-op positions there that would suit my skill set better?

3.) Are they big on recruiting at career fairs or are they mainly online applications? I’m a part of SHPE and it seems that they weren’t at the SHPE National Conference. How exactly do they focus on recruiting?

I'm a math student with minor in stats, so I'm in my road to finish my degree next semester(3 classes left) and I decided that I want to pursue a major in computer science for the next 1.5-2 years. I took some classes in computer science(Java script, Java and C++) last year and I just loved it. I did one gov internship in the summer of 2019, mostly did some VBA and a little of python. I wasn't really convinced that it prepared me for the job market, most internships/jobs I applied to require a lot of cs work especially the major companies.

I took the last two semesters off due to some serious family problems and now that I'm clear-headed, I decided that a major in computer science is more than necessary to get more opportunities for internships/jobs. I just feel bad for taking so long before finishing undergrad college, 4 years to finish a 3 years degree(we do one more year of HS in Quebec) + 2 years of cs.  Do you guys think it's worth getting that major or should I focus getting a data based job ?"

I have one simple, yet very important question for you guys which I wasn't able to answer to myslef after quite a long time of googling (the more i googled, the more i felt lost).

The question is really simple: which backend language should I choose for webdev? The reason I am torn is this- I've underwent a db course on college, where I was supposed to use PHP (just a simple application, really basic stuff). Then I encountered asp dot net (using MVC architecture) on my internship at the end, which ends in few days (there I was able to work on more interesting stuff, but let's face it, I am still truly at the start of the learning curve here..). Then there is python, which i fancy so much! Yet I haven't even encountered web code in python.

On the internet there is a lot of comparisons, also a lots and lots of biased views on the topic.  Right now I feel strongest in asp .net, but majority of my acquaintances are telling me to let asp go. It wouldn't hurt much starting over, as I said- I am still at the beginning. When I leave my internship, I am ready to go with the topic from the bottom (hell, I still haven't mastered js yet)Do you have a (if possible unbiased, but I know it can be hard) advice for me?"

I know success is relative, but should I be happy with what I have or could I have achieved more?

I graduated HS with a 2.79 GPA and got into the first 4 year school that would accept me, a no name SUNY school upstate. Since then, I've worked on several large open-source projects which allowed me to learn a ton about building websites/backends/databases. I've gotten three web/backend internships (two were paid), one was a no name unpaid NYC startup, one was a material/industrial retailer and the most recent was a large defense aerospace company. I just acquired my fourth internship during my summer of junior year that I start June 1st. It's a distributed-team/remote company. I am excited to start working for them, and I believe I will learn a lot in the stack that I want to be using day to day when I graduate.

 They are giving me a monthly stipend of $4k/month, which I am happy with as it's the most I've ever gotten paid, but I constantly see others with no CS experience as freshman or sophomore's making practically double that in a SWE position at Facebook or Citadel or something. Even though I feel like I am doing well and am told by family/friends that I am doing well, almost everywhere I look for people in my position are doing better. I feel like junior year is supposed to be the summer where you land your big internship at a Google or a Twitter but I haven't done that.. am I doing alright? I've interviewed with Google last year and this year and did not get it, and I also made it to the second round of Twitter interviews this year but also no offer. In a way I am happy I didn't get into those companies because I get to have this experience with a startup where I will have a large role on the team... but at the same time I am struggling to feel happy about my accomplishments because even though I know I can write good software and have a decent CV/resume with a few years of real work experience and projects while still in college, I am not making that crazy $45-60/hr wage and feel inferior.

Is that a reasonable timeframe? What are my options? It seems to me that it's express entry, or maybe leverage NAFTA which I guess is a separate thing. 

I took a look at the requirements and tallied up my points, and by my calculation—with my age, Bachelor's degree, English proficency, etc.—I was just short because of work experience. My college major was in computer science and I'm currently working as a software developer. I've had two IT internships totalling 4 months full time and 4 months part time, as well as a part-time work-study position totaling 5 years. Could any of that, plus the 7 months I'd have at my current position by the time I hope to move, count towards points for work experience and push me over the threshold for Express Entry? Would anyone even be willing to hire me for a software development job? I've seen that a job offer is critical to even apply, and apparently that's a whole process for employers.

Basically, are there any options that make it feasible for a fresh STEM grad to move from the US to Canada, maybe some NAFTA provisions that would make things easier? It would just be nice to start fresh in a new big city, even with the significantly higher cost of living, as living in America with all the racism, stupidity, corruption, shitty politics, and everything else feels like being trapped in a house that's burning down."

For those of you who have taken the path of either of those majors how did you apply that to an internship or job?

I want to make sure his experience is a positive one during this abnormal period of enforced remote work. I'd like input from experienced engineers, as well as input from students who have been interns, as to how I can accomplish this.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him what growth areas he would like to target this time around, and was met with relative indifference. He's a very laid back person who will hammer out most of what you put on his plate, largely independently. I have some tasks slotted in a codebase that he is already familiar with so he can hit the ground running. I won't have any problem drying up a backlog of technical work for him. I'm more concerned with the softer side of things - how can I be an effective mentor remotely, without necessarily pestering him all the time, clashing with his laid back personality?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm considering setting up a weekly check-in where we can chat about what he's worked on during the week, maybe go over areas he's struggling in, for as long as he needs. I would obviously also be open to daily asynchronous communication over Slack. Someone else on my team suggested an omnipresent voice chat room similar to what you would have in Discord or an on-going Skype call that I'm always in, where he can pop in and ask questions at will. This feels a little heavy to me, but might be worth doing for the first couple of weeks to make sure he's acclimated to working remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is letting things flow organically, since we've already worked together and are comfortable with one another. He knows he can pester me if he needs help and I'll answer, but some part of me feels some pressure to be very proactive as a mentor. This is partly self-imposed, and partly because the other person on my team who will  be serving as a mentor for another intern is very much a go-getter type, who will be up in their intern's business all the time whether they like it or not. I feel like effectively kicking my feet up and just treating him as a normal old junior dev is being a bit lazy on my part, even if that's what they say they would prefer. Opinions?"

It's my first internship and I'm a rising sophomore in college. I was originally happy about even landing one in this time of age (the internship is unpaid). However, there was a red flag on my first day. We were supposed to have a team meeting at 5pm, I waited and it never started so I texted my boss (btw text is our main tool of communication). S/he said ""We're running a bit late but hang in!"" We ended up starting the meeting 3 hours later. This has happened at least every other week with meetings (We have about 2-3 a week). It's been frustrating to sit around, not knowing exactly when we start and end up wasting a few hours. They also do not send out notifications for meetings for certain meetings, but talk about meeting attendance being ""unacceptably low"". (They're usually recorded and I've heard my name being brought up because I didn't show up when this meeting was never mentioned). 

I'm part of the social media team, and the communication among the team is horrible. I will be assigned a task, complete it days before it will be uploaded, then have it rejected because the board decided on something else an hour or two before it should be posted. I will also be assigned a task that requires information from the CEO (like a list, etc.) and not receive it for weeks. Even if I ask him, he says he'll get to it soon and just leave me hanging for who knows how long. Yet at team meetings, he'll call me out for not completing the task and putting the full blame on me. 

This is just a speculation, but it seems that no one in the company is paid (not sure about the CEO). The content editor and brand director who work almost full time for this company are for sure not paid (they told me they work a few other side jobs). It makes me question where the money is going. I'm also curious why people are still willing to work for this company when there seems to be little incentive?

I know startups and even most companies aren't structured perfectly. However, I feel that this company is too unorganized. Does anyone have any advice on how to pull through till this ends? I'm passionate about social media marketing but I feel that I'm just not learning. Or is this what I should have expected?"

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
My price range is flexible, but I would prefer something less than $1,000.00.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
As long as I can be confident in its reliability, yes.
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
performance, battery life, build quality, form factor
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
Not that important. If it could be light and thin that's nice, but more of a secondary benefit.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**  
N/A
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**  
MATLAB, Python, C++, ImageJ, Autodesk, LAMMPS, QUANTUMESPRESSO, maybe GIMP.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
N/A. I game on my desktop, this laptop is specifically NOT going to have any games on it.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**  
A good keyboard would be nice, and certainly reliable build quality.
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
I am very open to ideas, I just want to make the best choice because it's going to be a laptop that I have for a long time. It should be a laptop for a scientist, if such a thing exists.

For further context, most of my applications will be for non-grad roles. The main reason I'm asking this question is purely because I'm not sure what to expect from a mid level frontend interview."

I know a big factor of getting an internship is the interview and your ability to solve algorithms. Spring semester I’ll be taking an Algorithms and Data Structures class. I started reading the “Intro to Algorithms” book that everyone recommends, but then I learned that I’ll be taking a class on this stuff anyways. Is it worth my time reading this?

So far I’ve learned Python, HTML, some CSS, and plan to learn JavaScript then SQL next. I plan to design a few websites for myself and friends as projects.

I’m unsure what field specifically I want to go in, maybe web development or software engineering, but I want to get an internship so that when I figure it out, I’ll have some experience.

How should I spend my time? Is building project websites a good idea? Any comments are appreciated!"

gsgv18,3,2020-05-28,I'm in my early 20s. The schizophrenia gene ruined my future. How do I fix it?,ImpressiveMelatonin,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gsgv18/im_in_my_early_20s_the_schizophrenia_gene_ruined/,"Hello,

I'm a young adult who graduated from college last year. I do not yet have a job. Basic story:

1. I was a model student in high school and had a perfect reputation. I was running a business, running clubs, doing internships, playing sports, networking, getting great grades and test scores, etc. Everyone expected me to succeed, especially me. I got into over a dozen colleges and attended a top 20 one. I was expecting to go to Wall Street.
2. When I came to college, everything that could go wrong did. Failing classes, disciplinary issues with the school, social conflicts, squandered internships, chronic lateness, etc. I developed a strong interest in a theoretical subject, which I changed my major to and started a club around. That probably saved me in the midst of everything and allowed me to finish my degree. But my GPA dropped a full point by graduation and I didn't earn too many good references or develop too many positive relationships with professors, despite the fact that I was continuously trying to self-analyze and maintain the same trajectory I was on.
3. Without a job offer and with a string of unexplained failures, after graduation I started trying to compensate for my newfound moral and executive function deficiencies with a variety of unregulated supplements. None of them worked, and I instead acquired a depersonalization/derealization that I wasn't able to get out of until recently. Now somehow it's been almost a year since graduation.
4. I laid out the whole story to a psychiatrist and began talking with him. Eventually, we got into my family history (my mom has schizophrenia) and discussed the minutiae of my phenomenology. He determined that he was almost certain that my schizophrenia genes switched on at age 18 and I entered the prodromal phase, acquiring a psychosis spectrum state comprised of paranoia, slight perceptual alterations, and negative symptoms that didn't meet the criteria for full-blown psychosis. This explanation unified every unexplained factor about my experience and, after considering dozens over the years including that, was sufficient for me. I won't take medication yet but I will keep it in the cabinet and take it if things deteriorate. I've put in place a variety of both personal and interpersonal checks and balances that will help me recognize and respond to delusions and hallucinations if they arise in the future.

Now I'm trying to move forward from here. I still want to make my dreams come true, even though I'm aware some people wouldn't want me around if they knew the deal. I can't live for them. My true dream is to be a professor in this theoretical subject, but if I can't do that I at least want to work at a think tank that's involved with it and later become an author or columnist. If I figure out my finances and secure some status for myself, I can probably be an author or freelance columnist full-time, which will be good if my condition worsens. But until age 30 or so, I don't think I can make a name for myself without embedding myself within credible institutions.

I want to get a master's degree in this subject at the very least, and also hold at least one resume-boosting job. But all my professors know me as the chronically-late person with a rolodex of vague excuses (which I made because I knew something was wrong with me but I couldn't settle on an explanation) and all my former bosses know me as the same. My GPA is not good despite the fact that, though I don't want to be arrogant, I think I have some very good ideas in this subject. I made a blog to share some of them and everyone who reads it gives me glowing feedback. I think I could make some valuable contributions in this area, but my executive and social dysfunction will no doubt hold me back for the rest of my life.

**TLDR:**

I've angered a lot of people so far and I don't have many allies, but I don't know how to explain what happened to admissions committees, future employers, and alienated past contacts without disclosing this condition and stigmatizing myself. What's the explanation I should use, if any? How do I go about rekindling relationships and cleaning up my life?"

I'm  in my third year, but I'm graduating two semesters early and finishing up this summer. I originally had an internship laid out with a F500 company and the plan was to work with them during the summer and try my best to receive a full time offer immediately after. However due to Covid-19, my internship is essentially lost and I have already declined my other offers earlier this year because I had the expectation that I would be having this internship for the summer..

Now I'm stuck looking for other job opportunities with limited experience. The internship that I lost was supposed to be my first real-world experience working in finance as a finance intern at a major company. 

I've been applying to a bunch of companies on LinkedIn, Handshake, and many other companies but have failed to receive any response from them. I'm also skeptical of applying online because I received more offers from going to networking events than online. 

I'm particularly interested in corporate finance and commercial banking. I was reached out to by a few Financial Advisor roles (which are just insurance sales positions that offer zero based pay and are 100% commission based.) Unfortunately those roles don't really relate much to my interests or skills and I feel I would be struggling to make any sort of money there. 

**Should I just take those offers to build experience, even if they won't provide me much security or income and I don't expect to be there long? Or should I just apply to companies in the area I'm interested in?**

I've recently started applying for internships as it is compulsory to have practical hours under your belt to graduate from software engineering. I sent an application off to Amazon for their Professional Services intern role and heard back from them a couple of days ago.

From what I understand, this is a role where it is required to have a technical background but is more about consulting with B2B as opposed to being a particularly technical role such as software dev.

I have been asking all my friends for advice going into the interview and rather than just ask a general question here on the subreddit I wanted to know if anyone had any experience with this particular role at any company?

What kind of things were expected or did you do? I feel that the interview process would be far more focused on people skills and innate qualities rather than a very technical interview.

Any of your experiences or thoughts would be awesome!"

I've interned on the Infrastructure team the past 2 summers and I was told a week ago that I would be interning on the Cloud team this summer, which I was super stoked about because I would be able to learn a new skill that I haven't done before.

Then I got an email from a manager (different team / people, but still Infrastructure) telling me my project for the summer, which is on the Infrastructure side. I emailed my HR friend asking if there was a mixup and that I was really excited to work on something new, and they told me the manger specifically selected me because of my past experience and skills. 

I don't know how to proceed without being a dick. Do I push to be on the new Cloud team or keep doing Infrastructure for the third summer? 

On one hand I get to do something I haven't worked on before and learn new skills, but I'm basically not being a team player. I'm also worried about underdelivering on both teams, if I underdeliver on the new team then it shows that I made a mistake by trying something new, if I underdeliver on the old team then it shows I'm not capable of doing something I was picked to do. 

In the email from the manager that picked me I read the project description and it freaked me out because I don't know what any of the stuff means, so that might play a role in this. I get that every intern / new hire feels this way, I don't need emotional support just how to logically proceed / what my best career route would be. I'm also most likely going to get a full time offer since I've been loyal to this company for the past summers and my team likes me. 

I only have 3 days to try to do something. I'm conflicted.

Thank you!"

I had been living in my college town for the current school year that is now ending.

I have another year left, but family wants me to completely clear out my off campus apartment and move back home and finish my last year there. Also they don't live in the US.

They want me to do this in order to cut costs because they don't want to pay for another year of rent. I understand cutting costs, and given that so much is changing with covid 19, I think it will be possible to do stay home and take classes online. However I am worried about finishing my last year of college online. Mainly because I think I might be at a disadvantage compared to other students who are on campus with direct access to instructors, other students, involvement opportunities, etc. Also I will be outside of the US which adds challenges when I'm looking for work leading up to my graduation.

So is moving back home to finish college likely to affect my job prospects?

I was hired in the company in which I work today after a successful internship in 2017.

Since then, I have been very productive and engaged in the project we are working on and I have always had the best marks in the team and among the best in our department, so I have always had decent salary increases.

Last year i asked for a salary alignment with the current market. I was told that it is impossible unless I make a promotion as a technical referent which will cost me one more year of waiting. I was not convinced at the beginning since I did not yet have the level of a technical referent but I was told that it does not matter and that I could do it.

After a year of technical referent work they asked me to do training and workshops that I could not do so the promotion was finally canceled at 90% of the process and after a year of work. At this point I let all the work down. I'm not interested any more I  come late and leave early and I just do the minimum work to unblock my teammates and the important deliveries.

&amp;#x200B;

But since my project manager knows what I'm capable of, he proposed to them a new promotion as a technical coordinator and they agreed to that. At that time my team leader resigned from the company but my new leader knew about it and agreed to the promotion which was meant to be in March.

Because of the COVID-19 all promotions got delayed but now he is informing me that he is not convinced with my promotion and that he is canceling it.I just got a big hit and I don't know what to do, if I'm leaving the company, changing the team or just staying.

But for now I decided to not be productive and I will keep all what I know about the project for myself, as there are a lot of things that no one knows but me and my first team leader because I worked on the majority of big issues with him. I know that's not very ethical but it was a hard decision to make to feel protected until I found the right solution, because in few days the new team leader, which is a very good person that I respect by the way, can get all the points that he needs to keep the project in the same level of productivity.

&amp;#x200B;

**So I'm here asking for advice on how to not to be productive and not giving the inputs he needs cleverly? I really don't know how to do it.**

If you have any other advice about my situation go on and tell me maybe it will help."

I was part of the IBM summit program, some reasons I didn’t get a full time offers. Even though during the time of my internship I was extremely active at the hub, done all the mangers task and also full filled summit program task. Apart from all that work they expect you to get IBM badges, I started some but couldn’t finished it due to traveling and client meetings. Still don’t know why I didn’t get an offer. I know lot of the people with me didn’t do as much work I did, but still they got offer. Many of the summit intern at the IBM came with big connections. I was the only few people who had no connection. Most of the people who I know got offer came with connection. I emailed the hub manager &amp;amp;amp; summit manger they did not give any proper answer. I even told them if anyone rejects their offer I’m willing to take it but they didn’t care. 


During the summit internship I was going through a tough time. My father was hospitalized &amp;amp;amp; going through an amputation. I still put a smile on my face &amp;amp;amp; done all my work. Only hub manger knew about my situation. She seen me working so hard. Whenever at the hub all other summit interns were playing around,  I utilized it well and made sure I use this time wisely by going through design thinking garage or attending IBM events to make connection. After not getting the offer I emailed all my connection but no one really could help since they are not the “Recruiter”. Honestly speaking during the summit program the summit hiring program manager was extremely nice and said reach out to me for anything but once the program was done, she ignore all my email. It’s really hard to specially coming off from university &amp;amp;amp; thinking I got it and take only one person to take you down. 

Anyways, I’m being positive! Activity applying to IBM &amp;amp; other places. Hope something will work out soon."

There I am, interning at some company in a faraway place. It's pretty early on in the summer, I'm still making friends with the other interns. Here walks in this new intern, thought she was kind of cute at the time but that was all. We'll call her Kate. Well she ends up hanging out with the same group as me. We don't work together or anything, but I end up seeing her fairly often among our group of friends. 

Summer goes on a bit, we get to be pretty close. Then one day we're all out at this event drinking and dancing at this event. Another friend picks up on the chemistry and tells me I should dance with Kate. It might have been the alcohol talking, but that idea *blew my mind.* Now I'm a pretty shy guy, so normally I would have never even considered it. Drunk me though? He went all in.

And you know what? It **actually worked out.** 

Cue what may be one of the greatest times of my life. We're dating, we're hanging out, and I can't believe my luck. The fact that a girl like Kate could go out with a guy like me? *This girl? Me?!* Things couldn't have been better. We have a lot in common, similar ideals, both avid readers, yada yada you get the picture. She's smart, funny, and drop dead gorgeous to name a few things that you probably could have already guessed. We're a couple of crazy kids who can't get enough of each other.

Now here's where I fucked up. The end of the internship comes and it's decision time. Do we stay together or call it quits? Kate lives pretty far from me. If we tried long distance, there's no telling how long it'd be till we could actually be together again. Me in my extraordinarily finite wisdom finally settled on, ""You know what, I don't see how this can work if we can't actually *be* together."" Made sense in the moment, but let me tell you that was the **wrong** decision.

Kate leaves and about one week later I feel the deepest pit in my stomach that ever was. Life goes on and I go back to school, but that feeling in my gut is still there. I work up the courage to talk to her, but all I can tell her is that I have a book recommendation. *Book recommendation? Are you fucking kidding me?!* 

Now it gets worse. I do it again. Like two more times where I basically just text her out of the blue with another goddamn book I liked. Finally, one day I find my balls again and work up the nerve to give Kate a call. And fellas, let me tell you, I laid it all out on the table. I acknowledged how completely moronic it was that I did what I did, that I made a huge mistake. I tell Kate I know it's not my choice to make, but I'll do long distance if she'll take me. I knew this was a risky play, but I had to give it a shot. 

I'd love to sit here and tell you that she took me back. That my wrongs were righted and we all lived happily ever after. Unfortunately that ain't how it went down. I'll say this, Kate was gracious about it and that was more than I deserved. Fittingly enough, she mentioned that that chapter was closed now. I almost smiled at that one. We caught up on a few things and then called it a night. 

And when I hung up that phone I felt that pit sink further than ever before. Because that call was probably the last I'll ever hear from Kate. They say if you love someone, let them go. I'm here to tell you that don't you fucking dare.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I met the dream girl. We spent one incredible summer together. I called it quits because of the distance. Regret sits with me for a cool year and when I finally try to get her back it's a no go. Keep your loved ones close fellas, because losing this one hurts like hell."

gsr7ay,1,2020-05-29,Should I seek a lawyer?,Uppergot,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/gsr7ay/should_i_seek_a_lawyer/,"Hi there!

I worked two months on an internship at a tech company in my city, however, when I was working there they gave bonuses and asked for overtime work from the interns (things that are illegal for interns in Brazil), and now they are firing me, without me even seeing my work contract.

I am a minor and worked without a signed contract due to pressure by my supervisor.

The law that regulates internships clearly states that offering overtime and bonuses to interns is a legal recognition of employer-employee status, meaning that by offering those things to me, they recognized me as a full time employee witch should receive a much higher pay and the benefits associated.

I did not work any overtime nor did I take any bonuses.

The reason they gave me for firing me was because of ""low productivity"", but the way the productivity data is gathered clearly lumps overtime under it, meaning that if no intern in the company worked overtime, I would have a pretty average productivity rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I seek a lawyer to sue the company and get the pay I am possibly entitled to?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks."

gsvzvd,7,2020-05-29,Never go alone to meet anyone from a friend-finding app!,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gsvzvd/never_go_alone_to_meet_anyone_from_a/,"Throughout my first year of college I subsisted on multivitamins, tea, those little protein packs of cheese, meat, and fruit, and incalculable amounts of granola. Not the worse diet, though the lack of variety and odd meal schedule prevents it from being called “healthy"". I’ll also admit that in high school I was that brand of student that didn’t try very hard, but still achieved passing grades; so when college came around, and I enrolled in classes far more difficult than anything I’d taken before, I was not in any way prepared for the onslaught of the curriculum. I’ve never been a fan of stimulants, legal or otherwise; barely drank tea that contained caffeine, so staying awake late in the night to complete the mountains of homework was initially difficult.  

When my break suddenly arrived, I was beyond elated; told all my friends that we could finally spend time together, but all of them had other plans; mostly with their families, or internships, or work unrelated to their studies. Saddened, but not resentful, I planned for a summer alone. I bought video games, started trial subscriptions to streaming services—hadn't had time before to watch them—and downloaded a few social apps; hoping to perhaps find a new friend under similar circumstances.  

The first few days went by slowly, boringly, and I didn’t really do much besides play video games and watch forgettable movies. I hadn’t had any hits on the socialization front, and realized that there wasn’t anything suited to my preferences streaming that I hadn’t already seen several times in theaters and on television. Boredom came in waves, alleviated only by certain avenues of self-satisfaction, and alcohol—a vice newly acquired. But I soon realized that continuing with such behavior would only lead to a crappy, incredibly regretful summer, so I got off my ass—literally—and actively reached out to people on the apps I’d downloaded.  

Before, I had just attempted to match with someone and let them initiate the conversation; but that hadn’t worked, so I instead began messaging people first, regardless of if we’d matched—if the app allowed—and initiating what I thought would be interesting conversation. I actually talked to a few people this way, although most wanted to continue some variation of the routine from which I was hoping to break away. Eventually, almost two weeks since amending my behavior, I found someone with whom I could imagine myself spending time. We shared interests, sensibilities, and weren’t far enough away from each other for hanging out to be costly. But like anything that is *too* perfect, the first meeting of potential friendship went disastrously, and my life was adversely affected as a result. I’ve since lost an eye, and will probably never play video games properly again.  

The circumstances surrounding the unwanted removal of two different parts of my body require quite a bit of context; as you can imagine. These terrible events happened in the same day, the first time I had actually met this person. This person, who I’ll call Craig, lived about twenty minutes away from me. It was essentially a straight shot down the highway from my dorm; he lived in an apartment complex commonly rented by students who had moved off campus. I decided to meet him at his home rather than bring him to mine, since I hadn’t yet cleaned up the debris from my slovenly first week of break. 

Once there, we reiterated what had been said over chat, mostly to catch-up, but also to confirm that the other person was actually the person we had spoken to; and that the things we had claimed were actually true. Having passed each other’s identity confirmation, we agreed upon an activity—video games—and sat beside each other on his couch. An interest in split-screen gaming was something I had valued about him, because it’s not something you really see done that often in the era of online gaming. We played for a while, until the question of food arose. Since I had made the drive, he offered to buy something, being the “host” and all. We ordered pizza, continued to play, and genuinely enjoyed each other’s company.  

Things became weird when Craig suggested that we go outside to, “watch the sky.” I was having a good time playing video games, and the weather had been mostly cloudy; nothing that I’d find interesting to look at. But I assumed he had just grown tired of playing and wanted some fresh air, so I went along. We stepped onto the balcony connected to his apartment—he was on the second floor—and look up at the sky together. Just as I’ve described, it was mostly cloudy, with a few rays of sunlight preventing complete gloom. He asked if I saw anything interesting, and after gazing around, I told him that the only visible object was a plane in the distance, which I wouldn’t call interesting. He nodded as if he agreed, then pointed lower in the horizon towards the mountains visible in the distance, and asked what I thought of those. I commented that they were, “Cool”, and he then asked what I specifically enjoyed about them.  

That’s how we spent the next fifteen minutes. He’d point out something in the distance, ask what I thought of it, almost insist that I describe my exact feelings, then move onto another thing. Eventually, we left the balcony, having spotted and discussed everything we could see from that vantage. We returned to the couch, and I immediately picked up my controller, hoping we could get back to playing video games. But rather than pick up his, he dramatically cleared the table, knelt beside it, and threw his arm onto it; gesturing for me to do the same. 

“Bet you five bucks you can’t beat me in arm wrestling!”  

I hadn’t arm-wrestled in years, and didn’t really take him for the kind of guy to initiate such a thing, but I accepted his challenge; he didn’t seem any stronger than myself, both of us being small-framed guys. I got down and locked hands with him, and after the countdown I put forth as much strength as I could.  

I won almost immediately. I had felt only the slightest resistance, and would’ve thought that he let me win so he could up the bet and destroy me the next round, but the strain on his face in that brief moment seemed totally genuine. He shook his hand, saying that he just needed to warm up, and placed his arm onto the table again. We went two more rounds, even switching arms for the third, and I won each time. He actually looked exhausted afterwards, so I suggested we watch a movie or something. He said that was fine, and loaded Netflix on his console. We selected a movie that neither of us had seen, which was fairly surprising considering our shared love for film, and started watching.  

About thirty minutes in he said he was going to grab a glass of water, but told me I wouldn’t have to pause it because he could still hear the TV from the kitchen. I agreed, and kept my attention on the screen. This, unfortunately, was a mistake that cost me a couple parts of my body. I didn’t hear his light-footed steps as he snuck up behind me and injected me with the tranquilizer. Having an aversion to needles, I quickly jerked a way the second I felt the sensation, but the sedative had already gone in, and I felt its lethargic effects almost immediately. Sluggishly, I moved away from the couch, knocking the table over in the process. He came towards me, hands uncurled and poised as if to grab me. I tried to retreat to the door, but my legs felt as if they’d been filled with concrete.  

Craig lunged at me, knocking me to the ground. I tried to fight him off, was sure that I could, but the sedative was potent, and I struggled to keep his clawing hands away from my face. He then delivered a quick punch to my ribs, causing me to momentarily drop my hands away from my face; although the punch itself didn’t really hurt. Taking advantage of this opportunity, he thrust his own hand into my face, placing his fingers around my left eye.  

“I only need one! Just this one!” He shouted in my face despite sitting on top of me. He seemed to have gone rabid; his eyes widened as if under some spell of lunacy. I was growing weaker by the second, and could only slap my hands pathetically against his body as he pried my eye from its socket. Mercifully, the sedative—whatever it was—had also anesthetized me. I felt only the tug of my eye’s removal, and a sort of hollowness at its absence; and of course, the complete loss of sight from that side. Otherwise, there was no noticeable pain. 

I would’ve at that point preferred to have gone unconscious, but my body, apparently accustomed to resisting sleep from late-night studying, kept me awake; fought the mind-numbing effects. Craig left for a moment, going into another room of the apartment. I still couldn’t get up, so I put a hand over my bleeding socket. Blood trickled between my fingers anyway, sliding warmly down my face and wetting my hair. I had a thought to crawl over to the upturned table and press one of the unused napkins given with our pizza to my eye, but before I could act on the thought, Craig returned to the living room with a hacksaw.  

My arm came off next. As my body fought the sedative, it also fought the numbing agent, and I sure as shit felt the teeth of the saw pierce my skin, split through the underlying flesh, grind against the bone, and sever my right arm. It was not quick, it was certainly not painless, and I even briefly lost consciousness throughout the crazed operation. When the arm had finally been separated from my body, Craig—so thoughtful—immediately proceeded to cauterize my stump with an iron he’d plugged up beside him. 

I passed out the moment it touched me.  

I woke up sometime later. Not of my own volition; someone had been furiously knocking on the front door. Dazed and shocked, I pulled myself up from the floor, barely registering the aspects of my body that I now lacked. I did not notice the sticky, coagulated blood that coated the floor and my clothing. I went to the door, opened it, and came to face a man standing on the porch. He stared at me as if he had just been met with a reflection of his decayed self, then fell back and screamed. I stood there, confused and even a bit irritated—I had terrible headache and his screams didn’t help it.  

I reached out a hand to help him up—or so I thought. When nothing came into view, I tried the gesture a few more times, and when it continuously failed, I tried with the other arm; succeeding this time. Once he was up, I examined the arm that had failed to follow my command, but found only a stump. Then the recollection of the day’s earlier events hit me, and I passed out once again.  

I awoke in the hospital. I was told that I had been there for over a day, and that my parents, who had only just recently been contacted, would be arriving in a few hours. After some tests, the hospital staff left me, and an officer stepped into the room. He asked me questions, which I answered as clearly as possible, and took notes as I did so. Once the interview was over, he told me that the man I knew as “Craig” was not the person who rented the apartment. The actual renter, named Daniel, had been on vacation, but returned earlier than planned due to a negative experience he’d had.  He found me answering his door in the state I’ve previously described. He said that he lived alone, and that no one else beyond his landlord had keys to the apartment.  

The officer hadn’t seen anything like my case before in the area, and had no real leads as to the true identity or residence of Craig. I tried to show him Craig’s profile on the app in the hopes that it could offer potential clues, but the profile had been deleted, and I could only remember the things related directly to the interests we shared. The officer left, and I laid there, doped up on medication. I realized that the *sky-watching* and the arm wrestling had been tests to ascertain my visual acuity and strength; and that I had apparently done well enough to warrant the theft of my body parts. I can only assume that he desired some sort of transplantation—with him being so weak, and I guess partially blind as well.  

I’ve recuperated as best as possible, I think, and am currently looking into prosthesis; although with student loans nuking my bank account every month, I doubt I’ll be able to afford anything better than an eye patch and some sort of hook hand. "

I’m top 3% of my class with a 5.49 weighted GPA and a 1470 SAT with a 790 in math. I’m looking to get a Mechanical Engineering graduate degree and grab an MBA on the way. The issues begin to arise when I realize that my demographic makes me one of the least eligible for scholarships and financial ad and that I don’t have any college fund. This means that I have to rely on merit based scholarships and limited financial aid for a 6+ year degree. I think this pretty much rules out the majority of T20s for me. With that out of the way: 
- I’ve had an internship since freshman year with a mechatronics startup called Houston Mechatronics that currently has deals with DARPA and NASA and they’ve given me some great engineering projects. I am their youngest person on site and their first high school intern.
- One of my “passion projects” would definitely be my car as I’m a huge car nut and have done every single modification and bit of maintenance to it myself down to the engine block. I have done acoustic calculations and complete wiring setups for my competition sound system and have learned the ins and outs of fuel mixtures, materials types and properties, and mathematic tuning through this project.
- I’m also a huge computer nerd lol. I’ve learned Java, Java Script, and I’m currently learning C# through Unity. I’ve taken AP CSP and APCSA with 4s on AP tests.
- My APs include: AP Human Geo, AP Capstone Seminar, AP Capstone Research, AP Physics, AP Physics 2, AP CSP, AP CSA, AP World History, AP Language and Comp.
- I’ve currently decided that I’m going to apply to UT Austin, Stanford (why not), and Texas A&amp;M

gsz69a,7,2020-05-29,Be aware of scam internships!,KevnBlack,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/gsz69a/be_aware_of_scam_internships/,"A few months ago, I recently applied for an internship listed on the Chegg Internships website and the supposed HR representative, we'll call him Wohali, of the company just got back to me a few days ago. The listing sounded too good to be true; $30/hour remote position with flexible hours for a college student. Sounds amazing, which was how they pulled me in. The listing was removed from the website but it was for the position 'Data Analytics Consultant Intern' for a company listed as 'Courier Express Limited'. I was emailed on May 26th that I was to be scheduled for an interview the following morning, which was four hours of messaging back and forth various questions related to data analytical tools like R, Python, SQL, etc. Everything seemed legit at first, Wohali had a LinkedIn page with listed experiences and the company website looked legitimate as well, leading me to think that I could proceed further with no questions asked.

I realized something was wrong when I was talking with Wohali earlier this morning through the messaging service 'Wire' and he told me to pay for office supplies with a check he emailed me for $2,800. He had a very persistent personality in his messages by telling me to perform these actions quickly and not to waste any time. I stupidly mobile deposited the printed check and my bank called me soon after saying that fraud alerts have been placed on my account and to absolutely not give any money to this company. At this point, Wohali told me to try a variety of methods of sending them money through various means of PayPal, CashApp, and Zelle, none of which worked, thankfully. When these methods failed he resorted to saying I needed to pursue in the face of negativity by withdrawing $500 and send them giftcards in order to pay for the office supplies. What. The. Fuck. This was where I drew the line and the alarms were finally raised to me, to which I stopped messaging him and recorded the conversation history with this scammer.

Additionally, I called the company on the check (different from the company I was applying for) and they said they were not associated in any way with the company who was offering the internship. This was in contrast to what Wohali told me as he said that the company listed on the check sponsors Courier Express with internships/job fairs and the like. I also called Courier and asked them if this ""Wohali"" worked there and they said no, but said that this isn't the first time they received a call about Wohali under different names and that they are currently investigating these multiple incidents.

From one college student to another, please don't fall for these kinds of internships. These offers may sound enticing but absolutely turn away if they request that you purchase materials through their checks. And ABSOLUTELY do not give them your SSN or any other crucially identifying factors, which I thankfully did not.

I feel so stupid and down after all of this happened. It's sad we live in a world with people who do this scamming shit to college students desperate for work experience. I've applied to so many internships for this summer and the only company that got back to me was a scam. Looks like it's a part-time retail job for me this summer. 

So what do we learn from this? 

**Don't go for internships that ask you to print out a check and mobile deposit for office materials.**

**Don't give them any money in the from of money transfers via mobile deposits or gift cards.**

**If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.**

Tread lightly everyone."

I've seen this community being supportive of each other. Figured I could use some advice and help. This is gonna be a long post as I'm pouring my heart out.

I fucked up. Big time.

I'm just one of your regular guys; 26 years old, techie, etc etc.; from south India, from a fairly conservative family. They've been extremely supportive my whole life, and never really obstructed to anything that I wanted to do. At the age of 22, I met this one girl who was my colleague at that time. Let's call her A. She was from Delhi. We instantly clicked and became best friends. She was with someone else at that time, who she realized was just an emotionally abusive guy. We used to share everything between each other, with no real feelings of love or anything. We were just best friends, talking 3-4 hours a day.  A few months later, I moved to the US for my masters, while she was still in India. We continued to be in touch. I realized she was way too smart to be working in a stupid IT company and convinced her to pursue her masters as well. Helped with everything - from her application process, helping her with her travel arrangements, and helping her settling down after she reached here. (She enrolled in the same university as me - different course though). Somewhere in this time, I started developing feelings for her. She was going through a rough patch at that time with her ex. And after a few months, I asked her out and she said no, as she was still not over that guy. I spent the next 4 months crying every single night and was in depression - I was in my final semester of my masters, with only a couple of months left to graduate, with no job offer in hand or any internship experience. At some point in time, I decided to move on and found someone else. I had this extremely fucked up status quo with this new girl - When we'd meet and hang out, we'd have the best time. But otherwise there wouldn't be any sort of communication between us. Though I had moved on from my friend, I was still in touch with her. We'd meet often and hang out - we also had a huge group of friends. We still cared for each other.

June 2018  - got my degree, got my job. Everyone's happy.

I told my parents about girl no 2. And they met her and they were happy. I met her parents and they were happy. It all seemed good; except for the fact that the girl would ghost me, every now and then. She'd never call, pick up my calls or reply for a few days. And then she'd come back as if nothing happened. I was too blinded by my stupidity to see how badly I was being played by her. I was pissed off for a long time, but I was just too stupid to see it for what it was.

March 2019;

While I was in this emotionally fucked up state, A and I were talking every day and were still being extremely supportive of each other. We were spending a lot of time together. On the phone, or text, or in person. And one fine day, she asked me out. Now, this was the first time a girl ever asked me out. I've never really heard of that kinda stuff until then - I've always come across only guys asking out girls, not the other way around. And I was never in a relationship before. I started freaking out. She asked me to take some time to think about it, as I was overwhelmed at that point in time.

Growing up, I saw two of my cousins marry outside the caste and their parents ( my mom's siblings) went through extreme depression. They were always ridiculed by other relatives and they were just emotionally distraught. I knew my parents wouldn't be able to take such a news from me - given their age and the laundry list of health problems that they have. I knew if I told her yes, that was a commitment I had to stick to - no matter what.  And that would mean putting my family through extreme pain. I didn't want to tell her a yes, knowing the constraints in my house and then later, tell her that things won't work out - felt that would be cheating her. I feared I'd lose my parents if I just dropped the bomb on them one fine day that, Hey guys, I've been dating someone for 2 years now. And I wanna marry her now. They're not fundamentally opposed to a love marriage - they'd be okay with anyone with the caste / community. And that's how they got married 35 years back. But for them, a north indian girl was something they weren't able to take visualize. They met her and really liked her - as my friend. Their viewpoints were different - and had nothing to do with her as  person. They really respected her. They lived their entire life in a conservative environment and weren't ready to take that culture shock that she would bring. At the same time, she was my best friend. We saw each other grow into better human beings. We understood each other, and considered the other's success as our own. I couldn't tell her no either. I wanted to make sure my parents were on board - so that everyone would be happy in the end. I didn't want any drama later in life - besides, her parents, even though they really liked me, would be super unhappy if they get to know that their daughter wasn't being welcomed with open arms into my house.

This tug-of-war continued for 6 months. I couldn't give her any answer. I wasn't able to convince my parents one bit until then. And to add to all this, my work became super stressful. Coupled with the fact that I've always had low self confidence, and self esteem issues. I was under immense stress for all angles. She understood all of it, and was being supportive. But in the end, I started feeling she deserves better than me, and in some ways, started pushing her away. Never being in a relationship before scared the shit out of me of that commitment of being a ""boyfriend"". Even though, for all inten and purposes, we were already like a couple. I didn't want to lose her, or my parents. After 6 months of struggling with being in a limbo state, she decided to move on. She blocked me. I knew she snapped, and she deserved some space. I reached out to some friends to make sure she was okay. This distance just continued growing, and now, after almost 9 months later, we haven't spoken yet. I kept myself busy with work and other hobbies, but I still continued to talk to my parents about her, hoping that if they finally come around, I'd run back to her and live my life happily with her. AND THEY BLOODY DID. They came around finally, and accepted that they let their fears and biases blur their thinking. And were willing to talk.

But,

she had moved on. I should have seen this coming, but I was just to scared to think about it. She moved on, found another guy, and is now engaged to him. My world turned upside down. My insides churned after hearing this. I had this feeling of emptiness that , I remember, I had when I got to know my grandmother passed away. The realization that this person wouldn't be in life anymore just isn't sinking in. In all fairness to her, I don't blame her for what she did. I wasn't confident at that time that I could conquer the mountain in front of me, and I couldn't give her that confidence either. She deserved happiness, after all she's been through with her ex, and now me. She's an amazing person who, I pray, lives the best and most happiest life possible. And now, hear I am, utterly lost because I lost the one person who cared for me the most. Who saw her success in mine, and was willing to do whatever it takes to see me happy, during my worst times. Now, my folks, on hearing this, have become super depressed, and are extremely apologetic for the pain that me and her went through. My mom , who's health was already bad, is now crying day in and day out about this. My dad is also super depressed.  Looking back, I wish I communicated more with her. But as they say, hindsight is always 20/20.

All in all, I lost my best friend. Now, I can't sleep or eat or work. I just don't know how to move on."

I'm going to graduate in the spring of 21 with ~140 credits. 

I want to work in banking, thankfully my internship was not cancelled but switched to a virtual program. It's in corporate banking for a large bank in NYC. 

In a lot of my interviews at multiple banks, the interviewers made it clear that one of the biggest deficiencies they see with new hires was in accounting skills and fundamentals. This lead me to consider pursuing a CPA. 

Is it a good idea for someone who wants a career in banking to pursue a CPA? Also, as someone who hopes to leverage my current internship into a full time offer, what do I need to do to be able to sit for the CPA exam in NY and (hopefully) have my employer cover the costs of the exam and study program. I understand i need 150 college hours get a cpa but does it mattee what those extra hours are? What else do I need?

Furthermore if I'm unable to start a career in banking or I decide it's not what i want for my life I see having a CPA as a very solif safety blanket, am I right about that?

Any response, resources and insight are appreciated!"

But now I have to got to work and I got some nice jobs offers, but I feel like I lost my motivation and passion. I Absolutely love IT but the bad experience of the Internship scare me.

gt30e4,214,2020-05-29,Last day thank god get me the **** out of here,Thank_you_consulting,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/gt30e4/last_day_thank_god_get_me_the_out_of_here/,"After three years in consulting, today is my last day. I have been browsing this community since I was a junior in college 5 years ago. It was instrumental in my success landing an internship and full time role, as I was not aware of the steps you have to take to get into consulting.

I went from Analyst to Manager in three years. I did a secondment. I joined ERGs, and went to firm happy hours. I did projects helping plan out companies that didn't exist yet, and I did projects helping fix companies that are older than my parents, their parents, and their parents before them. I did on campus recruiting. I gladly fielded cold calls from random college students on LinkedIn. I took trips around the world with friends in my start class. I am sure there is more I am not covering but I did just about as much as you can do in three years as possible.

I loved consulting. Man I really got a kick out of all the people I worked with and the work I did. It was really exciting and the people were great (except a couple bad apples, but just avoid their projects).

Reflections on how to be a good consultant:

* **When they say jump, you say how high** \- Do what your manager says. The value in your work is the trickle down organization and insights provided by those more senior than you. You do not want to be the limiting factor in what your team is capable of; if you constantly iterate and seek feedback, you will learn more quickly how to recognize what the platonic ideal of ""good work"" is.
* **Try a lot of different project types** \- I have no idea how to do things on the cost side. I wish I did. I'm pretty good at growth strategy but I would trade that to have a better idea of how to do a lot of things. Eventually you'll have to specialize, so don't rush into it. Take your time. Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.
* **Participate in the life of the firm** \- If you are the world's best consultant but you are unknown, you are still a shitty consultant. You need to get in front of other people to make friends for your own sanity, get pulled onto good projects, and have partners go up to bat for you during your promotion cycle
* **Never forget to take care of yourself** \- Stretch when you get out of bed in the morning. Brush your teeth. Have tailored clothes once you can afford them. Go to the gym at least 3-4x / week. Make time to see your friends. Call your parents. Send people handwritten cards or gifts to maintain relationships. Don't drink every night. Have fun so that you're an interesting person people want to be around. So on and so forth.
* **Treat other people like humans** \- This cuts up and down. In terms of treating superiors like humans, look, do your job, this isn't inconsistent with the first point. But don't be afraid to joke around, and don't be afraid to offer suggestions. If you don't offer suggestions or insights, then people won't know how smart you are and what you can offer. Or, your suggestions are stupid, and someone needs to tell you so that you have time early in your career to adjust. As for treating subordinates like humans, be kind and understanding. Even if you're stern, make sure your analysts understand why you're asking them to do what you're asking them to do.
* **Network constantly** \- If you're still in school, you should have as many networking calls as you can have. These relationships are like fine wine - they get better with time - and it's never too early to start (er, well, you get my point). I'm still benefiting from relationships I made when I was networking in school - they have resulted in job interviews, good client relationships, and so on.
* **Always look out for yourself first and foremost** \- Here's an example - in general, staffers are not your friend. Look out for numero uno. Don't let them put you on that bullshit project in the middle of nowhere doing god knows what. Just say no! You don't have to take their shit! They work for the firm's interests, not yours! Your interests =/= the firm interests. Keep that in mind. What's more important is that you accumulate the network and experience that will most benefit you. If the firm isn't getting what it needs out of you, that's the firm's problem, not yours. Don't let this point get in the way of #1 - you still need to do an excellent job.

It's pretty simple. In some way or another, everything above falls into: ***Do a good job, meet a lot of people, be a good person.***

\- I'm a 23M UK PhD student researching machine learning (subset of AI) at a UK University.

\- Much prefer industry to academia.

\- I have two previous internships with the largest US companies in finance and aerospace sectors (though at UK offices).

\- Currently have an American girlfriend, but too early to tell if K-1 is an option!

\- Spent 2.5 months in the US with her on ESTA/B-1 tourist visa. Loved every second :D

\- Her parents are offering to try and get me in with their large US employers (&gt;20k and &gt;90k employees, both in relatively senior roles in STEM departments).

\- From my research it looks like EB-2 is a strong choice, however I understand it takes a long time (1-2 years? True?) and employer must prove no suitable American citizen could be found (PERM).

\- I am looking to move over and join gf ASAP.

\- H1-B seems the alternative, but I understand it is lottery based - can a STEM PhD offer any improved odds or a similar form of visa?

\- Can I begin the process prior to graduation, or must I wait until the degree is fully awarded (or after the viva defense, where I will learn the outcome immediately)? Could my University assist with this part?

I think I have a fighting chance, but I'm looking for the fastest route. Sadly, I only just learned of F-1 into ODP, else I would have been doing an MS at a US University! Thank you in advance everyone :)"

gt3lja,2,2020-05-29,How bad would it look on my resume if I quit my first job when I go back to school?,nyeehhsquidward,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt3lja/how_bad_would_it_look_on_my_resume_if_i_quit_my/,"Hi there. Two weeks ago, I began my first job, which is part-time as a cashier/floor associate in a retail chain store. This was shortly after my spring semester of college ended and therefore summer break began. I originally was supposed to have an internship relating to my field of study for this summer, but with the current world circumstances that has been delayed to next summer. So, I decided to get some experience outside of my field of study and get a retail job. I like the job well enough, it's just my manager (at least in these particular time I have been there so far) has scheduled me for about five hours for three or four days a week, and often makes me work past the time my shift ends. This is of course not bad at all as I have nothing better to do right now. However, I am slightly worried about this when I go back to college in the fall. I am taking 18 hours next semester (the most my school allows without special permission). Every day of the week will be spent in class from about 9:00 in the morning to about 5:00 in the afternoon.  I also commute back and forth to school, which is about 40 minutes away from where I live. I'm concerned that keeping my job (if my manager keeps up with the way she likes to schedule me) will just be too much for me. I have completed all of my GER's at this point in college, so I am going to be taking some high level and, from what I hear, pretty challenging classes and I just don't know if I can continue to work with this schoolwork load. I know I could try to talk to my manager about this, but she seems to be a hard person to reason with and I'm afraid that when I do try to talk to her, it will do no good. So please, assume with your answer that she will not change her manner of scheduling much. Will it look awful on my resume if I do quit my job in the beginning of August? This is incredibly important to me, as my field of study requires graduate schooling (a doctorate, in fact) and I do not want to hurt my chances of getting into said graduate school, which is pretty competitive for this field. I also obviously do not want to hurt my chances of getting hired ever again. Does anyone have any advice?"
gt3m34,2,2020-05-29,I’m (F/21) a biology college graduate with zero idea what career I should pursue?,ponybucket,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gt3m34/im_f21_a_biology_college_graduate_with_zero_idea/,"Not sure where to post this. It's been 6 months of me out of school and I don’t have a job or any future plans. I am lost with what to do w my life. I have a lot of anxiety about this and in order for me to feel sane I really need some advice on what I should consider doing for my career. I have many many interests, but can see myself doing something academic or health related.  I guess this post is just to ask for help in which direction I should go in moving forward. Beware it is a very long post but please help. 

The story:  I have a B.S. in Biology but I have no idea what to do. I didn’t go into college thinking about a career, I just chose a subject I liked as a major. 

Throughout college I did look into going into medicine. I did an internship one summer that let me shadow doctors and gave coursework for medicine.  This was a great time and I enjoyed shadowing the doctors. I just still didn’t know if I would want to be the doctor. I was interested in helping patients,I am just not so sure about the long and hard MD path. However, I continued to pursue medicine by volunteering and being in a school club.

I also did research, starting in the beginning years of undergrad. I didn’t do it with an end goal in mind, I just knew it may be a good experience to have. However, I did not initially have the best undergrad experience in research.

It was very difficult chemistry research and I went in not fully grasping what was going on in the lab and the purpose to our projects. It didn’t help that I have never had learned or heard of many of the terms used because it was advanced chemistry and did not get brought up in classes I had taken at the time. 

I also had a rough time fitting in and very little interactions with others.  My mentor also never tried to meet with me individually or kept tabs on my work. I was asked to present results in lab meetings, but in the lab I was lost and the graduate student would not let me get my own results, but would have me do the beginning steps to a project (or the entire lab work) and he would take that information and analyze results or do what he wished without explaining to me certain steps. Then my mentor would tell me it is important to take initiative and to explore things. Honestly, the research area was very new to me and I was just trying at that time to help my graduate student and read as much as I could. I couldn’t deliver enough results because my grad student would just use what we did together and just present it for us. This means even if I presented it would be redundant so I am not sure what else I could have done, even now.

In the beginning, I felt shy and it seemed unwelcoming and unapproachable to ask questions. I honestly got a lot of anxiety from this whole experience. As I continued to stay in the lab, I relaxed but did feel like I was a lab assistant instead of learning how to truly do research. My mentor never truly invested time in me, and didn’t get to truly know me. He also never pushed me to attend conferences, and when I asked about it, I was never given the opportunity to go.  At this point I had a lot of imposter syndrome, and felt envy for my friends who had great research experiences. I questioned my abilities as a ‘researcher’.

To be honest, this experience has taught me a lot. I realize that as a mentee I should have approached my PI more to make sure we had more contact. (But seriously, he should have tried too). I also realize I shouldn’t have been so hard on myself for not knowing everything in the beginning. I should have also asked more questions to my graduate student. In the end my grad student and I had a decent relationship. My mentor had high expectations of me but was always willing to write me letters of rec. 

Now I did have one other lab experience. 

It was a summer internship in biomedical research at a different school. I enjoyed the research more and understood it so much better. This improved my performance in the lab. I also got along with everyone in my lab. Everyone was willing to help me and share their stories. My mentor was great and spent so much time working with me. But although my mentor says I can be a great researcher, I doubt that because of my first experience with research. 

This made me reconsider the research career more and has put me in a position where I am lost. ALSO, a huge part of me not wanting to do research is the public speaking aspect. I mean research is great, but it doesn’t matter unless you talk about it and share it with others. That scares me. I can't imagine myself presenting to hundreds of people at conferences.So that is a huge turn off for me. But again, I realize this may be something I just have to overcome. :(

Right now I am just trying to find a job anywhere during my gap year. But with covid-19, this has been hard. In my area, it is also hard to get a lab job and are mostly food quality controls and basic healthcare jobs. 

Time has passed so fast and now I'm 6 months into my gap year. The time comes to where I need to decide what is next. I believe I have 50/50 experience in both medicine and research. I decided to take a gap year because I didn’t know what to do. Medicine just seems like such a large journey and I was so burnt out by the end of my senior year I didn't think I could do it. But after my break I am reconsidering it. 

My big question is what career would work for me? And what step should I take next if I cant figure out my dream job? Masters? (how to decide which one???),  Maybe a Postbac for Med School?, Maybe get a certificate to then become like a Medical Assistant and then get patient hours to apply to PA school? Or maybe I should go into public health and just get a masters? Industry jobs like biotech or pharm? Maybe try dentistry? Or find out a way to freelance. Any help is really appreciated. Thanks.

TL;DR -  Trouble deciding future science career. Hate public speaking but love intellectual challenge."

My experience sophomore year was well, really boring and dry but considering I was young I didn’t really expect them to give me any cutting edge work (I did some SQL queries and I’m an electrical engineer 3rd year student)  that probably isn’t representative of a full time job that I would do.

This summer I am going to intern for IBM as a software developer which is exciting. But IBM does not have the best pay for entry level. 

However, I ask this because I’m going to be a senior now so I really have to consider my first full time job and this is where I’m a bit lost. 

Regarding pay, how long does it take to get a pay increase in defense? The starting salary is decent but I would like to work for 3-5 years before jumping ship if needed. 

How is the work for electrical engineers/computer engineers (when I interned my work did not relate to my field at all) I’m not really interested in PCB board design or manufacturing but I enjoy embedded systems?

And overall did you, or do you enjoy working in defense or is working for a commercial company better? 

Also, I have an interview with Boeing too but I heard that company is going downhill ( unless you can tell me otherwise)

Even with all the internet digital whizbang stuff that enables companies to cast a wide net, for old school methods like recruiting in person, they can't scale it to every possible college. 

So if a high school graduate gets admitted to a target school are they already enjoying a head start in career planning? Even before their first day as a college freshmen? IMO, we are putting too much stock into the school you get into for tech careers. Some people might just stick with their local state college because they were undecided in major when they started. But I'm a big believer in a ""No College Left Behind"" philosophy, though. In this scenario, the college you go to will no longer be an important social signal for internship recruitment."

gt6yck,1,2020-05-29,How I've been feeling for the last few days...,Chemical_Wear,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/gt6yck/how_ive_been_feeling_for_the_last_few_days/,"It all started meeting some girl online from overseas with my goal of actually securing some form of relationship. As we got to know each other more, I found out that she had a boyfriend, which ended up crushing me. For the first time, I maintained my composure and we opened up a bit more about our experiences with love, and I realized that she was able to relate to the few situations I had discussed, which made me feel better. In the few days we've talked I have developed a bit of feelings for her, which is normal albeit weird given the short time frame.

In the coming days I'll continue to talk with her and then see if I want to actually pursue a friendship or cut myself off and move on if I want to look for an actual relationship. I find it stupid that I'm resorting to the internet to find that special someone. But I guess it's not the worst thing in the world, giving the pandemic. Nevertheless, I think I'm just desperate to be involved in romance. What's more silly is how my broken feelings made me contemplate about my own life.

Currently, I'm keeping myself quiet and away from my housemates that I've become much closer to over the past few months during my internship, as I am not comfortable discussing my issues once again with them. I'm also keeping quiet among my remaining friends, as I felt like I've bothered them too much with my own life. I know for myself I've been down this path over and over again. For the last few days, I've been contemplating my own life, and I found myself being pulled into this void once more, feeling sadness, loss of hope, pain, and loneliness. At 25 years of age, I envisioned that I would have already have a career and perhaps also settling in with the person I would want to marry one day. I'm very far away from either of those happening.

I first try to look at my own accomplishments, especially throughout my time in college. I graduated with a dual degree, finishing with a 3.45 GPA. I partook in undergraduate research and post-bachelor research through the government. I helped over a thousand students as a teaching assistant and a tutor for the same classes throughout the span of four years. I went above and beyond taking graduate courses, succeeding in every one of them. I helped with rebuilding a club and keeping people together through my jovial attitude. And I've done my best to check in with my close friends, see how they're doing, be there when they need it, and provide love and support to them.

Despite these feats, I unfortunately still hold more weight to the negative aspects of my life and my personality. My ego convinced me to believe that I was a top tier student who will go to a prestigious university to obtain a Ph.D. Three months later, I find myself getting rejected to all of my choices, proving that I was not even close to great enough for top-20 institutions, primarily because of my GPA, which still has left me broken and thinking twice about what to do with my life. I look at the fact that I took six years to graduate college, as I bounced around various majors until I made the decision to pursue my dreams. In that process, As and A- turned into Bs and Cs, which ultimately led me to failing my first and only course with a D, being one of only two students who received that grade in a 200-300 person class, where the majority of the grades were As and Bs. I think about the times where my ego got the better of me, coupled with my high sensitivity, where I acted like a total asshole. This resulted in distancing myself from my suite mates, ignoring my other friends for an entire month, yelling and cursing at those around me, physically hurting each of my family members once, mentally abusing my friends and family, rejecting a few people who expressed romantic interests because I was a chicken to stand up to my family who restricted me to only dating people of my race and their religion, being rejected by two people I fell in love with (only to reveal my true colors and insecurities which ultimately led them to ghosting me as I hurt them over and over again), ghosting my music teacher who was a priest (because I had transitioned to a life without religion), so on and so forth.

What pains me the most is what has happened in recent years. The two-year anniversary of my father's death (where he was declared brain-dead) is coming up and I can't help but recognize how much I still miss him but also how much I hurt him and let him down. I took too long to graduate from college, and as a result, he wasn't able to see me in a cap and gown on graduation day (which the one-year anniversary of that was a few days ago). I think of the many times where I disrespected him, did not do enough to take care of the family sooner, and offer the mental support that he needed in his later years. What will always haunt me is the fact that I ignored him the night before he went into the hospital, where I wouldn't hear from him again. For me, I saw him as a completely different individual, and I knew I couldn't do anything possible to reverse his illness. However, as my mom and half-brother rightfully point out, I was not there to spend time with him. They have even gone further implying I am partly responsible for his death, due to the added stress that came about from my absence, even in the household mostly. I feel as if I have blood on my hands. It's so easy for people to say ""hey grow up, ignore, and move on."" I get that's the ultimate goal, but it takes time. I'm still grieving. I still feel guilt for what I had done. My one promise to him and myself was that I was going to do what it takes to make him more proud, and even now, I have failed to do that still. I feel so damn defeated.

I look at what I came in with college and what I came out with, especially now a year later. One thing I always found silly but interesting was monitoring the number of friends I would have still on social media. I've kept to the philosophy of keeping and removing people based on my interactions with them, because I hold so much value to that. And today, I have 20 people on my social media. I've ended up losing more than what I started with (which was roughly and consistently 100). Again, social media shouldn't be a reason to stop talking to someone, but it is the tool which I used to communicate with them, especially during the pandemic. And even now, I fear that I will lose the remaining friends that I currently have, even the newest ones made through my internship.

I feel lonely again. I don't know if this is a phase or cycle I go through, or if this can be the start of something even more serious. I acknowledge that I'm an idiot and I also realize the many mental health issues that I have, which none of them are excuses for my actions. At this moment in time, I realize how much I miss everyone, even the team I work with, missing doing experiments in the lab, miss the fun times I was able to have, but most of all, miss my father, the only person in my family who accepted me for who I was and loved me always.

I've tried using other methods to talk to random people to vent (such as Whisper and even here on Reddit via throwaway accounts), but have had little to no success. Again, I don't want to talk to any of my actual friends because I feel like a burden to them. I recall one of my friends a week or two ago saying the following: ""During the pandemic, people just aren't around as much because they have their own lives and loved ones to worry about."" That's the painful truth (at least, in my eyes).

I don't know what I'm going to do now. I doubt this will be the last message that I ever will write, but I hope that is not the case. I'm not suicidal, but I do wish I could somehow end the misery.

I've seen therapists before, but at the moment I don't have one. I realize how important it was to have them in my life, as it kept me in check. I plan on getting another therapist once things return normal. But I feel like for now, I just need someone to talk to before I lose my sanity once again."

This September, I will be beginning my 5 year program majoring engineering. The tuition fee is estimated ~$14,000 a year. 

I don’t qualify for OSAP, and my parents were switching their jobs at the start of this year, and then this pandemic hit. It’s uncertain if they will find work, and they live in the US, so they are unable to receive the benefits Canada has been offering. 

I don’t have near enough in my savings either, so I’m considering RBC’s Student Line of Credit. Anyone have experiences with it? What is the interest rate like for engineering? I couldn’t find a specific interest, it said it varies with different programs, without actually showing any numbers. 

The good news is that the university offers a co-op program, though I’d need to be quite lucky to be able to get employed during first or maybe even second year... the third year offers a 16 month internship however, so that will be used to my advantage. But until then, I’m a bit confused on what’s best to do. Any input would be much appreciated, thank you!

P.S: I mentioned my parents live in the US. My father has moved there to work a few years ago, and my mother is also moving there once I start university. Before that we were in Canada (I still am), I grew up in Canada, and I have citizenship."

He’s planning doing the CompTia trifecta (A+, Network+, and Security+) and he was hounding me for not being as invested in it as him. I always thought since I was already in university that I should look to get higher level certs and that certs like A+ aren’t necessarily worth it. My main focus has been looking for experience from an internship or finding a certification to take that’s more specific to what I want to do. I just don’t want spend a lot of money on something that barely helps. I mainly just want to know if I should still follow the CompTia trifecta now, look for higher level certs more specific to what I want to do, or just focus on internships and experience."
gtfdw3,0,2020-05-30,Social Entrepreneurship and COVID,saggerk,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/gtfdw3/social_entrepreneurship_and_covid/,"So we've released our beta for our COVID-19 app geared towards reopening states. The core for us is social good, with the premise that our tool has an expiry date. That said, we do feel that it's possible to apply it towards other non-COVID for profit ventures, even if we currently are going with the social good aspect.  


So on one hand, going non-profit could make sense. Rapid community building through volunteers and collaborators, and be able to grow succinctly to match the current situation. On the other hand, if we go non-profit, we can't really use the IP, the risk engine, with for profit ventures.  


If we decide for profit is the way to go, monetize B2B or B2B2C, then that'll have it's own limitations. One big difference between non-profit and for-profit is getting VC money or investors. That's doable with for-profit. That said, this current project has a timeline, and going through the 3 to 6 month gauntlet of an accelerator is a waste of time.  


The third option is going with a hybrid. If we go with a for-profit arm, we can raise capital, apply our IP to other things at the same time, and move the money over to the non-profit with fighting against covid-19.  


Honestly, we're currently a team of 3, with 2 interns coming in. The deployment schedule is fine, the designs are made for, but this is the tipping point in how we build mentioned communities, deploy our messaging and all of the stuff that makes being an entrepreneur so god damn fun (for me at least). What do you guys think?"
gtfofg,2,2020-05-30,"Is a dual major in CS and EE worth it, or would it be better to do CpE?",cgjnm,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/gtfofg/is_a_dual_major_in_cs_and_ee_worth_it_or_would_it/,"I am extremely interested in Computer Science, but I also am interested in the electrical side of things. My actual question appears further down, and if you just want to read that, then you can skip the next 5 sections, but here is some background in my current education/situation:

I initially started at my university with a dual major in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. After speaking with a general engineering advisor, she told me I would be taking quite a lot of classes since there is very little overlap (and I knew that going in), and I would be better off pursuing Computer Engineering and pursuing a Masters, and she said there was no real benefit in having a degree in both CS/EE versus having a degree in CpE. 

At the time, I just took her word for it and switched to Computer Engineering. That wasn't too long ago, this is my third semester at university and the first semester I was taking classes for both CS and EE, and then my second and now third semester I have taken classes for CpE. All of the courses I have taken for CpE so far still also count for CS and EE, so I haven't gotten behind at all. I do plan on pursuing a Masters in CS, regardless if I get a Bachelors in CpE or one in CS/EE. 

The one thing that is really making me debate whether the dual major is worth it, is the extra time. I don't want to spend the extra time taking the extra classes if there is no benefit. As of right now, I need to take 8 more courses for CS, 13 more courses for EE, or 12 more courses for CpE (not including electives for any of them). Two of the courses in CS and EE might overlap, I'm not sure yet. It's Senior Design I and II, but they have different course numbers, I need to ask the university about that. 9 of the courses for CpE overlap with CS or EE.

Although pursuing a dual major would add a few semesters until I receive my Bachelors, it won't really place me behind my peers. I'm only 19 right now, and I spent all of high school working ahead, so I started out in some junior level classes in my first semester.

I am going to talk to a CS advisor about all of this (rather than just a general engineering advisor), but I am still hoping I can get some opinions from you guys. Also, I know having experience, such as internships, will help tremendously, and maybe even more so than adding a second major, and I am going to start applying for various internships once quarantine is up. (Also, I'm in a club that's working on sending a satellite to space, so I'm sure that'll count for some experience).

&amp;#x200B;

The above may be irrelevant, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to include it. In order to be able to work with both Computer Science topics as well as Electrical Engineering topics (with a slightly higher emphasis on the CS side), would it be worth it to pursue a double major in CS and EE, or would it be better to just pursue Computer Engineering? And I will be pursuing a Masters in CS regardless of those two options. I'm worried that if I choose CpE rather than CS/EE, some opportunities might not be available for me. 

Thank you in advance for your advice."
gtfprr,2,2020-05-30,overlapping internships/jobs. help? :),angelaibs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gtfprr/overlapping_internshipsjobs_help/,"Hi all! I'm in a bit of a pickle.

Ok, this is complicated- but here we go. I'm American. Valid residency in Germany. Valid student-based residency in Hungary (university). Valid exchange-student-based residency in South Korea (its an exchange from my main university in Hungary). I know that's a lot all at the same time. To say the least, life is chaotic. But please just roll with it :)

So I'm currently in South Korea wrapping up the very last semester of my bachelor program, ending in July. After I finish, I'll leave South Korea and go back to Europe to be a happy 'graduate'. I had the option to go to Hungary (where I study/studied), but since it's my last semester I figured I had no reason to go back there, so I decided I would go back to Germany to settle. So- before I came to South Korea in February, I moved all my things (luggage, boxes, etc) from Hungary to Germany so that I could return to Germany when everything in Korea is done. Essentially I thought I said my final goodbyes to Hungary already.

Well, it turns out that I found a Hungarian company who decided to offer me an internship/job position starting next week. Despite the fact I'm in South Korea, they will allow me to work online for now. Then, when I leave South Korea in July, they expect me to work in their Hungarian office. So... that's kinda cool, but totally was not what I expected. I thought I was done with Hungary, and I thought I was gonna end up in Germany. I find it funny that I literally moved all my shit out of Hungary, just to return back to Hungary ;) ...oh, life...

Truth be told, I WANT to go back to Germany... but this internship was a really great chance to get my foot in the door in the field that I wish to work in long term. I don't think this opportunity would ever fall on my lap in Germany the way it did with this Hungarian company. So it's definitely great to have. BUT here'S the thing. The pay is totally shit, and it won't get any better even if a fulltime 'normal' position gets offered to me later this summer (it is VERY likely they will hire me for that). Hungary has crap salaries, so if I stay then I am stuck with that. And honestly I dont wanna be stuck with this crap salary for more than 6 months or so. Seriously, I'm taking a salary right now that is below my living costs because I know it will open doors for me in the long run. But this isn't gonna be easy.

So my plan was this - Take the internship in Hungary. Work there for 6 months. Suffer, but know that I'm doing good for my CV. Then after about 6 months switch to Germany and find a job there. Sounds simple, right?

Well...

There's a special program called Erasmus+ which actually provides funding for new-graduates to take internships abroad. Taking an internship abroad means outside of Hungary (since Hungary is my 'home' university). This means that I could get the funding by taking an internship in Germany (even though I have a residency there, they do not consider it my home because they only look at where my university is). So this means that currently I am not funded by Erasmus+. BUT if i take an internship in Germany then I can get it. So of course I want to do that....

But I can only register for Erasmus+ with an active student status. My student status ends at the end of June. So this means I have to have a confirmed job in Germany within the next 30 days. But obviously I have already accepted the internship in Hungary (until at least September, but at best December). So I need to push the start-date of the German internship until the fall.

So basically I am applying for German companies, expressing my desire to get a confirmed position in June with a start date of September or later. 

Does all of that make sense? lol sorry its super hectic.

Ok here is my dilemma - 

When I write my cover letter/motivation letter for the German companies, and when I send them my CV - Do i mention the Hungarian internship???? Because on one hand, having that position on my CV looks great because it's in the relevant field that I'm applying for. It shows that I already will have some months of experience by the time I arrive to Germany. On the other hand, I fear that the German company will contact the Hungarian company and ask questions - basically I do not want the Hungarian company to know my plans about leaving them/leaving the country.

So please pitch in your thoughts - I'm really curious to hear what you have to say.

Do I mention the Hungarian internship to the Germans? Do I leave it out? Do I mention that I am currently gaining relevant skills (without specifying how)? 

THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!!!!!"

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for.

I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

gthrwz,4,2020-05-30,A very cold evening,mynameisnobody2205,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gthrwz/a_very_cold_evening/,"I suppose I should warn you that this is not my story. This is my friend's story although I should tell you it has been haunting me ever since. A few years ago when I was an intern in a small tech company I had accidentally met my friend robert who had been my childhood best friend even though we had drifted apart. I honestly didn't recognize him at first . His striking blue eyes had lost their gleam and he was an unfortunate victim of male pattern baldness. Anyways one day when we were having dinner at his house he started rambling about his great adventure.  I thought it was odd but just continued to listen to him . There may be some inaccuracies here because I heard the story quite a few years ago but I'll start anyway. 

In the year 1999 when  Robert was working odd jobs to make his ends meet his aunt offered him a job. His aunt's husband owned a chain of motels along the straten hills. Robert himself had been in the motels quite a few times. His job was to the northernmost motel near the town of smithsville to work as a receptionist.  The area seemingly isolated was actually well connected with the rest of the city . The town of Smithsville was just 10 minutes away and its residents were known to be kind and helpful.  So upon hearing this offer robert could not refuse it. The next morning he had packed up his suitcase and was ready to leave the city for the hills. He drove through the winding roads of the hills. As he peeked out of his window he could see the city far away. The pine trees that ran along the roads were tall and imposing making Robert feel much smaller in comparison. Though as he went on the roads started to become more difficult to drive on and the trees started to look more threatening then welcoming. It made sense as he was moving farther away from the city. 

Robert had started to become drowsy. It still had been early morning after all. So he stopped to car to get some rest. Unbeknownst to robert time had flown by when he was woken up by some odd noise he couldn't understand. He had slept for two hours in his car. It was already 10 pm and there was still a good two hours to reach the motel. Wasting no time he started the car. He stopped focusing on the scenery and started driving recklessly to reach his desired location. He was soon faced by the town of smithsville.  The place radiated a sort of mirth . He crossed several tea shops and inns but he did not stop. As soon as he had crossed the town there was a sudden drop in the temperature.  The roads were more winding than usual and it gave off a feeling of lonliness. Robert felt it too . 

He drove for at least 7 minutes before he was faced by the said motel. It was so unlike other motels his uncle owned. The motel rightfully named nocturn stood tall in a lonely road. It was large and coloured dully.  Even though it was noon and the sun was shining brightly the thick foliage that surrounded the house barely let the natural light in giving the motel an air of mysteriousness or perhaps suspense. The motel was built like a cabin in the woods but much larger ofcourse. As he stepped out of the car ,he was greeted by a boy ,not more than the age of 17. He had held a bored look . He looked straight into Robert's eyes although the word glare would be more appropriate and asked him if he was the new receptionist. As he entered the house it seemed strange and stranger. The ceiling was too low and the walls are too wide and far apart making it look both too large and too small in size. His desk was made of mahogany though it looked damp. Actually the whole motel looked damp but that was probably because of the foliage. The boy had warned him that the motel was hard to maintain and had at least 7 rooms though he had never actually counted. He also said that the other staff in the kitchen would arrive the next morning as their work was done . Robert was also given a staff room though he supposed he could just stay the night in the guest rooms seeing as to they were all empty. As the boy swiftly went out of the door ,robert found himself alone in the motel. 

He started to examine all the rooms . There was in fact 8 rooms . All incredibly similar in design and size. All except one which was the 8th and the farthest room from the lobby. It was a suite. It was beautiful and honestly pretty luxurious compared to the other rooms. He also had checked out the staff room. It was a far cry from the guest rooms. In fact it was barely decent enough to be called a room. Since he was alone in the motel he had decided to stay the night in the guest rooms. Specifically room no.8. It was large and robert need rest after a long drive. So he opened the key cupboard and took out the key replacing it with his own staff room key. He spent the day fooling around listening to music and watching television. As it began to become darker and darker the roads became more obscure. Far away he could see the well lit houses of Smithsville but that was the only light he could make out. Robert was happy and unafraid. He had ventured into the kitchen eat the cooked food assuming that no one was arriving to stay that night. 

Thinking about it , it made sense to robert that the branch of motel did not do well in terms of bussiness. The only way to arrive in the motel was a drive through the hills which were already lined by other motels . And it was not like anyone needed to pass through the motel to reach anywhere. In fact just a few miles after the motel the roads ended and the woods began . So it was quite illogical to have a motel situated in that particular area."

Come [join us](https://forms.gle/3N3CfqbH6YkM1DF67) at **Summer of Shipping**, a program started by an Uber alum for tech students that had their internships cancelled due to the pandemic (myself being one of them), and are looking to build personal coding projects to boost their portfolio. Ever since our [humble beginnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g9u0v4/are_you_working_on_a_summer_project_in_light_of_a/) at CSCQ, we've been hard at work and are gearing up for our **#30DaysOfShipping** challenge in June!

We meet 5 PM PST on Thursdays over Zoom for presentations and demos. We just wrapped up **Week 4** (recording [here](https://youtu.be/KUqMFW4QyNM)), where students and mentors demoed their projects ranging from path-finding algorithm visualizers to project management apps and auto-populating Spotify playlists with AWS magic. We have also committed resources to work on accommodating those in Europe/Africa/Asia by setting up a Friday meeting time!

A few of the things we offer:

* **Idea Pitching** \- Have an idea? We'll give you a platform to pitch to others and find collaborators!
* **Group Matching** \- A lot of people don't have an idea, but want to work in a group, so we do some manual matching based off a survey
* **Mentor Access** \- Still a work in progress, but our wonderful mentors have already helped quite a few projects (either by leading a project, providing technical guidance, or becoming a project advisor)

The goal is to help our participants ship great coding projects that will improve their resume and make them competitive as they look for jobs. However, we also want to ensure our students and mentors *stay* connected professionally for the long haul. To that end, we are establishing our LinkedIn presence. We want this program to become a great place to make connections in the industry.

If you're working on something, don't sail alone! [Join us](https://forms.gle/3N3CfqbH6YkM1DF67) if you're looking for a community to build great projects with! We're open to everyone of varying skills and proficiencies. Level up and let's make something together!

Wanted to get your opinion on my situation, and to hear what you would do if you were in my position.

Brief description: 

I am currently a Software Developer Consultant that graduated from University of Cambridge last year (2019 - STEM subject) at a company in the UK (&lt;1year of experience), and I have completed a three month internship prior to that in research (worked in Python/C++) and also received a data science scholarship couple years back. 

What I would like to do: 

I have been in love with Switzerland, especially Zurich, for quite a while. and have been looking to move there, however I am not sure exactly how does the job market look for someone with my level of experience there at the minute during the pandemic. Long story short, during university, I was not sure whether I would prefer more client facing/engineering role, so I have ended up taking a grad scheme that allowed me to get experience of various positions. After nearly a year in industry, I am certain I prefer to do software engineering/development. I think this is the perfect opportunity to take the leap, and move to Switzerland.

Relevant: 

A holder of EU passport of one of the continental countries.

Questions:

How does the graduate software engineer market look like right now in Zurich?

If you were me, would you rather wait for the pandemic to calm down? 

Do you know anyone in Zurich that are looking for grad/junior devs?"

I had plans for summer internships but they all went belly up and it’s making me a bit anxious. Having another summer at home is really the last thing I ever wanted and now it’s happening.

I didn’t listen, because I was very interested in mental health advocacy and trying to help others feel like they weren’t alone. I realized too late that maybe I wouldn’t be the best at being a therapist (because I don’t know that I want a career that’s so client-facing, since I’m an introvert, but still considering it), and I don’t even have a license to be a therapist, anyway. I just graduated with my BS in Psychology in December of 2019. In that time, I’ve also tried computer science stuff, since my bf and some of his family are in it and it almost promises you a stable income, but it was hard for me to stick to. Outside of my degree, the only job experience I have is being an admin assistant for a college, and having been an online chat representative at a call center. So, I’m afraid that inhibits me from being much more.

I’ve considered getting a masters in IO psychology, too, so I might have more options in what I can do. Ideally, I’d want something where I’d have as little interaction as possible, aside from maybe some meetings or one-on-one talks. I’d want a laid back atmosphere and not having people come to me for everything like they would an admin assistant. I don’t mind having to work with people sometimes, but my social anxiety makes it tiring to do it so much of the time. I’ve considered marketing, journalism, etc. I just don’t know what to stick with at all, or what would make me feel most fulfilled. I’m tired of just looking at unpaid internships, but I’m afraid that, without them, me not having experience won’t land me a worthwhile job. It feels like a lot of pressure. If anyone has any advice, feel free to let me know. I’m just afraid I can’t do much."
gtpcv1,3,2020-05-30,I’m tired of it all,Thrroooowawayfml,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/gtpcv1/im_tired_of_it_all/,"
I don’t care who sees this or doesn’t. I don’t care. All my life all I ever wanted was validation from my parents. I understand they work hard and don’t have time for me. But I wish so much for them just to take the time off and spend it with me and give me some appreciation and acceptance for who I’m becoming and what I’ve been through and what I’m trying to do for myself and family. I don’t know if it’s because my family is dysfunctional, or I’m first gen, or something about me but it’s so hard doing the right thing and never been acknowledged and accepted. I grew up idolizing my dad, then he left us and of course a 5 year old is gonna feel the pain of not seeing his dad anymore. Then he came back and promised everything would be okay and we became a family again. We moved states we left my moms family behind and reconnected with my dads side. Moved to the current city I live in which has drained everything out of me. Every ounce of blood sweat tear will everything. Since I came here I’ve been raped, beaten, witness to crime gun gang violence, rampant drug abuse, misogyny, racism, homophobia all of it. I’ve felt so alone, I get it my parents being immigrants not having the time for me and my sisters but damn has it hurt when they did they would invite my sisters over me and leave me behind. Man did it hurt that I didn’t want to go to the parties they went to because I had to see my rapist. Man it hurt that all I got was teased on for being overweight, it hurt that the family I was introduced to was indifferent to me and just left me to the side like a wet noodle. It hurt that for so long that trying to even talk to my parents wasn’t possible because they weren’t even emotionally available. My dad left my life and came back to just beat my mom and us while they both fell into substances. How was a 8 year old boy, supposed to tell his mom that his cousin raped him when all she did was drink with my tias. How was I supposed to tell my dad I wasn’t comfortable around all these kids getting involved with gangs when he rarely came home. That’s the way it is with trucking but when he came home it would be straight to a party. God so much shit, who the fuck watches porn in 2nd grade, who the fuck tries grabbing each other’s dicks in the bathroom in third grade, why the fuck was there so much pressure to fuck my girlfriend at 12 years old. Only to get bullied and ostracized after. I barely had any friends middle school, it was so hard getting my mind on the right track. I found a role model in green arrows optimism and Batman’s never ending loyalty and perseverance. Everyone I could look up to led me astray and hurt me, I was supposed to be proud of being Mexican when all I felt was hurt. Hurt when I found needles in my dads drawer, hurt when they threw me down the stairs, hurt when my mom held a knife to my dads throat and then turned it on me threatening to kill me for protecting him. God I been through so much bull shit and hurt. When they divorced they couldn’t settle whose responsibility, I was supposed to be so I just jumped from house to house every week they were telling me they were tired of my shit tired of me going to Xbox and staying up and laughing all night. Tired of my way of coping that they took it away, and disowned me every other week. I always had a roof over my head and they never let me forget because that’s the only thing they ever provided me with, I felt bad and blamed myself for feeling like shit because I wasn’t comforted by their homes.  I felt like a failure for not being accepted by either of them. High school I changed completely I was tired of my introvertive nature, I wanted to be better for myself and my parents. I wanted to be someone they could respect and accept and own up to. I went to a military academy and hoped to change to be better. I was waking up at 6:00 am to take the bus one hour away just to go to school. I stayed everyday after school to pass my AP classes. I wanted to be better but it never mattered.  Even after I got the 5 and my teacher gave me 50 bucks for it. My mom didn’t care, she never gave me a word of appreciation, never apologized for the unnecessary trauma she put me through. I guess she absolved herself of everything because I wanted to be better for myself and I was changing. She took credit for it and still does everyday of my life. I’m 17 years old and have had 3 internships so far, I have a full ride to college and on a waiting list for one of the military academies. “I put a roof over your head and soy tu mama” you should be grateful. Everyday of my life I felt alone, I finally broke and let loose all of my emotion to her. I told her that I had to pull myself forward as a new kid in a whole new state with no support of my family other than a roof over my head and a bed to sleep on. I was tired of feeling alone and depressed and wanted an apology at least for neglecting my older sister and I in our childhood. She said what for everyone has a hard life you’re not the only one who lived a hard life. Tough shit, I understand I’m not the only person to have it hard, I know there’s kids starving in Africa and citizens getting assassinated over expressing freedom of speech in China, but I just feel helpless and alone. I’ve done so much shit as well I’m no angel. But I’ve repented and apologized and try to be a better person because of it. Through it all I just want my parents to accept me, but to them all I am is a loser on a Xbox who doesn’t do a god damn thing. I’m just a nobody a filth, and my opinion doesn’t matter because I’m only their son. So yes I am in the wrong for telling them they’re hipócritas porque en la misma edad que tengo yo no hicieron nada. In my place they were pregnant with my sister living pay check to pay check. They followed a path of drugs and abuse and treated us like shit and I did throw it in their faces because I’m tired of it all I’m tired of them giving me so much shit. Though these two warfronts I fight with my parents one on the phone with my dad who I see once a year the other my mom I live with I feel like the only one who ever apologizes for the hurtful things I say because I am sorry and I want a relationship. But no matter how much I pour my heart out to them support them and take their shit I get nothing in return other then I should be grateful for the roof over my head. I’m tired of it I’m tired of it I’m tired, I think I have a life ahead of me that I can make to as long as I reach college and get through this summer, but with my birthday coming a few days I think I’m fucked and I’m stressed just thinking about the big 18. Fuck I know my life isn’t the worst in the world but god damn does my head feel like it’s ripping apart and my every action without meaning and empty. Thanks reddit for letting me vent my frustration, hopefully we make it through this mess and come out the other end of 2020 cause this grind, crippling loneliness, depression, and lost sense of achievement is so fucking bad my guy  I don’t even know if this is the right place to post but oh well"

2. Are poly students most of the time( i wouldnt use the word always) ahead of jc students since they have foundation and learn faster?

3. This is for seniors in tech related courses(cs, info sys, CE, info sec etc)
Your poly friends come in with extensive portfolio, done internships, connections etc, as a jc student how did you catch up with them? Or what did u see your jc friend do to catch up? 

4. What do you wish you have done before uni (for both jc and poly seniors)
Ive seen seniors some saying relax hard before uni while some saying build foundation mostly without elaborations so i would like to hear what u guys feel in detail

gtrub4,67,2020-05-30,Career switch from Architecture/Engineering to CS with self studying and a master. Reply to my 3 years old questions.,k1rd,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gtrub4/career_switch_from_architectureengineering_to_cs/,"I write this post because some friends recommended that I share my story.

I decided to switch my career to cs in february 2017, i was 27. It is now may 2020 and I have a full time Software engineering job and I am 31. 

This post is a reply to my past self: I asked in this subreddit for recommendations 3 years ago and I didn’t get much traction as you can see: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5zsnpu/international_switching_to_csse_master_in_us/

Prelude:

I come from a small town in Europe, from a country where tech was not really a viable path. Always loved computers, video games, math, physics… Between the various options for college I had engineering, architecture and cs. I went for civil engineering + architecture double major, bachelor and master in a single program. I graduated in 2015, it took forever, I didn't really like it. Few people know what they like when they are 18. Motivated by many school friends I decided In 2013 to study abroad in the US. That experience opened my future to the world. I always thought that I would have lived in my small town forever. This was not the case anymore. In the following years I went to work in the architectural field in the US and China.

A new hope:

After a few years jumping between many companies and continents I realized I was really not passionate about the field. It was too slow, to subjective, too archaic. I was good at it, I became an expert of the various design software, but couldn't care less.
At the end of 2016 One day a friend called me, there was big news! he was going to learn how to make an app by following a you tube video course that would “teach you android”... he used to be my roommate in college, not a techy guy at all. I got a strong pride rush: “if he can even think it is possible to pick up such an endeavor why am I not thinking the same?” I have always been the one interested in programming. I didn't follow that android path but i jumped on python. Early 2017 I did some codecademy, coursera introduction to cs with python then many many others. Dropped my job and self learned  for a few months. Of course my friend dropped his plans after a week :D but the door was already kicked open for me! I realized that my dream to give up everything and pursue cs could not be that bad, I was not chasing an impossible dream, it is a quite reachable one!

Swim or drown:

Thanks to my cousin I casually discovered a free programming school. Called ecole 42, based on project based peer learning. It is founded by a french billionaire that loves technology. They have campuses all over the world, but the two major campuses are in the Bay and in Paris. The schools teach almost uniquely C. I started in summer 2017, It was tough, a lot of programming, but there I realized I was motivated as much if not more than my peers, surely enough to learn programming and that I actually liked the GRIND.

The Grind:

Went to that school for a year. In Paris. Started late 2017. Coded a lot of C that year. Started applying for masters in the US. you might ask: Why? There have been 2 major reasons: First I needed to have a formal education in CS, I could program well but I was not understanding what was going on underneath my code: stuff like complexity, threads, OS, networks, algorithms. Second reason is that the US pays at least double than any other place, simple as that. Had my first internship in summer of 2018 in a small startup in Paris doing JavaScript. It was not great, I was happy to leave it in September to start my masters in the US. Loved receiving a formal education there, great professors and even better friends from the program. I have to thank my roommates at the time because they were always there to support me with school and everything else. Went for an internship in a local mid sized fintech company in summer of 2019. It was good but not great.

The Finale:

In summer fall 2019 I started applying for jobs, grinding leetcode, reviewing algorithms… applied to around 100 jobs. Went to the final round with Google in Mountainview, Aws in Seattle, some HFT and other companies. I could not believe it! In the end I accepted an offer from an HFT.

Post Scriptum:

I was lucky, I had support from my family (moral end economical) exceptional support from my girlfriend at the time (we broke up halfway) and from all my friends (old and new). I made many decisions in my life with no idea where they would lead. This is what everyone has to do. I like to think that this story is a collection of small events and people that all ended up aligning. like dots that you can connect only looking backward. 
So if i could go back to talk to my previous self and reply to those questions i would say it is a good plan, you will get out of it what you put into it. If you like the grind of learning programming you might go far and ""Just trust in the right process and everything will fall into place"".

Hoping this post can be of help. Thanks for reading

TLDR: loved computer all my life, graduated in Architecture/Engineering at 25, at 27 decided to switch to cs. After self learning, programming school, 1 year of  master and 2 internships I reached 30 and got a full time job at a HFT firm in the US."
gtt2ko,5,2020-05-31,Told that I'll need a CompTIA Security+ Cert for my internship,Gunnerblaster,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/gtt2ko/told_that_ill_need_a_comptia_security_cert_for_my/,"\*tl;dr at bottom\*

I'm in community college and working on finishing up a 2-year Associates of Science degree in Information Systems: Cybersecurity. Part of the degree has us create resumes and such, and they're looked over by prospective companies. Well, a particularly well-known military contractor has shown an interesting in hiring me on, as a full-time paid intern but the catch is that I need a CompTIA Security+ certificate. Up until I was told that I'd need it, I'd only heard of the CompTIA Sec+ in passing, but never in detail.

Now I'm reading through the threads on here - And seeing guys who sound like they have a lot of hand's on experience, say that the certification exam was extremely difficult. I feel like I'm out of my depth here, even though I'm coming up on the end of my 2-year degree.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a complete newbie on how to start studying for this thing? I have roughly 60/90 days to get it and, if I don't have it by then, the contractor said they'd have to pass me over for someone else - And this is a really big deal, for me. I feel like it's that once in a lifetime kind of thing.  


tl;dr - As a complete newbie, how do I even go about preparing for the CompTIA Sec+?"

Need Advice.,sprayandpay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/gtukt7/about_to_graduate_but_do_not_have_a_direction_yet/,"Hey, I am about to graduate with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. I have previously done an internship related to Web Development which was interesting. I usually spend time occasionally solving LeetCode problems. I'm currently also trying my hand at various small projects just to help me learn and also for my personal use. I see everyone around me getting into the fields of Machine Learning other fields. I feel my knowledge and skills are very inadequate compared to them and I do not have any career path yet nor do I have a direction.   
1. What would you suggest me to do about this feeling of inadequacy?  
2. Is there any particular field you suggest would be upcoming and good for me to get into?   
3. If I want to learn new skills, what seems like the best way? Doing projects? Certifications?"
gtuxir,1,2020-05-31,"Under $1000 USD (will consider up to $1500 max) Laptop for Solidworks, Gaming, Video Editing.",ZiyaBeast,SuggestALaptop,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuggestALaptop/comments/gtuxir/under_1000_usd_will_consider_up_to_1500_max/,"**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

 

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**

 

 $1000 USD without tax. I will be purchasing in the United States. I'm pretty sure what I want is within this range. If not I will consider going $1500. Anything above that will not work.

 

* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**

 

 No

 

* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**

 

 I plan to carry my laptop charger with me at all times so battery life is not too important. Performance is the most important aspect. Build quality should be average at least. I already have an iPad air 2 so a 2-in-1 would be redundant but will consider if performance is better without sacrificing capabilities.

 

* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**

 

 I will be carrying this in my backpack to and from school everyday (I go to university). I'm 6 ft 190 lbs so I can carry some weight, but I don't want it to be overwhelming. 10 lbs is acceptable as I do have a lot of other stuff I need to carry.

 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**

 

 It has to fit in my backpack. Currently I have a 15.25"" by 11"" laptop which just barely fits in my backpack. Screen size= 15.5"" so anything equal to or below that will be perfect.

 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**

 

 All of those yes. I will be running SolidWorks and potentially AutoCAD for engineering classes and internships so I want it to be pretty fast. Plan to run DaVinci Resolve 16 aswell for some YouTube projects. Thinking about Photoshop in the future too. I will be using this for gaming aswell. 

 

* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**

 

 I want to be able to stream on Twitch and upload videos of Tekken 7 and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. I really only play fighting games so smooth 60 fps is key so I can land my moves at the intended time. I don't care for amazing graphics that much. I'm content playing at 720p if my game runs butter smooth. In the future i'd even be ok with 480p if the next generation of gaming is that hard on my laptop

 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**

 

 Na nothing fancy. I'm gonna use a random mouse. Keyboard just needs to not break hahaha. Ethernet port is required. CD drive is preferred but not required if better performance is achieved. 

 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

 

 Like I said I'm willing to spend more than $1000 but would rather not. I want this computer to last me awhile to keep up with new fighting games and be able to stream them. I use Solidworks at my job a lot and the PCs they have are old so I want my laptop to be really fast so I don't waste time at work. Thank you guys in advance for finding one for me."
gtv2c9,442,2020-05-31,I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,ibsurvivors,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gtv2c9/i_got_the_chance_to_interview_a_data_scientist_at/,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do &amp; where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I’m working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber’s ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It’s actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there’s a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that’s why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there’s no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That’s when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What’s really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it’s at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there’s a lot of hard &amp; interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that’s how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber’s business?**

I’m on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing &amp; analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber’s business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It’s also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here’s another example:

So, there’s an optimization &amp; efficiency side of Shared Rides - there’s always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that’s this underlying technical tension that’s always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it’s a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there’s more bureaucracy, there’s more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can’t imagine doing that currently (given I’ve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you’re working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I’m also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I’m on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We’re working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I’m surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There’s some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it’s also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that’s much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you’re working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn’t even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there’s many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there’s broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I’m more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you’re actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there’s going to be work that’s a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don’t look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you’re not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn’t study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

I'm planning on interviewing more data scientists across a wide range of companies - let me know if you have any specific questions you'd like me to ask them :)"

gty253,2,2020-05-31,"Need advice: friend isolating himself, possibly spiraling",SidewaysMeta,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gty253/need_advice_friend_isolating_himself_possibly/,"Hi! I have a close friend (36M) with ADHD, bipolar disorder and recurring depressions / general anxiety. We have been close for maybe 10 years or so. 

My friend has often has difficulties keeping appointments since he gets anxious and cancels, and the last few years we decided to set up a recurring weekly time when we would meet no matter what. We managed to hold to it fairly well, maybe meeting every other week or so.

Just before Christmas, I got a dog, which made things increasingly difficult since his own dog does not handle other dogs well. We started seeing less of each other, though still meeting occasionally and keeping in touch. 

We touched bases fairly early into the pandemic, and he said things were fine since the lockdown hadn't changed his routine much. A week ago though, his partner reached out to me saying they (the partner) were worried about him. Apparently my friend is running out of money (he has been unemployed a couple of years now due to depression), his parents cannot support him anymore, and he cannot deal with applying for social support. I told his partner I would reach out to him.

What worries me now is that I haven't been able to reach him. I've tried to message him twice (which I can see he has read) suggesting that we go for a walk, and have called him without getting a reply. 

My guess is that he is too anxious and ashamed about his situation to talk to me. He doesn't have trouble expressing feelings, but I know he worries he'll burn bridges by asking things of people (such as loans or jobs) and then not coming through on his end. Last year I gave him an informal internship at my company (show up as much as you can handle) which he barely showed up for at all. Totally OK with me, but I suspect he is ashamed about it, and about potentially having to ask more of me.

How can I help him? What kind of support should I give and how should I present it? I'm well off, could easily help him financially for a few months at the very least, but more importantly I want him to talk to me and let me be there for him while he is down. I'm honestly worrying that this might spiral if nobody intervenes - I don't think he is suicidal (yet) but I've also understood that his type or bipolar may be the type that could put him in progressively worse depression. He certainly hasn't been getting better over the years.

Some medical context: I think he is on meds for all of the above, but I don't think he is getting therapy at the moment. I think he has been in therapy before, but likely got too anxious to keep going / kept cancelling his appointments.

Thankful for any suggestions!

tl;dr: unemployed close friend with bipolar/depression/ADHD, his partner worries that he can't pay his bills, I've tried reaching out but he doesn't reply. Want to help him any way I can, just don't know how to reach through and what support he really needs.


Update: He just got back to me saying that social interactions are scary at the moment, but asking if I still want to be his friend. I replied saying yes, that I've spoken to his partner and that I'm here if he needs anything - just talking or concrete support. He seemed happy about it, so it feels like a step in the right direction!"

I was planning on taking an internship as a backend developer, but after thinking a lot I have decided to do this.

Last year, I did an internship at Microsoft in Redmond WA and I was thrilled when my team wanted me to come back full-time after my graduation. I’m supposed to start beginning of July and my original plan was to relocate to Seattle one week prior to my start date - but with everything going on in the US right now, I am not sure if it would wise to move right now.

1) Relocate to anywhere in the US to start the on boarding process with Microsoft US virtually. It doesn't even have to be Seattle.   
2) They are okay with me working remotely from Canada. The only downside is that my total compensation will be reduced by 75% to adjust for the Canadian market.

I think both fields are interesting and in my technical school we get a ""Computer Systems Technician"" qualification (I think that's how it translates) and the program was more oriented towards the IT side of things (operating systems, servers, networks, computer repair, diagnostics etc.), but also had some programming classes where we learned some of the basics and made some very simple projects with HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, Pascal. I kind of enjoyed the classes and making simple projects but I have no idea how I would do if I had to work on larger scale, more meaningful projects. 

Judging from what I've read online, people seem to say that a CS degree is more universal and you can work in any of the IT fields with one while getting an IT degree it is way harder to switch to dev jobs.

So should I got with the CS degree and if I regret it, how likely is it to switch back more to the IT side of things? If I go for a CS degree maybe I could learn about IT tools on my own and make a homelab where I can practice IT tools. 

I don't really know, kind of scared of having to make this decision and I worry what if I regret picking one instead of the other since I'm unsure what I want to specialize in, I would really appreciate some advice on how to plan out my career, thanks in advance."

To make this post kind of short I'll give you guys a little bit of my background. I am a 29-year-old junior in Computer Engineering. When I turned 27 I was able to finally enroll at a Community College. I didn't go to school right after high school because I had fallen into a mild depression but I think not going to school kind of made it worst in some ways. Anyway, I started working in the restaurant industry and figured I was really good at it, working in fine dining, and being young making a good amount of money there was no reason for me to go to school (or so I thought). However, after a few years, I was just jaded, I wanted to branch out, I was tired of missing out on all of my family events and it was also taking a toll on my girlfriend (now wife) working all those long hours, to make matters worst the company I have been working for they're open 365 days a year and the holidays are the busiest times so there was no way for me to have those days off. I finally decided it was time for me to branch out and explore new career options.

When I first started it had been like 8 years since I had been in school so I decided to start with Intermediate math class. I figured out I was actually pretty good at math and I've always loved computers so I decided to get a degree in Computer Engineering. When I was in high school I was not good at all in school because I lacked motivation and frankly didn't care at all. However, as an older student, I seemed to be pretty good at this. Anyway, I finished community college with a 3.8 and most of my math classes done, Calc 1,2,3 Diff EQ, Physics, and all the other classes required to get an A.A. This is my second semester at a state university and everything seems to be going fine I absolutely love studying, learning and going through the process of getting this degree. I have a 3.7 and this summer I'm taking Electrical systems I and Java I. However I feel as if I have no skills to start looking for an internship at all and that worries me a lot. I am still working as a fine dining server because thankfully the hours are extremely flexible, and I make enough money to be able to have paid for most of the tuition myself, so far I have only taken out 2k in loans. What worries me the most is this is the first programming class I have taken in school and I'm only around 50 credits till graduation (The majority of the classes left are all specialization). I feel as if I lack any skills to look for an internship, I have no relevant experience when it comes to engineering what am I supposed to do at this point? just wait it out till I graduate and then look for a job? I honestly can't wait to start working in my field. Has anyone experienced a similar situation?"

I don't really have a full profile for evaluation, but I'm currently an undergraduate at UT Austin majoring in mathematics with two minors in computer science and statistics. I have one more semester left (Fall 2020) and I am thinking deeply about going to graduate school in the field of science/engineering. Current I am sitting at a GPA of 3.17 overall, with a technical GPA around 3.0 (really low, I know) but I can still potential bring it up to a 3.2-3.3 next semester.

As for projects/experience, I only have experience working in fast food and two projects (no internships) - one from a data science course and engineering course. I took the community college -&gt; university route and have been struggling to adjust to the academics/life of university, and right now I am hoping to get a research project in my last semester at UT Austin and work on my skills more so that I can work a bit (hopefully) in industry before or after graduation.

I wanted to know what specific programs I could apply for in Texas/USA. A list of programs I'm considering on applying for are (specifically in Engineering/Statistics/Applied Math/Computer Science):

Texas A&amp;M 

Texas Tech

Baylor

Rice

UT Dallas

North Texas

Colorado School of Mines

Oklahoma

Arkansas

CU Boulder

Purdue

Georgia Tech
