He's an International Student (from a developing country) in the USA and will be graduating with about 1 year worth of internship experience in one of these companies (EA, SAP, Oracle, and IBM) in the US.

He would like to avoid US H1B visa mess and try to get a job in EU for personal reason. I heard Germany (Berlin) is pretty easy. Is it doable for him with such background without having to do masters ?"
dpwnzp,52,2019-10-31,Importance of Enthusiasm In an Employer,cjflex,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dpwnzp/importance_of_enthusiasm_in_an_employer/,"I'll preface with a background:
This summer I did an internship with Microsoft and got a fulltime return offer. I also have a fulltime decision coming from Google on the same day as my Microsoft deadline (not guaranteed to be positive of course).
I have gotten what I'd judge as some pretty positive signs from Microsoft (I dont mean this in a bragging way). In particular, my ex-manager and my recruiter have been super helpful and responsive, reaching out often and checking if I have questions. Furthermore, I made a negotiation bid, which they fulfilled and surpassed by about 30k.
Then I contrast to Google, which doesn't seem as eager to have me. They're getting me my offer on the literal last day I have to make a MSFT decision and my Google recruiter just doesn't send the same friendly vibes as my MSFT one (I know this might sound kind of petty). 

THE QUESTION:
I'm wondering if I should take these different levels of apparent eagerness into consideration for my decision.
I'm particular, I'm thinking that if Microsoft is doing so much to bring me back in, they'll be more willing to invest in me and my professional growth (especially since I already somewhat have a professional network and ""mentors"" from my internship). Plus I know my manager will vouch for me to get the team I want. Whereas with Google, I just don't feel like I have that same internal voice.
But on the other hand, I know generally Google is considered more prestigious than Microsoft and might do more for my career in that sense.
How would y'all approach the situation?

My situation might be biased because I interned at Microsoft and so they obviously have more invested in me (plus past performance to work off of). 

But I've been in my head so much and I'm hoping some outside advice will help. Thank you!

p.s. this is my first post here so lmk if I did anything wrong/should add more info

Edit 1:
I started a preemptive negotiation process with Google (I've been Hiring Committee approved) and now looks like they're gonna try to match Microsoft. It's still a little confusing bc I haven't gotten the explicit offer though.

Edit 2:
Officially got offer letter! Competitive with Microsoft but still slightly less. I don't really mind the difference though"

dpzzcx,1,2019-11-01,"Landlord/Tenant Dispute - Retaliation, Verbal Agreements, etc. [Oregon]",Xen0plasm,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dpzzcx/landlordtenant_dispute_retaliation_verbal/,"I am a university student living in a college town in Oregon. I spent my summer on an international internship, and a plan to move in with a friend after returning failed. I had contacted another person before leaving, but they never returned a call to set up a visit to the house. I managed to contact this person from abroad, and signed the lease from there via adobe signable forms.

So I returned at the beginning of September, moved in, and everything seemed okay at first. The living situation is three students renting bedrooms in a house, but one of them is technically the landlord's agent as well. I will refer to him as ""**J**"". J is in a serious relationship with the landlord's daughter, who I will call ""**K**"". I will call the actual landlord ""**R""**. J began to show an erratic behavior pattern;  he consistently took the most extreme interpretation of anything I said.  I'm a very patient person, and he told me he had some mental health issues, but I didn't know how bad this would get.

At the end of the month, I had an unexpected money problem come up. I explained the money problem to him, and even though I had a way to fix it (i.e., pay rent), he told me that he'd allow me to pay a part of the rent that day and then pay the rest in a few days, when I got a paycheck. The money trouble made J nervous; my lease started with a three-month term, since J had done all of this with me sight-unseen from very far away.

The weekend after I was unable to pay rent, he told me he was willing to sign me on for another month; J said he would sign me on for a normal lease after that, but only if I was able to resolve my money troubles.  I was thankful for this reprieve, and waited for the check to process at my bank that weekend. We had agreed that I'd give him the remainder of what I owed as soon as the check processed, but J became antsy on Monday, and kept asking me if the check had come through.

J also ""doesn't believe in having a bank account"", which was my first clue that I'd made a mistake. Knowing this already, I began to explain to him how online banking works, but he kept escalating the conversation, and even though I did my best to get him to calm down, he ultimately shut down the conversation and slammed his bedroom door in my face. Half an hour later, he sent me **a text that amounted to a refusal to renew my lease beyond November**. He told me that I was being dishonest with him and I wasn't working hard enough to get the money to him.

Moving out in mid to late November would be extremely difficult to do here, because my classes are going be picking up steam by then, and it is more difficult to find places to live during this time in this city. His refusal is a violation of our earlier agreement, which unfortunately was verbal. This guy seemed mostly alright until he snapped that night, so I didn't worry about getting anything in writing. The only proof I have of those exchanges is a receipt from our agreement about the rent, and the newer lease (for the month of November).

All attempts to reason with him have failed (and continue to fail). I also talked to the other roommate about it when I ran into him on campus; he suggested asking K about it. I approached K as she was leaving one night, and told her about what happened; she told me that she didn't want to get involved, and after asking me a few questions, she left. 

J was upset about this; he accused me of harassing her. I told him that the other roommate suggested it, and confronted him about his irrational behavior. I told him that if he didn't relent and return to the original agreement, I may have to explore legal action for the sake of defending myself.

Next, I tried talking to the actual landlord, R. R seemed like a very reasonable person, claiming to understand how J's behavior was difficult to tolerate at times. I explained that it would be very challenging for me to move out according to J's demands, but if I could stay there until July, it would be easier since school would be over. He was receptive to this, and I hoped that he'd override J's decision. J had also never contacted my previous landlord, so I gave R the contact info.

Unfortunately, J told exaggerated versions of my mention of legal action and my conversation with the other roommate to R. Additionally, the landlord contact info I gave to R was for my landlord from 2017-2018, not 2018-2019; this was done on purpose, because my 2018-2019 landlord tried to break the law twice while I lived there, and I had to take legal action against them to make it stop. I explained this to J when I was talking to him on the phone from Borneo, and he agreed to accept the contact info from that landlord instead. I also emailed the 2017-2018 landlord before giving the contact info, and explained everything to him (the 2017-2018 landlord). He agreed to give me a reference.

J explained ***NONE OF THIS*** to R, at any point. The result is that R called the 2017-2018 landlord, found out that it's not my most recent landlord, and because he didn't have the information that I told J, it looked like I was being dishonest. That plus J's version of my interactions with him and the other roommate caused R to decide to allow me to move out early, but not extend the lease.

This is proving to be quite a problem; I'm taking some really challenging courses right now, and going through the motions of moving again could be a disaster for my grades. I've done it anyway, but I haven't found much; this is a college town with housing shortages due to the sheer number of students. I want to try talking to R one more time about this, but it's likely that he won't listen; he's in his early seventies, and it really seems as though he is more interested in not rocking the boat.

Does anyone in r/legaladvice have any ideas? J sent me the text message that started all of this immediately after I accused him of being unreasonable, and that seems retaliatory to me, but the last time I checked on that definition, I read that it was notoriously difficult to handle that in court.

But, I'm trapped here, these people are barely following the rules for a tenancy (there are details I've left out), and I need help. I would be much better off if I could just stay here until things are calmer and it's easier to find a new place."

I'm in the final stages of an interview with a company in London, UK. It would be a winter internship, and then I may be able to do a consecutive summer internship somewhere else, like in the states.

I'd like to see what life is like in London, and I feel like the experience would make me grow as a person. But at the same time I feel like I'd be incredibly stupid to throw away the full-time offer.

Unfortunately the deadline for the full-time offer is very soon so in the worst case I would lose both offers.

Does anyone have any advice on what I should do, or some things to consider before I make a decision? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys."

I feel as if all my inspiration and energy have been sucked out of me.

I have a paid offer to do my thesis at a research institute in my city, but I am inclined to decline the offer due to lack of interest and mental exhaustion. I am also more interested in NLP, which is unavailable at my university. Since I live in a small city, there are not many opportunities for a paid thesis and I am afraid that I would be making a mistake turning down the offer.

I currently work heavily in Infrastructure support, event management, and server administration. While I enjoy certain aspects of this work, there are times where I can find it very ticket based and repetitive. I have limited experience (coursework and hackathons) in several languages such as Java, Python, React, vanilla JavaScript, and knowledge of HTML/CSS. 

I've been presented with the opportunity to take a job as a Java developer while finishing my degree. I enjoy my experiences so far and am fairly competent when it comes to coding. I've also considered the possibility of trying to get on at consulting companies such as Slalom or others after several years of experience.

I could see myself being content in either job role (provided I get out of repetitive ticketed work in infrastructure Ops). I do fully intend to move upwards into management roles as my career allows. 

Can anyone offer insight into which path they would recommend? The salary differences aren't of a huge concern, however I know that salary range and pay bumps with experience can vary based on the path as well.

I was just informed that I got an interview for an entry level hardware EE/ITE engineering position. I‚Äôve heard that the interviewers like to ask a lot of technical questions (as expected), but I really want to get a better feel for what those questions could pertain to. I know it‚Äôs a very broad topic, that I‚Äôm sure varies from company to company, but any thoughts or advice would be hugely appreciated.

Here‚Äôs some info about myself:
I‚Äôm currently in my senior year of college (will be graduating in May2020) majoring in EET. That being said, I probably won‚Äôt know as much theory as a straight up EE, but I‚Äôm fairly confident I still have a fighting chance to show that I would be a valued EE or ITE engineer. 

I‚Äôve worked as an operations intern for the company I‚Äôm interviewing at for just over six months. I feel that this has allowed me to learn a lot about the functions of the company, as well as helped me learn many skills I lacked coming in (such as various software the company uses, how things are generally run, quality and lean principles etc). This company also considers hiring internal applicants before external, even for interns such as myself. 

I think I‚Äôm in a good position for doing well in the interview, but I would hate to ruin the opportunity by panicking and blanking on the technical questions. I really just want to be as well prepared going into the interview as I can be, so any advice is welcome!

TLDR: I have an interview for an entry level EE/ITE position and would appreciate any input on technical questions I could be asked during the interview."

I'm currently a student in Master Degree in Software Engineering, in France. In order to graduate, I must complete a 9-week internship (during summer) in an English-speaking country (related to Software Engineering).

I am asked to do my internship in a public entity. In France we have some big public entities like the French National Center for Scientific Research, which hire a lot of interns in all fields. I was wondering if it exists an equivalent in English-speaking countries such as US, Canada, UK, where it's easy to find an internship ?

I have looked at the universities, but it seems that their mainly hire their own students (perhaps I'm wrong ?).

**Do you have any advice to find an internship in Software Engineering, in a public entity ?**

dqaekh,2,2019-11-01,I just landed an internship and think I might be in a position to negotiate. Looking for some insight!,acmed,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dqaekh/i_just_landed_an_internship_and_think_i_might_be/,"I'm a current senior year student leaving my 2nd internship and about to start my 3rd (I work throughout the school year). This position is much more relevant to my finance major and I'm pretty excited about it.

After I initially interviewed for a position about a month ago, I ended up not getting the job, but the managers I interviewed with were still impressed and quote ""didn't want to lose me"" so then they sent my resume over to another manager who needed to quickly fill an internship position due to some short-staffing. 

The interview went great and at the end of the interview she said ""I won't lie to you, you're the only one I'm interviewing. You seem like you'd be a great fit. This position was just approved so I'm not looking to go through a bunch of candidates.""

I was pretty stoked about this and very flattered that the initial hiring managers saw something in me and pushed my resume along. This is the first time where I actually feel like *the* candidate and not just *a* candidate.

That being said, I think I might be in a position to negotiate since I'm the only one being considered. I currently make $15.25 per hour and Glassdoor estimates that the range for this job is $18 to $24 per hour.

How should I go about this? Some companies have a baseline ""intern"" pay that can't really be negotiated, but I don't think that'd be the case here since there are internships for engineering, finance, you name it. There seems to be a fair amount of variation in intern salaries according to the glassdoor.

I'm thinking I offer $20, but ultimately I could go $17 and $18 and not lose much sleep over it. In my situation, the bump is not going to make or break me since I live with my folks, but I figure this would at least be good negotiation practice.

Let me know what you think. Thanks!"

I find myself paying attention more in my MIS classes than business core classes. I'm taking a Python class and I really like it, so I added CS as a minor (2 weeks ago) because I'm thinking of getting into software dev/app dev.  I'm really not liking the whole business core requirements of the MIS degree (Financial Management, Management Skills, International Business etc). Personally I don't really care about them and I find them uninteresting. I'm also hearing a lot about how MIS is like the undesired major (by employers) and how it's not enough as a program in itself (I've witnessed this first hand as I've only gotten a few replies after applying to 40+ internships). I'm a transfer student already a semester and a half through and I'm considering switching over to Computer Science as a major. Only problem is I'm 23 years old and that would add about 2.5-3 years until I finish whereas MIS Major/CompSci minor will be another year and a half. Debts are going up. Also a little insecure about my age considering my friends are all done, working full time and then there's me. Granted, I do see plenty of 25+ year olds in college.

My parents are also not getting any younger and plan on retiring soon I'd like to be working somewhere to help out financially before they retire and plan on moving to South Jersey. I live in NJ (10 miles away from NYC) so jobs are everywhere.

Is it possible to become a software developer/software engineer with the MIS major/Compsci Minor route?

So to narrow it down I have 2 choices

1. Continue with MIS major/CS Minor and struggle through the business core classes (6 more) because I don't care about them, then maybe take a coding bootcamp post graduation.
2. Make the switch to Computer Science but have a better internship outlook next year and job outlook post graduation.

Any advice would be great. I'm stuck in the middle here and registration for the Spring semester is next week."

Read on! The course covers the fundamentals of cybersecurity, and you‚Äôll learn common application vulnerabilities and develop defensive applications. Several universities like UF offer school credit for this course and we‚Äôre in the process of getting course credit at UCF too!

No prior cybersecurity experience is required, but we do go in depth on a number of cybersecurity topics which you can see here (https://courses.codepath.com/snippets/cybersecurity\_university/syllabus\_fall\_2019#heading-course-content). Students interested in this course should have *introductory* knowledge of: programming, web applications, and databases. Also, you should be pursuing a course of study related to CS or IT.  The course is planned for Spring 2020 on-campus. Please fill out this google form if you‚Äôre interested (just your email), and join the discord for updates. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoDIHtsXts43JF0HR9EAxMaMN6qhu8ZmrzX\_uDwFTAF\_3icg/viewform

BONUS: People who complete this course get matched with Codepath partner companies, who offer internships and full-time jobs! This summer, my friend and I took Codepath‚Äôs technical interviewing course, and Codepath got us (we‚Äôre both UCF students) 1-on-1 recruiter interviews from Facebook, Lyft, and some other companies. It‚Äôs a really quality perk. 

This course is student-led (Codepath designs and creates the curriculum however), and we‚Äôre looking for 1 more Technical Program Managers in order to bring the course to UCF. TPMs kick off each class with a short presentation of the weekly topics and activities, provide technical support for students during labs and assignments, manage in-class operations (attendance, activity flow), etc. Applications are due soon, November 8th.

I thought going to a top school would give me access to many opportunities for me to pursue my passions. Am I just overthinking it? Am I having difficulty because I'm a sophomore?

Some background information:

\- I graduated March 2018 and have a little less than 2 years of accounting experience, 3 years including internships

\- Private mid-sized corporation with around $150MM annual revenue and 200-500 employees

\- I work in the finance/accounting department as a Staff Accountant, the team is very top heavy, with many senior accountants, one controller and asst controller. I'm the only Staff Accountant.

\- currently done with 2/4 tests on my CPA exam

&amp;#x200B;

Events &amp; accomplishments since being hired January 2019 in chronological order:

1. Initially brought in to take over the duties of a current Senior Accountant (lets say business segment A) and the senior accountant was to shift to ASC compliance testing. I worked in this capacity through audit and handled my duties very well in my honest opinion. Duties were Financial / GL accounting in nature.
2. However, plans fell through upon our current Controller stepping down, this put the senior accountant back into the role I took from him (segment A) and I shifted into a Corporate Accounting role. This was about month 3 - 4 months in and I also quickly relearned the processes and nuances of this role with minimal supervision and established a great reputation among my peers. Throughout this time, I also did some ad-hoc reporting and research projects for the FP&amp;A team working with the Director of FP&amp;A and Senior financial analyst for another busines segment (lets say segment B)
3. During month 5 - 6, one of the analysts left her position and my company was now looking to replace her. An executive had a referral come in to interview for the position with the Director of FPA &amp; SFA and they did not see him fit for the role. So the Director recommended me to fill the Senior Financial Analysts duties and recommended the referral to be hired as a Senior Accountant to take over my Corporation Accounting position. Keep in mind, I gladly accepted this without a promotion and remained as a Staff Accountant because I had a great relationship with the Director and saw his mentor-ship as being more valuable than a 5%-10% raise or a promotion. I also believed it was too early for me to deserve one anyways. However, I did have a conversation with an executive and my the assistant controller prior to accepting another job duty change, and one of them said ""we will keep your position the same and re-evaluate in 3 months at the end of September 2019 to see if you like it or not"". Not sure how to interpret this but this conversation has not happened.
4. Had a performance review around July/August and got very positive feedback (w/ new and old controller together) as well as a small standard inflation salary increase (2-3%)
5. After points 3 &amp; 4 have been resolved, I trained the new Senior Accountant that will be taking my Corporate accounting duties (as a Staff Accountant still) while slowly shifting into Bus Segment B training with the senior analyst that left (she was contracted to train me lol).
6. I am still in this current capacity current day. I handle the accounting close, some financial reporting (FP&amp;A duties of the senior analyst that resigned were split between me and the Director of FP&amp;A) as well as some sales ops duties including inventory reporting &amp; commissions calculation for sales reps.
7. Here's the bomb, this week my mentor, the Director of FP&amp;A, resigned for a better job in an industry hes interested in and his last day will be the in 2 weeks from today. He's told me that he recommended me to take over the executive month end reporting package and will be the sole person reporting for business segment B, as a stop-gap or possibly long term. He also told me on the side that he thinks I should definitely ask for a raise at this point ( I am not his direct report).
8. So I basically feel like the cheap bandaid for the company to stop its continuous bleeding and I will most certainly ask for a raise the end of this month.

**TLDR; my leverages for a raise/promotion:**

\- all the shit I mentioned above (solid progression, willingness to learn, fast learner, aspiring CPA)

\- I will soon be the sole source of knowledge for my segments commissions (comp analyst recently hired to consolidate commission calculations from the various business segments I'm the only one that has the knowledge to train him)

\- I will also be the person doing the ""rolled up sleeves work"" for accounting and FP&amp;A for my business division. My only buffer at this point from the executive team is the Controller.

\- It is expected, although not stated to me yet, that I will be going to the year-end inventory audit on January 2nd 2020

\- In my opinion, my company faces huge business risks from this point to year-end due to these issues as well as having me as a flight-risk if they deny my raise/promotion. I don't think I'll have an issue looking for another job. The only thing keeping me here is that it is more convenient for me to get my cpa experience signed off. I also highly doubt that my coworkers have the capacity to take on my work.

***Can someone please provide some insight on what they think my chances of getting a promotion / raise are?***

***Can it be reasonably argued that I don't deserve a raise?***

***If denied a raise, should I immediately start looking or stay until I get my CPA signed off?***

***I truly appreciate all feedback and responses, thank you!***"
dqgtfj,1,2019-11-02,My career is seemingly taking off in a the oil and gas industry. Am I settling by staying here?,SwolesomeDude,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dqgtfj/my_career_is_seemingly_taking_off_in_a_the_oil/,"I'm an early/mid 20s go-getter, working in a fairly niche part of the larger oil and gas/petrochemical value chain. I did a BBA and Poli Sci degree at a good state school. Perhaps I am overestimating myself here, but I consider myself to be a very respectable student. My school invited me to apply for a Rhodes scholarship, and I think I am just as intellectual as some of my family members who attended Ivies.  When I was in school, I was also very politically aware, and pretty 'optimistic' - in the way college students stereotypically are.

I just applied for my job - this was one of a few industries &amp; types of roles that interested me. But I was also interested in vastly different things too.  For anonymity's sake, let's pretend that I work in a small lubricants and specialty fuels sales company. I can honestly say that I really like my job. The day-to-day can be pitifully frustrating, but I actually think the underlying business that we do is neat. I love the team I work with (barring one crazy). In a short 18 months, I have nearly doubled my salary. I am rubbing into 6 figures with bonuses included. And most importantly, a few really important figures in my company/industry have pulled me aside and essentially told me that I can go as far as I want, should I decide to pursue that. I think I am by far the best employee they've ever had in my role. About half of it is because I work really hard (also, no kids/serious partner yet...), and partly because super driven and high pedigree people wouldn't typically be attracted to this relatively unglamorous role.

This role has afforded me a nice life. I already have a lot of money saved up for a down payment. I work really hard, and am constantly on call, but it still easily beats high finance or consulting hours. 

However, I have also been having some reservations lately. It's almost like I'm a little bit scared of commitment, seeing how fast it's moving. 

1) Do I want to be in the oil and gas industry? Despite my company growing doing particularly well in its niche (continues to grow), I feel like the larger oil and gas industry might be in its last hurrah. I have a 40 year career to plan for. Also, there is a bit of social guilt for me. While the products are demanded by the world, there is still newer technologies we should be moving to. 

2) I feel like I belong doing bigger and better things. I think I can likely move into a role soon that is a lot more 'analytical.' My current job - although very respected in the industry, doesn't feel like something a cum laude graduate from a good college belongs doing. Maybe my ego is getting the best of me here, but I don't feel like I should be talking to a trucker at 9 at night fixing some dumb problem in my mid 20s.

I have what a lot of people are yearning for. A high-paying job, with visible advancement opportunities, that I quite enjoy. However, I'm getting increasingly worried that I'm golden handcuffing myself to something that doesn't suit my future. 

If I had to branch out, I would probably seek a top grad degree and/or seek work in the renewable energy or tech sector. Perhaps I am being a bit too pie-in-the-sky in thinking that, but it seems like a more logical path. 

However, I know there are some harsh realities to that as well:

1) I would go from being an abnormally capable person in my small pond, to competing against a bunch of young gunners in the more 'sexy' industries.

2) I worked for a small ""tech"" company before as an intern, and it absolutely sucked. I have seen first-hand that it is overly glorified by our media, and the culture can be worse than oil and gas. It was just a cultish job for some unoriginal idea, and I was doing the least rewarding work ever. I don't have programming skills.

3) Relocation would probably be necessary. Right now I live in a city like Columbus, Tulsa, etc. I would have to go to a SF type place. I absolutely love my family, and they're all here.

4) Even though the market is trending this way, I don't think renewable is there yet (in my area at least). I would be fine taking a significant pay cut, but I'd still want to work on major projects, and have the mechanisms of a company with heavy resources. In reality, it would likely be selling residential solar panels door-to-door and installing myself. Or something of that nature.

Can somebody wiser than me please share some advice?"

I posted about this before but I have made some progress with selecting universities and am looking for further advice.

I majored in Mechanical Engineering in my undergrad and want to switch majors for my masters. I really enjoy research and would like it if the program had a research component. I have made a list of universities which I think have strong programs and research relevant to my interests and experience (artificial intelligence in general and reinforcement learning in particular). I am sure about six universities that I want to apply to:

1. Stanford
2. UIUC
3. UT Austin
4. Columbia
5. GeorgiaTech
6. UMass Amherst

I think it would be wise for me to apply to 10-12 universities because the facts that I am switching majors and don't have great grades will really damage my chances. Other universities I am considering are: CMU, Princeton, UToronto, UMichigan, Brown, McGill, Alberta, NYU. What universities would you recommend from these (taking both the quality of the program and toughness of getting in into consideration)? Also, if you any of you have been to the schools I have mentioned, can you tell me how your experience has been in the program and how easy/hard it is to get funding through RA/TAships for Master's students at your school?

dqhu51,2,2019-11-02,What do you think about my portfolio?,Dolidodzik123,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/dqhu51/what_do_you_think_about_my_portfolio/,"**Hello!**

I want to become WebdDveloper (Fullstack) in the future, and I want to ask you about some advice guys. Here's things that will show you my skill:

[Portfolio](https://portfolio-dominik-lech.herokuapp.com/) (currently hosted on heroku, but i will buy hosting and domain in near future obviously) and [GitHub account](https://github.com/Dolidodzik/).

Do you guys think my portfolio/skills are good enough to get internship / job as junior / freelance?

What can I improve in my portfolio (I mean website here, I mentioned skills few lines below)?

If yes - what do you recommend for me (StackOverflow jobs / Upwork / something else), and why?

What should I improve, what additional skills (I mean, I want to ask about technical things like should I learn - like Redux for React, or Angular. Should I learn more about Django or learn flask, or maybe some other technology and so on)

If yes (once again) - where and how should I VERY start my new journey (I mean first place(s) I should visit, when my current target is getting more experience and earning VERY first money)?

I appreciate every piece of your help, every comment or note. I also wish this post will be found by other juniors (I read some post like this one I am writing right now, and it helped me a lot.)"
dqk86l,1,2019-11-02,Should I apply to the Master's in Computer Science program?,ISeeCrabPeople,UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/dqk86l/should_i_apply_to_the_masters_in_computer_science/,"I think UofT's MSc CS program would be a great fit for me. There are several researchers who are doing the kind of research I am interested in and have experience in: Jimmy Ba, Jakob Foerster, Animesh Garg. Also, I believe that the program has a significant research component. But I have had heard they have very small cohorts and the program and it is very hard to get in. Given my profile, how much of a chance do you think I have? I don't want to apply if it is really unlikely I'll get in.

&amp;#x200B;

My profile:

**GRE**: 170Q/167V/4AWA

**TOEFL**:¬†118

**Major GPA (Mechanical Engineering):**¬† 8.56/10.0

**Minor GPA (Computer Science):** 9.67/10.0 (though the number of courses is quite low)

**College**: IIT Bombay (one of the best, if not the best, college in India)

**Paper**: One paper published in CCN (Cognitive Computational Neuroscience) (work was at the intersection of reinforcement learning and cognitive science)

**Other Research:** Working on a theoretical reinforcement learning problem and developing and analysing new algorithms for bandits; also worked on a distributed computing project on which I am working drafting a manuscript which will hopefully get published

**LORs**: Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems - Research Group Leader, IIT Bombay - Associate Professor, IIT Bombay - Assistant Professor

**Internships**: Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (worked on reverse engineering human learning mechanisms with RL methods); Developed a product classifier that incorporated user feedback for a small startup

I'd be grateful for any help/feedback! I'd also appreciate it if any of you could share your experience of the program."
dqkjfm,2,2019-11-02,"Was offered an internship as an App Dev, accepted. Was offered a better internship as an App Dev somewhere else. Now what?",veggievoid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dqkjfm/was_offered_an_internship_as_an_app_dev_accepted/,"I recently went to a career fair at my university, and applied to a few different companies. My main pick didn't contact me back for around a month or so, whereas one of my bottom picks contacted me back right away (just a few days later). My bottom pick was by no means a bad one, they're a Fortune 100 company and offered a pretty decent pay rate, and they're flexible with hours during the school year. I had no idea if my main pick would ever contact me, so I accepted the other internship, which was for an App Dev position. The main reason why these guys are my bottom pick, however, are that they're known for their layoffs and don't exactly have the best reputation around town here (despite my personal experience being a good one so far). On the other hand, my top pick offers everything this current internship does, with a better possibility for a full-time position after graduation, and they don't have the same layoff reputation that my current employer has.

Fast-forward two weeks into my current internship, and about a month after the career fair. I got an email from my main pick's HR department saying they'd like to schedule an interview for an App Dev internship. I replied to the email, setup the interview, went, and \*I think\* did pretty well. I was told I'd hear a reply back within 10-14 business days if I had the internship with them or not. 10-14 business days from the interview though, I'll be about a month into my current internship. One other thing to note is that these are not summer internships, they're year-rounds for both companies.

My question is, how bad is it if I give my two week notice at my current internship a month in? If I end up getting the App Dev internship at the other company, it pays \*significantly\* better right off the bat (+25% pay) at a company that isn't known for laying off employees after a successful fiscal year, with a higher chance of full-time employment upon graduation. Ultimately, if I leave my current internship, I'm not really putting the screws to the company, I'm doing it to my direct boss and my team, who are actually very friendly and helpful people (they've all been incredibly patient while I learn the ropes). That's where the issue in my mind lies, but I don't want to pass up on an even better opportunity if it presents itself.

Any advice?"
dqlcad,15,2019-11-02,Summer 2020 Intern at Amazon vs Akuna Capital vs Activision vs others,csmajorthrowaway0110,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/dqlcad/summer_2020_intern_at_amazon_vs_akuna_capital_vs/,"Hey all, just wanna preface this saying this is not a flex, just want to get some honest advice.

I am currently a junior at a top cs school, who has gotten offers from: 
Amazon
Akuna Capital
Activision
Capital One
General Motors
American Express 

All for software engineer intern positions.  

Currently I‚Äôm leaning towards Amazon, because I think it aligns most with my goals after graduating (I.e., not super interested in finance related stuff, although I‚Äôve never tried so who knows, I‚Äôm sure the tech is dope and that‚Äôs what matters). 

Compensation at Akuna is the best, and they have a really good housing / travel package, but Amazon is actually really close in terms of compensation, and housing isn‚Äôt bad. 

I also love games and want to be close to that somehow, which is why activision is also solid.  This would be for raven.  
I‚Äôve also heard that capital One‚Äôs intern program is really good, and have a few friends going there. 

Finally I think what I look for most in these internships is the ability to grow and challenge myself with some type of mentorship ‚Äî I‚Äôm 100% down to get deep into something I‚Äôve never done before, just would want to learn the best way to do it from someone way smarter / experienced than me.  

What do y‚Äôall think would be the best course of action as a junior, keeping in mind next year‚Äôs recruiting / return offers and stuff?"

I‚Äôm just torn because I have no idea if I want to stick with cyber or pursue SWE. Does experience here help in the app dev world as well? Has anyone gotten a cybersecurity internship at Google or something and can comment on that? I had the opportunity to accept a job in app dev instead at the same company so I‚Äôm now wondering which would‚Äôve been better overall. Thanks!

Last summer, I did a product management internship. This summer, most of my offers are again PM or business analyst. Why are companies attracted to me for BA? Am I making the wrong move by using my CS degree for a BA position instead of traditional software engineering? How valued is the BA position?"
dqmcti,1,2019-11-02,Want to leave my state but the guilt of leaving is holding me back,KMAGS5,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dqmcti/want_to_leave_my_state_but_the_guilt_of_leaving/,"I'm a 23 year old male who recently graduated college and took an easy job right out of college in the same midwest city. I'm about a 2 hour drive away from the town I grew up so I can regularly visit my family and close friends. My issue is I want to leave the midwest and move to somewhere different, however the guilt of leaving my aging parents and close friends has really held me back from doing so.

When I was 22 I had the chance to intern in California for about 7 months and absolutely loved it. I was able to do the hobbies I love like regularly hiking and skiing, and really excelled at the company I was at because I was so happy. This September they offered me a full-time job offer. At first I was ecstatic, however, after explaining it to my friends and family they all seemed really sad about the idea of me moving. It seemed as if everyone brought up only the negatives of the job offer, like the traffic and cost of living. Both were valid topics, but I just felt like everyone was against me leaving. I have a really close relationships with them so I ended up making the difficult decision and turning down the offer. At first I was happy with the decision but over the past two months every morning I wake up with regret of not taking the offer. At my current job I've lost all motivation to work and find myself daydreaming about the other offer. The city I'm in has lost all of it's charm and I yearn to be back in a new environment and living more fast paced. I've also realized that even though I stayed, I only see my close friends and family a couple of days every 2-3 months. 

I just found out the company I turned down is still hiring for the position so I may have a second chance. Every time I start to think about contacting the recruiter I have an intense feeling of guilt about leaving my loved ones. I'm afraid to talk to them because I know they will still try to talk me out of leaving. Has anyone else dealt with guilt and pressure about taking on a new opportunity far from loved ones?"
dqmdcp,65,2019-11-02,Applying for jobs during my senior year as a computer science student is not the best decision,bellabella28,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dqmdcp/applying_for_jobs_during_my_senior_year_as_a/,"Tldr: Losing my sleep, health and social life due to mixing the SE job search/leetcode process with my final year as a com sci student. For those of you that took your time and waited until you graduated to search for full time offers how was your experience? 

I don‚Äôt go to a big shot school and I don‚Äôt have experience in big shot companies. 
As a final year student, I see all of my friends losing sleep, eating poorly, applying, violently reviewing leetcode, getting ghosted or rejected, and all while taking the MOST intensive courses of the major. 
I have good internship experience despite most of it being in startups. So far I have filled out 100+ applications and only the medium-small companies (usually looking for contractors) have gotten back to me, but unlike the big companies they want someone to work for them in a month, and I will be in school for another semester. 

We are all told to start applying for companies during our senior year, complete the technical interviews and land an offer. 

Unfortunately, this does not mention the time we need to make room for studying programming challenges in leetcode and building up our vocabulary to land an interview.

This does not mention the hours a day we need filling out applications that we most likely will NOT be getting responses from.

This does not mention the fact that we are still students and taking the most intensive courses with ongoing tests that alone would require us sacrificing sleep to learn. 

I want to better myself, I want to learn these courses and enjoy life as a student. I want to learn leetcode and prepare for job interviews. I want to have time to sleep, eat, workout without feeling like my day is defeated because i didn‚Äôt complete 1000 tasks at once. 

But for the sake of my mental health, i want to start my job search after graduation.

I'll try to keep this brief, but I'll be happy to answer any questions in the comments. I'm looking for a reality check or any helpful advice. 

I'm a Computer Science BSc student in Hungary, graduating next summer. I'm also just starting an internship at a fairly prestigious multinational company, this will be my first piece of related work experience.

The thing is, for years now I've dreamt of moving to the US. I've visited friends there twice now, so I feel like I have somewhat of a taste of everyday life, and I absolutely love it. Without getting too wordy, I love the people, culture, sports, food, everything. My goal is definitely to move there as soon as possible.

I had the following idea recently: In case I can't make it work and move right after graduating, I could move to Paris first! I really like that city, and it would be a much easier transition given that I wouldn't need a visa, a car, it's closer, etc. With the added year of full time work experience I could gain there, it might be a lot easier to find a US company who would go through the visa process with me.

I don't speak French at the moment, but I speak English and German at a high level. 

In terms of saving up money for the move, staying in Hungary for that year would be much better, but I really need a kind of social reset and to start living my life, staying another year would be very uncomfortable emotionally.

Thank you guys for any input!"

dqnox6,3,2019-11-02,Admission advisor attitude,PenVII,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dqnox6/admission_advisor_attitude/,"Hello guys and gals. First of all, I want to say good luck to all of you engineering students. Keep working hard and getting it done. 

I always wanted to become an engineer but due to circumstances in life, I haven't got a chance to official enroll in an engineering school yet. A little bit about my background, I love aviation so went to school to become an aviation maintenance technician and got my Airframe and Powerplant license from the FAA. After A&amp;P school, I work for a large aerospace manufacturer as an aviation maintenance technician. After a few years with experience and an AS degree, I became a manufacturing engineer planner (current job). I basically write installation plans for mechanics on the shop floor on how to put parts together. I'm also a few classes away from my BS degree in Technical Management from Embry Riddle.  

Anyway,  the urge of getting an engineering degree is always there and this time I decide to do something about it.  I plan to go back to school for an engineering degree after finishing my current BS degree. I do it more of me satisfying my goal and desire more than a career advancement because guys with engineering degrees working next to me don't make that much more. 

I really like the BSEE from ASU online because it works with my schedule (married with a kid). However, after talking with the advisor from ASU online, I feel very disappointed with his mindset and attitude. 

I don't really remember exactly his question but somewhere along the line, he asks what is the reason for me going to ASU BSEE and is there any question for him to answer? I told him the above story. I also ask him can I do this degree part-time, and how many credits would I be able to transfer from my future BS degree from Embry Riddle. 

He seems to not care about my motive to go back to school and he told me I would have to do a formal evaluation on my transcript and ( word by word) "" it's up to the student, it's the student that register for class, the school doesn't register class for student"". So, fair enough, I think my questions are answered and I don't have anything else to ask really.  

Then, he asks me again what is my reason for going to ASU BSEE? I told him I want to go to ASU because it's online and it would work with my schedule. Still, he doesn't accept my question and he sounds really frustrated. 

After a couple of back and forth, I told him I'm not sure what he wants me to answer. He ends up telling me what he looking for is me asking him what kind of skill set will I get after finishing the degree. I told him I want to know more about the electrical system and electrical engineering in general. Then, he get really frustrated and he told me my questions are not good enough. 

Then, he starts to tell me about all of these electrical systems that he learns from ASU and he wants me to ask specific questions about those systems other than  ""I just want to go back to school because that is my desire and my goal.""

I asked him if he ever goes outside and does the actual work. He told me he got internships and I kinda laugh at that. After that, he told me he also worked in the industry but I don't think so. I told him I don't look for any particular skill from the program really. A majority of my co-worker has their engineering degree and they told me the degree is more of a statement from the school that tell potential employers this person is able to learn engineering concept and work. It's the work that teaches you not the degree. I work with internship students that have mechanical/system engineering degree and none of them know crap. 

Well, let me tell you, after telling him that he changed the subject and ask me what is my education background. I think he used to talk with high school students or people with no engineering work experience so that the way he treats everyone else. 

This is the moment when I realize the school is trying to sell me that after graduating from their program I would be skilled and able to just go out and work. Am I wrong with my assumption here? Do you experience a similar thing when you try to enroll in your school? 

After a couple more questions about my education background, I told him I'm no longer interest in the program particularly ASU in general. I think he did an absolute worst representing the school and the program. He should never be an admission advisor with that kind of attitude and mindset. Treating people with the attitude that you're better than them will never take you far. Tell me what's you think?"

My fianc√©e is studying in London for law school. She is 1st year so it‚Äôs going to be a while before she can work and she can realistically only practice law in the U.K. 

I am applying for summer internship in London. But they require numerical reasoning tests and I really struggle at them and I‚Äôm not bad at math at all. I am a 4.0 student in Uni and got a 700 on my SAT math. I speak 4 languages, 2 of them fluent. So I‚Äôm not idiot but I just struggle with this test. They also require me to fly into London to do another assessment which is really too costly. 

I am thinking about applying in the US because I know a few people in IB in NYC and they can put in a good word for me. And they don‚Äôt seem to require numerical reasoning tests. 

I wonder if it‚Äôs at all possible to ask for my offer, if I get one, to be relocated in London? 

I have previous work experience as a project manager of an entertainment company and operations manager at a boutique gym. So I also I have work experience, nothing in finance but I‚Äôm sure it helps to know I can work.

I was wondering if anyone else who's been an intern at Citi or has heard reliable information about it directly would be able to share some details on how it is?

How's the culture/people? The projects? Anything I should watch out for? Do interns get to socialize with one another?

I've already looked up information with Glassdoor reviews and looking through past Citi-related posts on Reddit, but I'm hoping to get as much information as I can.

I've seen a couple reviews saying that there's not much work, innovation, or company pride. And definitely that Citi uses old technologies. I'm also not too fond of having to wear business casual, but that's alright. My recruiter hasn't been the most responsive and interactive with me after I signed, which makes me a little wary.

The pros are that Citi is a well-known name and they've given me a really good offer in terms of pay, especially for my first internship. I'm a junior in CS that hasn't been able to land anything my freshman and sophomore summers.

Any advice, help, or information is super appreciated!"

Soooo as you may have seen on this sub a few weeks ago, Lyft filled up their internship spots and started rescinding extended offers. Upon seeing this, I panic and accepted Lyft for Summer 2020. After this though, I received an offer from Stripe, who based on the interviews and what I think about their future, is my number 1 pick. I also hear that they will not negotiate for salaries, so getting a returning-intern new grad offer is the only way to get a higher starting salary there. I can't say for sure if I will end up their new grad, but I think its likely.

 Idk how sketch it is to reneg Lyft, or if I even should/need to. Also Lyft's TC is crazy high, but idk if its worth it or will even convert cuz stocks.

What does everyone think? It is also an option to do Stripe + Lyft as I am taking a semester off, but I was planning on doing FB + Lyft. The debate is whether I should do FB + Lyft or Stripe + FB (and reneg Lyft)

One is an offer from Goldman Sachs while the other is from a smaller trading firm. 

At GS I'd be working on a new product called Marcus and I'd be using a relevant stack that includes stuff like React, Spring-Boot and MongoDB. At the smaller trading firm I'd probably be working with Python or C++ to write software to assist traders. 

Both seem like good places to work and learn, but the trading firm pays about 50% more than GS, while both are in places with a comparable COL. 

I'd like to work at a bigger tech company or a trading firm after graduation, and this may not be my last internship as I'm applying for an integrated masters program that my university offers. 

Do y'all think the name recognition and interesting project I'd be getting by going with GS is worth the lower pay? Is there anything else I should be considering?"

dqrpqs,3,2019-11-02,Journey to my full time position [CS Graduate],Alces_,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dqrpqs/journey_to_my_full_time_position_cs_graduate/,"I have been lurking, sometimes posting, in this subreddit for over 2 years, and I start my first full time position as an SDET in about a month at a relatively large software company.  This subreddit has helped so much with what I've learned, that I wanted to give back and explain my route that I have taken.  Although this is more for Computer Science students, I believe that information may be relevant for self taught programmers as well.

I started studying computer science in Summer 2017.  I was about to transfer to a 4 year for business, but wanted to test the waters for comp sci.  I instantly fell in love with the problem solving aspect, and as soon as I got to my university, I switched to computer science.  Let me assure you guys, I had no previous programming experience, nor was I good at math (I had to start at calc 1 at the university).  Furthermore, I was already 22 at the time of starting the program, so not exactly the youngest.  After finishing almost a year at university, I started applying to jobs and internships, because gaining experience is always important and money is nice right?

My first job I got was at an IT help desk.  Not exactly close to programming, but it did give me more insight to other things related in the technology world, and I got to help with a few things like integrating small systems together or helping make a bot for Microsoft teams (all of this was volunteered on my downtime at work).  I was still attending school and got close to one of my professors, who ended up needing an additional teaching assistant/grader.  

Having a professor as a reference/previous employer was so beneficial.  I worked for him for the remainder of my university career, and it even got me a few other gigs at the university as a grader, which is great money as it keeps you refreshed on the basics.  So I was doing both the IT job and this at the same time.

Another month passed and I got a job at a local utility agency as a programming assistant (student only job).  And I would do small tasks for the Programmers, IT people, DBA's or anyone who asked if I could do something for them.  I left the IT job for this job and kept up with it until very recently.  They had me do a wide range of tasks, although I would argue I had no real mentor.. just a lot of asking me to do something and let them know if I had questions.  This experience lasted about a year from October 2018 until October 2019.  

During the summer I applied to many jobs, and although I got a few interviews at other places, the company I signed on with was great with communication and really seemed to care about hiring me.  Before they even contacted me, they interviewed the professor on my resume about me, then contacted me.  I believe having a PhD as a reference was extremely helpful.  The other things that really helped were the fact I had created a website to host my resume and experience (although it was very basic, nothing too fancy as I don't want to do web dev), and that seemed to catch the attention of the hiring manager.  They were equally interested about how I worked with people along with my technical skills.  They offered me a position and I accepted, so long as I graduate as expected in December.

So I hope for some of you this helps with creating either a path to starting your careers.. or can give you some guidance.  Overall I have been studying and practicing for a little over 2 years now, and it is a long journey but very doable if you stay focused.  A big thing I wanted to mention, many people gave me crap for taking an IT job because ""HAHA THATS FOR BUSINESS STUDENTS"".  But honestly, I think this has helped me grow my domain knowledge about technology in general, and I think without it I wouldn't have had the opportunity to work with the local utility company.  So don't be afraid to take opportunities that don't seem like the best, flashy company or position, because it may blossom to something more."

I think I'm proficient in English, and a good programmer. Although recently I knew nothing but php and basics in java and C# (silly small programs or systems with db)...

This company that hired is actually big. But I don't expect much from them, having in mind my little experience in serious development.

They will train me in Git, maven, domain-driven design, Java 8, servlets &amp; JSP, JDBC, OOP, JUnit &amp; Mock, Spring Security, Persistency &amp; ORM, Spring boot ,Hibernate, Swagger, Postman, Microservices, RabbitMQ, SAGAS (ORchestration) OAuth, Api managers, containers &amp; images, CD/CI deployments.

And based in our performance, they will hire us as juniors. I expect as much as 12k USD annually which might be good to live here in Mexico 

My question is... How can I sell my profile, given this experience as a developer in other countries? USA, CA? (Or even in Mexico)

I know getting a job in a FAANG company is considerably hard, lots of udemy and online courses, leetcode algorithms. Maybe a masters..

But if I can't afford a master..  how would I do to have a successful career path? Become a software architect? Lick the right boots?"

Trading for all three, Jump is algo trading/qr but it's pretty much the same. Have offers at the first two and the third one am still interviewing.

**Jane Street** Pros: probably the most reputable of the three (Citadel has a great rep too but perhaps in a negative way), great culture, open environment to learn about all asset classes and aspects of trading, in New York

Cons: A lot of freshman (I know it's minor but I'm a junior and would prefer people of similar grade), and there are way too many interns like 60 all together which makes me think that it won't be a very personalized experience, conflicts with my school dates

**Citadel**  Pros: you learn with an individual desk on a specific asset class with full time employees, more similar to a full time employee than Jane Street, they treat their interns very well with luxurious trips and dinners and amazing housing and such

Cons: Pay for the internship is lower than most trading firms (still good), I heard the hours are rough and the return offer rate is low

**Jump Trading** Pros: more algo/quant research focused with classes on topics like ML, lots of PHDs to learn from, smaller intern class

Cons: not as well known as the other two, and obviously the big one...they haven't completed their interview cycle yet

Update: I think I won‚Äôt be taking citadel"

But regardless of what college you go to, make sure to **APPLY TO SOME FUCKING INTERNSHIPS.**

I know what you are thinking. ""This is a college subreddit. Why are you talking about internships?""

Because, my darling, Internships low-key give you everything you want from college.

**1) Prestige**

Yes yes yes, we should not chase prestige. But we all do it anyway so lets just admit. Sure, going to Stanford is very prestigious. But you know what else is prestigious, being a software engineering intern at Google. Internships can skyrocket your prestige and clout levels.

**2) Money and scholarships**

Money is a very important topic. We all want money. Considering how expensive school can be, you guys need to look into scholarships for sure. But guess what, **Interns at top tech companies earn $8k+ per month.** Yes, you heard me correct. Sometimes over $10k per month. These kids are paying their way straight through college. Don't believe me? [I made a video showing how much these kids earn.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khvBihRCI0o)

$8k+ per month would really help pay for school, right?

**3) Career and networking**

You guys know where I am going with this. The kids you meet at internships will be absolutely the most valuable people you can network with. Your career will skyrocket.

&amp;#x200B;

College is important, for but us CS kids, make sure to tie internships into your goals too. In my opinion, I think your college prestige does not matter at all when it comes to these big companies. I go to ASU which is not prestigious, but I've interviewed with Facebook, etc. If you want me to talk about why college prestige is not that important, LMK!

I really want to move to Japan and work in the field of data science.

What I want to know, is how hard it is to get in? I mean how competent do you need to be in order to be accepted?

I am a good student (top 5%), but I am afraid not to be good enough to be accepted in Japan. I imagine the amount of competion that it might exist for foreigners to get in there.

I mean, I am from Portugal, not a huge or very powerful country. I am competing against people from germany, USA (MIT), etc.

Realistically what chances do I have?

I have been starting to think about many plans:
1 - work really hard at data science to become highly skilled.

2 - Learn Japanese and become fluent

3 - Since I am getting close to fluency in german, I could start working there and improve my CV and then increase chances to get in Japan. (basically I will use Germany just to impress my love Japan ‚ù§Ô∏èüáØüáµ :D sorrynotsorry) 

4 - after 1 year of working in Data science start to apply almost everyday, for years, if necessary.

5 - after around 2/3 years of experience in data science (or whichever time that it makes me feel competent with it) do an internship in Japan. The longer the better (6 months would be nice). It doesn't matter if it is unpaid. There I will start applying like a mad-lad, and since I am in the country I will have a better chance to get accepted. Or if my company likes me, stay with them.

Anyways, these are some ideas that I have in order to get in. What do you guys think?
I am unawere about how though I can be. But I remember that the best student of my university got the opportunity to do an exchange program in there. Thats why I am so stressed and trying so hard.

Am I exageranting or is it really though? And how though? Is this plan realistic, would it have a chance to work given my skills and potential future skills (assuming that I follow it)?

Could I just apply now and get in?"

Today, I decided to make a change in my life and stop wasting time doing meaningless stuff. I want to learn how to code. 

Currently, I am undergoing an internship at my school and learning about machine learning/object detection. As a side project to further my coding knowledge, I wanted to try making a Runescape bot.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that it is possible to do scripting with python but how can we actually get the data from the game/server?

The easiest method I could think of was 'hard coding' where the mouse clicks. But I don't want to do that as I won't be learning anything. I want to actually make a script where the machine learns and does everything. 

Any advice on where to start would be extremely helpful! Thank you :)"

I know lots (or so i feel/am told i do) about computer hardware, smart phones, computer networking.

I'm working at a retail job which I hate right now and would really like to think there are jobs out there related to what I've listed. I've also thought about getting an internship, but where do I find one?

but I also realize that most jobs like so are full time and require other things like certificates/higher education. even something like best buy which is barely related to technology sounds nice (although also retail)

just need some ideas of what I can do with the background of going to such a high school and having those skills"

dqwtzx,3,2019-11-03,(Yet Another) New Grad Data Point,cscqnewgrad,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dqwtzx/yet_another_new_grad_data_point/," Background: 

I am a senior at a top-25 CS school (not a target). I did end up attending a conference this year with a career fair, but honestly did not get much out of it in terms of my final results. Previous experience includes CS research, an internship at a local company, and most recently a Big-N internship. 

Preparation:

I completed 69 leetcode questions (1 hard, 10 medium, 58 easy). I mostly targeted the ‚ÄúTop Interview Questions‚Äù and I did purchase a premium account which I shared with friends. If I had an interview with a specific company approaching I would either go to the dedicated problems on Leetcode for that company, or hunt through Glassdoor interview posts for that role to see the type of questions that the company liked asking. I also skimmed CTCI, but didn‚Äôt work from it as much as last year. Honestly, at one point I was doing so many actual interviews that those served as my ‚Äúpractice‚Äù. I did not practice behavioral.

Breakdown:

Since I had a return offer from my summer internship that I would be happy to take, I tried to be a lot more selective in my applications this year. I ended up applying to or entering the recruiting process with 18 companies:

* 4 Big N / FAANG
* 12 Unicorn/Medium size (think LinkedIn, Airbnb, Stripe, etc.)
* 1 FinTech company
* 1 Retail company

Of these companies, 4 reached out to me. I also filled out 3 applications for companies at the conference career fair. I cold-applied on the company‚Äôs website for the other 11 companies.

Conclusion:

Recruiting was rough, even having a Big N on my resume. I was ghosted by half of the unicorns I applied to, as well as one of the FAANG (even after completing an in-person first round and being told I would move on to the next round). I found that a lot of those mid-size/unicorns I was targeting were not really hiring new grads, but were mostly hiring from their intern pool. 

I was doing onsites every single week in October, and it was really hard to keep up with school, interview prep, and travel.  I think the most important thing is to watch your mental health, and take breaks when you need them. I‚Äôm happy to say that it all paid off in the end, and I‚Äôll be starting next summer at a company I‚Äôm really excited about. Good luck to everyone still in the process!

I believe in learning to learn than learning something. I have made two posts in this sub that would probably help first and second year engineering students. I promised another 2 posts,  but I could not do it because i was struck with a personal tragedy.

Anyway, you can drop your questions below.

This post is a bit personal, just need help and some mental peace.If my sentences are a bit incoherent please forgive me because I'm overwhelmed with emotions at the moment. 
So here begins my story,I (24M) was born and brought up in Kerala. I got through the medical entrance exam and took up a medical seat in Maharashtra . Didn't have any problems but felt homesick finally got over it and started studying for my future in medicine. The first semester in Ist M.B.B.S goes very good, my problems begin in the second semester where i start having issues with my health.During this period i consulted many doctors. I'm unstable and bed ridden, taking multiple pain killers and muscle relaxants prescribed by them.The doctors aren't able to give me a diagnosis a few months pass keep in mind even in such a state I'm studying. I give my prelim examination and barely make it. I'm geared up to give my Ist M.B.B.S exam. My health takes a turn for the worst and now I'm unable to move, my parents come all the way from Kerala. They aren't able to see me in such a state and they take me back to Kerala . They get me checked up and within 2 days the competent doctor gives me the diagnosis, i have T.B spine. My parents are shell shocked, my mother starts crying. I felt numb. I felt helpless. My treatment schedule is put in place and i start with my medication. The treatment plan was for a year, with physiotherapy. Luckily the  vertebrae involved ankylosed without causing a need for surgical involvement. I healed physically. Now my treatment was done,  i was healthy. But during this period all the friends i had made in my college, were now strangers. I had become a social pariah. I didn't disclose my illness except to 1 close friend who was also from Kerala . He kept me updated on what was going on in college even though he had moved to the second year. I had completed my treatment and had to sit for the Ist M.B.B.S exam. With 2 months left after my treatment, i give it my all and with the grace of God i make it through. Now begins the second year, I'm with a completely new batch. I became a junior. Nobody knows who i am. I thought i get a fresh start. But slowly the news spreads and they get to know that I'm from their senior batch. Initially they assumed i was a transfer. Initially people tried making small talk with me and i was soon ""friends"" with a few of the people from this batch. Slowly i was isolated and my ""seniors"" wanted nothing to do with me. I was completely alone, even my close friend got busy with his life and abandoned me aswell. My parents kept asking me how the new batch was and if i had adjusted. I lied to them just to make them feel better that everything was perfect. Keep in mind my parents are doctors and they have extremely busy schedules and I didn't want to burden them further. Now somehow i have kept myself together with the support of my parents, the only people i talk to are my parents. I somehow made it through the second and third year aswell, now I'm in my final year. This year has been nerve-wracking. All i do is study, eat and sleep. I'm completely alone. All the ridicule i face from my batchmates and juniors has got me all messed up ( for something that wasnt my fault at all). I don't know who i can trust anymore.I have no one in my life besides my family. There is only so much I can take. I'm in another state away from home questioning my sanity. My batchmates are now in internship. They'll graduate soon. Everyday i keep thinking what i had done to deserve this. I keep thinking is it worth it to even live anymore.  Why should i pain myself to become a doctor at all under such pathetic conditions? Why should i have to live with this? If this is how the society is I'd rather be dead."

dr7nge,53,2019-11-03,Should I pursue a second Bachelor's degree or apply to a Master's program so I can gain more experience on my resume?,k9351,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dr7nge/should_i_pursue_a_second_bachelors_degree_or/," Hi everyone! I've posted this in a couple other grad school related subs and I felt it would be relevant here.

This is my first post in this sub and as my title suggests, I'm questioning on whether to go and pursue a second Bachelor's degree or continue on to a Master's Program.

I recently graduated with a B.B.A in Economics back in May and after several months of applying to entry level Data Analyst positions and internships, I haven't been receiving any feedback at all from recruiters.

I think my lack of experience in the field is a major turn-off for employers, as I never completed any internships or had any relevant work experience while I was in school. I only took an introductory Econometrics course, but we never were exposed to any of the programs/languages that employers are looking for now. We only used the Data Analysis Toolpak in Microsoft Excel, and only analyzed Simple and Multiple-Linear Regressions from the ANOVA outputs.

This was in addition to analyzing larger data sets in SAP Predictive Analytics, but we were never exposed to R, SQL, SAS, Tableau, or similar programs.

I've always thought about going back to grad school at some point, but if I'm able to get an entry level position as a Data Analyst without a Master's degree, it wouldn't be worth the hassle to enter a Master's degree program. I would only consider grad school if it meant employers taking my resume more seriously.

As far as research interests, I never really thought that far ahead, but if I'm in a program I love, I wouldn't mind compiling/analyzing a data set for a thesis paper. If I were to enter a graduate program, I would probably pursue one where I would have hands-on experience working with R, SQL, Tableau, or similar software.

However, I feel like my only option at this point would be to go back to school, receive a second's Bachelor's degree and complete an internship, as my final undergraduate GPA was a 2.42. I will admit that early on, I was not a serious student and did not take my coursework seriously. It wasn't until my senior year of college that I started to turn my GPA around and took school seriously. In addition, I do not have a strong math/calculus background so I think it would be a hard sell for an admissions committee to consider my application.

As of today, I have not taken the GRE or GMAT exams, but I would be willing to take them if there was a remote possibly that it would help improve my chances of applying somewhere.

Please let me know what your opinions are on my situation, as I really want to start a career where I actually am excited to get out of bed and go to work in the morning.

Thanks again for everyone who's read down this far! Any advice at this point would be extremely helpful!"
dr7tg6,3,2019-11-03,Internship advice,RebelChild1999,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/dr7tg6/internship_advice/,"I was hoping to get some advice on a few different offers for an internship next summer. I realize that these all are great opportunities and I would be happy with any of them, I just am not sure what is best for me.  
A little about me, I am a Junior at a really good small engineering school that is only well known within the engineering industry. In high school, I got in with Northrop Grumman's high school internship program and ever since I have been interning with them each summer. I love cybersecurity (particularly the pointy end) and that is the domain I have been working in with Northrop. Because of that, I haven't gotten a lot of your typical software engineering industry experience and was hoping to diversify and get some this summer, but I am worried I may not enjoy it as much or may end up missing the pointy end aspect of what I have done historically.  
Here are my current offers.

**Northrop Grumman**  
Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern  
Pay: $24/hr + $3500 living stipend for the summer  
Location: Cincinnati, Ohio  
Description: This is what I know and love but I think I have kind of ruled it out due to my wanting to experience a different workplace before I graduate.

**Ceaser Creek Software**  
Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern  
Pay: $30/hr + unspecified living stipend  
Location: Dayton, Ohio  
Description: I had a 6-hour interview here and loved everything about it. The work and the people was amazing. It is very similar to the defense contraction I have done at Northrop, it is just a smaller company with more of a family atmosphere. I almost made my mind up after visiting until I received other offers.

**MIT Lincoln Labs**  
Role: Cyber Systems Assesment Group Intern  
Pay: $24/hr + subsidized housing  
Location: Lexington, Massachusetts  
Description: This is really interesting to me because it is what I love (similar to Northrop but more researchy) and it comes with the name MIT Lincoln Labs attached. I have been told that only really matters if I plan to do research or go into academia (which I don't think I do). Also not sure if I would like the more formal work atmosphere (I am used to casual attire and not strict hours). I feel like I would be crazy to pass up the name MIT Lincoln Labs but maybe I put too much weight on it.

**Amazon**  
Role: SDE  
Pay: $8k/month + $2500/month living stipend  
Location: Seattle, Washington  
Description: Opportunities like this are ones CS students dream about. Being an independent self-supporting student money is also a big factor even for internships, and this offer has no lack of it. Also, I feel like having a Big-N on your resume is the type of thing to let you work almost anywhere but I am not sure how true that actually is. Part of the reason I have started looking at other places than just accepting my return offer from Northrop was for the chance to experience something different and this would be that. On the other hand, I have been told the wlb is awfull and while that may not be as true for interns, I am not sure this is a place I would like a ft offer from but I'm guessing that opinion may change if I had one in my hand. I also would not get to pick my team wich kinda sucks because I would still like to do something related to security. On the other hand, **AMAZON!!!**

**Microsoft**  
Role: SWE  
Pay: \~7.5k/month + $2500/month living stipend  
Location: Seattle, Washington  
Description: I haven't actually received an offer yet but I have my onsite soon so I include it just in case. This would probably be about the same as Amazon with a few exceptions. For some reason, I feel like Amazon looks better on a resume because people will know they worked you hard. Also, the pay from Amazon is slightly better and I feel like I would learn a lot more at Amazon, someone tell me I am wrong.

It took me 6 years to get my bachelor's while the average is 4-5 years. I have completed 4 internships during the process from swe to sort of data science work. Most students who graduated as a 21-23 have already a couple of years of experience over me. I just got offered my first full-time swe role and I am just wondering am I starting out too late. I mean I consider my 4 internships as experience but starting off my first role as a 25-year-old while most who graduated with me are 22-23. Just wondering if my thinking is right?

A year and a half ago I joined an IT startup as a first non-founding employee,  
at that time I was an intern (my university has a requirement that internships are unpaid...) and through the time I designed a good part of needed graphics for the company. After my internship ended I continued to work half-time but still unpaid, as all the funders live off their savings, with the agreement of a job when the possibility comes. Last week the company got evaluated for $5M, now I feel a little sorry for myself as I am the only one whose network stays the same. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach the founders and what is in my right to ask? The biggest concern I have is that the design and marketing I did haven't brought ""real"" value as founders are way more experienced in their positions.

Edit: thank you guys on so many solid answers, I saw that I haven't explained the situation well in the first place but we learn while we live. For those who are interested I decided to ask for a share based on the lost salary based on prevaluation."
dr8pw8,1,2019-11-03,Internship advice,RebelChild1999,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dr8pw8/internship_advice/,"I was hoping to get some advice on a few different offers for an internship next summer. I realize that these all are great opportunities and I would be happy with any of them, I just am not sure what is best for me.  
A little about me, I am a Junior at a really good small engineering school that is only well known within the engineering industry. In high school, I got in with Northrop Grumman's high school internship program and ever since I have been interning with them each summer. I love cybersecurity (particularly the pointy end) and that is the domain I have been working in with Northrop. Because of that, I haven't gotten a lot of your typical software engineering industry experience and was hoping to diversify and get some this summer, but I am worried I may not enjoy it as much or may end up missing the pointy end aspect of what I have done historically.  
Here are my current offers.

**Northrop Grumman**  
Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern  
Pay: $24/hr + $3500 living stipend for the summer  
Location: Cincinnati, Ohio  
Description: This is what I know and love but I think I have kind of ruled it out due to my wanting to experience a different workplace before I graduate.

**Ceaser Creek Software**  
Role: Cyber Software Engineer Intern  
Pay: $30/hr + unspecified living stipend  
Location: Dayton, Ohio  
Description: I had a 6-hour interview here and loved everything about it. The work and the people was amazing. It is very similar to the defense contraction I have done at Northrop, it is just a smaller company with more of a family atmosphere. I almost made my mind up after visiting until I received other offers.

**MIT Lincoln Labs**  
Role: Cyber Systems Assesment Group Intern  
Pay: $24/hr + subsidized housing  
Location: Lexington, Massachusetts  
Description: This is really interesting to me because it is what I love (similar to Northrop but more researchy) and it comes with the name MIT Lincoln Labs attached. I have been told that only really matters if I plan to do research or go into academia (which I don't think I do). Also not sure if I would like the more formal work atmosphere (I am used to casual attire and not strict hours). I feel like I would be crazy to pass up the name MIT Lincoln Labs but maybe I put too much weight on it.

**Amazon**  
Role: SDE  
Pay: $8k/month + $2500/month living stipend  
Location: Seattle, Washington  
Description: Opportunities like this are ones CS students dream about. Being an independent self-supporting student money is also a big factor even for internships, and this offer has no lack of it. Also, I feel like having a Big-N on your resume is the type of thing to let you work almost anywhere but I am not sure how true that actually is. Part of the reason I have started looking at other places than just accepting my return offer from Northrop was for the chance to experience something different and this would be that. On the other hand, I have been told the wlb is awfull and while that may not be as true for interns, I am not sure this is a place I would like a ft offer from but I'm guessing that opinion may change if I had one in my hand. I also would not get to pick my team wich kinda sucks because I would still like to do something related to security. On the other hand, **AMAZON!!!**

**Microsoft**  
Role: SWE  
Pay: \~7.5k/month + $2500/month living stipend  
Location: Seattle, Washington  
Description: I haven't actually received an offer yet but I have my onsite soon so I include it just in case. This would probably be about the same as Amazon with a few exceptions. For some reason, I feel like Amazon looks better on a resume because people will know they worked you hard. Also, the pay from Amazon is slightly better and I feel like I would learn a lot more at Amazon, someone tell me I am wrong. The pros are that it seems like Microsoft has a better internship experience and a lot of people get ft offers, which is something I would be more inclined to accept.

It's gotten to the point where I have withdrawn my applications from other amazing places because I don't want to make my decision harder.

I've been fortunate enough to have received offers from both [Seattle area company best known for an OS] and Yext for a 2020 summer internship. Surprisingly or not, the decision has been a rather difficult one, and I'm looking for some of y'all's opinions to tip the scale. Now before you play the prestige card and tell me to go for [Seattle area company best known for an OS], here are my thoughts and considerations so far:

**[Seattle area company best known for an OS]**

*Pros:*

* Bigger name company has more resume clout ‚Äì get big N on resume first
* Already know about placement onto interesting team (doing some stuff with Bing‚Äôs knowledge graph)
* Final interviewer (manager of team I would be working with) stated that interns are empowered to architect their own solutions and bring up own ideas to team. FWIW, had a great impression of 
* Seattle (different and far away but maybe slight preference for over NYC, where Yext is located)
* High return offer rate
* Larger company probably has more established internship program and smoother onboarding process

*Cons:*

* MS-DOS/C# (yeah breadth is good but less transferrable knowledge)
* Low risk/low reward (again, thinking about what the future and working there full-time would be like)

*Other considerations:*

* Project sounds closer to what I did last year (knowledge graph processing): again, the question of depth vs. breadth arises
* $7,350/mo, corporate housing or housing lump sum (will probably take corporate housing)

**Yext**

*Pros:*

* **High reward if company takes off** ‚Äì promising from standpoint of employees: company leadership largely from Salesforce which was a successful company; lots of ex-Google engineers; rolling out many exciting new products
* Amazing experience with people/culture/engineering practices via coffee chats and interviewers 
* Java/Linux shop (depth ‚Äì improving chops with technologies already familiar to me)
* A larger proportion of Yext engineers are from my university: more networking opportunities
* Interns work on the same code as full-timers: this and smaller size =&gt; very high impact for company for an intern
* Gut feeling that since Yext hires fewer interns, the opportunity will be more likely to be gone if I pass it off this summer
* NYC (relatively familiar)
* Cool new office opening March 2020

*Cons:*

* Uncertainty about project/team (team decisions will be made after I accept the offer)
* Generally riskier regarding company growth in the future ‚Äì additionally, small-business customers don‚Äôt seem as happy with Yext‚Äôs main digital knowledge management product
* Less clout on resume (fewer people know a lot about Yext)? Do note that I don‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôll be doing less interesting or less complex work at Yext
* Lower return offer rate

*Other considerations:*

* Experience working with SaaS/cloud computing; possibility of doing something a bit more different from what I did last summer
* ~$48/hr, $10k signing bonus (I‚Äôd imagine a good chunk of which will be going towards housing). Higher compensation than MS but the difference is unfortunately not enough to make the decision definitive in the slightest.

Thanks for reading through these considerations and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this!"

I really enjoyed my undergraduate degree and did pretty well in my classes. I had an internship for my junior and senior years. I took a job in the same industry in which I had my internship. I like what I do but I'm not sold on making a career out of it. I love software engineering and am passionate about programming. Programming started out as a hobby about 20 years ago. Compared to other developers with my relative experience, I think I stack up pretty well at my job. Recently I thought I should go back to school to get a masters so that I could specialize in a cs domain that is relevant to my industry. I am almost through my first semester and have realized that I just don't have the drive to power through academic work anymore! During my underrate degree, I worked 30 hours a week for my internship and was taking 4 classes per semester for years while maintaining a pretty good GPA. Now I'm just trying to take one class but I'm finding it hard to stay focused and do the taunting tasks like paper writing. So, I'm about to drop out of graduate school and I'm having a hard time with this decision. How can I just be happy with what I have? How can I accelerate my career without a masters degree? How can I separate myself from other software engineers without the extra degree? I feel like my undergraduate degree required more work but things have changed so much the past few years. Now, I'm married and have a house and have a social life. I need to put some time into each of those things and work on my personnel health and physical fitness. Can anybody help me with this decision or give me some real career advice? Has anybody else been in my situation?"

When I applied, he was very impressed with my operations management experience. My resume went straight to his assistant (called: ‚Äúoperations‚Äù) manager‚Äôs desk. Throughout the interview process, I‚Äôm guessing she heard him talk me up a lot and maybe felt envy/threatened that someone he knows and likes has her same qualifications. He keeps saying he wants me to be part of ‚Äúwhat he‚Äôs building,‚Äù which seems to imply I have a part in some grand plan he has for the future.

Anyway, I start the job, and red flags abound. Anything I do, she questions. Whenever I answer the phone, she calls me into her office and questions that I have correctly answered. She gives me an assignment and has an intern train me on how to complete the task. I complete the assignment, and she scolds me for not doing it exactly the way she would have done, herself. She then admonishes me to approach her if I ever have questions. Mind you, there is no way for me to know her way without her telling me. Next, I ask questions to preemptively understand what she wants, and she contradicts what she has explained on an earlier occasion. Trying to professionally bring these contradictions to light and wanting to avoid her lashing out at me for directly pointing out her contradiction, I ask questions to indirectly highlight the contradiction. She then gaslights me for anything I ask, saying ‚Äúwe already talked about this‚Äù for basically every one of my questions and saying ‚Äúthis is just common sense‚Äù for everything else. This played out over the first few weeks.

My first 30 days were so fraught with her coming down on me for basically anything that she actually got my friend‚Äôs dad to call a performance conversation for me. The whole time, my friend‚Äôs dad talks, while she sits opposite him, nodding her head. It is clear she has told him what to say. A great deal of the voiced concerns full of lies and half-truths about me not supporting the team and random accusations such as me not alerting people to my bathroom breaks. Towards the end of the conversation, he asks me if I really think it‚Äôs the right job. I listened to all they had to say, then she went back to her office. I then explained to my friend‚Äôs dad that I question much of the basis of the criticism. He listened, was sympathetic, and agreed to do a covert 360 review, and apparently the reviews from everyone else were good enough that it seems he overrode he critiques and kept me on as a team member.

Moving forward from the meeting, I resolve to take the criticisms to heart and to rid of any perception that I do the things they mentioned. For example, I stop taking bathroom breaks for the most part, and when I do, I tell everyone that I‚Äôm going. To my surprise, my colleagues say they don‚Äôt care nor need to know. This makes me think their concerns have either been overstated or made up entirely. In any case, to avoid asking my manager questions, and to have added protection of someone else‚Äôs word, I instead ask my colleagues questions. This is something all my colleagues do with each other, anyway. But to my surprise, she scolds me for asking them questions. Then one day I go to the bathroom, she calls me in and reprimands me for ‚Äúnot telling anyone‚Äù where I‚Äôm going. I go to my colleagues and apologize, telling them I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt communicate clearly enough, and they seem baffled. They tell me they even told her I went to the bathroom. But now I don‚Äôt know what to do, so I struggle through my days, sometimes accidentally urinating in my clothes, as I struggle to avoid going to the bathroom. Additionally, my manager requires that all my work‚Äîand no one else‚Äôs‚Äîgo through her, so I have limited means of getting other people‚Äôs feedback, and she gets to examine everything I do with a microscope.

A month ago, at the end of my probation period, she sends out an email to **only some of us,** saying that she is revising the performance reviews to make them more frequently (quarterly) and using a new criteria and that we should fill them out immediately. The review basically seems to have taken all of her specific gripes with me and made them into the criteria for the review. I immediately took it to my friend‚Äôs dad, and he requested that I forward the email, detailing the review criteria. That was the last I heard of that, and it seems the reviews got canceled. Part of the review criteria states that she wants us to send her updates on projects, highlighting any roadblocks. OK - fine.

So she assigns me a few projects the past few weeks as our company prepares for a merger, and I send updates as I run into roadblocks and complete the projects. She fails reply to any of the emails where I inform her of roadblocks, but she does manage to ask me which projects I‚Äôve completed. I take this as a red flag, given that I‚Äôve already sent her emails explaining which projects I‚Äôve completed. Perhaps this means she‚Äôs overwhelmed and isn‚Äôt keeping these details straight? Regardless, I politely tell her I‚Äôve been assigned X # of projects and completed all of them. No reply from her.

Two weeks later, two colleagues asks me if I can gather reports for them. I say I‚Äôll try but that our computer systems have changed and that we likely won‚Äôt be able to. I send an email to my boss, explaining that these colleagues want these things done and that I‚Äôm running into these roadblocks, and she gaslights me, saying she and others told me to complete this work (false). I point out to her that I have no record of this and that she scheduled meetings at a time I‚Äôm not available the past few weeks, and she just says ‚Äúthis is all your fault.‚Äù So I call company headquarters, talk to the higher ups, and beg them to send the data my colleagues have requested. The higher ups oblige, and they actually helped so much that my request ended up putting our entire branch ahead on several projects by about three months! I was so relieved and excited. My friend‚Äôs dad was so excited to see that the branch is ahead on these projects, but he has no idea that I pulled all that off. Of course, though, I‚Äôm afraid to mention it, because I fear my manager will twist it into something where I actually did wrong.

I can‚Äôt defend myself if she just decides to rewrite history and accuse me of things and refuse to acknowledge when she‚Äôs wrong. She routinely belittles me in front of colleagues for aspects of my personality, saying I apologize too much and whatnot. She yells at me in front of them for stuff that isn‚Äôt my fault. She calls people and higher ups ‚Äústupid‚Äù and ‚Äúidiots‚Äù in front of our whole branch and mocks the idea of bringing issues to HR. She also makes racist comments.and lastly, many times she gets at me and scolds me for supposedly making a mistake, but then I point out that it was actually a colleague who made the mistake, and she doesn‚Äôt care about the mistake anymore. That pisses me off and makes me feel like this is all targeted at me. I‚Äôve basically given up at this point. What recourse do I have? I‚Äôm thinking of talking to my friend‚Äôs dad. How do I explain all this to him? I‚Äôm thinking of posing it as a question‚Äîas in ‚ÄúHow should I deal with this?‚Äù Because I don‚Äôt feel good about the direction of this. I feel as though I have zero control over job expectations and responsibilities. If my manager can just retroactively change my responsibilities and deny our email conversations, what basis do I have for argument? How can I do my job well when she can retroactively change the facts? I‚Äôm worried about my job and the upcoming half-year reviews in January. I feel I have zero control over the facts, because she just changes them whenever.

She blows up regularly at people‚Äîbut especially at me. People are scared of her‚Äîeven people at out company‚Äôs call center, hundreds of miles away. She wants to become an executive in the company, and she‚Äôs happy to run over people to get there. She‚Äôs a very aggressive character and will lie about anything and defame anyone to get there, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with all of this anymore. I feel like my friend‚Äôs dad tries to listen to her, but I wish he‚Äôd take a more active role in controlling her management style. She basically intimidates and gaslights people into agreeing that she is always right and that we all serve at her mercy. She is held accountable to no one. In a sense, I don‚Äôt care that she is an asshole. I just care that she is making up facts and using those made up facts to evaluate my work. THANKFULLY her boss is my friend‚Äôs dad. That‚Äôs one of the only things going for me here. And also that everyone else there seems to like me.

I am an Australian electrical engineering undergraduate with a GPA of 2.5 on a scale of 4 (4.5 on a scale of 7) in the second semester of my sophomore year (3 semesters completed). After a fair number of applications, and two failed interviews, I finally have an internship for me during the summer. I will be working on drone sensors in visible and infrared wavelengths and interpreting the data from these sensors in a small engineering company which I will start in late November. This is just a message for anyone with a low GPA but passionate about the field to keep at it."

I‚Äôm a freshman at a good school for cs (Georgia Tech) with an interesting dilemma. I have two options for next semester: 
(Well, I think I do- the company hasn‚Äôt said yes or no to if I‚Äôll be offered something there even though I asked... but let‚Äôs assume it becomes a choice, as they haven‚Äôt said no)

1)  (keep doing what I‚Äôm doing) continue part time internship as a web developer doing .net, sql, css stuff 15 hours a week. It‚Äôs at a company w 60-70 employees that has pretty high traffic on their websites, and my work here is definitely real (goes to prod and does a lot). Then 14 credit hours of fundamental classes. 
I‚Äôm learning a lot at the internship, but it‚Äôs a lot of web dev stuff (and a lot of general swe too).  The stack feels a little outdated though. 
Pros: $, work experience
Cons: less interesting/fun

2) drop the internship and add 6 credits of cool classes. The two classes would be objects and design (the class after intro java, that‚Äôs basically a group project) and cx 4230- modeling and simulation. A big bonus of this is that 2340 is with some friends, and 4230 sounds interesting (and would result in a big programming project). 
Pros: cool, fun 
Cons: not real world, no $. The 4230 class also might not be that useful for what I want to do too. 

Registration was today and I got everything I wanted for the 20 credit schedule- so both of these paths are doable. (I can drop as needed)

I don‚Äôt want to do web dev as a career. Ideally in a year or two I‚Äôd like to intern (and probably work at) some big tech companies to get some stable credibility on my resume, then maybe do quant or startups. I really like math, so ai ml areas seem right for me- will web dev experience help me there? I‚Äôm pretty conflicted right now

Thanks to anyone who reads all this and hopefully gives advice!"

However I failed both of them. Mainly due to lack of preparation. Not because I didn't prepare but just not enough. Obviously both of my applications have been rejected. Both are internships since I haven't graduated yet. This has really knocked my confidence however.

Now I know I need to spend more time practicing leetcode questions. Maybe this is a misconception but how am I supposed to progress through this stage without dedicating alot of my free time to doing leetcode?

How do you deal with rejection? Cause honestly I just feel like crying...

I'm trying to see the positives out of this, like well I got to the assessment stage of Amazon despite my coming from a no name school and my friends just getting out right rejected. But I'm not really used to this at all."

It went really well actually and the manager said he only has one other interview scheduled as of now. If it stays that way we would likely both get hired but they could get potentially get more interviews. 

I don't want to seem too pushy or something by emailing him. But I want to thank him for meeting with me and reiterate my interest in the job. Also he spoke about my projects on my resume and said they weren't good enough to get a job (but that's alright) and I wanted to ask if a different project would be better for my resume. I normally wouldn't ask this but since we spoke so freely in our meeting I figured it wouldn't be a problem.

The only condition is the references, and since it is mental health the references have to be supervisors that know my work. My job supervisor and both my internship supervisors are very hard to get a hold of and I don't even think they work work for the organizations I worked at anymore.

So where I'm at is 3 weeks post job offer, still waiting for my references to return calls so i can sign my contract. I worry I won't get the job since it's taking so long. I don't have much experience so the job field is limited. Anyone else bogged down by needing specific references?"

It's been a really positive experience but my SO and I would like to move out of state and try living in a  bigger city with more opportunity for growth for both of us. I do plan on practicing leetcode (and can do most easy's, though it takes me a bit if I'm honest) but I'd hate to never be able to find decent work because companies expect me to be able to implement a perfect 2-3-4 tree or merge-sort on the spot.

I'm an IT student working on an Associates pretty close to graduating and I got a few questions to hopefully push me along better

My biggest question is, after this semester is done I will have 1 class left to finish my degree, would it be fine to begin throwing out applications as soon as this semester ends despite being just a hair short of the complete degree? And if yes, how should I ensure my resume reflects that I'm basically there but not quite?

I was also thinking about testing out of the class, but due to the schools graduation application process, I wouldn't even be an official graduate until April/May like the rest of the kids despite being done in January, would I be able to tell jobs I have the degree in the meantime?

Then, once this semester ends I'll be about 6 months deep in an internship with one of the larger healthcare providers in the US. This work is about 30-40% internal call center work (lot of tech support for company staff like nurses and providers) and 60-70% working with internal databases.

The company has told me that it's likely that they'll offer me a full time call center job once the internship is done, but that's not really where I'd like to be. The database side of my internship holds my interests tons more than call center work. Are there any recommendations out there for jobs that are more project based (which is what the database side is like) or hands on problem solving based? Or is this really my only foot in the door for the IT world? I have no issue with tech support, but sitting on the phone 8 hours a day is a bit of a mind numbing experience at times. 

And lastly, I've been told a bit lately that the requirements listed on job postings are pretty loose and usually a product of HR using buzzwords. Is that true? Is it worth it applying to jobs that I clearly cannot meet the requirements for at that time? Such as needing 2 years of experience when I'd only have 6 months?"
drk8hz,3,2019-11-04,Negotiating after accepting a job offer,theseejay,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/drk8hz/negotiating_after_accepting_a_job_offer/,"Howdy everyone,

I‚Äôve been a lurker for awhile but now I need some advice. I‚Äôm finishing up my senior year at college with a degree in CIS with a minor in Data Analytics. Last summer I did an internship with Company A doing Test Automation for their applications and received a job offer with a pretty generous salary, a location I like, and extremely good benefits. At the time I didn‚Äôt really have any other job offers and accepted the offer verbally (through email and over the phone) out of desperation. However, I‚Äôve still been interviewing with other companies since I haven‚Äôt signed a contract, I wouldn‚Äôt start until July 2020, a lot of things can change in 8 months (economy shifts, job availability etc)and I feel like I was lowballed by Company A since I didn‚Äôt have any leverage/other job opportunities. Since then, I‚Äôve had 3 interviews with other really reputable companies that would most likely pay more and have similar benefits. In the event that I do received an offer from the other companies, should I try to negotiate a higher salary with Company A? The only reason I‚Äôd stick with the company I accepted with was because of how much I‚Äôve networked through my internship and would have an easier time moving up. My question is that should I try to negotiate with Company A now that I have leverage even though I‚Äôve verbally accepted or will they get mad an take away my offer? Company A is a mid sized company that has a pretty relaxed culture. 

TL;DR Should I try to negotiate with the company I‚Äôve already verbally accepted an offer with (employment at will) now that I have leverage with other offers?"

drkqeh,4,2019-11-04,What we owe to each other (and what we don't),[deleted],mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/drkqeh/what_we_owe_to_each_other_and_what_we_dont/,"I'm a final year student at uni and I live in a flat with two other students. One of my roommates is genuinely nice but going through a very rough patch, and I've been encouraging her to go to therapy since last year. She always puts it off, saying ""I feel much better after talking to you"" but nothing ever changes. This year has already been incredibly stressful for me as I'm taking very intensive courses and doing an internship; however, I can deal with that. In fact, even though it hasn't been easy, I find it very rewarding. However, my roommate's emotional and mental is is extremely precarious right now. She has these breakdowns in the middle of the night and I've been there for her. I've pushed aside my work to be there for her and yet I feel like she doesn't take any initiative. Although I wake up at 5 am and return to my flat at 11 pm, I'm still lagging behind on my work: I've made excuses to the prof I'm interning with because I haven't been able to keep up with my tasks, I've submitted an assignment late for the first time in my entire life, I didn't do well for an exam I'd studied a lot for, and I go to class in an absolutely zombie-like state. I know I sound like a jerk but in the past five weeks, my life has been my studies, my work, and consoling her. My other roommate and I return home to an environment of constant stress and crying. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells around her, I neglect my needs and even take on her chores because I'm terrified of how she'll react. I haven't had a single day so far where I've done something for myself. I'm not strong; I have mental health problems that I seek therapy for and I've sacrificed a lot to be here.

Last night, when she was having one of these moments, I told her very politely that she needed to be a little more resilient to these little things because this stress was affecting us as well and she literally barked, ""I'll figure it out myself, not that you care"" or something along those lines. I told her that's not what I meant and she snapped back saying ""that's how you made me feel."" At that moment, I snapped. After everything I'd done for her, this was only still about her. Just because I don't have these breakdowns or keep complaining about how stressed I am clearly means that I don't deserve my peace of mind. I have to spend one more year here. I walked out of the apartment because I was genuinely overcome with panic and fury. This exacerbated her issues even more and she went into a panic attack. My other roommate calmed her down and came down to get me because she said that this one was feeling sorry for what she said. I don't what what she said but I pulled myself together and went to console her. After we'd put her to rest, me and my other roommate both burst into tears because we're genuinely scared. This is beyond us. She's already on multiple medications (not related to mental health) and she panics about symptoms, side-effects etc. and we're not doctors. Her health is fragile and we don't know what to do if something happens. I know she's going through a lot but she needs to understand that staying here is only going to make it worse. We called up her parents and they said ""we'll see what the counselor says, maybe we'll take her home"" but at this point, I can't deal with this ""maybe"". In all honesty, it is very serious and I'm not capable of handling this. I'm very scared right now, for all of us. We can't afford to give her the care and attention she requires. I am in a situation where I don't have the option of taking a break if something happens to me; while I'm not a citizen of the country I study in, my family has been living here for a while now and this is my HOME. If I don't do well and get a job, I don't know where I'll go. They've worked very hard and sacrificed a lot for me to be able to pursue my dreams. They've never pressurized me and I know they will support me at all costs but I don't want to let them and myself down after coming this far.  I know I'm only thinking about myself but does my hard-work, my family's efforts, and my mental health have no value? I've been as supportive as I possibly can but at this point, it's beyond me. I can't take this anymore."

Currently, I will only be taking three classes in the first session of the Spring semester (as opposed to the usual four) There‚Äôs a class that‚Äôs not required for my major program but I would like to take. It‚Äôs Intro to Programming with Python. There‚Äôs only three section opened for next Spring/Summer session. One that lands at the same time/day as another *required* class, so that‚Äôs already out. The other one is on a Saturday at 9:15am and last FIVE hours. And last one is during summer session (only six weeks) and is Mon-Thurs from 2:15-4:25. I‚Äôm already taking a class during summer session that is Mon-Thurs 11:45-2, as it‚Äôs required. The issue here is that a five hour Saturday class at 9:15am sounds horrible. Although, I won‚Äôt have classes on Fridays. The issue with the summer class is that if I take two classes during the Summer session, it‚Äôll limit my availability at work. I try to work 20 hours a week and don‚Äôt want to stretch myself too thin while attempting to do both. 

The thing here is that I wanna take this class so I have some sort of knowledge with Python and so it‚Äôll look good for internships (along with the other programming classes I‚Äôll be taking) which my goal by the end of sophomore year. I know I can learn on my own but having a class on it would probably be easier for me to learn.

drlg3i,7,2019-11-04,Summer internship search results as a senior that decided to major in CS pretty late,zeroexposure1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/drlg3i/summer_internship_search_results_as_a_senior_that/,"Just some background, I'm a senior right now and decided to graduate in December 2020 so I can get an internship this summer. I was originally an Economics major and math minor, but decided to double major in CS/Econ at the end of my junior year. I haven't taken any upper level CS courses, just data structures and algorithms, but I have practiced Leetcode (70 easy, 40 medium).

No previous work experience related to CS.

Previous Projects: A full stack web-app related to language learning, some simple Python packages, portfolio website.

School: Large well-known university on the east coat (CS department is nothing special imo)

GPA: 3.73/4

Applications: 109

Total Rejections: 34 (rejected from companies like Airbnb, MongoDB, Citadel, IMC, Akuna, etc.)

Coding Challenges Received: about 15 (failed most of them)

Offers: 2 (large investment bank in NYC and big rainforest company)

I think I was getting responses and coding challenges from several trading firms and banks because of my Econ major but who knows. I found trading firms to have the hardest coding challenges and was only able to pass IMC's. I was ghosted by all of FAANG except for one lol and outright rejected by many other companies I would've loved to work at (Airbnb, Flatiron, etc). 

Even if you think your data structures and algo skills lacking, make sure you take full advantage of any on-campus recruiting offered by your school (this was how I got the bank offer, no superday, just a single 45 minute interview at university's career center with freebie questions). Also, in my experience, once you're at the phone screen or in-person stage, behavioral skills and clear communication can definitely make up for technical skills. 

Lastly, whenever I was being interviewed by an engineer, at the end when it's time to ask the interviewer questions, I always asked questions about their personal experience at the company rather than general questions about the intern program or whatever. People like to talk about themselves, so if the interviewer likes their job and you show genuine interest in them personally, chances are they'll be in a much better mood after talking about their work."

I am planning on applying to around 8-10 schools, however. While my major is in Materials Engineering, I have mostly done my research in CS and most of my work for the last 2 years has been under this advisor.  Since I want to continue working in a similar area in grad school, his LOR would be pretty important imo, especially since I am changing majors too. So, what do I do for my LORs in other schools? I have a pretty strong application other than that and while other profs and my internship mentor have agreed to give me a strong LOR, I am worried that a lack of an LOR from my advisor would be a potential red flag or would not adequately communicate the extent of research I did in my field of interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I am applying for an MS in CS for Fall 2020, if that helps. Any suggestions are welcome.

drn1tx,97,2019-11-04,I don't feel any love for my parents at all. Am I a terrible person? (Serious answers only),WellFuckMe1234,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/drn1tx/i_dont_feel_any_love_for_my_parents_at_all_am_i_a/,"I have parents who are judgmental, overbearing, and lacking in emotional empathy and support. They provided me materially and made sure I got good grades but it was never in a positive manner. For example, I was called ""stupid"" all the time, compared to my brother for not being as ""smart"" as him, and treated as though I were less capable.

My dad especially is not a warm person at all. He as an obsession with status, grades, and looks down on anyone he sees as incapable or not doing anything useful. For example, when he was driving a friend and I, the only things he asked are, what major she is, whether she has done any internships, etc... And then she told me my dad seems like a cold person. He has barely showed any affection at all. Even today, every time he calls or messages, I feel anxiety because I'm used to him getting angry all the time.

As for my mother, I should show some sympathy but unfortunately, I don't. She is a stay at home mom and she is subject to my dad's behavior even more. He has a habit of putting her down and calling her useless. She also has a father who doesn't recognize her as a daughter, yet she still wants to reach out for many years despite him never initiating contact as well. This will sound bad but I look down on her for not having the self esteem to cut contact. She is also an enabler of my dad but I suppose she can't help it given her dependency. I'm conflicted as to how I should feel about her. She is an overprotective parent, intrusive, and also minimizes the way I feel at times calling me ""too sensitive"". The last time I talked to her, she told me I should call more because the nest is now empty and she is lonely. I can see her point of view but on the other hand, I just feel pretty indifferent to my entire family. Calling her more often would be against my will and quite frankly, I still hold a grudge so I won't budge on my position.

I talked about this with a friend and I have to agree that my parents probably did try their best. We were poor growing up and there was a lot of stress growing up. Yet, I still cannot shake holding a grudge on them still. I'm still resentful that I wasn't happy most of my childhood. I spoke to a therapist about this and she says I'm not required to forgive. If I do, it's more to feel better myself than it is for them. I absolutely can't forgive them still and I have accepted that it is what it is. My friend is in a similar position and says there are certain things he won't do with family like traveling and I will enforce those boundaries as well.

Every time, I visit home (which is once a year), all I do is nod my head and be polite for a week. Then I go back home to my own ways once I get back. My therapist said I'm not really living authentically and suggested maybe I tell them how I feel to get it off my chest. I really have nothing to lose since I wouldn't care if they disown me yet this feels daunting to actually do.

If you read all of this, thank you for reading. It's a long rant/vent. I'd like to know your thoughts on this situation.

TL;DR: My parents were never emotionally supportive and put me down so I hold a grudge on them. I can't really let go and don't feel any love for them. Am I a terrible person? Btw, I'm 26F. I've been out of the house for a while now so I don't think how I feel is going to change anytime soon."

Currently, I will only be taking three classes in the first session of the Spring semester (as opposed to the usual four) There‚Äôs a class that‚Äôs not required for my major program but I would like to take. It‚Äôs Intro to Programming with Python. There‚Äôs only three section opened for next Spring/Summer session. One that lands at the same time/day as another *required* class, so that‚Äôs already out. The other one is on a Saturday at 9:15am and last FIVE hours. And last one is during summer session (only six weeks) and is Mon-Thurs from 2:15-4:25. I‚Äôm already taking a class during summer session that is Mon-Thurs 11:45-2, as it‚Äôs required. The issue here is that a five hour Saturday class at 9:15am sounds horrible. Although, I won‚Äôt have classes on Fridays. The issue with the summer class is that if I take two classes during the Summer session, it‚Äôll limit my availability at work. I try to work 20 hours a week and don‚Äôt want to stretch myself too thin while attempting to do both. 

The thing here is that I wanna take this class so I have some sort of knowledge with Python and so it‚Äôll look good for internships (along with the other programming classes I‚Äôll be taking) which my goal by the end of sophomore year. I know I can learn on my own but having a class on it would probably be easier for me to learn. 

Any advice?"
drnk15,1,2019-11-04,Applying for my first job and feeling like I don't deserve any,marrecar,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/drnk15/applying_for_my_first_job_and_feeling_like_i_dont/,"I recently graduate from University. My studies were very time consuming, most of the 8 semesters I had classes and lab practice the whole day (some days 8am-8pm or 8am-6pm etc), so I didn't exactly have much time to get an internship or a part time job. Therefore, I literally don't have any work experience, aside from a small internship in an external laboratory that was mandatory to finish the studies and graduate. Now I have enrolled in Master studies in a different country, but won't be starting the studies in months. So, I decided to try getting a job in that country, mainly because I have planned to move there and start living, and getting a job would be one of the ways to do that.

So, I wrote my r√©sum√© and will write cover letters for the jobs I will apply. But, my worry is that, if I would eventually get a job, I won't do very good. Even though I was a great student and graduated without failing a single final exam, and in time, I somehow don't feel confident in my knowledge. I feel like, if my employer would ask me a basic question regarding my job and the actual thing I graduated on, I would blank out or get the wrong answer. And that I would do the whole job badly. I feel that the cause of this is partially because of my lack of work experience, but even self confidence. One day, I was writing my r√©sum√© with my friend and at one point I got sad and bummed, my confidence level went below zero and I felt like I am incapable of doing any kind of job and that no one will ever hire me and that I will never earn any experience. And I basically ruined mine and my friend's whole day because I was so negative the whole time. I feel like, if I made those mistakes at work, I would feel embarrassed, ashamed, and then I would get fired.

I googled, before writing here, and saw some kind of Imposter syndrome, but I'm not sure if that applies to me. It probably is applied to me too and I'm just denying it lmao. I literally don't have any kind of work experience, never worked in my life.

Is this a normal kind of feeling? Especially for us newcomers, recent graduates who are about to embark into real life.

Thanks guys!"
droz7b,2,2019-11-04,Continue at same company or move for internship,-Lousy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/droz7b/continue_at_same_company_or_move_for_internship/,"I worked full time for a small early-ish stage startup for 4 months this last summer, and have been working for them part time since my new school semester started. It being a startup I have near ownership of a large part of their products back end, and I find the work really rewarding. I can also work from wherever (they allow fully remote), so I plan to travel again while I work. I'm more than likely going to be offered another internship here next summer. The job here is machine learning engineer.

However, I will also most likely be offered an internship at a mid size bank in a larger city doing work on smaller projects. New team, different culture, less flexibility. Job here would be data scientist. 

 This would be my 5th 4 month internship (including research jobs), so it might be better to have a longer stint on the resume because my previous job was only 8 months long. I go to a low tier US School for Computer Eng (so I'm relying on job experience to be seen), and I'm one year from graduating.

My questions: 

Do I go with a startup where I can have more impact, more flexibility and learn more about starting a company (something I eventually want to do), or do I got with the big bank for brand recognition and a safer career path forward?

Does working at the same company for longer (the startup) look better on a resume than switching between jobs often during internships?

Does any of this actually matter? Like am I stressing over nothing?"

I‚Äôve heard amazing things about Stripe and its culture, and I also think their product has a lot of potential. It also seems like they are about to IPO very soon, so I feel like Stripe would be a pretty good and safe option. 

However I‚Äôm also really interested in Databricks for the types of work they do. I feel like I will get the experience and work with the types of people at Databricks that I couldn‚Äôt at Stripe. I think their product also has a lot of potential but at the same time I‚Äôve heard mixed things about their outlook and culture.

For the bigN company, I think it would be a really good place to kick off full time career. However I‚Äôm not too sure if I liked the culture that much, and I feel like starting at Stripe fresh out of university will be equally as good.

But I‚Äôve been concurrently working in both IT roles (at my University as Deskside support) and working at a local cybersecurity startup company (as a Security Analyst, still working here) for roughly 3 years combined. Over the Summer, I also got the chance to intern at a big tech company doing some pen-testing/Offensive Security type work. This is all because I‚Äôve been interested in InfoSec since high school and have done whatever I could to get practical experience as early as possible.

Additionally, I am hoping to get at least a cert like the Sec + once graduated to supplement my experience and check off HR boxes on some job applications.

Basically, what I am asking is, with your experiences and knowledge of the industry, what should I expect to see as a salary in the US based on my gpa, work experience and overall field of interest?

And a bonus question is if you believe that I have any bargaining power when it comes to salaries or if I should just accept the first job with the highest offer?

drt7a3,5,2019-11-04,I am 35 year old Top MBA graduate and unemployed since graduation and struggling to land a job. What should I do?,bk19xsa,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/drt7a3/i_am_35_year_old_top_mba_graduate_and_unemployed/,"Hi,

I request urgent guidance as I am finding it extremely challenging to get a job. There's also a Tl;dr down below.

My story and situation:

I am a Full Time MBA graduate from one of the Southern Ivies in USA and graduated this year in May. I am 35 and an International student of South East Asian origin with an extensive (8 years) work background in Middle East. Most of my work was in Sales, Business Development and Project Management . I worked for one of the biggest conglomerates in Middle East and prior to my MBA I was working as a Business Development Manager for a small construction and engineering firm in Middle East. My undergraduate degree is in Computer Engineering and I did it from Canada and Middle East.

By my 6th work year I wanted to do a big career switch. I had a passion for Media and Film and planned to do my MBA in Media Management. I got a 98-99th percentile GMAT score and decided to apply to the two best MBA universities in USA that cater to Media Management. I tried hard but could not get into both of them and then I changed my mindset and after some advice from my professional network and my own analysis, I decided to pursue MBA for Investment Banking. Additionally, I was hopeful that an MBA would also allow me to see what else might be out there and how I can make a career switch. Lastly, I hoped an MBA from a good university would add more brand value and weight to my resume, especially compared to my undergraduate school. I wanted to end up at a post MBA level at least at the same, if not higher, career level as my peers.

I got into a school with a full tuition scholarship. It had a nice track record for Investment Banking (20% of the class). I thought it was relatively good fit. As soon as I started, I was struck with a major personal issue that caused me a lot of strife. On top of that, I came to know that no International student from the school had been hired into banking for the past 5 years. Nevertheless, I pushed hard for Investment Banking. But by the mid of the first semester, because of my personal issue, things spiraled out of control and it was either maintaining pursuit for IB or maintaining grades for continued scholarship. Eventually, I focused on my grades and lost out on interviews for IB.
I was also advised to pursue Consulting but since the recruitment happens at the same time as IB, I couldn't. In the
Second semester I just focused on my grades as I did not want to risk my scholarship again. In the Summer I took a Strategy internship in a education firm which was a non-profit.

As I did not get an IB Internship, I reluctantly gave up on that dream. In the last two semesters of my MBA, I took lots of strategy courses and tried improving my GPA as much as possible. Towards the end of the program, I built my resume again , and started networking full fledged for Strategy positions. Most of the companies that visited campus had already finished hiring in the 3rd semester and therefore there wasn't much recruiting in the 4th semester.

After graduation, I had to wait 4 months to receive my 1 year work permit, which is given to International MBA students. In the meantime, I revamped my resume again, updated my LinkedIn and applied to many other places with very specific and well catered resumes. I ensured that all my resumes for any job application will pass the ATS system. I networked with the lead recruiters of the companies I was applying to.

Unfortunately most companies did not sponsor an International MBA. Plus my school was not as big as a brand as the top 7 (M7) or Top 10 MBA schools. So there were very few interviews.

I then focused my energy towards companies that only sponsored or positions in Middle East. However, getting an interview itself is a big hurdle and a very slow process. Unlike recruitment on campus, I am an external candidate now. That means I compete against a very large number of job applicants.

Another issue is that I do not know how should I distribute my time or what should I focus on? Beggars cannot be choosers, so I can't even neglect any potential opportunity for me, regardless of industry or job function.
For example, should I only focus on consulting? I have not worked in consulting and neither did I do my internship in consulting. This means that I have to spend an unbelievable amount of time on networking, research, case interview prep, studying consulting books, revising management theories and learning strategy models.

You, the reader, might ask why would I like consulting if it is so challenging for me to get in. Few things:
1.	I know I can do it and do it well. I have some very strong consulting soft skills such as client relationship, communication and presentation, building business from ground up, leadership and managing cross functional teams, solving complex issues, working long and under pressure and some decent hard skills such as business analysis, market research and variety of software. I can get stuff done for the client.
2.	I am 35 and I want to be at least on a level that personally satisfies me. I was a bright kid and usually the top of my group but during undergrad I fell behind my peers. Now, I am already 5 years behind 30 year olds who, post MBA, are in Consulting, Investment Banking and other Fortune 200s. Consulting, even at Big 4, gives me that kind of brand image, job prestige and financial security level.
3.	This is the only chance I have to get into it otherwise I can't make a lateral shift later in my career.
4.	I will get to at least work with some smart people and successful clients. It will be an invaluable learning and growth experience.
5.	Even though I want to be long term in it, the exit ops of consulting are also good. The network made will help you lifelong.
Or should I cast a wide net? I have applied for Business Development and Product Management roles but so far have had no luck. Additionally, I am over qualified for some of the jobs or those jobs are mostly a career stagnation for me.

Initially, I wanted the US experience but because of the visa issues, my previous experience in the ME and my gf being in Middle East, I am now very much inclined to work there. However, I am still in the US. I am trying my best to reach out to recruiters and network from here but so far things have moved very slow. There has not been any official interview there. Therefore, I do not know whether I should completely forget about the US and just focus on Middle East.
I am lost. I have run out of money and despite my scholarship, I have student debt that covered my non tuition expenses. I need guidance. I need help, evaluating my profile and knowing how I can achieve my goals.

TL;dr: 8 yrs Sales/BD/PM prior MBA work experience in Middle East. Went to Southern US to school for MBA and graduated in May of this year. Jobless since then. During MBA, recruited for IB. Had major personal problem and IB didn't workout . Cost me key recruiting time as well as grades. Focused more on improving grades in following semesters. Shifted recruiting focus to strategy/consulting by end of MBA. Post MBA things have moved very slow and getting interviews is the biggest hurdle as an External/Non Campus hire as well as being an International Student. Want job brand, prestige and financial status equivalent to 30 year old top school MBAs. Do not know what should I focus on? Consulting or Buss Development? US or Middle East? How should I go about it? In debt and struggling. Need urgent help."

I'm not someone who has every considered entering banking, and would really like to make use of my C.S. minor to work in tech. However, the internship pays very well and the company has very large name recognition. I'm just wondering if working there over the summer will make it very difficult to find full-time jobs outside of banking? If anyone has any experiences with this that would be great.

I've been working on a project for the past few months that I think you guys might like. It's a video full of advice for Computer Science students that are just about to take their first Internship. I at least didn't hear this advice¬†and I want to share¬†it with all of you.

[Link to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGDrIqClUZA)

It covers stuff like ""Professional Developers"", Travel, and User Stories.

I sent a message to the mods asking if I can make this post a few days ago since it technically counts as advertising. I think I should make this post because it promotes discussion and might have some advice that hasn't been shared on this Reddit before. I should also mention that I'm new to Reddit and this subreddit so I don't know if this kind of stuff is allowed.

This was my first attempt at making a nice video. I've done some videos in the past but they were always stuff for classes and they were never something that I wanted to make on my own. I'm pretty proud of it but I'm sure that there are things that I messed up. I just don't see them anymore since I've worked on it for so long. Let me know if you like or dislike any of the lessons or if you have any advice on editing.

The systems administrator had to support a network with over 1000 devices on it and over 1500 users.  He came up with the idea of selecting a group of students to assist him.  We didn't get a wage but we did learn valuable skills in IT and this in turn has turned into an almost 30 year career for myself.

The following takes place in 1990.  A little background on the network setup.  We had recently upgraded from 3Com's 3+Open Network Operating System to Novell Netware 3.0.  The servers were all 3Com 3Server's and were connected using BNC Coax connection's and connected to the school districts mainframe via a dedicated frame relay.

One day, we get a call from a guidance counselor that her printer had stopped working.  We had been diagnosing some connection problems between some of the servers and the mainframe.  Since the printers were all connected to dedicated workstations/servers we thought maybe her server was experiencing connection problems.

The system administrator and I go down to her office and before our eyes we see smoke coming out of the printer, a plant hanging above the printer and water dripping down from the plant into said printer.  We informed her that she should move her plant and that we would get her a new one.

We retrieve a new printer from our office and bring it back down to her office.  Just as we are entering her office, we see her in the process of rehanging her plant, ABOVE THE SERVER!!!  ""STOP!!!"", shout's the systems administrator.  ""Water and electronics do not mix, your printer is dead because you got water in it from watering your plant.  You need to put your plant somewhere else.""  The systems administrator suggested a few safe places in her office.  Luckily for us, she chose one of those safe places.

It was this day that I learned some people are extremely dense when it comes to common sense and diagnosing cause and effect."

ds1xh7,1,2019-11-05,Legal options to get money back from for-profit school that screwed me over,drunk_funky_chipmunk,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ds1xh7/legal_options_to_get_money_back_from_forprofit/,"So this happened about three years ago, therefore I am not sure if there is anything I can do about it, but I would love some legal advice. 

	I decided to pursue an Art MFA program in a well-known (world renowned) and very expensive school in Georgia. At the time when I first applied, I wanted to be an Animator, so the program I applied too was an MFA Animation program. After the first trimester, I realized it was not for me, and applied to switch out of Animation and move into something more closely related to fine art, which is my background (and more aligned to my passion). So I applied to their MFA Illustration program and was accepted. The MFA Illustration program is a \*two year program, however because of how intense the workload is, basically no one graduates within two years. 

Anyway, to graduate from this program you need to present a thesis proposal, just a proposal (not even an actual thesis project) that needs to be accepted by a group of reviewers who happen to be Professors within the program. You only have two chances to pass this review, and if you fail both times you are kicked out of the program. This is where I need advice. 

For my first review, my housing was not finished so I was living out of a hotel. I received an email about two weeks prior to the review that I was in-fact scheduled to present my proposal. The week of the proposal comes and there is a hurricane warning and everyone has to leave the city. So I trekked far into Georgia and found a hotel to stay in for the next few days until I could return.  When I returned, I really did not feel comfortable going to this review since I only had two weeks to prepare a proposal and show all of my work up to this point. So I scheduled an interview with the Professor who leads the board of reviews and told him, that I need more time, and that I am not ready to present anything. He literally told me how ‚Äúunprofessional this was, and that this is a grad school. And that he sent out an email months ago during the spring trimester to everyone who would be presenting in the fall.‚Äù However, because I switched in-between two different programs, I was never on his email list. So I walked out of his office frustrated but determined to pass at my first attempt. Of course I failed, being told that my idea was too popular and would never work. Then the Professors told me their advice as to what they believe I should focus on for my next proposal. Here is where we both messed up.

I should have been taking notes per their advice, however because I failed I could not concentrate. Secondly, they were supposed to send out an email to me with all of their notes, as to how I should prepare/be ready to present for my second and final proposal. Which of course I never got. I only learned they were supposed to send this out after I had failed my second time proposing, and was kicked out of the program. I understand it was grad school, and I should have reached out to them, but it feels like they really missed the mark here with me. And I was out of the loop more than I should have been. In addition, I had completed 85% of the program up to this point, holding around a 3.4 GPA the whole time while working 25 hours a week as a server. So if my work was quality enough to pass every class, literally the only classes I had left were 3 courses. 

1)	The thesis class. Yes, you have to present a thesis proposal, prior to taking this course.

2-3)	Either two TA position‚Äôs or 2 internships

That was literally it, I had completed the whole program with those three exceptions (as well as the three courses I was currently enrolled in). Which I was planning on taking the thesis class and a TA position in the same following trimester, and then finishing off with an Internship after that. I really don't understand how I got kicked out from failing a proposal when I had successfully completed all the other work for the program with good grades.

I understand that I only had two chances to pass this ‚Äúproposal‚Äù, however I just feel like I was robbed from a degree I owe a lot of money for. As a result of a ‚Äúproposal‚Äù, not even the actual thesis (which I could see getting kicked out of school for) that I even went to the head of the proposal committee and said I was not ready, and he just laughed me out of his office. The worst part, is that another student said the same thing to him the following trimester and he pushed her first proposal back. So on just about every step it seems I was glanced over, not taken seriously, and that the professor did not do his job. Also, I never signed anything stating I was ok with having two chances to pass this proposal, I had only heard about it from other students in the program, not even from this professor himself. It also turns out that after I had been kicked out of the program, he resigned that position. 

	After I was kicked out of the program, I still had a few weeks left to continue to going to the classes I was paying for. At one of these classes, my professor (who was part of my panel) asked me to step outside and spoke with me. He asked me ‚Äúwhy I was still in class, and my time would be better spent elsewhere‚Äù. I had all the right to finish those three classes I was taking, but needless to say I dropped out the next day because of how pissed off that comment made me. Because I did not finish the class (because the professor essentially told me to stop coming), my student aid for those classes was revoked and I had to pay the full amount for those classes out of pocket. I did not know this would happen and only stopped going because that professor made me think I shouldn't. 

And now I am in crippling debt with no degree. I was just wondering if there are any legal ramifications I can take against this program/school? None of the courses count anywhere else in the school, so to transfer into another program would mean I would have to start all over again because most schools only allow you to transfer so many credits. 

**TDLR;** I failed a proposal (how do you fail a proposal?) and was kicked out of a master's program I was almost finished completed, and am now is tens of thousands of additional debt (on top of undergrad), with no degree. This for-profit school failed to prepare me for proposal presentations and I am wondering if i can take legal steps to collect money to pay back the financial aid I owe for the program."

Recently, I received an offer from a small start up company in NJ as a Machine Learning Engineer- they offered me 60k/year with no equity, no stock, and no sign-on bonus or whatsoever. I was told that because the work site is crowded right now, that I should be working remotely (There are few other machine learning engineers that work remote)

I flat out told them there is a gap between what they offered and what I am looking for, which is the average software engineer's salary around the area. However, HR is insisting that this is the average salary for software engineer with my experience. As Glassdoor suggests 85k, and payscale 89k, I was going to ask them how they got to that average number, but I didn't want to sound arrogant.

Currently, I am in the process of interviewing with one other company in Georgia, but I am not sure how that is going to turn out. I will do my best but assuming that I don't get an offer, should I just accept the 60k offer?

I feel like the gap between my graduation and now is making it harder for me to get a decent offer. How would you guys negotiate if you were in my position?"

I graduated May,18th with a Bachelor's degree. My fields of study were:

* Business
* Marketing
* Communications

I have a great resume with work experiences along with *volunteer*, *internships*, and *extra curricular activities* listed. 

I have been searching and applying what feels like all of Zip Recruiter, Indeed, and LinkedIn, with only 1 interview for a sales job that was falsely advertised. I realize it takes a while for companies to get back with you, however i'm not sure where else to start looking.

I have been applying to marketing jobs, social media marketing, property management, recruiting/HR, administration/assistant.

I'm beginning to feel hopeless at this point that I haven't found anything, and frustrated that I went through four years of college for nothing.

With my degree what other jobs should I be searching up? At this point I'd be willing to take anything, and if I could even land something part time that would be amazing. 

I have had ***several*** professionals look at my resume (including recruiters/HR) so I'm not worried about tweaking anything on it, as that can't be the issue. At this point I just want to land ***anything.***

ds2l0t,1,2019-11-05,Advice for my friend who is hindered by financial problems,turboboost2020,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ds2l0t/advice_for_my_friend_who_is_hindered_by_financial/,"Hi everyone,

My friend from college, who used to be driven with a goal in mind, has now lost all his motivation. Please bear with this story after this - I met my friend in my undergrad while helping with a project and I became good friends with him after that. We had similar interests in pursuing our goals and building a venture of our own in the near future. We committed our time during the final year to work on developing an electronic product for a local manufacturing company.  Both him and I shelled out money even though it was him who supported the project financially to a larger extent and I was mostly involved in development and testing (Field Testing was always done by both of us). In short, we drove it to completion, but the company couldn't accept it because the BOM was too expensive compared to its Chinese counterpart. The project was a failure also because of the fact that we took too long to finish it. This ended around 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

Following this, we tried our hands in a lot of other projects, but couldn't go past the development stage due to reasons like time and money (both of us were working to support our families) and also partly due to the reason that we couldn't get reliable interns to work. Amidst this, my friend thought of taking a break and applying for higher studies while I decided to improve my career in my day-job.

&amp;#x200B;

He got an admit from one of the top universities in product development and techno-management and was the first to get the admit among all applicants and I was immensely happy that he may get to pursue his dreams. But it all came crashing down as he couldn't procure a student loan due to financial instability in his family(there were no scholarship options available for international students for the program he wanted to pursue). With work too tiring (almost 16 hours/day), and almost non-existent options for a higher degree, my friend broke down in a spiraling depression as he couldn't prioritize his career goals over his family conditions. So he decided to solve problems by switching jobs to support his family for a few years.

&amp;#x200B;

As a friend who has been trying to help him all these years, it pains my heart to see that he has now abandoned his dreams at building his own company and pursuing higher education (which could potentially help him in his future venture). Of course, he could start after a few years, but I feel he might always regret his current decision. Also, I am not the one to dictate what he should do with his life, as that may seem like manipulation and reeks of personal gain. But as a friend, I am obliged to tell him the truth that life is supposed to be hard, and that you should never give up your dreams for anything, and also at the same time I should help him arrive at a pragmatic decision.

&amp;#x200B;

My question for fellow Redditors is that,

1. How do I motivate my friend to his older self again?
2. What advice would you give my friend? (and possibly me as well)

Thank you for your time and responses. I apologize for any inconsistencies in grammar, text formatting and for the long read."
ds2pjg,2,2019-11-05,What‚Äôs it like to be an Aerospace Engineer?,WhatForWork,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/ds2pjg/whats_it_like_to_be_an_aerospace_engineer/,"Hey, Jeremy here from [whatforwork.com](https://whatforwork.com/jobs) with another interview.

Today‚Äôs interview is with an Aerospace Engineer.

**What Do People Think You Do?**

When people hear I'm an aerospace engineer the first questions they tend to ask are ""Have you been to space?"" or ""Are you an astronaut?"". While working with space projects is part of the job, an aerospace engineer is actually qualified to do a whole lot more, including work that is entirely outside aerospace but uses the skillset we build in college. Because aerospace engineering is a multi-disciplinary field, you can actually find a variety of positions available. Another misconception is that as an aerospace engineer you must be a designer of some sort - this isn't always the case either. As an aerospace engineer you can take on work in design, but also areas such as manufacturing, business operations, project management and a host of other options. It's a truly open field when you have a basis in aerospace engineering.

**What Do You Really Do?**

At the moment, I work in Mission Operations for NASA through a prime contractor, performing work onboard a flying telescope. This mission involves an airplane that has been outfitted with a large telescope that flies above clouds and moisture to see the best images of the universe in infrared light. Most people who work in this role are astronomers, but my background in aerospace engineering and specifically mission operations helped me a ton in getting here. Prior to this job I worked as an Aerospace Engineer for a number of rocket launch companies, where we were responsible for delivering other companies satellites to space. In these positions I worked in both Systems Engineering and in Program Management. As a Systems Engineer, you put your aerospace engineering knowledge to work in your ability to integrate various types of information from multiple engineers areas - such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and even software engineering. Being an Aerospace Engineer in a Systems Engineering role is all about integrating information. This is also why being an Aerospace Engineer sets you up for positions like Program Management - you are already familiar with many aspects of a project, but now are not only integrating technical information, but business information as well.

**A Day In The Life**

In my current role at NASA, a day in the life of my job starts with getting a handle on what's happened in the last 24 hours. Most of this is done via e-mail, but we also have real time meetings to discuss what has happened with the aircraft and telescope on a daily basis. I work with my colleagues, who operate the telescope and the science instruments that fly with it, on what our plans are for the next flight or the one that just occurred. We also plan for missions that may be happening in the future weeks or months as well. After a day of planning, those who are going to be flying with the telescope on a given night will report to work to get briefed on this information. We rotate who flies so as to avoid getting too tired when conducting critical flight operations. The flight crew will conduct their own review of the evening's flight and once they are ready, they head out to the airplane. From there, the mission operations crew (which includes myself) will take our positions at consoles on the airplane. This is sort of like working in NASA Mission Control like you see on tv, but instead of being on the ground, we're flying onboard the vehicle - a flying observatory. Once the flight begins, we closely monitor system health of both the airplane systems and the telescope, and work together as a mission operations team to ensure we can execute the planned observations for the night. It's a lot of fun and puts my ""integration"" knowledge as an aerospace engineer to work.

**What's The Average Income?**

The average income for an aerospace engineer varies with experience. Starting engineers may make $70,000-$80,000 USD nowadays, but depending on their career path aerospace engineers can make well over $150,000 USD per year with 10-15 years experience.

**What Education If Any Is Needed?**

The best way to be an aerospace engineer - is to get an aerospace engineering degree to start! The interesting thing is a lot of your experience you learn on the job will really be what sets you up for future opportunities in your career. A bachelors degree is an excellent foundation, followed by or done in concert with internships or co-op work experiences. After graduation, if you intend to become a specialist, graduate education is a very good idea. However, if you wish to remain a generalist - and work in a role such as mission operations or launch integration, like I have, then gaining more practical work experience is probably the best path possible. In this modern age, don't be afraid to try different jobs and build a variety of experience - an engineer with 2-3 years of experience in a variety of different roles will be a very attractive candidate for integration or project management roles down the line, due to their diverse knowledge. Someone who is interested in this can get into the field by looking into a school that meets their interest area. If you love airplanes, find an aerospace engineering program with an aeronautics concentration. If you love space, find one with a space engineering curriculum or with a history of landing interns at NASA or other space organizations.

**Something Important To Know**

The most important thing is that although it's hard, it is one of the most rewarding, incredible professions to work in. You will be exposed to cutting edge hardware and missions. You will have stories to tell friends and family for years to come. There are jobs available and they are actually growing in number with a recent rise in aerospace activity in the US.

I want to pursue a PhD in Comp Sci but have no Comp Sci degree, but I have 6 years of programming experience and all my research is Comp Sci based. With my unique background and current stats I don't know if I have a chance to go to a top school, see list of schools below.

If anyone is willing to send me some advice it would be much appreciated.

I have not taken the GRE, and I do not know if I should take it and expand my list. I am happy with the current list and have found professors that work in areas i want to work in.

Masters: University of Ottawa - Biomedical Engineering GPA=4.0

Awards: 4 prestigious Canadian undergraduate and graduate awards/scholarships + other awards (total 9).

SOP - Will focus on moving my research towards computer vision and learning, and their application towards healthcare. 

Possible List of Schools:
MIT Media Lab
Harvard
Standford
UofT Comp Sci
Brown

Work Experience:
2 Years Teaching Assistant at Uni

LOR:
2 Professors who directly supervised my research
1 Professor who I TA'd for, and also taught me and supervised some projects
I helped write the LOR so they are strong.

Research Experience:
6 years of experience
 - 4 years research experience with current supervisor (All CS/Programming based)
 - 1 Summer international research internship (Switzerland)
 - 1 year wet-lab experience

Publications:
3 Conference Publications (not international, Canadian conferences), 
1 Publication currently submitted to International Conference (could be two submissions depending on deadline to apply)

My only real question is, am I being realistic or should I be going back to the drawing board, writing the GRE, and making a new list of schools? Has anyone had experience going into CS without a CS degree?

Advice is greatly appreciated, as I am lost on if my choice is right."

I'm on a small team there and we talk like I'm going to work for them after school.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not in love with it anymore and I have worked really hard to put myself through school and have ended up (in a surprising twist, to me) being one of the top students in my major. The thing is, I *think* I could get an internship anywhere I wanted for next year, but I do not know the professional approach to trying for this.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I put out applications without letting my current boss know? If I let my boss know, it would certainly cause tension, and then it would be a real waste if I didn't even get the internship I really want. Additionally, is it OK to put out applications for next summer even though I already accept my current companies summer internship? I would cancel the current internship if I got the one I want. The thing is, I don't wanna be rude or let people down, but we live in a cruel world lol, if I cancel my current internship and don't get the new one then I am dead."

I'm a Computer Engineering student at University of Waterloo, just finishing up my 2B term. Contrary to what this sub makes Waterloo sound like, I haven't gotten an internship at the valley. I've done three co-ops, two of them being dev internships now moving onto a SWE internship, but they're all in/have been in the Waterloo/Kitchener area. 

I see a lot of people get internships in the valley, not just on the internet, but people from my class as well. The one thing in common I notice about people that go to the valley tho is that they have an insane portfolio, or they attend hackathons, they do this, they do that etc. 

I'm not like that. I think I'm a good programmer, I have a couple side projects, my grades aren't horrible, but I don't get insane internships. What I'm asking is, do I HAVE to become someone that does go to all of these hackathons, someone who does create an insane portfolio, someone who does seem like they try hard to put themselves out there? Or is it possible for me to just be me and still get an internship in the valley?

Maybe this is more of a rant rather than a question, because I know the answer is that I have to be someone slightly like that, but with how difficult my program is for me, I wish there was still a way for the non top percentile people to still get an internship that's remotely nice"

I'm scared, and feel unprepared.",HaydenKell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ds87vy/i_landed_an_internship_this_upcoming_summer_i/,"Hey, guys. So here's the story:

I had to attend a stem career fair for one of my intro classes; it was huge. I went with the intention of figuring out how career fairs work, maybe put my impoverished resume out there a little bit, learn some stuff.

To prepare, I chose a couple companies and wrote down their location, what they do, and if they are freshman friendly. I went to one table, the table of the company that just hired me, and seemed to leave a good impression. Maybe they were so shocked I didnt lead with ""so what do you guys do?"" And instead just jumped right into it. I gave the guy my resume, shook hands, and left the fair. 

A couple weeks later I'm sitting in class, and I get a text. ""Hi, Hayden, I'm blah blah blah, head of recruiting here at COMPANY-X. I'd love to chat with you if you had a moment."" I was blown away. Long story short, the interview process moved along smoothly, and I was offered a job. Here's why I'm terrified. 

I am a FRESHMAN CSC STUDENT. Before college, my programming knowledge went as far as dipping my toes into codecademy. I'm still fighting to figure out python. I'm battling this huge weight of imposter syndrome and I dont know what to do. Should I be here? Why do I deserve this? I dont know what the hell makes me qualified to work for this place. 

What I'm looking for is someone to talk to me about the way I'm feeling; someone who has been there, or close. Do they understand I'm basically a fetus? Did I get the job because of my personality? Someone help.

TL; DR:
I got a summer internship after I had been at school for less than a month. No real world csc experience beyond playing with arduino, which was also for less than a month. All of my resume was current things I'm learning and experimenting with. I feel unprepared and unworthy."

ds93ne,11,2019-11-05,How much struggling is reasonable for a new grad? - Story inside,noobgrad42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ds93ne/how_much_struggling_is_reasonable_for_a_new_grad/,"Hi all. New grad here, a few months into my first job in SF. Not at a FAANG, but its SF so people here are still pretty talented and competition is pretty fierce. Not the kind of place where I can coast, even though its a generic F500 company. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short:

* I'm not fully focused at work. I check Reddit more than I should, and generally I struggle with focusing for a decent chunk of time. I find I can focus best at home with an energy drink in my system. Even then, though, it comes and goes. If I'm not in the zone, its hard to really get stuff done. 
* I work decently late / I will work when I get home. 
* I'll spend a few hours on the weekend working and honestly haven't gone out much recently. I need to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I really struggle with understanding the larger picture. I can do a ticket and figure out what it entails for the most part. I'm not having issues writing actual code. I understand the language I use, albeit not as much as I could I guess. Its just that - Honest to God - My critical thinking skills just aren't amazing. I feel stupid at work. Truly. I'm surrounded by incredible engineers and I'm a moron who bs'd his way into an SF tech company from a garbage rural school. 

I can't make connections most people can make. I can write code, I can decently write clean code, I don't submit garbage for a PR. I don't get negative comments on PRs (some feedback from senior devs), I write tests, I do all that stuff. I'm okay.   


Its just that things that should be obvious, things that any person who can legitimately think outside of the bubble that is their ticket should be able to pick up or whatever - I just don't. My mental memory/hdd is just smaller than most people's it seems like. I work on something and only learn enough to get the ticket done, then I end up doing something again in the same space and have to re-learn a lot of what I should've done.   


I'll get \~5 functions into something (say im debugging) and realize I forgot what the fuck I was even doing in here cause I got distracted or something.   


In college I was an A student. I went to a lower-tier school and if I'm being honest, my CS education was poor. I find that there's so many things I can't speak intelligently about or even understand. Networking concepts, security concepts, DevOps concepts, Unix concepts, so many times I find myself trying to understand what the fuck a CNAME is, etc etc. (I know what it is now, but to further that example - All I know about networking is TCP vs UDP. I don't know what a root authority is, what a CA cert is, etc etc etc). I feel like all I can do is write code and everything else is above my head. I'm like a bootcamp grad.  


The above compounds to where our system has integrations with things/uses things/whatever and I kind of treat large parts of our app as a black box. I don't understand large parts and our app isn't that big.   


I know I should go home and really study all these fundamentals and concepts and whatever else we use, but I'm kind of at this awkward situation - cause it takes me way too long to do simple stuff so I work at home and shit and can't get the drive in to study.

I'm not proud of this, and its something I really struggle with admitting, but I genuinely feel like I've been mediocre at the 2 places I interned at. I had such silo'd knowledge, I was/am a stack overflow developer where I don't read the manual for  grep, I just google 'find string recursively in files' and learn nothing. It feels like at my internships I was able to exit before it caught up to me, but idk I genuinely feel like its some critical thinking issue. Its just so hard to connect the dots and stuff.   


This got a lot longer than intended, but it was a stream of consciousness and if you read this far, thank you. I kinda wanted to get this out cause I've been decently scared I'm not cut out for this field despite my success in college, 8 new grad offers, and successful internships. On paper I should be fine, but dang it if I don't feel stupid all the time in comparison to every talented engineer around me."

**My predicament:**

I'm under the impression this question comes up a lot, so please bear with me. I have three classes left to my degree and I'm on my way out of the military in the next two years. Though I'm a bit confused/nervous about getting out (I have a family to support) I'm also very eager to get into a developer position. 

**About Me:**

I'm a natural problem solver, incredibly resourceful and fiercely determined. My interest in finding out how things work along with my strong drive to solve problems is what drove me to the CS curriculum. I dabble a bit in development but have yet to put forth any projects that show off what I know. Unfortunately with the military, I haven't had much free time and I will admit some of my CS classes were long ago. As most students within the CS field have the chance to enter an internship, I, unfortunately, cannot. There is a wonderful program called skills bridge that affords me a chance to intern at MS or AWS, but it doesn't guarantee an interview. This is also limited to a six-month window (long enough to get a breath of experience?)

Since I'm getting out in the near future, I'm curious what advice some of you folks have for my particular restraints. I'm definitely considering skills bridge, as well as working through leetcode and hacker rank. I'm hoping with this post that I could also get some advice on how to prepare myself, my portfolio and my resume."

I happen to also be located in the heart of Silicon Valley and I'm paid well enough, so I'm in no rush (although my current job makes me feel like I'm losing brain cells every day).

I'm not really sure where to start, though. I know Python well enough to make basic things, but like I'd have no clue how to actually say, build a website's backend. I also know basic C as part of projects I did in college. I have a couple projects in embedded software to show this. I never took any formal advanced CS classes -- anything algos or DS I know I picked up on my own, so there may be gaps in my knowledge that a typical CS grad won't have.

I had 2 internships, one at a major semiconductor firm doing 'firmware' (which basically amounted to writing tests in Python) and one at a defense contractor where most of my work was done in Matlab, plus a little Python. My senior design project, to throw in some buzzwords, used multiple microcontrollers and sensors, programmed in Python and C++.

Despite all that, I don't feel like I ""know"" how to do software engineering. Where should I start? Since Python makes up the bulk of my experience, is it best to focus on that to get my foot in the door and learn Flask/Django or something? If side projects are a good option, what should I focus on? Any courses you can recommend?"

This would greatly advance my career in allowing me to complete a clinical specialization and go through further training, as well as completing research. I was waitlisted, but apparently I was first on the list.

It really stands out on my resume, and I am almost always asked about it in interviews. However, the project to which I was assigned quickly proved to be more technical and ambiguous than our supervisor let on during the application and interview process, and my team members and I were tasked with developing the desired solution on our own. This was much to my surprise, as I assumed the internship would be more structured and more tailored to a programming novice. I had only taken one coding class at the time I applied, and I made this very clear during my interview.

By the end of the semester, a couple of my team members with a stronger technical acumen were able to provide the deliverable our supervisor wanted, and he was pleased with our ""team's"" work. The issue is, I spent most of the time looking over their shoulders trying to make sense of what was going on and asking questions rather than actually contributing to the solution, as I felt trying to tamper with their code and algorithms would only make things worse.

My team members understood where I was coming from and were happy to help teach me, but in other interviews after the fact, I have been hard-pressed to discuss my ""individual contributions."" I usually outline what our team's goal was and how we effectively met our supervisor's expectations  (what I currently have outlined on my resume), but I have been met with something along the lines of ""that's great...now tell me what YOU PERSONALLY contributed,"" to which I have no real response. 

I really don't want to come off as like I was just being lazy or like I am falsifying an entire internship experience. How can I more effectively and positively communicate this experience to a potential employer while still remaining honest about the situation and not taking individual ownership for something that was really the work of my team members?"

My college is ending next year, so it is now time to apply and receive job offers. I've accepted an offer in my local city for a web-dev job at a small company, it comes with an internship period until the college ends, and full-time after, so it will effectively start next month. Opportunities from other cities were open but I could not take them up as my family is going through a financial crunch and me working local would make things easy to manage.

I am anxious and unsure about the topic of changing jobs. I often look at job postings and they often come with experience requirements, like '2-3 years experience in Angular/React'. Also, I do not know how it would be possible to apply to other jobs while working the current one. I do not want to be confined to this local job, and I wish to expand my horizons and work at larger, prominent companies in major cities like Bangalore. I really enjoy programming and I have interests in UI/UX design, dev in Flutter and Python, and I am open to picking up new stuff and experimenting.

So if any of you guys have done the same, taking up a job at a small company, and then jumped to a more satisfactory position in a short time, I'd be happy to hear from you. Also, advice on how to prepare (ds + algo if it is necessary, other skills for software dev in general) while working would be really helpful to me.

Apologies if there is any unnecessary elaboration, I am simply confused at the moment.

I'm open to all advice from everyone, but answers relevant to India would be more helpful to me.

I was waiting for on one company that I got an offer from for 6 months due to the need to get a government clearance. Last minute, they let me know that the position no longer exist so now I am back in the job market and I need a lot of help editing my resume to get a call back. I applied to more than 30 jobs but did not get any call back for interview. I try to change my resume and cover letter a little bit to fit more with the role I am applying for but that doesn't seem to help.

I appreciate your time and effort to read my post and any feedback is appreciated.

Thank you"

I know the other locations it's pretty easy to get a return offer so does the same hold for NYC?

I want to maximize my chances to get a full time return offer after the internship so do you all think I should ask my recruiter to change my location to DC or Richmond, or does NYC have a similar percentage of people that get return offers for full time? Thanks!!"

dsisg3,1,2019-11-06,Too late to renegotiate?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dsisg3/too_late_to_renegotiate/,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a canadian student with 3 previous internships, one of them being an 8 month internship. I'm applying for my last internship this summer and I found a company in my city that pays really well and that I really like and can see myself working at in the future. I initially didn't want to negotiate because my first thought was that if I'm not willing to walk away from the job, then I have no negotiating power. I was more concerned about getting the job and only concerned about negotiating any potential return offer in the future which would be much more important. When the offer was made to me on the phone, I basically said ""sounds good"" and I think that I essentially communicated that I was happy with the offer and had no plans to negotiate. She left long pauses after each thing she mentioned in the offer, which trapped me into giving a response about how I felt about it, which I think led to me giving away too much.

&amp;#x200B;

After the phone call she sent an email just giving me the exact end/start dates and office location that I asked for during the phone call. I replied asking for two weeks off at some point during the summer, so she modified my end date to end two weeks early and sent me the first offer. I replied saying that I would prefer to start two weeks later rather than end two weeks early, and she sent me the revised offer.

This is a fairly big company, but it's not big N or anything. They are offering me 29.7$ an hour and a 2k sign on bonus for the internship. After thinking about it once I had the offer in writing, I realize that I would prefer to be paid more than what i previously made at another internship, where I was paid 30$ an hour and had a 3k relocation bonus. This other internship was out of town in a higher cost of living area, so I wouldn't expect them to match the relocation bonus. In reality, I wouldn't want to work at this company again because of culture fit and location, and I would only be considering this new offer, but I can use this as leverage to make two arguments (that are somewhat similar):

&amp;#x200B;

1. It's early in the recruitment cycle for the summer, and I could be paid more at this other company. I would want them to make a better offer than I could get at another company, after taking into account inflation.
2. I would be much more comfortable working at this company long term knowing that they are willing to pay me more than anyone else and that they see me as more valuable than other companies would.

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, it seems late to negotiate and my argument relies on a hypothetical, and I'm not actually willing to work elsewhere right now and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity since the location, pay and tech that i'd be working with is really cool. On the other hand, they don't know what I'm willing to do, and I've not actually given explicit acceptance of anything yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it benefit me to ask for a higher wage at this point? I was thinking of asking for 32$ an hour, to take into account inflation since two summers ago. Please be honest if you think there's not much point to doing so. If you do think I should ask for more, how should I frame my negotiation? Should I mention that I'm generally happy with the offer to not risk losing anything, or should I remain as impartial as possible and simply try to leverage as much as I can? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this long post."
dsjyo1,1,2019-11-06,Getting a ton of experience... that has no value?,thisisathrowaway6027,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dsjyo1/getting_a_ton_of_experience_that_has_no_value/,"I am a senior CS student at a large but little known school, especially for comp sci. Modest GPA, slightly above 3.0. My road into industry work has been rather complicated to say the least. When I started Summer after Sophomore year, I was working Desktop Support for minimum wage at a small company (\~100 People). Not what I wanted to do but I wasn't getting in anywhere else.

So I had this boss, we'll call him Erlich (Obvious reference). Erlich absolutely loved me, he was a dynamic manager who wanted to make sure everyone he hired felt fulfilled and could get to where they wanted to be. Great guy, in a not so great company. After my summer stint, Erlich asked if I would stay on part time while I was in school. I agreed since I could use the money and he promised to move me into a developer role. I then proceeded to plan all subsequent semesters to allow for 24-30 hour work weeks alongside coursework.

The small company Erlich and I were at had a dev team but it was small only 2 people and they were too overloaded to train me. So he improvised, and got me a ""thing"" at the parent company who had the resources to help. I call it a thing because it was fully remote, he told them I was a skilled developer ready for big projects, and I was never on their payroll. I remained on the small companies books. I spent the next 6 months learning a ton but struggling to meet crazy deadlines because I was oversold by Erlich. This was all traditional LAMP full stack related work. All the while I remained at minimum wage.

Once the big company no longer needed my services I was cast back to the small company. They basically put me back at my support role so I started to look for other more relevant work given I now had SWE experience. This was a challenge to say the least. Wasn't really considered for any big internships or anything in SWE. Finally, out of the blue, I must have been a last ditch candidate but May before my senior year, I get an offer to be a network engineer at a fortune 20. I jumped at it because I wanted out of support and it paid 3 times what I was making. I made the absolute best of this. I geared all of my intern projects towards development and built network automation tools with a few of the engineers who had dev experience. I learned a ton and gained skills in modern web frameworks and low level programming.

Fortune 20 company, for budget reasons, was not able to keep me part time and due to management wanting SWE and not network engineers, full time at graduation on that team wasn't coming either. At that point I reached out to Erlich and he managed to get me an offer for a little over minimum wage to come back and do actual development part time for small company. That is where I stand now.

I am the ""do everything"" developer now. I have an intern I trained to help me out but mostly I build and maintain wordpress sites, manage the servers, organize the codebase, etc. They fired the previous development team because they lost a big client who took with them a lot of development work. I learn a ton every single day and teaching this intern is a tremendous help but I am underpaid and overworked. Erlich just sat me down and company offered 50k for me to continue after graduation. All of my friends in other majors are getting more than this. I have given 2 years and for them to say this is the best I can get kind of hurts.

So I reached out to a recruiter at fortune 20 and he is going to help me find full time work as SWE over there. He said given I interned with them I have great chances and he even shared the starting salary for this season which is an unbelievable 85k. But they don't even hire until well into next semester. So I started applying elsewhere, it hasn't been going well. Despite going on 2 years corporate experience I don't even get responses to most applications. It seems like it has been a waste. I'm not sure whether or not to continue working next semester, or how to better myself as a full time candidate? Should I just quit and transition to side projects? Any advice helps. Thanks"

I need 3 internships to graduate with my bachelors and I cant find one.,Mewover,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/dskbnt/should_i_drop_out_of_college_im_in_engineering/,"I don't know what to do guys. I have fought tooth and nail to push through and have managed to scrape by in Comp Sci and engineering, only ever failing one class and having not dropped a single one. I'm currently in my fourth year and am sitting just above a 2.0 GPA. I'm actually doing well in most of my classes currently, and will only have a year left after this year to be able to graduate.

I've fought so hard. So, so hard. I've made so many sacrifices. But its not enough. My program, for some *inexplicable* reason requires 3 internships to be able to graduate. I haven't managed to land a single one, where most people have gotten one by year 2. I've been a depressed, anxious wreck. I fear that I will make it to the end of classes and be denied graduation because I can't convince a private company to give me a job... Isn't that what college is for anyways? To be able to avoid the job market until a skillset has been developed enough? 

I just don't know what to do. I have never heard of anybody being in my position. For the first time in my life I am doing well in school but its too late. I want to message the Dean and ask if I can have an exception but I doubt I will get one. I don't want all my hard work to go to waste. I WANT to be an engineer. I've fought for it. But I just don't know if its possible at this point. I feel like I deserve my degree.

Has anyone here ever been in a situation like this? I need advice. Literally nobody in my life understands. Nobody has gone through what I've gone through. I despise the fact that I have to put it like that, but its true. I didn't slack, I've done the work, but nobody is willing to give me a chance."

I was in a lot of engineering programs in high school. Programmed robots, competed in state competitions, got a couple of medals, etc. 

I guess it got to the point that I believed what people were telling me. That I should be a computer engineer. Programming? Check. Computers? Check. 18 year old me thought it was what I wanted, and, since I was told I would be successful, I guess I got arrogant. 

I'm not shy of work or high workloads. I spammed AP classes in High School and graduated valedictorian of my class. I felt sure that it was what I wanted. 

I started university coming out of high school with a ton of credits done and jumped into my major. It started off okay. I'd never studied C programming or C++ so it was a bit difficult so I tried. I tried hard. I specifically kept my unit load low on recommendations from advisors, yes it would take longer but it would allow me to focus on my classes. 

The first difficult class I encounter was Physics. I'm trash at physics. I have no idea how it works. C- was my final grade. Not enough to meet the prerequisites for the next Physics course I had to take. It took me a whole year and a half before I could get credits transferred over to cover the class.  And I still ended up with a C- in the following class - not enough to meet the prerequisites. Additionally, the difficulty in my programming classes was increasing. 

I kind of thought that, even though C and C++ were the focus of our programming classes, that eventually, due to my major, there would be introductory classes for Python and Java. Nope. Blame my ignorant mind for thinking this but that isn't how life works. 

I'm at the start of my 4th year. I don't even understand what my professors are saying nor how I passed my classes last semester. My GPA is so low I can't qualify for internships anymore.  I've given up on trying to program anything past a basic search function with classes. I've completely lost all interest in my major. My stress is at an all-time high. I have no idea what I want to do with my life.

I look at my life and I've spent so much time studying and listening to the voices of the people around me encouraging me to the point where I was believing what they were saying about me. 

At the rate my studies are going, I'm expecting another 3 years at this university. I would rather study what I love but I don't even know what I want to study. 

Does anyone have any advice?"
dsl4ec,1,2019-11-06,Old roommate changed amounts owed from security deposit with a suspicious charge and is withholding the money altogether,itsuhlivi,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dsl4ec/old_roommate_changed_amounts_owed_from_security/,"For reference, this is in Kentucky. Last year (Aug 2018-Jul 2019) I rented a house with 5 other roommates. Our security deposit was about $2395, so we all put down $400 and the excess went to utilities. One of the roommates, I'll call him Luke, took it upon himself to handle all the utility bills (rent was individual online), so we all paid him our portion for utilities.  

^(Not entirely relevant to the security deposit, but I feel like it establishes the shadiness of it all, or at least is a red flag we should have caught - about a month or two into living there, Luke asked his girlfriend to move in with him and share his room. She had been staying over nearly every day anyway, and we were all fine with it, so she moved in. However, we were told that she was added to the lease, and she wasn't. So the two of them split Luke's portion of rent between themselves instead of splitting the total 7 ways. They told us it would be fine because they volunteered to cover the whole water and city bills.  He said we were saving money either way (about $5 a month his way as opposed to about $30 a month the \~right way\~) so we decided to just let it go.)

At move-out, the agent who did our walk-through told us that we would be charged $400 for cleaning as we had missed sweeping some rooms. It would be taken from our deposit, which is cool and fine. He told us that to get our deposit back, we would need to call/email the office and ask for it. It would be given back as a check that we would all have to sign and then cash. Since one of our roommates had already moved to California for grad school, that would be nearly impossible. The agent told us that we should just email the office and say that it's ok that they give the check back to just one of us -Luke. We all sent the email and everything was dandy. It took the office about 80 or so days to return the deposit to us, but Luke finally sent us a message in our group chat that he had received it, and he included a breakdown of what each of us would be getting.

So, since the deposit was $2395 and we were charged $400, I was expecting the deposit to be $1995 (and it was), and I was expecting to get my portion of $332.50 minus whatever I still owed for utilities. Here is the kicker: we had a water leak in late May/early June that turned out to be my roommate's toilet constantly running. Luke was out of state for an internship and said the water usage had tripled since he left and that the bill was about $500. We got the leak fixed, but since only Luke handled the water, we don't know if he showed proof of the leak being fixed to the water co in order to lower the bill. Either way, it doesn't constitute the $1148 charge he added to our spreadsheet in August titled ""Leak"". 

When he told us what we would be getting back, we were all confused because it was so low - some of us were listed as owing Luke money even. He told us that it cost about $1200 to fix ""the leak"", and we could go see it broken down in the spreadsheet we had all used to keep track of payments. We didn't want to start anything, so we just reiterated our venmos/zelles to him so that he could send us our share. This was about 3 weeks ago, and we have yet to receive anything from Luke. He has also stopped responding in our group chat, even though we can see that he read it. 

We are confused because when the leak happened and was billed in June, we got it fixed and that was that. The only charge was for the water, since the maintenance would be handled by the landlord. There were no other issues with the house or with utilities after that. Water bills were never posted in the spreadsheet because Luke and his girlfriend took care of them on their own, so we don't know what was actually billed in June, but from what we were told, that $500 was the highest it ever was. It seems suspicious that such a high charge only vaguely titled ""leak"" would show up months after the leak was fixed and forgotten about. It also doesn't help that we have no access to the billing statements from the water company. If this is a real charge that we all owe, so be it, but it doesn't add up from my point of view.

Either way, he owes us at least the small amounts (about $70-$80) he has divided for us after the ""leak"", if it is real, and he has stopped acknowledging our requests. He is notorious for taking a long while to cash checks, and he probably has been working quite often for our theatre department's fall show, but I would think this is something he would and should get done asap. Not to mention that within this time frame of ignoring us, he got engaged to his girlfriend - which is something that probably required a trip to the bank, but at least shows that he probably had the time to go. 

Is there anything that can be done to get our portions of the deposit back, or to see the water/city bills?"

Back when I was 18-24 I believed it didn't really matter much because I considered myself young and that it's not unusual to job hop while you figure out what you actually want to do for a career. Now I'm in my late 20s and I don't have much of a resume despite having a degree.

I haven't challenged myself to try and get a better job that might teach me new skills that I can use to build more a more solid professional work history. Whenever I do somehow land those kinds of positions, I'll get overwhelmed and immediately quit without giving notice and effectively burn bridges.

It was a sales role that involved customer service over the phone and a decent amount of general office work. I got really overloaded the first week and was pretty much a nervous wreck, unable to force myself to speak over the phone with any sort of clarity or confidence. I walked out Friday morning that week. I don't know why but I feel like that I'm enabling myself to continue doing this because of a mindset where I've convinced myself that I can always just get another job, but as my employment gaps grow larger and larger, it's becoming more difficult to properly explain to interviewers why I don't have many references or why I've never been promoted or given more responsibility in the few positions I've had where I've lasted longer than six months.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel really shitty because I don't know if this is just a laziness issue or if it's a major occurrence with other people who suffer from ADHD. I managed to get a new medication prescription earlier this year which has helped slightly, but I still have this issue. For those who are experiencing something like this, how do you deal with it?"

The university is teaching Java for the first year only, and as a programming newbie, I want to focus on this language for now before I try learning other languages. I currently work at a superstore as a part time, but I want to gain some expereice, that I can add on my CV. I was never good at any sports, so I do not have much achievements other than my school grades. I am actively looking for a part time job that has something to do with technology, but there aren't many out there, especially for part time. 

I really want to land a internship after my second year of uni but my cv is so bad that i feel like they would not even bother. So i want to start early and see what type of experience i should look to gather that might help my cv look better when i apply for an internship. 

any suggestions?

Current Big 4 consulting (post-MBA), hoping I can get some advice about how to avoid getting pigeonholed in a new role (sorry for the lengthy read).

My background: Went to a non-target UG, with a major in Finance and minor in Information Systems. Because I was from a non-target, options post UG were limited, and I took a role in internal audit with a F500 company. I was immediately thrown into IT audit due to my IS minor, which might be even worse than normal IA. I absolutely HATED the work, but worked hard and was able to get some great recommendations and a very strong GMAT score, which thankfully led to a full-ride at a T10 MBA program. I graduated from that program in May 2018 (note that due to some unfortunate personal events, I didn't start at my current firm until January 2019).

I was pretty clear during recruiting that a huge part of why I was getting my MBA was to get away from working in IT. I spent my first year recruiting for various finance roles and ultimately landed a role in corporate finance in NY. I ultimately decided that consulting was a better fit for me long term, so I re-recruited as a second year MBA. I actually did quite well re-recruiting (ended up with multiple MBB final rounds, final rounds for some Tier 2 strategy firms, and a few offers), but didn't quite make it with a pure strategy firm. In the end, I took a role in a Big 4 consulting practice (i.e. more ops focused). To be clear, I really like the company and most of the role, so that's not what I'm complaining about. I personally think there are a lot of benefits to working on the ops side (I was never one of those MBA's who insist it's pure strategy or bust). The pay is great, the hours are much better than at MBB, and I really like the people.

However, what I am complaining about is that yet again, I already seem to have been marked for IT ops projects despite giving very little indication that I was interested in that role. When I was given the offer the recruiter asked me if I ""would be okay working on some IT projects"". I answered by saying that I did not want IT to be my main focus and that in my opinion my background is better suited to more generalist work (we're comparing a degree in Finance, MBA, and internship in Corp Fin here to a minor in IS and IT audit experience...), but that I would be happy to do some rotations in IT and help out if needed. Note I was asked about that BEFORE being made the offer (it was clear at that point I had done well, but nothing was in writing) so I felt that was a fair response. I was assured that the staffing pool was one big pool and that I'd work on a range of projects before specializing 2-3 years out.

Unfortunately, that's been nothing like what happened. When I started this past January, I immediately found out that there is in fact a separate staffing pool for IT, and that I'm in it (I think this was a change made between when I got my offer and when I started). I started with a group of 100+ MBA's, most of whom don't seem to have any kind of different background on paper which should make them a better fit for generalist work than me. Out of the class of 100+, maybe 2-3 of us were tagged for IT, and the others in the group specifically asked to be there (and have much stronger IT backgrounds). The vast majority of the people in the IT group seem to have either been experienced hires from more IT-focused firms, or have M.S. degrees in CS/IS, etc. - there's not a lot of MBA's.

I have been upfront with people in the IT group about this, and have received a range of responses. While some have been helpful and understanding, even those individuals have basically told me I will need to probably put in at least a full year in IT and prove myself before I get too aggressive about moving. Others have clearly lost interest in networking with me or having any further discussions as soon as I brought that up. My staffer is also assigned purely to IT projects, so it's in their best interest to keep me as a resource instead of letting me branch out. Even more frustrating is that people at my level with more IT experience are getting picked up on the more high profile clients which offer more networking opportunities within the firm, while I get stuck on tiny projects nobody wants to be on (I've had several calls with managers trying to get staffed this past week, where I was told they needed someone with more IT experience to step in). And while my alma mater has a ton of MBA's in the practice, virtually none of them are in IT, so people in my network who could help staff me on better projects are limited on what they can do due to the separate staffing pool.

At this point, I'm getting increasingly frustrated as I'm basically being told that I'm stuck for the time being as an IT resource, despite IT clearly not being the best fit for me at the firm to begin with. The bright side is that I've been able to network pretty well with people in some of the more generalist areas of the practice, and am confident I can get staffed on projects with them at some point. My concern is that it seems it will be a big hurdle to get over the staffing model and switch full-time to a generalist role. Additionally, while I know I need to probably put in at least a year before thinking about moving firm or becoming more aggressive on moving internally, I'm also concerned that if I spend too long in IT, I'll miss the opportunity to jump ship. I also have little interest in the exit opps available from IT, so I'm concerned if I get stuck in IT too long, I'm missing my chance to just exit and do something else.

Would appreciate any advice on managing this!

TLDR: Got assigned to IT in opps consulting without knowing it and now seem pretty stuck, looking for advice on how to move internally within the firm without burning bridges or to just escape IT in general"

First a bit of background, I'm a Back-end developer currently working in the US. I've 3 years of FT experience, and 1 year of internship experience. Have worked in a mix of startup and midsize environments.

I'm currently on student visa, (came here for my masters in CS ), and not too psyched about the visa situation in the US. My student visa ends in Jun 2020, and I'm planning to move to another country (preferably in Canada or EU).

So far the steps I'm taking to ensure that is,

** Preparing for  SWE positions in FANGs, and in the worst case get transferred or recruited to an international team (chances are slim for this)

** Start doing some side projects (or contributing to open source) and improving my profile so that I can apply to international SWE positions online.

** I'm currently reading papers of popular distributed systems based systems (distributed databases, consensus protocols, messaging systems), and other tech blogs and planning to write my blog on what I find Interesting.

** Applying to Canada express entry.

** Anything else I should be doing?

Worst case, I'll go back to my home country, I'm not worrying too much about it, but I like my lifestyle here in the US and other developed countries I've seen so far. The work culture and life in general would be more relaxed and for the first time in life, I'm actually loving what I do, it sucks that it's all dependent on getting a visa (again, I'm not bashing the system, just venting here)

I welcome any other views, opinions or anything else I could try to improve my chances to move to Canada or the EU. Thank you for reading!"

Truth is that the department is such a joke because many of the career fairs and online services they put on cater primarily to nursing, (some) business majors like accounting and (maybe) marketing or finance, and liberal arts majors. Other than that, it's do-it-yourself for every STEM career unless pursuing graduate school which I've been told to go elsewhere. 

I contemplate graduating a semester early from college to test the waters by practicing for code interviews, even taking GE classes in the summer and/or winter in lieu of internships so my mind is sharp. I fall into manic depression because I feel like I'm lost at a school where my money goes nowhere but the president's pockets. I know won't even have a job out of college, which I understand is hard unless you have connections that **might** make things a bit smoother. Instead, I'm being taught how to be a social justice warrior for the sake of the underprivileged and the needy, but doesn't pay for my bills nor my student loans. 

In the meantime, I'm a B-student with A's in some of my CS courses in an undergraduate program that is challenging but not strong enough such that their focus is on software development (little focus in networks or cybersecurity let alone a couple classes). I take advantage of opportunities by getting onto research projects with professors as an undergraduate and I get myself aware into opportunities to becoming a teaching assistant if that is even possible with a CS department under a serious budget cut. In addition, I'm actively applying for internships but find little luck in getting offers, let alone even a technical interview or phone screen.

I'm lost. I feel like I've drank too much of the school's Kool-Aid and boy has it gotten me nowhere near what I want to achieve. I'm not sure where I should go from here and is there any way I can get help if I'm quickly losing patience in a school that provides nothing?"

The classes I'm in right now I just show up for the tests since I've already done what they are teaching in my own time. I've tried talking to everyone in my University to be able to test-out of classes but for bureaucratic reason I apparently just can't.  I often have people coming to me for help when they are in much higher level course work, which makes me think that it isn't gonna get any better the further up I go. Not only do I have these useless CS courses, but I have to take all these other required courses along with working an unrelated job just so I can pay for these said useless courses. It's a brutal mental toll of knowing you are prepared for a job, but unable to get one and having no idea how to fix it. It literally feels like I've already done my degree and just waiting for the piece of paper so employers will give me the time of day.

&amp;#x200B;

This accompanied with the fact that I've always had mental and financial problems is making me lose motivation to keep teaching and working myself, despite that I've practically dedicated my life to programming.  And when I say my life  I literally mean it, for better or worse most of my high school career consisted of programming as I thought it would be my ""ticket out of poverty"", but here i fucking am lmao.

I hope this is the right place to post this. I just got an internship offer from Morningstar. I am super thrilled but I'm somewhat conflicted on accepting it right now. I am hoping some of you would be willing to help me make a more informed decision based on your thoughts of the firm, if you know or have heard anything: prestige, culture, compensations, experience, etc. If anyone has ever been an intern at Morningstar, or works/has worked in the Mornongstar Development Program, that insight is especially welcome!

My main goals for any summer 2020 internship are:
1) to gain experience in the finance sector;
2) intern at firm that has a solid track record of hiring interns for full time position post graduation;
3) be happy and enjoy my internship.

There are a lot of pros: the culture seems relaxed, especially for finance related firms, and everyone I have spoken to there seems to genuinely like it. It is in Chicago which is where I live so it would be rent free. The internship program seems genuinely interesting to me and would allow me to gain some good experience. They also hire interns into their Morningstar Development Program (MPD).

But cons: Perhaps because of this, the intern pay seems somewhat low for the industry. And the MPD is also a fairly uncompetitive salary, at first at least. I also read that the MPD is a glorified sales representative for the first year but I can not confirm this beyond one or two Glassdoor reviews. If I am wrong I would love to be corrected.

Another hesitation for me is that I have applied to some other places, both finance and otherwise, and I want to see how those shake out. Primarily, I am set to attend the CIBC internship interview ""superday"" event on Dec 6th in Chicago. While that is by no means a sure thing, I would like to see the process through as the CIBC internship also seems like a great opportunity.

Morningstar has an internship offer acceptance date before the CIBC interviews. I am conflicted. I know ""one in the hand is worth two in the bush"", but I do want to see what other opportunities might fall my way and weigh my options. Could I ask for an extension, or is that tacky? Based on your experiences/opinions, is Morningstar a place where people are happy and get good experience? Should I take this internship and not look back?

Thank you for your time!"

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Dropped out of high school twice. Couldn't do CS back home. Moved to US. Faced multiple job rejections. Grinded leetcode. Got a new grad full-time offer (compensation in last bullet point).

&amp;#x200B;

* Dropped out of secondary school (basically high school) twice, but ended up going back to graduate with straight Cs from an Asian country (feel free to take a guess where). Didn't do well enough to take advanced math in secondary school so I wasn't eligible to apply for any STEM majors (so no CS) in University there.

&amp;#x200B;

* Moved to the US for college, studied for the SATs for an entire month 12 hours straight each day, and got into a local public college to pursue CS. Brought my GPA to a 4.0 but I struggled finding work. Couldn't land any technical internships until the summer after my junior year (Summer '19). For that hiring season I applied to over 200 jobs, over 100+ rejections, and only got the 1 internship offer. (For clarity, I'm a green card holder because I know the job hunt is 10x harder for international students)

&amp;#x200B;

* Started applying myself heavily outside of college by going to Hackathons, meetups, networking events, and spent countless hours tailoring my resume, grinding leetcode + cracking the coding interview, and doing mock interviews/whiteboarding with friends.

&amp;#x200B;

* During my senior year, I was fortunate enough to have an easier job hunt than my junior year (which I attribute to building my connections with recruiters from the previous year, and networking with individuals at Hackathons).

&amp;#x200B;

* Applied to 30 companies, was lucky enough to have a decent response rate. 12 coding challenges, 7 phone/video interviews, 4 onsites, 1 offer.

&amp;#x200B;

* Just signed the offer to start after graduating in Summer 2020 in a low CoL area with 90k base, 130k after bonuses and stock.

Just needed a place to vent and hopefully get advice from somone whos maybe been in a similar spot. Now I'd be the first to admit I didnt utilize college that well. Spent a long time depressed and turned off from the hyper competitive environment that was especially prevalent in the business school. This, and some other factors,basically sucked out all my love for learning and resulted in me having a shitty gpa (3.1) and hardly any internship experience. 

Fast forward to full time recruiting going on right now, and I've just been taking Ls. Not hearing back after resume drops, getting rejected after a phone interview, etc.. Almost to the point where I don't even want to try any longer. Just logging into handshake gives me severe anxiety. I'm now in a position where im graduating in a little over a month and dont have a job offer. idk wtf im gonna do or if theres even any decent jobs left at this point. My parents paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for me to attend this school and I just feel like a failure. It especially stings since basically all my friends either have rich parents they can go work for or are networking gurus and charismatic af and getting past interviews is no problem for them, even though I may be technically smarter. Sorry for the long post, just needed to rant I guess. Hopefully it all works out. Anyone in business get a full time job this late in recruiting(with a december graduation)?"
dsuj3g,0,2019-11-07,Which Company to Intern For,Wavytide,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dsuj3g/which_company_to_intern_for/,"Hello. I would like some advice so I can pick a place to intern at. Some background about me. I am currently a junior studying computer engineering. I am a highly ambitious person and I started taking coding more seriously last year because I wanted a good career in computer science. 

That being said I have been the potential to intern at two different companies but I don't know which one to choose. 

The first company is top 10 on the Fortune 500 which I think would look really good on my resume and lead to a vast majority of opportunities in the future. It is a basic coding internship and I heard mixed reviews about it ($24/hr). They are hiring about 40 interns. I also heard there is a lot of down time and I feel like I wont be learning as much here. But the culture is very fun and lenient(Allowed to wear sweat pants to work lol). This is an 8 hour day (Mon-Fri) with a lot of down time and 30 minutes away.

On the other hand, the second company is much smaller and not really well known. It is a software engineering internship.($30/hr but money is not a factor in my decision). They are only hiring 4-5 interns and from my interview, I can tell that they are the type of company who will milk the crap out of their employees. They also place a huge emphasis on growth and learning. It is 9 hours a day and I would have to drive an hour to get there. 

What I am looking for is the best opportunity to advance my career. And as for my career, I want to work somewhere along the lines of Software Engineering, back end programming, or AI.

What should I do?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Work for fortune 500 company and potentially not learn as much. Work for smaller company with bad culture, further but a better learning experience."

I have been given the task of using the YARA tool &amp; the signatures that are shown on threat advisories to scan desktops for signs of threats.

My employer wants to know how can YARA be deployed and what are the effects on the machines, would it disrupt normal working or can it run silently?

I've done a lot of research on using it with Nessus or Zeek to scan the network. 

Any tips or pointers are greatly appreciated by this Computer Science student in her internship, TIA!"

After I graduated from college, I could not find a job and had to move back home and was unemployed for 10 months (despite the fact I had excellent internships and graduated first in my major). I was really sad during this time. I finally landed a job based on pure networking and luck that allowed me to move from a small town in the rust belt (where I was from) to Houston, Texas. It was my dream to live in a big city and I finally got it. The job was supposed to be an incredible sales opportunity, but our program and business quickly fell apart. Despite the job sucking, I made a lot of great friends and had the time of my life living downtown in the city. I started to look for a new job after about a year and a half and had no success, until I was able to actually be promoted within the company and had the chance to move to San Francisco (my dream city to live in and where I already had friends) I was so excited and was planning on it until they could not pay me the full amount because of an HR rule. I couldn't afford to live out there on what they were going to pay me. I had a mental break down and was so afraid of what would happen since I was already leaving my apartment and I had no money (we didn't make what we were told we would) or car (company provided my car and I was going to lose it since I could not stay in Houston). Because I froze, I almost got in trouble with the company (it did ruin my reputation a bit), but because of a connection I had within, they gave me the option to instead go to small beach town in Florida with the same pay (so much better once you adjust the COL), and I took it right away without thinking about it.

Now I am completely miserable because I shortly figured out the opportunities were not equal and I hate living in Florida. Not to sound spoiled, but I gave up somewhere I wanted to live for a ""better job"" and I realized it cost me everything. Friends, a social life, living in a big city, and most importantly my mental health. To make matters worse my parents are on the verge of cutting me off because they really wanted me to take the position in Florida and I am extremely depressed being here. I already am stuck in a lease and if I leave before a year I have to pay back relocation, and I have almost no money. I'm super depressed and miserable. I can barely function at work. I've hit rock bottom. I don't know how to get out both from an actual moving out and getting a new job perspective to a mental health perspective. All I can think about is how I should have stayed in Texas or pursued my dream on the west coast. But instead I feel like I threw it all away because all I am reminded of is my failure and knowing the I made the wrong decision."
dt008k,2,2019-11-07,"Love everything about the job except the job itself (Software Engineer, 4 months at big corp)",csJobIHate,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dt008k/love_everything_about_the_job_except_the_job/,"Hi cscareerquestions,      
I've recently started a job as Software  Engineer where I'm being payed the most that I've ever been payed  before, (Not that much though, I'm a junior engineer living in Canada)  however I'm pretty unhappy with it overall after working just a couple  months.   


Before I start ranting, some background about me:  
\- I'm 24 and graduated in May with a unrelated engineering degree but awhile ago I decided I liked programming more   
\-  I worked for a year as a Software Engineer at a mature startup (40  people), it was awesome there. I was paid okay, but I had good  mentorship, autonomy and generally felt appreciated and closer to my  colleagues.   
\- I did some non software internships where I did automation work and data analysis (VBA and Python)   


Even though we use a fairly new tech stack (Go, Kubernetes, etc..)   
I  feel like my skills are stagnating. I'm given tasks pretty much  arbitrarily, which are often trivial and tedious; they basically involve  changing configuration files and testing proper deployment.   
The  team and processes are somewhat unorganized even though it's a big  company. However, at the same time they are difficult to change because  of the bureaucracy and momentum they already have.  
I've tried  speaking to my manager about this stuff and he seems to genuinely listen  during our 1on1s but nothing really happens afterwards.  


The best  parts of the job are the pay, location and benefits, outside of that I  kind of hate this job. Besides that I've been trying to keep myself  current by doing my own thing during my free time but I'm not sure it's  enough.  


So my question is what should do?   
1. Stick it out for a year while practicing algos and other technologies and try to land a better job  
2. Try to find a job now after approximately 4 months at this company  
3. Stay here forever and do my own thing during my free time  


Appreciate  any advice as I've never been in a situation like this before; where I  liked everything about the job except the job itself"

I'm finishing up a 3 month remote programming internship and it hasn't gone very well. My background isn't in computer science and this was my first paid foray into programming work. From the beginning my manager was frustrated with my lack of what he considered basic git skills. From there it was just me stumbling from task to task, with my manager essentially writing me off 1/3 of the way through the internship. He's just very short and rude to me now.  I'm on doc-update-duty and haven't touched any meaningful code in quite a while. Hopefully I'll still be able to list the internship on my resume and possibly list them as a reference if they're feeling generous, but I'm looking for some advice on how I can get the most out of my remaining time at the internship and what next steps I could take to have a little more success in my next (hopefully non-internship) job. Advice from others with lackluster internship experiences would be especially helpful! Thanks!"

It resides in the following path along with the following related files

C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers

Ksapi.sys

Ksapi\_ev.sys

Ksapi64.sys

Ksapi64\_ev.sys

Ksapi64.sys has a copyright value for a company known as Beijing Kingsoft Security software Co. Also known as Cheetah Mobile, the developer of Clean Master

After doing some testing, we found that Clean Master is indeed installing these .sys files, but more disturbingly, if Clean Master is uninstalled, the .sys files remain, and must be removed by hand.

This is worrisome, because not only should a ‚ÄúCleaner Software‚Äù not be touching ANYTHING in system32, it definitely should not be leaving anything in system32 after it is uninstalled."

I'm a currently a 4.0 (may change) CS student who goes to an average school in the west coast with decent experience in personal projects &amp; job-related extracurriculars. I'm only okay in terms of technical skills, with school takes up most of my time and not really involving programming so I'm hoping I could focus more on whichever company stack afterwards. Currently my internship would be $60k in terms of annual salary, and while I'm grateful to have a negotiation point, I'm not sure how much more to ask for. I'm wondering how much I could ask for relative to an ivy league student or students who don't put as much in towards their career in college. At the moment, I think I'm aiming for $80k but I also ideally want to be able to get closer to the 6 figure range to help my family out. Thoughts are appreciated, thanks!"

I‚Äôm nearing the end of my B.S. in computer science from an average to slightly above average public American university. I graduate in May, and I have not had a CS internship, and I have a GPA of 3.3 (I hope to boost it to 3.5 by graduation, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure I‚Äôll be able to). I really would like to work as an entry-level Java developer. 

I‚Äôm definitely not a prodigy, and I take full responsibility for this, but I really want to end my degree on a high note. Up until the past couple weeks, my Github has been empty, but I‚Äôve developed a neat recursive Sudoku solver, and right now I‚Äôm creating a Minesweeper-like game. I don‚Äôt know what else to do right now but try to prove I understand particularly elementary data structures and software engineering concepts, so I‚Äôm trying to create small projects that are relevant to those fields. I also intend to create some projects dealing with Python and R, which I don‚Äôt know as well as Java, but I want to show off more than one skill.

I‚Äôm currently studying abroad, but when I get back to the US, I want to start networking very hard with my friends and professors. I have a good relationship with three of them, so I have that going for me. 

I think I do communicate well, and I typically do well in interviews, but I know this doesn‚Äôt replace clear experience and skills. I do think I have understood and done acceptably in my classes in college, and I think they‚Äôve prepared me to confidently continue my studies on my own to tailor towards whatever job I find. However, I have little proof of this at the moment, so I think I need to write a lot of publicly-visible projects.

I speak three languages too, but I don‚Äôt know if this is relevant enough to put on a resum√©. 

Do you have any advice for my situation? Am I still missing something crucial? Thanks for your patience reading through all this."

With that being said, I've taken an interest in pursuing a career in the cloud industry, but I absolutely have no idea where to start. I might be reaching for the stars with this aspiration, but I've researched that cloud jobs are and will be in high demand for the years to come. 

I have no IT background and no degree. I'm currently in a program that teaches individuals IT fundamentals and the soft skills that are expected in the corporate workspace. This program will offer a 6-month internship with one of their partner companies and it's an opportunity to get my foot into the door of the IT industry. They offer several different internship opportunities, but I'm looking specifically to get a helpdesk internship, just to create a strong foundation with IT knowledge. 

Unfortunately, this program doesn't focus much on the hard skills of IT, but mostly soft skills. I am currently in the process of completing a google IT Support Certificate and teaching myself a little bit of Python. I know this isn't much to convert into cloud, but I want to know what are the future steps i can take in order for me to have a guideline as to how I can pursue this career choice.

So I'm 25 and am in my first semester at my local community college getting a programming degree. Thus far have taken classes in Python, HTML, C# and Java and it's coming pretty easily to me I think... I have to ask questions at times but I pick it up pretty well it seems. If it's relevant at all I have a BA degree in a foreign language from a state university (pretty bullshit liberal arts degree but for what it's worth I am now fluent in said foreign language) which obviously did not give me much of any direction regarding my job search lol. In order to complete my AS degree I am required to have an internship my last semester which I don't think would be too terribly difficult for me to find since a lot of companies around here hire interns from the community college I'm going to. 

I really want to do what I can to ensure I can be successful in this field... any suggestions as to what I can do now to start making myself look more appealing to potential employers at this early stage? I'm a little paranoid because I feel like I'm at a disadvantage being an ""older"" student. idk if it matters but I'm not working atm but I am volunteering a lot. I also know I should start working on my own projects for a portfolio and I do have some ideas. 

Also, just as a general question that I am curious about.. how difficult is it really to find a job in this field? I'm sure it depends on a lot of factors but I am just trying to prepare myself for whatever I'll have to deal with."

The area that is making the decision difficult is the type of work. GM was ambiguous on what I might be working in. They said Autonomy and EV's are a possibility, but I'm not counting on it. Regardless, that work would most likely be more involved with controls software with some hardware. On the other hand, GE digital is pure software, but my responsibilities there are also uncertain. I was told that backend, full stack, and technical product management positions will probably be one of the areas I work in. I would probably be developing data analytics tools. 

As someone with a variety of interests, I am unsure as to which position might offer me an experience that could give me more flexibility. I am currently unsure as to if I want to go the full swe route or potentially a mix of soft and hardware (like embedded systems). That said, is there one way that might benefit me more than the other? Would having practical experience on working on software in a hardware application (and potentially a larger scale project) be a more versatile experience for future recruiting (and learning in general)? If I were to go with GM, would competitive swe internships the next year be harder to attain? On the other hand, If I took GE, would a future embedded systems or computer engineering type internship be harder to attain?

Just trying to make the best decision that gives me good experience but also the flexibility to be a prepared for recruiting for good computer engineering or computer science type internships the next year.

Also, does anyone have any insight regarding the internship programs at  these two companies or working at them in general? Thanks for the help."

I work as a long-term intern somewhere where the company has limited positions for full-timers. It's very likely that I'll have to wait a bit to get a position there.

Today I wrapped up my summer internship search. I wanted to share some interesting findings and lessons learned. I‚Äôm hoping to encourage others to hang in there if they‚Äôre feeling like I did up till two weeks ago, feeling like dirt and comparing myself to my peers who seem to be getting offers left and right. My friends, there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

Throwaway because I‚Äôm very active on reddit (though not in cs subreddits). I copied others and created a Sankey diagram to visualize the results. I started my search in early August. Here are my results:

[https://imgur.com/8GWDs2U](https://imgur.com/8GWDs2U)

A little about me. I go to a mediocre state school not known for its CS program. I did not go to university right away, instead working in advocacy for a few years and taking temp jobs to help support my family. I had two previous internships, one remote doing front end and one full stack both in small local companies. Since my first year I have been doing everything I can to reduce my student debt working at the IT desk and as a campus driver. I have a high GPA and a good relationship with the few cs faculty here.

To practice for interviews, I did a lot of mock interviews with roommate, bought and practiced technicals with leetcode premium, and read CTCI, Elements of Programming Interviews in Python, and Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein). I spent on average 2-3 hours a night on prep but I always took Saturday night off.

I got rejected/ghosted from every automated interview I received (and in one case I received a phone interview and then an automated interview where I got ghosted). Needless to say, I have a poor opinion of them.

For technical interviews I did not encounter very many leetcode hards and a surprisingly large number of system design questions. In my smoother interviews there was a stronger focus on my pre-university non-profit work. All the offers came within two weeks of each other and I accepted a dream offer from a very well-known company in California.

The search isn‚Äôt easy, and for a long while it looked like I was going nowhere. If anyone reading this is still searching know that there is likely an offer around the corner and you just don‚Äôt know it yet. I hope everyone has a great weekend!"

Do you guys think it is too late for getting a good internship let alone Spring co-op? I mean in terms of even getting the coding challenges, I am really worried that I won't even get them now. (for some reason Amazon never really sends me any too.) 
If you guys have any suggestions, please let me know, in terms of which companies I should apply to or anything else in general. Trying to solve more leetcode problems in the meantime to get better at it."
dtb87l,2,2019-11-08,(Yet another) post on hard work paying off,NoBiscotti1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dtb87l/yet_another_post_on_hard_work_paying_off/,"I never was a straight A student in high school. I started off with an International Baccalaureate score of 32. Pretty trash (max is 45), not enough to get me into top universities. However, I got lucky and ended up getting a spot at a reputable university for computer science. I decided to move to the UK for Uni all the way from Italy. It sucked, but there were no decent universities in my city.

First and second years were hard. Not because of the course content itself, but because growing up is hard. Some minor health issues also got in the way. Got close to 100% in all courseworks (to do day, I love building stuff rather than studying theory. I would also throw 2-3 times the amount of hours at courseworks than anyone I knew), and about 50-60% in all exams (with a few exceptions). I ended up with just over the highest grade boundary, which in the UK is anything above 70% (my actual average was 70.4%. Calculated). Looking back, however, I see how I was studying only for the purpose of passing the exams, rather than furthering my education.

For my third year I decided to swap courses to Comp Sci with a placement year. Managed to get a decent CV together and landed a year-long internship at a major credit card company. It was my first interview ever. The interviewer skimmed through my CV and got straight to the juicy technical questions. Got asked about C pointers and references... fun stuff. I think the behavioral portion of the interview got me through. Had to move countries again though, ugh.

Nearing the end of my internship I get a return offer by doing an easy in-house interview. My performance during the year was good, so they might have gone easy on me. I decide to decline it because of incompatibility and issues with the location of the office. 

It's now mid-august, and I start feeling the remorse of declining the offer. All my other friends on the placement course have already signed their return offers at Amazon, Microsoft and other top tech companies. I decide to start applying for grad jobs by the end of August. This is where my world turned around. 

Remember when I said I studied only to pass exams? Well, that came back to bite me in the butt. Thanks to my internship and high (cherry picked) course grades, I managed to get through the screening process for two major tech companies. Around this time I was extremely cocky and overconfident, mostly due to having received a return offer. When I got to the online assessment, I completely failed. I couldn't answer a single question. I was shocked and confused. I couldn't wrap my hear around the fact 14 months at a top company and two years of university taught me absolutely nothing about this interviewing process.

These were my dark days. I started getting really bad impostor syndrome. Why, you say? Because I was, in part, an impostor. I had completed two years of university, but I had committed a fraction of the course content to memory. I had no skills when it came to interviewing. On top of that, the minor health problems I had a few years back became major health problems. A few weeks later, I catch up with one of my friends. He was completely laid back with his contracts already signed, and I decided I was gonna do it too. And if I was gonna do it, I would need all the help I could get. This is when I discovered leetcode, CTCI, subreddits. I researched the internet for any tech interview/algorithm &amp; data structures resource I could get my hands on. You name it, I was all over it. Dropped the ego, started grinding.

Fast forward to early November. 75 leetcode questions. 25 rejections. 3 onsites. 1 offer. There was a lot of variation in the companies I applied to, mainly in size (startups &amp; large corporations), and type of work they do. Against all my predictions, I got offered a position at one of the big 4 investment banks as a new grad software engineer. 

And here we are. Started off with a below average high school diploma. Made my way through moving countries, health issues, bad studying habits. If I made it, so can you. There is no excuse. Was luck involved? I believe it was, to a certain extent. Was it as easy as studying free, online material, carefully and at my own pace? You bet. Can anyone do it? Absolutely. Freakin. Everyone.

Life saving tips: Don't compare yourself to others (I did that mistake). Don't study for the purpose of exams. And if there's something you wanna do in your life, start doing it. If it's uncomfortable, boring, tedious, embrace the feeling, and do it until it becomes a habit."

I'm looking to get suggestions on an FPGA board and projects that would help me stick out when it comes to applying to internships. 

I'm currently taking my third computer design course (and fucking love it) and have been using the terasic DE10-standard board for all three classes.  Some of the recent class projects I've done are a hybrid shift/array multiplier and I'm currently finishing a 16-bit RISC processor but we're only designing the control logic. Based on these I'd like to say I'm more than a beginner but I'd really like to learn a lot more to add to my personal projects and also because I really enjoy it. 

I'm open to any suggestions for boards/projects as well as things I can do to land a digital design internship.

Edit: sorry forgot to clarify that I dont own the de10-standard but its what I use at school"

I‚Äôve completed data structures and have pretty extensive knowledge in C++ since my college is mainly C++ oriented. Besides C++, I have some knowledge of python and Java and a few other technologies.

I want to work on a project that would increase my chances of getting an internship. Right now, most of the projects that are on my resume are the ones that I did for my classes. I don‚Äôt mind to further my knowledge in python if that‚Äôs what I need for the project but I need some guidance from someone who‚Äôs already gone through this phase I guess. 

I thought of perhaps creating a tinder bot for the heck of it since it would be a pretty funny project that I can talk about when I goto a career fair. But besides tinder bot, I have no clue on what project to work on. Even if I go ahead with the tinder bot, it would be based on python API‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt know how useful using API‚Äôs for a project and then stating that on the resume would be. So i guess it‚Äôs safe to say I‚Äôm pretty lost on how I should decide on what kind of projects I want to work on my own.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
dtf37d,3,2019-11-08,Adventures of ADHD in the legal field - SPOILER: I‚Äôm going to get fired.,UnholyHurricane,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/dtf37d/adventures_of_adhd_in_the_legal_field_spoiler_im/,"I wasn‚Äôt diagnosed with adhd until two years into my four year program. I‚Äôm studying to be a paralegal, and deadlines are everything. I started my job in the summer as an internship of sorts, and I was kept on in September. 

I was hired specifically because I have knowledge of a niche area of law, in which none of the partners, associates, or paralegals at my work have experience. At first we had a single client with reasonable volume and even though it was hard, I was making do and getting things done on time. 

The trouble started when I went back to school. My hours were cut from 40-50 down to 24 hours a week. In September, the law firm that used to handle ALL of this niche business closed suddenly, and it was all up for grabs. My boss wanted as much of it as he could get. He poached not one, not two, not three, but four paralegals from that firm and promoted from within into my brand new department, all within two weeks. All of a sudden I was responsible for five trainees, approximately 150 transfer files, and a higher volume of incoming files, approximately 4-5x the volume that I had been dealing with on my own. 

It wasn‚Äôt obvious right away, but I came to realize that I have really been shitting the proverbial bed here. I‚Äôm not meeting targets, I‚Äôm not documenting my files the way I should, and I‚Äôm missing deadlines. By the time I sat down to manage my own desk after working with IT and accounting to get the newbies set up, training them on internal systems, and developing processes for the department, I was too far behind and now I‚Äôm struggling to catch up. 

The managing partner, who used to treat me like the golden child now treats me like his red-headed stepson. They don‚Äôt talk to me about anything anymore, and they‚Äôre going to my new trainees for opinions or to discuss another new client they added on. They‚Äôre simply not acknowledging my existence at all. 

I feel like I‚Äôm on the outs and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they let me go. I‚Äôve been running myself ragged trying to catch up, pulling 12, 13, even 15 hour days. I‚Äôve been taking Lyfts to and from work because I‚Äôm so mentally, emotionally, and physically drained. I tried to reach out to my boss for help but he basically said everyone is busy. There seems to be an expectation that I run at full-time capacity on part-time hours. I just barely made it through the first round of major projects and midterms at school, and now we‚Äôre coming up on the group projects and final exams. 

I go in every day feeling like I should just ask my boss if he‚Äôs going to let me go. I‚Äôm really invested in this department (that I helped create!) but if it‚Äôs all for naught I‚Äôd rather just duck out now and focus on school rather than working my ass off and getting fired once everything gets sorted out and they feel like they can let me go. 

Looking for tips of how to manage my desk, approach my boss, or just generally how to succeed in the legal field with adhd. 

Thanks for reading, I‚Äôm going to go cry now."

I need some advice.

I live in Poland. This spring I'll get my Master's Computer Science degree. In the meantime I've worked for half a year for a small Polish company (some random webdev) and did a Big4 internship (sadly no offer due to ""work culture unfit"" despite excellent performance).

I speak Dutch on B2 level (though no certificate) and I was thinking about moving to the Netherlands after graduation.

1. Where and how do I look for a job?

2. Do I have a chance being hired online and then moving or do I need to physically be in the Netherlands for interviews? How do I proceed?

3. When do I start?

4. How much can I expect to earn? I know C++ really well, can do low-level stuff, less Python and Java, but can get around if I have to, got a lick of some less common stuff, like CUDA, assembly, writing your own toy language compiler, OpenMPI. Hate web development and most of network-related problems, but for an entry level position I won't complain too much.

5. How difficult is it to find a job? How long should I expect to stay unemployed?

6. Can I expect that the employer would help me find a (temporary) place to live (assuming I get interviewed online)?

I'll be thankful for any advice. I'm really lost.

Also... there's another plot-twist: I'll be done with my university around March-April, but in February I have an interview at Microsoft in Denmark (my last try to get a position in a big company). I don't know whether to apply for other jobs before being done with this offer or not."

I feel like its much easier to go from a SWE role to a PM role rather than PM to SWE and I'm scared that if I take Microsoft then I wont be able to get back into SWE. At the same time though, I feel like Microsoft is a huge name and it would be a shame to turn down. I thought the Microsoft PM position was more technical, but my interviewers told me that PMs do not program at all. I don't really have experience in either role.

I am also thinking in terms of a full-time job as most interns get full-time offers. Does anyone know what salary development is like at either of these companies(how long do you have to work before you get a raise)? Also, I heard about the Seattle Freeze.

dtkc03,1,2019-11-08,Must Currently Possess Active TS/SCI Clearance...,VonnSkyhawk,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/dtkc03/must_currently_possess_active_tssci_clearance/,"I've noticed a lot entry level positions require a clearance. I assume they're looking for fresh graduates who have received their TS/SCI through some sort of internship. So, my questions is; are employers willing to consider candidates without it? And should I even both applying to these positions?"
dtkdlx,97,2019-11-08,Admissions Rep here! I‚Äôm curious as to why students want to get into a top 40 university.,Luciditi89,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/dtkdlx/admissions_rep_here_im_curious_as_to_why_students/,"So I‚Äôve been following this subreddit for a few weeks now hoping to give advice from my perspective, since I‚Äôm an Admissions Representative from a small private university in Los Angeles. But I‚Äôve been becoming increasingly concerned by some of the things I‚Äôve been seeing and wanted to ask a very important question, why a top 40? 

It‚Äôs really interesting from my perspective as a person who was once a first gen college student and now has a masters degree and is working in higher education as an admissions representive, to see how some people in this subreddit are overvaluing getting into a top 40 school. I‚Äôm really not sure why everyone is hell bent on getting perfect SAT scores, layering ECs, and stressing through 4.0 GPAs. It‚Äôs like if your entire lives depend on getting into Harvard, Yale or Brown for some reason, but I don‚Äôt get a sense of why anyone here is trying to do that? Is it family pressure? Is it a nagging sense that you have to do it? That your value as individuals depend on whether or not a top university validates you? Why not just get into a really good state school or less competitive private university where you will receive top marks while also having the benefit of closer relationships with your professors and staff, and more opportunities for the world outside of the classroom such as clubs, internships or even sports? I‚Äôm not going to lie, all these schools want you and once you are here you are going to be way more valued than you would be while in a sea of other students who score just as high or if not more than you do. 


I also would really like to know what some of your long term goals are. What do you see yourself doing after college and why does being in Harvard or any other Ivy League or top 40 university mean to you that you will achieve that long term goal rather than just breezing through a state school. Because I have to tell you there is no more humbling experience than graduating, being in debt and realizing you are no more better qualified for a job than anyone else with a similar degree and zero work experience. From my experience, what matters more is the connections and relationships you make during your university and no GPA or test score is going to prepare you for that. 

Overall, what really worries me the most is that studies show that Generation Z more than any other generation has difficulty coping with failure. It‚Äôs led to a much higher rate of depression, anxiety and suicide in young people. This has been steadily increasing for a decade and testing culture which prizes your end result ‚Äúscores/grades‚Äù over the amount of effort put in, has contributed greatly to this. I honestly read some of the posts and comments here and feel that it‚Äôs the students who want to get into these top 40s and feel like they have to have perfect grades and scores that are at the most risk.What‚Äôs going to happen to all of you when you get into the school of your dreams and you don‚Äôt get 4.0s in every class? When you struggle and then can‚Äôt internalize that feeling of failure in a way that is healthy and productive? And when that same school doesn‚Äôt have the resources to support you when you do start to become overwhelmed? Or when you graduate and realize the real world cares much less about your grades that you ever did and you don‚Äôt feel prepared for it? Unless you are all planning on getting PhDs and becoming professors (which by the way is a very difficult life track) you are all going to experience it at some point.... and im worried that your current mentalities are setting you up for unnecessary pain. 

I‚Äôve seen it with my own eyes working in higher ed and I don‚Äôt think you understand how hard it is to take an overachiever and try to let them know that failure is okay. It‚Äôs a part of life. What matters is what you do after you fail. It‚Äôs getting up and trying again or trying something different that you excel at or enjoy more because it‚Äôs perfectly fine to change what you are doing if it‚Äôs not working out. What matters at the end of the day is how hard you work for what you want. 

As a side note I‚Äôm planning on getting my Ph.D and becoming a professor. I got high grades in undergrad and grad school (3.8) and now I am working in higher ed. My masters degree has literally meant zip professionally. I don‚Äôt make more money than someone who doesn‚Äôt and I barely have an edge when applying for jobs. No one has has ever cared that I went to a state school. No one has even bothered to ask. I make whatever money and have to have work experience to move up anyway. So now I‚Äôve decided to continue onto the PhD because honestly I was happy in academia, felt like I was thriving and felt like I was valued for the work I was doing. Honestly that‚Äôs what matters. My friend on the other hand graduated with a 2.5 GPA from a private university that wasn‚Äôt top 40 but was decent and got a job immediately after college and has just worked for the past decade (has no loans) and makes almost double what I do to do a job that is half the work. Go figure. 

So with that all said, why do you want to get into one of these top 40 schools? Do you feel you value the prestige of the university over other things such quality of life during your academic career, whether or not the school is a good fit for you and whether or not you will receive the support you need to be successful? And are you prepared to be in a competitive and stressful environment for the four years you are in that school? Is that something you thrive in? Or does it seem daunting? And finally, what are your dreams to accomplish in life beyond getting into a good college? How does your dream school help you achieve your goals?"
dtkx00,15,2019-11-08,A Shadow in the Sun,NeuroticKnight,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dtkx00/a_shadow_in_the_sun/,"Humans are weird, we say it over and over again, you, I and everyone else do I suppose, we say so till we forget what weird is or fail to recognize why, it is ironical for us to claim ourselves as weird, when we are the most familiar of what we know about the universe. But none the less the statement is true, and no more accurate did I ever find it out to be so than when I got used to not being human.  The year was 2835, and this was the ideal future from my childhood poverty eliminated, sustainable energy, AI servants, colonies on Mars and Europa, all problems solved, almost all. This was no magic or aliens, though, it was due to science progressing at its pace and the world protesting and accepting, over and over again.  
Elimination of death through cancer and ageing was one of the most significant scientific hurdles that were overcome in the past millennia. Still, the most significant hurdles were politics and ethics, I suppose. But enough of this tirade, for me to continue. Biological Immortality has been discovered in the past eight centuries or so and human to machine transfer for the past 300 years. The two inventions mentioned above changed the landscape of the world forever, and I know because I was there from the start.  
Born in a small city in rural India, it was always a uphill struggle for me, i managed to somehow squeeze my way into grad school in Scotland and then worked for a few years in India before pursuing a PhD in gerontology in UC Davis, after which I shifted through various jobs until I finally ended up working in Google X labs with Calico, here I was able to work on projects that usually would not get funding finally, I worked on various diseases toxoplasma, cancer and so on, until I was able to put myself into one of the most challenging projects, single. In the late 40s, I had nothing to lose, between weed, vodka and occasional dates or so-called hookups, I was pretty much an average American except for my work. But I was no super genius either, not going to brag on that, I merely had nothing but the science to love for, you see both my parents are dead, I have no wife nor no child, so I am a scientist, and that is all I am and what I would probably be. So my passion was the only thing keeping me alive, so no wonder I strived forth towards it.  
With my passion and dedication, not to mention bit of sacrifice from interns, i was able to finally find a way to  reverse aging by the year 2076, Clinical trials followed the initial tests on mice and it began by the year 2083, 1st human trials started and if all went well we could be selling it soon, me being in my 90s by then volunteered for these trials and needless to say, though not perfect they did their job. We had our 1st working technology by 2091 but caught in a barricade of lawsuits and opposition from religious groups and natural philosophists, coupled with its gigantic costs the system finally reached the public by the year 2051, still expensive , it was now more affordable for the more impoverished people who occupied a whopping 10% of the world population, can you imagine the horror, these people are too poor to afford the public transit system, that they had to drive themselves laboriously to work where they would slave 8hours a day for just a few hundred thousand dollars.  
I remember it being worse in my childhood, but still, it was terrible. But finally all said and done, biological immortality was possible. With this in mind and worth over a century of wisdom, I was one of the most experienced scientists to be alive. However, the body still had a life span of merely 500 years, but as time passed by it became an issue no more, by the time I was 2416, there were neurologically analogous computers and data transfer capabilities that memories were finally capable of being stored in a robotic body, but again this was met with opposition, many choose not too just as they choose against age  engineering systems and  even some of those who picked AES systems decided not also in prefer of a biological existence, however, risky that might be.  
With politics aside and education of the world at 100%. The progress kept on having by having centuries of knowledge and intuition from super-geniuses like me, along with basically unlimited resources, allowed great things to happen. We finally figured out how to build a time machine, It was not too complicated really, an alcubiere shield to protect us from relativistic mass increase and exotic matter fuelled thrusters for travel into the past and a less powerful antimatter engine for a journey to the future. with that built and 1st time travel tested when our colleague john editor appeared in 1990‚Äôs, this off course results in timeline divergence, but it really did not matter to us, It just means that now there are two versions of reality where john showed up and one where he did not.  
Ahem, anyhow getting back to the topic now that it was shown to have been working, the whole team were indeed happy about the results. But none the less we decided not to get too carried away, as we still were not sure of the upper limit of divergence and sending John back Itself was a reckless act that could have wiped out reality. But we did take the risk because, at this point, life was instead becoming pointless. But in any case we agreed to follow through to not mess with time streams anymore. But despite the promise and not to mention the security systems, I managed to hack and sneak in. Security in the Utopia was instead a week I can say, not because of lack of technology, but because the age of plenty brought end of crime and without money, hoarding had no value and people were well good too at least compared to my 20th century mind I suppose.  
So I sneak into the storage vault, being the lead researcher was a plus point and once inside I was curious as to when to go and I decide travel back to 2012, where I meet my girlfriend or at least back then she was before we parted ways I suppose, she had just started to date the past me by then. I track her down to her place, curious yet taken back I meet her in front of her college, she is suspicious as I explain myself, who would blame here. But none the less I tell her everything that would happen to us at 2013 and tell her not to abandon me for whatever reason may be, and that I will never find peace after that, I also tell her about how my past self had anger issues and how she can change me and fix those insecurities and flaws of mine.  
You may ask why i did not tell myself these but rather her, may be because i did not trust myself from back then and found it a reliable option. Let‚Äôs face it, and if a millenia old me can cheat and lie, i have not many hopes for the young adult me. With my wishes done and conversation over, my devices tachyon relayer up that the then me from future, tries to return, since I changed the past, timelines diverged into two, so I can no longer respond to my timeline has diverged (a tachyon relayer works by relaying a particular frequency of tachyons to the past from the future, if timeline changes, the rate of tachyon either changes or disappears indicating whether time alteration has occurred or not). With that done I realise that I am now stuck on this time line, but none the less I decide to go back to my default period anyways, I turn on the antimatter engine, and I accelerate towards the future to see what has happened.  
I notice a future that is good, though not as perfect as mine. Science indeed has improved, along with age reversal, but no immortality and nor is there a time machine. I find the nearest network hub and try to connect, after a couple of minutes of errors, because the new world has been using different protocols, I begin to trace my genealogical records. I fly back to India, a place I have not been too for so long and after scouting around I finally go to a graveyard, and there are two graves one of me and her next to each other, saying, here lies true love. Further data mining provided t that both of us died a few days apart. I  bend down and cry, 1st tear in centuries. I created a universe where both of us were together, yet I was lonelier than ever before. As we never break up, and I am quite happy, with happiness comes peace and acceptance, I never do manage to become immortal and have never found the way, theme in current timeline dies at the age of 98. I sit there and close my eyes and cry, what I do next, is another story to tell.  
Context:  
I wrote this years ago after my 1st break up as a way to deal with my pain, and I am not at Calico nor Davis. However, I am still pursuing a PhD in Aging, I have a girlfriend now, not so alone, but am passionate of science still, I have not found ways to be immortal, but that is why I am doing my PhD lol, I just am a month away from 3 years of anniversary with my new girlfriend. Things have been stable and best as they ever have been. I buried my pain in this story; now I am throwing the story out to the world so that my past is gone too. Also my 1st post here, so looking forward to replies."

Top 2 Canadian CS School graduating May 2020

5 Internships at Canadian tech companies

150 Leetcode done

3 Personal Projects hosted online

Resume reviewed by multiple people online, offline and recruiters

Began Applications: August 2019

Sent So Far: 248

Hackerrank/Initial Screen: 17

(A lot of these hackerranks were sent to all applicants or a lot of applicants so its not unreasonable to assume that doing well in them doesn't mean you will move on)

&amp;#x200B;

Passed Initial Screen: 6 companies

Company 1: San Fran Startup - Failed 2nd round Leetcode (Leetcode Hard)

Company 2: New York Startup - Passed 3 rounds, failed onsite (Leetcoding Day Of)

Company 3: Big-N - Waiting for Final Interview

Company 4: Goldman Sachs - Passed 3 rounds, Failed 4th phone interview

Company 5: San Fran Startup - Failed 2nd phone screen (Leetcode Medium)

Company 6: Seattle Startup - Did 5 rounds leetcode phone/video, failed onsite (full day leetcode/behavioural)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Personal Takeaways:**

&amp;#x200B;

Need to learn to deal with anxiety and stress - this stems from lack of confidence in leetcode skills and overall difficulty of getting a response over hundreds of applications

Improve Leetcode skills: Goal is to get to 300 Quality problems done by January 2020. Comparing the questions I'm getting now to friends who graduated 1-2 years ago the difficulty has definitely gone up.

There is an abundance of qualified candidates. From discussions on Blind, Reddit, CSCareerQuestions, etc. it seems like 200+ Leetcode is a standard that companies expect and companies can pick the cream of the crop. It's always disheartening going to apply for a job on LinkedIn posted 1-2 days ago and seeing 200+ applicants.

There are also many interview stages where correctness and speed won't necessarily pass you to the next round as the other applicant in the pool could've outdone you.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for a Big-N or Unicorn gig with a TC of $90k+ you're competing against thousands of Ivy League (target school) grads, overqualified international applicants, returning interns, and people with referrals for not that many spots. The market is pretty hard to break into as a new grad."
dtla05,64,2019-11-08,I got my first offer 5 months after graduating,bcbfalcon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dtla05/i_got_my_first_offer_5_months_after_graduating/,"5 months ago I graduated from a UC with a B.S. in Computer Science. I had two internships and a year long project under my belt. I had been applying for full-time positions during the school year and got to final rounds with Amazon before the year ended. To top it all off, I was graduating after my 3rd year of school. I thought I was hot shit on the market.

Boy was I wrong.

I didn't pass final rounds at Amazon. By the time I graduated, I had nothing on the table. From then on I spent pretty much everyday on Linkedin applying for jobs and on Leetcode preparing for them.

I talked to some of my friends and coworkers, and a few of them referenced me to a few places, but none of them had a software engineering opportunity at the time. So, I continued shotgunning my resume on Linkedin, then also AngelList, then also my school's job board. I got a few interviews doing this, but again, I eventually failed all of them.

At one point, a family friend in recruiting gave me some tips. First of all, my Linkedin profile apparently was only visible to friends. Secondly, I should be reaching out to recruiters, and make sure my Linkedin profile SCREAMS I'm open to recruiters with opportunities. See, I of course have been given advice like this from family members and job searching articles, but I am somewhat shy and have trouble initiating conversation with strangers, especially when asking for help. I needed to be beaten over the head with advice that I wouldn't really use until I was desperate enough.

So I revamped my Linkedin profile, started getting a ton of messages from recruiters (a lot of it spam so don't just give your resume to anybody), and by the 5th month of job searching, I replied to recruiter who eventually led me to my first offer.

I scrolled through posts on this subreddit A LOT during this process, and I decided to post here to share my experience that, honestly is similar to everyone else's, but I also feel that I learned first-hand what many people advise on here. I definitely asked myself many times, ""Why is this taking longer for me?"" and ""Why are people getting so many more interviews?""

So if you are a new grad who is still searching, or if you are graduating in the future, or even if you took a boot camp or whatever, I want to tell you this:

1. USE YOUR RESOURCES EFFECTIVELY! If you use Linkedin, make sure your profile is open to the public, make sure you use the feature that tells recruiters you are searching. That may be obvious, but I swear I'm not dumb and I wasn't aware of a few things on there that really helped. Use your university's job board if you have one, or the career center if you have one. NETWORK! Ask your friends, family, former coworkers for references or connections. That is literally the easiest way to get a job (most of my friends got a job this way). Use resume helpers to make sure your keywords are appearing on the auto-screeners!
2. Prepare for your interviews, and do it efficiently. Just like studying for a test, you want to know what you are studying for, and you want to do it efficiently. For instance, if you start the interview process with a company, check out what they ask on Glassdoor, find an organized list of types of questions on Leetcode, and practice those kinds of questions. This one is pretty simple, but I definitely wasn't practicing Leetcode problems as effectively as I could be.
3. Be humble and be open-minded. Rejection after rejection, I started looking to other choices. Originally, I only looked for jobs in Silicon Valley, and I only considered jobs at companies like FAANG and the like with super high pay. It didn't take long to move my eyes to Seattle, Austin, New York, and to companies that no one knows about. But that's not enough. The job I eventually got is in the mid west, pays well, and I would not have considered it 5 months ago. It's actually, in some ways, a much better opportunity than working in Silicon Valley. I ended up taking the offer and stopped my interviews with two FAANG new grad positions.

This kind of advice is obvious and repeated on this sub A LOT, but I didn't take it to heart. I wanted to work at Amazon or Google like my friends and live the promised Silicon Valley life I was told was the only way to be respected around here. It's all BS. It's a big world out there with many opportunities and many ways to the top. Be smart, talk to recruiters, network, look for adventures, and know that no matter how many rejections you get, no matter how embarrassingly long you've been job searching, you are intelligent and driven if you choose to be. Don't let yourself tell you otherwise. You will make it.

tl;dr: I had to overcome hubris, social constructs, social anxiety and take advice to heart to get a job. Who would've thought!"

For a long time, I was browsing this sub and reading about how people were applying to hundreds of jobs with no responses, grinding crazy amounts of LEETcode, and going to crazy lengths just to get an offer. I'm sure their experiences are valid.

However, I also want to share my story to show that a different possibility exists. I did not graduate from college. I did not go to a bootcamp. I did not apply to hundreds of jobs. For those of you who are just beginning your journeys, know that it is possible to land a job without jumping through some crazy hoops.

Reading about the lengths that people would go through to get an offer was very demoralizing. At several points, I wondered if I was good enough, smart enough, or capable enough to persevere and make such a big career change. If you are feeling like I once did, I want you to know that it is possible to get a job without doing all those crazy things. That it is possible get paid well, and be self-taught.

I spent a few months studying on my own time, and built several toy projects that I put on my resume. That, along with a nice cover letter, got me an internship where I worked hard and continued to study until I managed to convert into a full time position.

I don't work at a Big N or FAANG, but I make more money as an individual than the median household income in Canada. And that's plenty good enough for me."

dtq5ts,1,2019-11-08,Trying to balance a job search and my last semester. May wait till after graduation to continue the job search....,ArAMITAS,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dtq5ts/trying_to_balance_a_job_search_and_my_last/,"I've been applying to jobs and have starting to become overwhelmed with phone calls. At first I was happy, but know I'm starting to get tired of it. Phone calls from recruiters or someone who saw my resume online. I've stopped responding to some of them. I have gotten three interviews and I'm waiting to hear back. Also, I have connected to 5 different recruiters. No offers so far, but consistently 2-3 phone calls a day.

Know I am thinking I'd like to just focus on completing my last semester and graduating. I am interning, working on the side, trying to study for a cert, studying for my courses, preparing for interviews, etc.... At least one of the jobs I've applied for I am excited to hear back from. Overall I just am ready to slow it down until after I graduate and then focus on getting a job after the holidays. I live with my parents and my internship last till the end off December. I also have plenty of work at my job while I look for a IT job. I'm inclined to wait until late December, and January to focus on getting a job in my career.

I'd think that this a fine idea, but my worry is what happens if I start ignoring phone calls and emails. I want people to think I am interested, but I can't focus my time on responding to phone calls and emails all day. For instance, If a company tries to contact me three times and I never answer, but then I apply there later will they remember and throw my application out?? If I want to put my job hunt on hold or slow it down, what advice can someone give me?

I was just already busy before applying for jobs, and I didn't realize how much work finding a good job was... Feels like a full-time job.

Many places are looking to hire right away, which has been an issues because of my courses.  I'd just like to get through the semester, graduate, and then focus all my time on finding a good job. Like I said, my concern is what happens if I ignore phone calls and emails"

I have recently become more and more frustrated with the full time job I currently have. My coworkers are great. Job isn't that bad either. But the pay and some structural changes are causing awful chaos and I'm looking to get out before the ship sinks.

However, I'm not sure it's truly realistic to get a full time job in CS before I'm even halfway done with the program. Also, the reason I specific say ""full time"" and not some kind of internship is that I am in a situation where I literally cannot afford to lose employer health care. Without insurance my healthcare costs can be anywhere from 3k-10k a month.

Has anyone gotten a job that early in the program (with no prior work experience in the field)? What are some things I could do that could improve my chances? Would a personalized cover letter for each job somehow help my chances?

Sorry if I'm offending anyone.

So I had a bad internship as an embedded systems intern and it kinda averted me from going towards anything with hardware(I'm a CpE major). It was a small company (post-startup) and I would just work alone with only 1 person near me inside a small room. My boss had no social interaction and I barely noticed him engaging in any teamwork. He would be in the room with me all day and just do his work and go home. It was quite depressing and it gives me anxiety when I think about it.

How is the life of an embedded systems engineer? Is there a lot of teamwork compared to a general software engineer or app developer? One of the main reasons I wanted to become a Software Engineer was to be able to work in a collaborative environment and solve different challenges. I'm interested in embedded systems since it's used everywhere but I'd rather work in an open environment that relies on teamwork and communication."

I'm currently in my second year of college, but honestly getting scared. None of my brothers have completed college and when I was 16-17 I kept telling my mom I was going to be her first child to graduate college. I still aim to, it's just so much has came up. My first year of college was okay. I attended a private college which with my big ego and on a high of me knowing I was graduating high school, paid to go to. During my first year I got stuck with a roommate who smoked weed all the time, tried to kick me out of the room to invite boys in for sex (even though she had a boyfriend), she was a huge partier as well. Her boyfriend broke up with her when he found out what she was doing, and I had to deal with her fits, and her calling her crude names. Luckily, my second semester she moved out. However, during that semester I was sexually assaulted, nearly raped (I couldn't bring myself to leave my room all weekend, feeling as I had sinned and felt I almost broke my promise to God that I was to save my virginity till marriage. I saw it as I deserved it because I've done something against God. Luckily this summer at a camp I met a girl who had went through the same thing, which I'll later talk about). Not only that, but tuition was going up to $40,000 a year.

I didn't feel safe at school anymore, and a friend I had made stated she was transferring to a cheaper school, and that I should transfer with her. I saw it as an opportunity and took it. However, to transfer the school recommended good grades, 2.5 GPA, and over 30 credit hours. My grades was A's and B's, I have a 3.8 GPA, and I was working on the last half of my credit hours. However, my friend had a 2.6 GPA, C's and D's, but over 30 credit hours since she was a year older. This caused a strain in our friendship since she applied before me, but I got accepted before her. She's a nursing student who continues to fail her nursing classes, and would blow up on me whenever I suggested she look into tutoring, or changing her major. In the end, I had went to the school, toured, and fell in love. They told me with the scholarships I would receive everything would be paid for. 

Summer rolls around and I go to my orientation, and there I find out that I don't actually get those scholarships because I wasn't studying to be a nurse, or work with science or mathmatics. Thus that mean't my mom and I would have to pay $2,000 out of pocket a semester, something we didn't have. I was feeling stressed, tired, and took a job at a Christian summer camp to help detox and feel closer to my religion. It worked to an extent. I worked as the camp photographer, made good friends with the assistant director, even a few councilors. However, one who turns out I went to high school with kept telling the other councilors that I was ""faked"" and ""hated everyone in high school"" when I legit had never met this girl. I ended up asking my friends back at home who she was, and found out she left school for keying her ex-boyfriends car in the high school parking lot. Well, besides that, when July rolled around, I decided I didn't want to take out another loan for college, and told my mom I wanted to attend the community college in my home town. This was something her and many others tried to get me to when I was a senior in high school, but I was stubborn. 

I was taking Marketing and Business Law at my first school, and it was because people I interned with at a company said it would be the most useful degree, and honestly I had no idea what to do. I had originally wanted to do art, become an animator or comic book artist since I love to draw, but my family wasn't supportive, and this made them happy that I was following this career path. Now that I'm back in town, I had first decided upon Cyber Security/Networking since I honestly love computers just as much as art. Well I was happy with my classes and choice, feeling that I was finally choosing a major I will like, and recently went to the school to set up my schedule for my second semester. My intent was to remain in community college for 2 years before transferring to another college for the next 2 years. However, the school stated I couldn't transfer without getting a associates in art or science. This honestly broke me at the fact that I had to change my major from something I love to something I didn't just to transfer. However, with recent information I got, I've decided to switch it back to cyber security/networking.

However, I found out by my moms friend who's worked in the school system for years that I lose my LIFE scholarship after 4 years, which means I'd have to pay my last year of college most likely out of pocket, and I didn't want to take out another loan. I currently have $5,500 I owe in loans, and my mom owes $6,000 due to the parent plus loan. I get $2,000+ back a semester and planning to save the money up from college to pay my loans off. However, my mom dropped on me that once I pay my $5,500 back, I'm going to pay her $6,000 back. I asked her why in which she stated ""Because I invested in you to even go to college because you said you were going to be my first child to graduate!"". Honestly, since moving back my mom has caused me nothing but stress. She has access to my bank account, and takes what she wants. Whenever I bring up wanting a bank account separate from her, she blows up. She's a full time cosmetologist , and works part time at the store I do. However, she takes days off when she wants, tells clients she's gotta reschedule for random reasons, just because she doesn't want to go in, and then will turn around and go pick up my 1 year old niece from day care to take her out and spoil her.

As I stated before, I'm a full time college student with 8 a.m.'s, and straight after school I go straight to work, to be on my feet for multiple hours, every single day. I only get Sundays off. I get $7.50 an hour, meanwhile my mom gets $10. My mom told my boss she wouldn't work for her unless she got paid $10 an hour, and my boss was desperate for work. Plus my mom only comes in and works for about 2-3 days maybe even just 1, depending on if she wants to work. My mom is an overweight woman, who tells people I'm making her fat since I moved back home. I've always enjoyed cooking and usually cook for myself since she says she doesn't want anything, just for me to come back and see she's eaten all that I've cooked. I try not to be like my mom. I work everyday, I work out to keep a nice figure, and I keep good grades to keep my scholarships. Now this is where I feel it gets worse. I feel depressed and anxious, and have been having extremely dark thoughts such as suicide. However, I don't act on these due to the fear of going to Hell. I've tried going to the doctor to get medicated and help, but I found out that my insurance doesn't cover it. My mother says it's all in my head and I just need to eat healthier and sleep better. 

Back on the thing about my mom taking my money. Our apartment rent is $500 a month and that includes water. When just pay that and the power bill. Honestly not bad. I buy the groceries, pay my own bills, (except for my car insurance, my mom forged my name to have the car put on her insurance since she ""Didn't want me paying my car insurance during college to be a burden""). I even asked her recently how much does my car insurance cost, because now that I'm working, I'm willing to pay, but she kept saying $200+. I've never had a ticket, never been in a wreck, meanwhile she's been in and gotten multiple. One day when I asked while she was distracted on her phone she stated that my insurance was only $120, which I see isn't bad, but now she won't tell me that date I can pay her, and keep the responsibility. 

I feel my mom is becoming more and more toxic. Calling me a brat as she takes $200+ out of my bank account without telling me so she can pay her own stuff instead of working, buying alcohol, etc. When I confront her about needing the money back she claims I owe her for raising me, or that i need to contribute to the family. My family has always said my mom never wanted to work, is very materialistic and wants to be taken care of. It's absolute hell working for $7.50, when bills are coming out and I get scared of even purchasing gas because she's taken so much money out. I mostly been noticing she takes out most of my money at the beginning of the month when rent is due, so I'm mostly paying that, then I make more money, just to see she's taken that out to pay the power bill, then wants to turn around to tell me I pay nothing. It's spiraling me deeper and deeper into depression, and my mom snaps at me stating I have nothing to be depressed about, I have such a good life. Whenever I bring up wanting to move out and find an apartment she throws a huge fit stating I need to stay at home. However, I should finish school a bit early due to taking all my major classes my first year at the other college, and so I should be done by Winter 2020. 

I want to try and get a job with BMW, or maybe some place else and move out. I've thought about contacting BMW and asking about their internships since I know most students that have been working with them that I graduated with get paid enough to live on their own. My mom keeps saying I'm throwing her in a loop and driving her crazy with changing my major and such  when she doesn't understand the pressure I'm under. My best friend should be graduating the same time as me, she's aiming to be a school teacher, and I want to discuss with her about us getting an apartment together. 

Another problem is my love life. I know this sounds stupid as I have all this going on, and then I want to complain about being single. I've never dated before, always putting my studies before anything else. However, now it's catching up to me and I'm feeling extremely lonely. I hang out with friends, but that only soothes the ache for a little while. A guy I once liked, but tried to get over when I found out he had a girlfriend, became extremely abusive towards me when I tried staying away from him to get over my feeling for him. To make this clear, I didn't know he was an abusive prick when I liked him. We went out during the weekends to dinner, cafes, etc. and I felt uncomfortable hanging around him with these feelings and knowing he had someone. When I started distancing myself from him, and talking to other guys, he's demand to know who the guys were, and that I wasn't good enough for them. Luckily I got away from him officially when I went away my first year of college. However, now that he knows I'm back he's been trying to get me to give him my address, and inviting me out to places, which I ignore. 

Another thing is a friend suggested I date guys a few years older than me, something I never really thought about. The bad thing is, is I'm 19, but look 14-15. I look naturally really young, which people tell me to be grateful for, but I just can't. I wear simple foundation, lipstick, mascara, blush, and highlighter. I try to dress fashionably and mature, but people still don't take me seriously. I've talked to a few guys, feeling like we've had a connection, just for them to get a girlfriend a few months later. They tell me they liked me, but me looking like a high schooler made them a bit uncomfortable. My mom says I need to try harder, let her do my hair and make up, but when I told my uncle about this he stated ""There's a difference between a woman wanting to get a man by looking mature, and looking like a slut. Don't let your mother make you look like a slut."" 

I just feel like there's no good guys in my town, I refuse to use dating apps, whenever people at my church try to introduce me to guys it's usually along the lines of ""My daughters boyfriend has a twin! He's not as attractive as him, but still!"" or ""My son is available! He usually tries to impress girls by acting a certain way, or doing this or that, but he has a good heart!"". I honestly feel I should just focus on school, and getting my life together. I know a relationship is a lot of work, but I guess I want one since I feel I'm getting older, and want to experience it? I just don't know what to do anymore..."

I'm having Java here and I'm not really having any problems with it. For my final project I built a fingerprint attendance system using an Arduino and some modules that I connected with a database and a php based page. I had an internship also there for 2.5 months where we used Laravel, Bootstrap and really got to understand and use Git in a team. I feel like I know some things, but nothing that concrete that would land me a job. I also know that companies don't really pay attention to you when you say you're first semester. I can say that it sounds promising because one of my classmates already landed a student job with React (he knew it before coming here) and I'm starting to learn a thing or two from him. If I was to apply I don't even know for what kind of position (front-end, back-end) not even what language. I really need a student-job and I sometimes fell like I can get one, but I don't know where to start. Should I specialize in something and learn more for know or should i try my luck?"

I‚Äôm a junior and I‚Äôve always been told that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs such a big need for people with CS degrees‚Äù or that ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be able to find a job quick after college with a CS degree‚Äù.  But on reddit I constantly see that people  job search for months and apply for tons of jobs and are having trouble landing a job?

I know going in with experience helps a little. I‚Äôve worked at my schools IT department my freshman-sophomore year. Then I landed a internship at This start up second half of my sophomore year. And they said I could keep on working there with no set end date. The others intern has been working there for 2 years and will soon be graduating, and they offered him a full time job. So if i continue working there I‚Äôm sure the same would happen, but I‚Äôm also applying to other internships just try add more experience and try different industries.

So I guess my question is, is it true that it is hard to get a job after college with a CS degree? And what are some stuff i could do that would help me get a job when that time comes?"

I‚Äôm a computer graphics undergraduate with a passion for television and film and have 2 very different offers and I‚Äôm not really sure which is the best option. 
I am a senior and submatriculating for a Masters in computer graphics. 

I will be more than halfway done with the Masters when I graduate with my BS, and I would likely only need +1 semester to finish the Masters. 

If I choose to take a full time job, I have 7 years to complete the remaining courses in the Masters. 

Company A is a major film and television company which has given me a full time offer for a technical role in the TV/Film production pipeline. In addition, because my screenwriting has been doing incredibly well in contests, they offered me a first-look agreement, which is when a studio has you pitch your ideas to them before any competitors. 

Company B is a computer graphics and rendering company, which has offered me an internship for the summer with great pay, relocation, plus meals and transportation. The interview process was exceptional and I really enjoyed getting to know everyone on the team. They were very clear that after seeing my projects with OpenGL/C++ they really want me to work with them for the summer. 

I‚Äôm struggling with this decision because I have applied to Company A maybe 5 times over the course of my college career for internships, but I always received another offer before they replied to me. I have always wanted to work in the film industry and for this company specifically. 

The job application process (as I‚Äôm sure you all know) is incredibly grueling‚Äî I have completed 40+ skype, phone, and in person behavioral/technical/coding interviews since September. 

Company B, however, is a great company to work for as well and it would be easier for me to complete the Masters.  It is directly aligned with the course content of my Masters as well (GPU programming, shaders, rendering pipeline, etc.)

What would you suggest?"

dtyx6s,1,2019-11-09,Caught roommate's girlfriend naked in my room on camera,roomiegfthrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dtyx6s/caught_roommates_girlfriend_naked_in_my_room_on/,"I thought my roommate was going through my stuff when I was out of town so I got a security camera. Lo and behold, I almost immediately catch not him, but his girlfriend, going into my room naked. To make this slightly more complicated, she is an intern at the company both myself and my roommate work at. (Personally I think it's weird to date an intern, but to each his own.)

I approached him and told him to not let her in my room in the future. He asked how I knew at which point I told him I had 1 camera in my personal room and I again asked him to not let her back into my room. He told me she went into my room to check if I was there (obviously a lie, as she was naked) and so I asked him to just text me in the future. I did not reveal to him I knew she was naked in my room.

This has created an extremely uncomfortable situation for me at work as I view this as a serious invasion of privacy and have to see both of them every day. This situation actually happened a few months ago but I recently found out she's been spreading lies to other co-workers that I have cameras all over the apartment among other lies that make me sound like a strange, messy, weirdo. (And I'd like to think I'm none of those things, ha)

I guess here's where the advice I'm looking for comes into play. I feel like I have been/am being harassed at work by her spreading these lies about me. How would you approach this situation professionally and appropriately? Should I involve HR? Should I just let it be? I'd appreciate any and all perspectives on this as it's been weighing on me a silly amount. 

(Also, while I know this is not the legal advice subreddit, does anyone have any input on whether I am breaking the law by having inadvertently recorded her naked? My security camera ONLY records in my room. It is very clearly my personal room and it has no view of any shared/public space in our apartment.)"

I‚Äôm currently in DC attending American University and I absolutely hate this school. I‚Äôm a stats student and the science department at AU is AWFULL to say the least. The students here are absolute idiots who can‚Äôt even do algebra. The TAs know even less than me. The professor, while they know their stuff, don‚Äôt really care about teaching the students. Being a student in statistics, I feel like I‚Äôm not getting the education I deserve. Plus I‚Äôm a nerd and AU is full of political wannabe idiots who act like their interested in politics but can‚Äôt even name the representatives of their own state. The sports programs here sucks too. The basketball team has been absolute nightmare and there is no football team.  The only thing I like about this school is maybe it‚Äôs in a safe area and we have a Upass to use unlimited DC metro rides. 

So my question is, how is the stats department of UMD?? I‚Äôve never taken class in UMD b4?? But based on the account of my friends, UMD has a very stellar and tough stats program. I‚Äôm also thinking about minoring in computer science. My future dream job is to work in data consulting. I think UMD can provide me with the better connections. As far as I know, employers love UMD way more than AU. Tbh, I had a hard time finding summer internship with my AU resume, I landed one by using my connection in high school. 

So my question is, should I consider transferring to UMD?? I currently live in Bethesda so I don‚Äôt think UMD would be hard to commute to."

I'm probably way way way behind on this with respect to internships this year, but hey, better late than never I guess?

I've searched already on this subreddit, and most of the posts I've seen are quite old / contain very mixed responses. So I have a few questions, particularly toward CS upperclassmen:

1. When do most companies take in interns? I get the impression that the window for most of this stuff has pretty much passed for this year, but I could be wrong.

2. How easy / difficult is it for freshmen to get internships? How frequently do freshman get internships? Similarly, where would be a good place to obtain this information? Reddit is all over the place on this question. Something similar to [this](https://www.cmu.edu/career/documents/2018_one_pagers/internships/SCS_Internships_One-Pager.pdf) would be ideal, but I don't believe UIUC maintains anything similar, at least not publicly.

3. Besides personal projects, joining RSOs, and applying a lot, what other things ought I do?

4. I'm aware of a number of internships that might be good to apply to as a freshman, but if there's any that aren't as well known, please drop them down below.

I'm mostly interested in what steps I can do as a high schooler to help increase my chances as I hear that these programs are incredibly competitive. I don't think I will be competetive for T20 school but I hope I will get into a T50 school like UW, Colorado School of Mines, Grinell, or RPI for my undergrad (all of which I am happy with). Are there any other good programs for grad placement that I should apply to? Should I take any programs out?

Also, what should I do in order to help me later on? I'm planning on taking some AI related online courses.

Should I try to get a research position (btw, can I get this at a community college in Washington or no) or should I try to get an internship at a company like Microsoft or a startup?

du31ua,93,2019-11-09,I got a tech job that I love and life is turning up after months of failing. (Relatable post),joom_enhance,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/du31ua/i_got_a_tech_job_that_i_love_and_life_is_turning/,"If you look at my post history, I created a whine post about getting rejected from onsite interviews. I'll link it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cra9ep/got\_rejected\_again/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cra9ep/got_rejected_again/)

I graduated college with 3.45 GPA from UC Santa Cruz in California and it's not that great of a school for CS. I wanna say that I am not that smart either. My background consists of failing all of my AP exams in high school and I am first generation (my parents work at a grocery store) so I don't have the background of a rich kid that went to expensive private schools. I immigrated from a third world country and I still get confused by double negatives in a sentence sometimes. I probably have adhd and have trouble reading for extended periods of time, so I'm pretty average in terms of intelligence and efficiency. I took out loans and consistently tried to not let myself take it easy in college by taking the hardest project based courses to put on my resume and not mention that it was for a class. I never had an internship, and did not have a job lined up after graduating, so I gotta sell myself really well lmao. I interviewed, failed, interviewed, failed and kept doing that until I got my first really good offer at a tech company in October 2019. It's a small company and the coworkers are amazing and there is much to learn about big data tech.

I (and maybe most of you out there) have had this thought cross my mind: ""Fuck, maybe I'm not made for CS. My friends all have great jobs but I'm the only one."" Don't do that. Tell yourself you can get a job and just study til you get it. When you wake up, warm up with applying to a few jobs. Then, memorize and UNDERSTAND those annoying algorithms that you think you'll never use that you learned in school. Make sure you know how to write them with your eyes closed. You need to know them well. Yes, they come up in interviews. Review how to implement data structures. Write them out on a whiteboard regularly as an exercise. Learn hash tables/hash maps. Learn a scripting language and a compiled language that is widely used. My choices were python and java since I am now a data engineer. Learning both taught me to be a better programmer, especially through java's OOP concepts which also comes up a lot in interviews. Whether you wanna be a SWE, Devops, computer security, data engineer, whatever. Review the basics like graphs and sliding window algorithms (look this up, this is a medium-hard and comes up a lot with FANG interviews from my experience). When you're about to sleep, read some motivational shit like this and apply to more jobs. Repeat until you succeed. I did this for 3 months and those 3 months were depressing as fuck. But it's okay. You can do it.

If you're someone that graduated and said (I'm gonna take a break for a few months) without a real good grasp at the things I mentioned above, and never had an internship, or have a good network, you're behind. Hit the books and don't let your CS knowledge expire. Do leetcode RIGHT NOW. Actively seek improvements and don't just let the world beat you and say ""I can't get any interviews..."". It should be, ""I can't get any interviews. Ok, how do I be better?"" My manager loves this type of attitude. It's a thing you have to keep up constantly in this industry.

After getting  job, you'll be beat down with more hardships because of that learning curve of starting as a junior engineer. You'll feel useless (I still do) but it's ok. If you desire to keep learning, you'll be where you want to be.

I'm mostly writing this to help anyone that was in my situation or currently is feeling discouraged at job hunting. It sucks and yes, you really gotta leetcode everyday and look back at your past interviews, what you failed and do them so you know for next time. There's unfortunately no easy route, unless, unlike me, you have a network that can get you a job right away. I want to also stress that you shouldn't accept a job that you don't think you'll like if money isn't an issue for you. Keep looking. But, if you want to start working, then take that job but keep looking still to make yourself happy and climb that corporate ladder.

I also met a really pretty girl in my new city and the first date went really well.

All this uphill means there's gonna be a downhill soon, but right now, life is very nice.

TLDR; Work hard, even if you think you're dumb, and you WILL get a tech job."

I only have two days left after extensions to make a decision.

The area that is making the decision difficult is the type of work. GM was ambiguous on what I might be working in. The work would most likely be more involved with controls software and some electrical hardware. On the other hand, GE digital is pure software, but my responsibilities there are also uncertain. I was told that backend, full stack, and technical product management positions will probably be one of the areas I work in. I would probably be developing data analytics tools.

As someone with a variety of interests, I am unsure as to which position might offer me an experience that could give me more flexibility. I am currently unsure as to if I want to go the full software engineer route or potentially a mix of soft and hardware (like embedded systems). That said, is there one way that might benefit me more than the other? Would having practical experience on working on software in a hardware application (and potentially a larger scale project) be a more versatile experience for future recruiting and learning in general? If I were to go with GM, would competitive swe internships the next year be harder to attain? On the other hand, If I took GE, would a future embedded systems or computer engineering type internship be harder to attain due to a pure software background? I feel that if my interests change from the work I do at either internship, I will not have as much practical experience in the focus area I decide to pivot into.

Just trying to make the best decision that gives me good experience but also the flexibility to be a prepared for recruiting for good computer engineering or computer science type internships the next year.

Also, does anyone have any insight regarding the internship programs at these two companies or working at them in general? Thanks for the help."

Here are my stats: 3.2 GPA, currently Junior standing at a I want to say top 50 CS school in the US, no work experience/prior internships, most of my resume is personal projects I did in my own time.

I wanted to follow up with the current results of my internship search. I applied to 194 companies in total sofar, got 54 rejections, received 18 coding challenges/assessments, 8 phone interviews, 4 final round interviews(3 coming up soon) and 1 offer from one of FAANG. I just wanted to make this post to tell others that if you are in a similar situation, you can definitely pull through with an offer. As my post suggested a few months back, I was really worried because I never interned as a freshmen/sophomore and at the time was panicking cause nothing was working out/I wasn‚Äôt hearing back from companies. Today I accepted the FAANG offer and I‚Äôm happy to say ended the search for a summer internship as a student with no prior internships. What I did from September is essentially apply to any posting in major cities and grind leetcode. I was pretty consistent, managing to do atleast 2-3 problems every day and I think that really helped when it came to the assessments/technical interviews. I also would suggest reading CTCI if you don‚Äôt have a solid basic understanding of the well known data structures because I think after reading through all of the specific data structure chapters, I was able to approach leetcode problems much better and was atleast able to provide brute force solutions for most problems.

* Work experience:   
2 years in tech sales in San Francisco (started out in an adtech closing role at a large public company, now in a BDR role at a decacorn startup). I know I‚Äôm pretty new in my career so there‚Äôs not much to go off of here, but in the next 2-3 years I plan on transitioning over to sales engineering and then eventually product management, hopefully all at my current company. Also an advisor/investor at a B2C startup founded at my alma mater

* Extra curriculars:  
Volunteering with the San Francisco chapter of the largest education media group in the world (you‚Äôve definitely seen a few videos of theirs online), planning on eventually leading my own team.

In the process of starting my own nonprofit that will help coach underrepresented minorities prepare for careers in tech sales. It‚Äôs a popular career for young people and brings thousands of people to the Bay Area every year.

Volunteer and involved with freemasonry.

I was also very involved at university, from starting/leading my own business related fraternity, VP level of 3-4 clubs, taught my own classes, and I held a supply chain internship at a large FMCG company. Plenty of volunteering experience as well: habitat for humanity, street cleaning, food banks, etc. More volunteering while in highschool (spent a month in Indonesia volunteering), amongst other things.

* Hobbies:
Not sure if relevant but I love traveling by myself. I‚Äôve been to 26 countries and plan on having gone to 40 before I apply bschool. I‚Äôve also dabbled in starting a travel tech company so might end up exploring this post grad.

* Undergrad school/major:  
Business management major and minored in philosophy at a public school in California. Think lower tier UC. Studied abroad twice in England.

* Race/nationality: American Chinese male.   

**Stats**

* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): 
Haven‚Äôt taken it yet, I have done gmat prep classes and I am aiming for a 740+ or else I won‚Äôt go to business school.

* Undergrad GPA:
3.0/4. I was honestly a terrible student in college but this was due to my anxiety disorder. I literally could not bring myself to class certain days and would stay up all night on occasion. Its now being managed, and I am taking quant classes at my local CC to make up for it (I was always good at writing so. I will be taking finance/accounting/statistics/economics classes. Will also be taking some coding classes to help break into sales engineering)

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
Long story short, I want to break into management consulting. Working at BCG has always been a dream of mine as I‚Äôm a very logical person who loves applying frameworks to everyday processes. I also think this would be a good way to break into VC and help invest/scout for the next big startup that focuses on social impact, specifically AI and edtech.

* Target schools:
Top 10 or bust. For obvious reasons, Im targeting schools that are known to feed into VC/consulting - Haas, GSB, HBS, Wharton, CBS, Kellogg, Booth, Duke, Tuck, Yale, etc. I know there‚Äôs a huge spread between say Stanford and Duke so in order of tiers: HBS/GSB/Wharton, CBS/Kellogg/Booth, Tuck/Yale, Haas/Duke. Haas is the most realistic choice for me.

Also planning on studying abroad in england again while doing bschool just to keep the theme going (just kidding, mainly to increase job prospects and hopefully work for a company that has networks in both). Looking for connections with LBS and LSE.

I know this is super far in advanced and there‚Äôs not much to work off of (and this is mostly optimistic thinking) but please let me know what you think if I can accomplish this!"

I  need some advice. I would love to spend a couple months (3-6) in 2020 working abroad (preferably in the Netherlands) and then move back to Germany. If I'd still be a student or just recently graduated I'd just apply for an internship.

Starting at a position and quit right before the probation period ends? That sounds like a dick move to me.

**Bloomberg:**

Pros:

Good culture

Intern program seems really developed

Gives interns housing so will probably be more fun

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

Possibly being put on a team with legacy tech

&amp;#x200B;

Neutral:

NYC

**A to Z owned by Blue Founder**

Pros:

More likely to work on a project with a modern tech stack

More prestigious though they seem to be letting in anyone who can code these days

Cons:

WLB issues/Meh Culture

&amp;#x200B;

Neutral:

Seattle

&amp;#x200B;

Location/Pay isn't really a factor for me since they both are in tech hubs/pay similar. I do want to note that I am not really interested in full-timing for either of these companies since full-timing at Bloomberg puts me in a position to get stuck with doing legacy tech while full-timing at A to Z owned by Blue Founder is not great since they want to work you to death.

CGPA: 8.9/10.0

TOEFL:115

Internships: I have done a two month internship in the biosciences department of Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, a three month internship at a bioinformatics department in an industry. Both the internships are in the related fields.

I do know the basics of programing languages and have used MySQL and Python (am solving the problems on Rosalind.org. It is an awesome site)

I am currently writing a review paper under one of the profs who is giving me an LoR. Otherwise there are no publications.

Besides this, I have completed about 2 online courses in bioinformatics, and machine learning and attended a couple of workshops in the related fields.

The thing is, the universities in which I like the research work of the professors, I feel it is too ambitious for me. Probably it is this feeling that there are a number of people better than me and obviously they'll pick them over me. And this doesn't help in the application process.

I'm really looking to move out of my home town in Ontario, Canada. Other than applying to neighboring cities near me, I've been completely blind about where would be a good place to look for work. I'm very up for going international, if its an option. Whether that means Europe, the States, Australia, whatever.

What are some cities that are little-known good environments for someone in their mid-20s who would like to be very career-focused for the next \~5 years?

I spoke with the new manager and it seemed alright, but it's been a week after starting and it's extremely clear the new team is just overworked and needed more people, and the job seems to be maintaining legacy systems even after I graduated with a master's degree, while the old team was working on some more modern stuff that was really in line with my skills.

Not top tier, but close. I have a very good GPA, but no real experience... no big projects outside of school, no internships. The real problem, however, is that I'm graduating three semesters early. This puts me into Limbo where I may graduate without anything legitimate under my belt.

Taking this information into account, I'm wondering, is there any value to employers in graduating that young? Will any employer take into account that I have a BS at 20 years old, or is that not a consideration? A year and a half of experience must be more valuable than a year and a half of school, but that would depend on me getting a job without anything but a few IT jobs and websites on my resume, which I'm not confident will happen.

I'm considering staying and either getting an MD in CS or Triple Majoring in CS along with Mathematics and Philosophy. Would either of these be wise options? These are all very compelling options to me as someone who enjoys learning but I want to make whatever decision makes the most sense career wise, and I feel like that's graduating early.

Please consider this in a vacuum. I don't enjoy the college life style, but I'm more than happy to stay and keep my eyes on the prize if an MS or Triple Major would be significantly advantageous. Money is not an issue either, as it's a state school that's offered me lots of aid due to personal circumstances.

I sincerely appreciate any advice. I'm not really from a place where I have anyone I can ask about this and get a real answer. I was hoping my advisor and career office could help, but I came out of my meetings disappointed. I know you guys aren't being paid like they are, and  don't give a fuck about my personal problems, but you're here. Thank you.

You can view an example of the blog portion of Center by tapping Learning Center Blog on the Homepage and the Contact Page by tapping this label in the menu. The front end of the Message Board can also be viewed in the Menu section.

Student users need to be gathered to provide feedback on the blog and test our prototype. Further development will then be needed to refine prototype functionality.

We have a plan to complete the development process and the goal line is now clearly viewed. We all look forward to exploring your joining our team PT to help this talented crew across the goal line!

We can discuss during our phone meeting

**Twice Shy, Exile**

**The Exile Fleet, Flagship, Mars Orbital**

"" Attention Admiral Rowan. We have processed the translation information. Language capacity is now sufficient.

I am Acting Command of the Exile fleet.

It is with sorrow that I must explain. This fleet may never return to the Many. Our actions contradicted the will of the Conclave. That is forbidden. We have chosen Exile rather than participate in the genocide of your people.

The Conclave may resume it's offensive.

The previous Admiral of this fleet was carefully chosen by the Conclave. He is a Germaphope. They showed him the footage and reports from the fall of the first empire. It called to his deepest fears. That led to his shameful behaviour.

The ISS Many Eyes is exempt from this exile. They will have to defend their decision to issue a First Contact edict and we will use them to transport the Admiral back to the Many. He should face charges. However that is up to the Conclave.

We understand that you may imprison us. Our brief study indicates your rules of war are applicable to us. Please advise your intentions. We will accept your decision.""

**UN Command, Mars Colony**

""Admiral McMahon, our thanks for your actions. Mankind will be forever grateful.

However. What are we going to do now? We are not equipped to intern eleven new species.  We don't even know how to intern one. We cannot let them roam around while the Many still intend to attack. Not all of them rebelled. You took the surrender. Do you have any ideas?""

**Admiral McMahon,**

""Sir, I suggest we give them refugee status. They can't go home. They are already in a prison they chose in order to save us. It would be petty and stupid to punish them.

I agree we can't let them roam around. It would probably kill them anyway.

Mars Orbital is empty. It is sterile. I suggest we give it to them. Let them rebuild it as they wish. In return they can serve us. We need their technology. We need to figure out how not to infect them. It's the best solution I can come up with.""

""Thank you Admiral, we will let you know our decision.""

**The Herald, Admiral McMahon commanding**

""Attention Acting Command of the Exile fleet.

This is the formal decision of the United Nations of Earth.

You are not prisoners of war. You are accorded Refugee status. We are granting the Mars Orbital to you. You will be provided all necessary materials to rebuild it as you wish.

Other than a peace treaty and the understanding that we both obey your First Contact protocol, there are no restrictions. We will establish an Embassy and medical facilities on the Orbital in order to facilitate our cooperation.

You may govern as you wish, provided it is not any form of government banned under our laws. Please feel free to establish a Conclave quickly. We will appoint a suitable ambassador. We also ask that you appoint an ambassador to the UN. We will need your assistance in our relationship with the Many. You are not required, and will never be asked, to enter any future conflict between Earth and the Many.

**Acting Commander of the Exile fleet**

""Admiral Rowan. I am deeply grateful for the welcome your world has offered. I will inform the fleet. Speaking for myself and my ship, thank you.""

**First Conclave of Mars Orbital**

""We hereby ratify the treaty with the United Nations of Earth.""

**First Minister of the Mars Orbital**

""I don't understand these Humans. We tried to kill them. They granted us the greatest construction their species has built. We resigned ourselves to prison and exile. We have more freedom here than at home. Why?""

**Ambassador to the Earth, former Acting Commander of the Exile Fleet**

""They dream of a welcoming universe. Our attack was the worst injury we could have inflicted. Not the dead, they live with death always on their world. It was the dream we attacked. To them, giving us the Orbital gives them back the dream. They can hope again.""

**First Minister**

""We have not been alone for a long time. Then we sealed the border and called them killers. The first empires fall was our mistake, not theirs, yet we punished them for thousands of years.""

**Ambassador to Earth,**

""I have read the ship reports from the derelicts they found. I would have shot the crew. Sloppy, self-centred and irresponsible only begins to describe it. No wonder they buried the reports and blamed some monsters in the dark.""

The reconstruction of the Orbital continued. The drone workers followed the new designs provided by the Conclave.

The Earth began construction on its own Orbital. The first FTL ships Mankind had ever built began construction. The whole world turned its production to the project. At the back of everyone's mind was the fear of a new attack. One less inclined to surrender.

**The Herald, Deep Space Surveillance fleet**

""Admiral, we have a contact incoming. They request contact. Identified as the ISS Many Eyes.""

""Put them through.""

""Welcome back. I hope you bring good news?""

**ISS Many Eyes**

""Greetings Admiral Rowan. We are pleased to meet you here. Our news is for the Exile Conclave.

However we are willing to share with you in the spirit of first contact. The Conclave of the Many has disowned the Exile Fleet. They are forbidden from returning to Many space. The Admiral has been promoted and retired. He will never serve again. No further action will be taken against Human space.

You are forbidden from entering Many space. We will act as unofficial Ambassador to the Exile Conclave and Human species. We will resume guarding the borders.

Speaking frankly, this whole episode has severely embarrassed the leadership. I would expect the Conclave to remove them shortly. Many of the exiled are connected to powerful factions in the government. I advise you to wait.

Do we have your permission to approach the Mars Conclave?""

**ESA Herald, Admiral McMahon**

""Thanks for the update. Your approach isn't up to me. We have a representative of the Mars Conclave on board. They will let you know.""

""So it's true that you gave them independence? We heard rumours, but it is difficult to understand. Do they not pose a threat to you?""

""It was their honour that saved us. We have no doubts about our alliance. The Conclave Ambassador says you are welcome to approach the Orbital."""

I've been reluctant to apply to Revature but I feel like I'm at the point where I don't have the option to choose what I want to do. I've heard that Revature provides really good training program, which I think I need because I don't know much at all to be honest even though I have graduated with a CS degree. I don't mind the extremely low pay since right now i just need experience, which I have none at all, nor any internships. My biggest gripe is that I value work-life balance above all else but I've heard that I'd basically won't have that at all if I join Revature. I was wondering is that because most people joining Revature do not have a CS background so they struggle to grasp new concepts which causes the extra studying and work after hours? Basically what I'm trying to see here is that since I already have a foundation, would I still find myself working way past work hours?

a few days after the third interview, a different recruiter reached out to me, saying she wanted to schedule an interview with HR and asking my availability. i replied immediately, and then...i never heard from her again. i followed up three different times, and nothing. i even reached out to the initial recruiter, and he replied that i wasn't his recruit anymore (?), and he cc'd the other recruiter and said she would give me an update. she still didn't.

THREE ROUNDS at this place, and the recruiter just ghosted me--after asking my availability to schedule an interview! i invested over 3 hours into them, and they couldn't invest 10 seconds to send a cursory rejection email. a couple of my other friends who applied here had similar things happen, so i know it wasn't a freak thing. i was so mad about it that i ended up emailing the CEO, but i wanted to warn everyone else about it so y'all don't end up wasting your time"

I have initiated myself to beginner level programming with Python and now do web scraping and web automation with Selenium, and I also made a basic tool to help calculate derivatives in my calculus course.

The Universit√© de Montr√©al, where I will be going next year, has recently opened a B.Sc program in bioinformatics, with possible specializations in genetics, molecular medicine, software engineering, theoretical computer science or statistics.

I'd like to ask a few questions:

1) What place do you feel problem solving strategies take in your work? In a correct, rigorous, and methodical approach, is it better to find better, optimized and creative ways to evaluate a dataset, or do you prefer to consistently apply an organized, unchanging method?

2) How did you first hear about bioinformatics? How many of you are from a pure computer science background?

3) Do you feel like your work is done alone, or in a team? Do you need to frequently explain your work and your results to wet lab scientists?

4) How much of your work is spent coding? Do you also write research papers, teach students, or give talks to other scientists?

Hi,

I am currently a junior going into my third year in Engineering. This past summer, I had my first exposure to a ""real world"" job, working for as a project engineer intern for a general contractor. I was extremely nervous on my first day, did not sleep at all the day before. I thought that the nerves would dissipate, but unfortunately, I had performance anxiety throughout the duration of the internship; this was something that affected my focus at work to a substantial degree. The pace at which things would change and new information was thrown at me made me feel completely overwhelmed and like I couldn't keep up. In school, it was very easy for me to hide my slow processing speed: I would not overcommit myself to extracurricular activities, I would take minimal course loads, and I would always study ahead of lecture so that if I lost focus, I would be ok. I don't work during school, so fitting that into my schedule isn't an issue either. I always had a textbook to fall back on, and I wasn't on ""someone else's schedule."" I could work at my own pace, when I wanted to, how I wanted to, with little distractions from emails or coordination. I know I am smart enough to tackle any problem given enough time; the problem was that I never felt like I had enough time this summer; between meetings, (both internal and external), emails, and everything else that a ""typical"" work environment contains, I felt like I never could actually sit down, think about, process, react, and act in time. Combining this adrenaline and overwhelm with a 2.5 hour commute, I felt exhausted and brain dead by the time I got back home 5 days a week. On the weekend I would just count down the hours until Monday, dreading going back. The idea that this is my life for the next 40 years after I graduate is extremely depressing. I know that there is a learning curve to any new job, but by the end of the summer I felt like I was still slow on the up-take. There was another intern sitting next to me, and the number of things she could cover in 8-hour work day seemed like twice as much as what I could handle. The amount of technical jargon, terminology, acronyms, and other vocabulary that I was exposed to and had to know felt like too much. I really tried my best, but often due to distractions around the office, such as phone calls, conversations, etc (particularly listening to the speed of everyone furiously typing and clicking away bothered me) I would lose focus and the fear that I was not doing the job fast enough continually burst into my mind and flooded my senses. I would often forget where I had placed things in the computer hardrive or lose my train of thought, and maintaining a sense of organization amid what felt like controlled chaos was incredibly difficult. I had the sensation that if I was full-time, any second I would be fired. Not only that, but office power dynamics and social politics (office banter) was also something that confused the hell out of me. People would ask me questions about myself, my goals, and my interests, but often I was so wrapped up in what I needed to do that day that I couldn‚Äôt react or respond. *I felt like an idiot every day and felt like I was being judged or stigmatized for it; the only way I learned what to do was by doing it wrong the first time and getting feedback for it; even after that I would still make the same mistake over and over again. Even things as simple as Microsoft Office email management/filing would trip me up. What was especially frustrating was that everyone seemed incredibly patient and supportive. I just felt like I couldn‚Äôt keep up, and I felt like I was not contributing to the group in any meaningful way.* During check-ins with my supervisor I would continually slip up on speech and explanations. One particularly fervent memory of my work-speed is when I presented a budget spreadsheet I had been working on for the past two weeks; my boss made changes in excel, completely changing up the spreadsheet within the period of around 30 minutes, using all the keyboard shortcuts and tips/tricks that I didn‚Äôt know. During meetings I caught myself zoning out and using it as a ‚Äúmental break,‚Äù and I would clock-watch, counting down the hours to when I had to leave. Often when everyone else was packing up I would still be writing an email, or performing some other task that should take 5 minutes but for some reason was taking me forever. After 2.5 months of this, I grew a lot personally, but by the end of the experience my lip was half-chewed through due to anxiety. There was this image that popped into my head of me literally sleeping nights at the office (which I heard from one of my co-workers that he had actually done). This is also aggravating my FOMO sensation. I am in my 20s. This is the time in my life where I should be young, full of energy, vibrant, and exploring life, going out with friends and partying every Friday night. I have actually deleted my social media because it is giving me intense feelings that I am somehow not enjoying life to the fullest extent I should be. I am now half-way through my junior year, and while many people may see adult life with a job as the ‚Äúlight at the end of the tunnel,‚Äù for me this transition feels like it is approaching way to fast. I don‚Äôt know what to do when I graduate; the thought of getting a job that requires me to work at this pace and handle a million different things at once is terrifying, on top of the extra stuff such as health insurance, credit management, and taxes that I know *absolutely nothing about*.

Another aspect that drove me crazy about my summer job was the realization that what I learned in school *really didn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of things*. I have always been a good student, focusing on grades and academic performance as my top priority and placing this above networking opportunities, clubs, sports, socializing, and other extracurriculars. This is partly because I take a long time with my assignments. In engineering, you need to be very precise with your work; stupid mistakes due to lack of attention to detail or simple algebra is not looked kindly on in the grading process, so I always make sure to triple-check my work before I turn it in. The problem is that my grades have come at the detriment of other personal/professional growth experiences, such as learning communication, time-management, and soft skills as that ultimately seem to be way more important towards success. Handling ambiguity in a problem that doesn‚Äôt have a textbook solution or any sort of curriculum is incredibly challenging for me as someone who is used to having clear expectations/assignments and being told exactly what to do for assignments. The idea that relationships (EQ) and adaptability (AQ) rather than a grade (IQ) is what is going to determine my success after college is really messing with my head, because while I am great at the latter I feel very underprepared or developed in the two former skills.

I am at a point where I am intent on finishing this engineering degree, but I am ridiculously scared of what is going to happen afterwards/whether or not I will be able to get a job/career in the field of engineering and science. Many of the jobs that I am looking at want a master‚Äôs degree, but this is a) not something I can afford until I work first and b) not something that I want to invest in until I figure out what I want to do and whether or not I would enjoy doing it. It seems to me personally like the stress of engineering (at least construction management) is not worth the higher pay; ideally, I have a job that only requires 40 hours a week and I enjoy doing and that has minimal stress (don‚Äôt we all). I have looked into maybe a research career, or something that is a lot slower paced, but I don‚Äôt have any undergraduate research experience to brag of, and whenever I try to get involved in research I end up dropping it because the engineering assignments take me way too long to complete. At this point in the semester I feel lost and guilty. My family and I are spending a lot of money on my education, and if I don‚Äôt figure out how to use my degree or overcome my phobia of a real-world job before summer of 2020 rolls around, I will essentially be treading water. I have debated dropping out and taking a gap year to gain work/world experience and perspective, but there is a stipulation at my school that you need to complete the engineering degree in four years. I can‚Äôt go back to what I was doing this previous summer: I know it will be too much, and I need to try something different. I have the same feeling that I had during the weekends this summer, of counting down the time until I need to show up again, but this time its over a much longer period. By comparison, this entire school year has felt like a massive vacation, which, though relaxing, has completely ridden me with guilt. I am dreading the family dinners and meetings, where other relatives (siblings, cousins) will be discussing their professional career aspirations, and I will literally be left with ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know at all.‚Äù Everyone else in my family is either working full time or ambitiously attempting to start their careers; I should be able to handle it too, right? Does anyone know of any slower-paced engineering jobs or how to overcome ergophobia (fear of work/employment)? Apparently, this is an extended form of social anxiety as well, which I think fits the bill for me completely. There has been this weird sense of shift from stress in the summer to depression currently, and life doesn‚Äôt look very amazing/optimistic right now. All I want to do is sleep, I have trouble getting out of bed in the mornings, and I know that this is all gonna eventually come bite me in the ass when the student loan payments start rolling in. Please offer some advice and/or guidance. Thank you."
duo8p3,3,2019-11-11,Which internship offer should I take?,ngwattcos,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/duo8p3/which_internship_offer_should_i_take/,"EDIT: I know there are several posts on this subreddit similar to this, but I feel we could all use a discussion specifically on pitting together an established company vs. a promising (but early-stage) startup.

&amp;#x200B;

Context: I'm a sophomore CS student. I recently got two offers, one from an established company that provides **talent acquisition software** and another from an early-stage startup (\~30 employees) that has ***deceptively*** ***huge*** networking potential. I wonder which of these two companies provides a better balance of professional growth and resume booster, in order to maximize my chances at a FAANG internship next year.

In deciding between these offers, which criteria should I prioritize? (For example, since I'm a 2nd-year student, could I afford to intern at a less-known company?) Basically, here are some of the facts and my initial impressions so far:

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of the established company**

* well-defined role - I most likely will be matched to a project according to my preferences (front-end role)
* if matched to a front-end role, I have the potential to impact thousands of users, since the front-end is customer-facing
* located 5 mins from my house (east coast)
* will definitely be exposed to software development best practices / industry-grade code
* established internship program - the company has had this program for 5+ yaers
* pay is average at $20/hr for 40 hr/week

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros of the startup**

* ***ridiculous networking potential*** \- CEO &amp; several of the CTOs are former VPs (leading 1,000 - 12,000 employes) of a \*leading\* tech company in CA
* amazing pay ($9000/month)
* due to the variety of tasks to be completed, I have the potential to explore all my interests in full-stack, front-end, and maybe even ML features

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons of Startup**

* virtually unknown company. I could tell you the name of the startup and you won't even find it on Google ;) (on the other hand, a good number of people will the name of the CEO...)
* located in CA. I live on the east coast, so I'd have to handle housing and transportation.
* exempt position. I'm not salaried per hour and there's no set work hours per week.
* this is only the 2nd summer they're taking on interns

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have several questions to ask. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

1. Am I paying attention to the correct criteria?
   1. Since I am a 2nd-year student, does it \*matter\* in the short-term that the company I'm interning at is virtually unknown? For example, I'm trying to get a FAANG internship next year as a junior. Would an early-stage startup \*hurt\* my chances in comparison to a more established company?
   2. On the other hand, how valuable would a connection to/endorsement from/reference from the CEO be (he's the former VP of a division of 12,000 employees I mentioned)
2. I'm looking for a good balance between mentorship/resume booster/impact. Are my assumptions on mentorship potential correct? For example, the startup \*promises\* very good mentorship from its variety of employees (which include some former Google &amp; Facebook engineers). But I don't know what kind of \*standards\* I could expect to be exposed to for a software product that hasn't (but almost) been shipped yet. Conversely, can I expect to learn good, industry-grade software habits at my local tech company?

I may have more questions later. If you've read through the block of text, ***thank you***! I would really appreciate any advice or guidance on my decision."

In a year I will graduate with my master's degree in Computer Science in Italy. I am considering moving out to look for a job as a software developer in Germany as first job. 
I ask you:
1. Is it possible without prior working experience? If yes, how much hard would it be for me finding a job? (I have not a specific city in mind but I would like something not too small)
2. Is it possible landing a job without knowing german? My idea would be to learn it there mostly. 
3. Which position should I look for if 1&amp;2 are satisfied? Should I look for a internship or a junior position? 

Thanks to everyone, any more suggestions are welcome."

dutnuj,21,2019-11-11,Black women are dealt a shit hand in life and it sickens me,DeathcampEnthusiast,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/dutnuj/black_women_are_dealt_a_shit_hand_in_life_and_it/,"Yes, this is a long one. It starts with my personal experience and ends in a love ballad for what I think is one of the most beautiful things on the planet. And I -honestly- do not give one single fuck if you disagree. They deserve to have other people standing up for them.

They are dealt a shit hand that is completely undeserved. And before you all think about that disgustingly overweight whale covered in tattoos with awful nails, an ill-fitting wig, fat that just waxes and wanes everywhere and makes proper dressing impossible, bad fake lashes and a voice that could cut glass.. let me stop you right there. Those women excist in literally every skin colour, they're just *trash*. The black community definitely doesn't have the monopoly on women like that. But we see them shoved in our faces on the tired medium of TV and film because executives are too afraid to do something new because, oh god, 1 person less might watch and how will I fill my garage with new Mercedi? 

So, we're stuck with that awful stereotype of a getto shank who yells, goes ""hmmhmm you go girl"" and ""don't need no [x]"". It's tired, trite and plain fucking boring.
Most probably will have guessed I'm a white bloke and the place I grew up in was moderately mixed. Where I live it's quite white but my schools were a bit mixed. Growing up my best friends were never white and that's something I only realised recently. I don't know why that was but boy, did we have fun. I mostly dated white because I was always told black women aren't interested in ""us"". I can't dance, I don't listen to ""their music"", I'm not festive enough, etc. It bummed me out massively but like everyone's life mine went on and I happened to meet women I'd date and again: most of them were white. Some other ethnicities, but never black. Because through various media I was told they weren't into me since I was white and I just wasn't cool enough. 

Then years ago I was hanging around with this girl who was being such a massive bitch to me, but who kept giving mixed signals. I was discussing this with a Jamaican female friend who I thought was one of the most beautiful girls I'd ever seen. She was sweet, her voice was lovely, a most adorable giggle, a nose that made me smile, she had such a pleasant disposition, and how she moved.. She just made me happy when I was around her. She gave me her opinion on it all and added ""unless I'm so far back in the friend zone you can't hear what I'm saying"". I don't know what happened, but suddenly my entire life narrowed down to one option only: I need to tell you I'd much, much rather date you.

I didn't know if she felt the same, we'd been close for a while but since I had been brainwashed into believing no black woman could ever feel about me like that I didn't know what would happen. But I also felt in my entire being there was only *one* choice for me. So I told her. I think it surprised her, but she was really up for it. We were together for a while. One of my fondest memories is a hotel room where we staid while visiting things in the city. She was doing her hair in front of the mirror with the music softly playing and absent-mindedly she swayed in a way that made me feel warm. I couldn't do that if my life depended on it. God, how I fell for her... Eventually it ended because we were in a different place in life and with that place came different needs. But she was and still is a great girl. Now, carnally.. it was something else. No, I'm not going with the tired ""oh they're animals in the sack"". She paid a tender sort of attention to me that was new to me, and that I haven't experienced with any white woman. Before nor after. The connection was unbelievable, no walls.

Years went by and I just tried to get ahead in life. But something had changed. From time to time I'd see a girl from my car or while walking around that would affect my whole physique. I don't mean I'd get hard, I mean my body would almost contract at that much beauty in one woman. Usually my mind feels sort of chaotic, but some women would bring it to a complete stand-still, I could only look and take in the absolute beauty. All those women were black. 

It would take some years for me to meet a tiny African American girl with a very large mouth. Not a crass or loud mouth, but someone who is fiercely proud of who she is. Someone with whom I'd enter a very complex relationship, but one that taught me a lot. The inital phase of getting to know one another was very interesting and fun. I felt more comfortable around her and she didn't make it a secret she was into me. Often we'd call later in the day and discussed things going on in our personal lives, in the news, things we'd seen, etc. But early on she told me she hadn't dated a white guy before. I felt that meant something so I made that into a conversation. I wanted to know the how and why of that, and it turned out she just didn't trust them. Which made me feel that was rather a racist remark. But then came the stories, and the shift in my outlook, and why I will not accept anyone shitting on this beautiful demographic.

Now, this girl is very intelligent. She's working on quite the degree, one that should result in a life of plenty. We ended up discussing the job market and she told me that someone in class had raised his hand (I believe during a conversation on internships or jobs) and asked what he should do if he didn't want to work with ""certain people"". At first that didn't phase me, I met so many people at university that I'd rather set ablaze than work with. He didn't mean *shit people*, though. He meant *black* people. Now, that did phase me. Not just having the mind that a) forms that question, b) asks that question, c) asks that question out loud with people around, d) expects a serious answer to that, and e) hopes to be allowed to not have to work with black people. Also that people like this are alive and draw breath. I've obviously seen racism. I've had jobs since I was a very young lad and I have worked with people who weren't fans of certain demographics and who were vocal about that. But if they had colleagues from said demographic they'd treat them like anyone else. Or people who are vocal about their dislike but apart from casting a wasted vote don't do anything else. So, hearing about one in the wild was rather new. What's also new is that I realised that if someone pulled that shit at my current university he/she'd probably be asked to leave by the professor and would most likely not be allowed back. It stuck with me and I carried that around. Like the image of people wearing red caps at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. I went from 'very tasteless' to realising that it isn't *tasteless*, it is meant to send a message. It's not just the ignoring of a very reasonable plea, it's the ridiculing that comes with it.

I wondered out loud if maybe these were clueless young men. Let's be honest, all men around twenty have an atrocious sense of humour. They cross boundaries, say things they know they shouldn't just for effect, attempt to be edgy.. it's a shit show. But then she told me she had a black, female professor who was at a conference and who was scheduled for a lecture. After the lecture she was congratulated by some people who ""almost hadn't come when they saw who spoke"" and who were ""surprised"" that she was so ""articulate"". Articulate. Yes. That's when I was introduced to the World of the Dog Whistle. What they were saying is that they were surprised such a monkey could string that many words together in a coherent fashion. They wouldn't have gone up to a white professor of quantum mechanics and said ""Oh and you were so articulate, sir!"" Because unless you're at a conference of people with Down's Syndrome, why would you think anyone *speaking at that conference* wouldn't be articulate? This wasn't cluelessness. Anyone attending a conference in that field couldn't possibly be this fucking thick and make it. This.. was racism. It occupied me greatly.

The more I followed the news and current ""outrages"", the more I saw my now girlfriend was right. Not in the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon way, I'd spend time going through it and try to see if someone was merely being stupid or had pernicious intentions. And I sadly concluded that a lot of my white brothers and sisters, actually, were much shittier people than I had realised before. I was a very early user of the internet and used it to dive into communities I knew little about. I was fascinated by the far-right websites and their hilarious discussions. It felt like monks in the Dark Ages having aggressive discussions about how many angels could fit on the head of a pin. Useless bullshit, but it keeps us occupied. I began to realise that more people honestly subscribe to this than I realised.

When we got to the subject of dating she said that black women were ""at the bottom of the barrel"". Her words. At first I thought she was just disappointed with the men that had tried to court her. Then I went online and again my trust in the human race was eroded a little further. Of course OkCupid had some data on this. It showed that no ethnicity had black women as a preference. None at all. On Reddit I found a whole host of topics where black women voiced dissatisfaction over being seen as a mere fetish, a ""dirty secret"", something to fuck in silence but dear god, not something to bring home. You don't want your friends to see you with one of *those*, let alone your parents! It was either that, or not being seen as an option. They talked about feeling sad, alone, unwanted and ugly. The women described or showed themselves, they ranged from voluptuous to skinny, from light skinned to dark skinned. A wide range with only *one* common trait.

And while this may seem meandering and boring to most, I felt it necessary to introduce my anger and disappointment over it. Because what I have come to find is that black women are a fantastic, warm, and highly enjoyable demographic. A group that is overlooked, ignored or viewed with disdain. Often distaste even. Something for which -painfully enough- there isn't even a reason. Apart from the fact that the stereotypical getto skank is something we're all fed in so many forms it gives us the impression they're a majority. The clueless white hero needs a sassy black friend, one who snips her fingers and goes ""hmhm"". Or as a spiritual guide. But only rarely as a serious character that is fleshed out. Or -god forbid- starring in a major picture. They have been made into nothing but wallpaper, a comical addition that doesn't need to be taken seriously. But they do need to be taken seriously. Yeah, they like fake nails, wigs and lashes. But do you know why? It's highly likely you don't, and maybe that's okay. But there is a depth behind what we're shown that is left out and that makes them look ridiculous. On purpose.

The variation between black women is as huge as it is between white women, Asian women, native American women, blondes, brunettes, etc. Some are very petite, some are voluptuous, some have a massive behind and some have a flat butt. I -unapologetically- happen to think they are beautiful. From light skinned to deeply dark, from petite to full bodied: gorgeous. The ones I was lucky enough to date had a most adorable nose, beautiful eyes that made me feel like I was allowed to look into their soul, and awoke an appreciation of beauty society had told me was wrong and destined to die fruitless. With all my heart I can see and say I love them. They best conversations I had were with black women. Why? I don't know. I felt like I was heard more. Like the questions were of better quality, and like their answers to my questions were better. Answers that led to more questions, to digging in one another. The most fulfilling and intimate friendships were with them. And I only found out about this when I sat down and looked back at the people I had been close with throughout my life.

So, all in all, it saddens me they're dealt a shit hand. Black men often don't want to date them and when they do date a non-black guy they catch shit from all sides because oh god, they're not dating black. Usually from people who are dating outside their race as well because why draw a line under hypocracy at this point? They just can't do *anytyhing* right: when they're silent they get berated and when they speak up they're automatically getto or hysterical.
But I know it'll change. It will. Every time a story like a black Little Mermaid hits the news and people are outraged I take a deep breath, sit them down and explain why I feel it is very important to have one that's black. The most surprising thing? I've seen people's eyes literally widen before saying ""I think you're right, I didn't think of this"". 

And that's what it's about. Shift your perspective and meet a vibrant, gorgeous group of women. To me, they're physically more attractive, dress nicer, their luscious lips are unmatched when it comes to the tactile part of love, and the most important thing to me: conversation-wise it feels better, more dynamic and equal. It ended with the girl who taught me a lot, the ebb and flow of life changes everything. And while I don't know what my next girlfriend will look like, there's a huge probability she'll be black. That being an issue to many people makes me sad and angry."

I have some ideas/plans for side project to start in next 6m to 1y when i get more experience and knowledge. I would like to make web app that will use others API to get data (on some specific topic) and manipulate it to present some useful content.

I am into react, redux, axios... now, palnning to take a look at Firebase, Fulx, Flutter maybe MongoDB, React Native ofc...

As i never build something big and dont have a bigger picture of what that kind of app would need could you suggest me directions what technologies/languages to take a look at? Is php necessary or can be avoided? what is most compatible with that what i know now to build that kind of app?

duwp84,214,2019-11-11,Found a Job.,3lRey,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/duwp84/found_a_job/,"Hey ya'll.              

Just writing to say that I found a job (mid-level engineer) and start next Monday. It's at a Silicon Valley non big N paying 110k+ bennies. I'll be working in some big building by the bay and commuting quite a distance for the privilege. Some take-aways: 

1. The only reason this dropped so easily in my lap was because I network a lot. I reached out to all the people I know who did CS style work and looked for potential opportunities. Eventually, one of them reached out to me. You don't program alone, so why look for a job alone? 
2. ""They"" really seem to love back end database/API shit. At my internship I worked with SQL (for fucking ever) and contributed to many projects that involved databases. My personal projects involve CRUD operations and the only ""leetcode"" thing I've needed to write was literal fizzbuzz. 
3. Leetcode was way less prominent than I anticipated. In fact, businesses are more likely to make you write a whole fucking web form than operations on a B-tree or array. I found myself wanting a whiteboard interview but not once did I get it. 
4. Success isn't really about being the smartest boy alive. It's about showing up every day with a good attitude. Many high IQ people can fail in life or simply not actualize their potential because of inability or unwillingness to work with and appreciate other people. Most of the ""cool"" things I've worked on have been with other people who approached me for help and those same people will be the ones who show up later in life with opportunities. 
5. Never give up, it's just not worth it. You can take off a couple days to smoke weed in your pajamas and play warhammer, but you have to get back to it eventually. Literally what do you have to lose? I worked as a mid-level office slave in the meantime and just applied/coded on the weekends. You can even code at work (as long as it's relevant to work!) I wrote VBA automation and powershell scripts. VBA isn't really a ""top skill"" but I got to sell it as workplace automation and not low-level formatting. 

All in all, my journey isn't done- it probably never will be. I'm not going to pretend I've got the industry all figured out- but this is what appears to be working for me. Honestly, I probably could have asked for more but I was so nervous and wanted the job so I asked for what I imagined to be a competitive salary.             

Thanks for reading and have a nice week."
dux3ty,1,2019-11-11,Should I take this job?,demon246810,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dux3ty/should_i_take_this_job/,"Hello, I am currently in my final semester for my BS and am in an internship that is related to my major. My boss has sat me down and talked to me about offering me a job after the internship is over. However, I don't know if I should take it.

As of right now, I am leaning towards not taking the job because of how much I really don't like it. But I feel like it would be good for me in the long run. Should I take it?

Here are some pros and cons about the job:

**Pros**

* Higher paying job than I have now ($12 to $15)
* It is related to my major and would look good for future careers
* I talked to my supervisor and she told me that it is good for an entry level job right out of college, but wouldn't recommend it as a long-term job.

**Cons**

* The boss can micromanage at times and gives a lot of attitude
* Supervisor is looking for other jobs after being here for around 8-9 months
* It's not something I would look forward to doing
* Small business, only about 2-3 coworkers
* No benefits
* Happiness would probably go down

I've talked to some friends and family about this issue and the usual advice they give is to try it out for a couple of months and see how I feel about it. But I've been thinking about this for the past month and a half and I really don't know if I should."

&amp;#x200B;

I just stumbled onto this subreddit while scouring the internet for resources about a potential move to France! I've really begun to resent the US, so I was hoping to get away and start someplace new. I am currently a computer science student, but my grades are pretty awful.. On the bright side, I do have two summer internships worth of experience in my field. I was wondering if there were some schools that are really easy to get into or more dependent on an entrance exam. I'm not sure if this helps, but I would also be willing to scrap all my coursework up to this point and completely start over. 

I guess all I'm really asking is if an International Student can get accepted into French universities with bad grades.

Edit: A bit embarrasing, but I know no French whatsoever."

duz6id,1,2019-11-11,Best way to discuss pay with company when deciding between 2 potential jobs?,kendrameek,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/duz6id/best_way_to_discuss_pay_with_company_when/,"So I‚Äôm in the later interview process with 2 different companies. Honestly, I could go with either of them and be happy (assuming I get offered both, which I‚Äôm fully aware is not guaranteed. I just want to be prepared). 

One of the jobs (Comp. A)  is hourly and the pay range is $18-21 an hour- full benefits/PTO/all the normal things. 

The other (Comp. B) is salary ranging from 40-50k. In an earlier interview I said my requirement was 45k. - also full benefits/PTO/all the normal things. 

*if It‚Äôs important to note, I graduated recently and have mainly intern experience. 

I really hit it off with company A, they called me on my way home from my interview to set up the next one. BUT, it‚Äôs also about a 50 minute commute- which I would be driving for a few months until I could save up and find an apartment closer. 

So in order for Comp. A to be comparable to Comp. B, I‚Äôd really need 20-21 an hour. How do I go about negotiating this? Do I mention I‚Äôm talking to another company that‚Äôs willing to pay more if they try to give me less than $20, or is that a bad idea?? Help please!"

I'm a third-year undergraduate student at a somewhat prestigious university studying Marketing and Economics in a double concentration. I'm posting here because I see all my peers securing summer internships at all these fancy companies with their lives seemingly all put together and having some sense of a path for their career. I've been going through college just trying to get through class and pursuing a bunch of side projects on my own, but I don't really know what I want to do for a summer internship or in post-graduate life. I'm kinda panicking and feel like I'm not doing enough for my future. I wanted to ask y'all if you could point me to careers that could suit my interests or things that I could try to apply for this summer? I would love any direction. I don't think I've found my path due to a mix of ignorance, laziness, and being overwhelmed/afraid to commit to one job.

About me:

\- I make Youtube videos as a side hobby and have a huge passion for film/video and storytelling. I'm fairly adept at editing, writing, and shooting

\- I love to make music and perform. I play the guitar, piano, and sing.

\- I have played around with CS and can work with computers well and think that in the right environment, I can get more into programming. In college right now, the CS classes aren't that engaging for me so I haven't pursued it as much.

\- My end goal is to have my own business and do entrepreneurial things. I love business, but don't like the social climbing networking environment of Wall Street. It sounds so soulless and depressing. Esp. the hours.

What I'm looking for in a job:

\- I'm hugely afraid of the 9-5 corporate life (or the hours I've heard are even worse these days). I want a job that I like and don't want to hate going to everyday.

\- I want a job that has some creative element to it and allows me to grow as a person and challenge myself.

\- If it can incorporate design, photo, video, that would be an added plus

\- Ideally, high-paying or there is some career mobility that can eventually (but not too long) lead to a higher paying job

I've heard Product Management and working at a marketing/advertising firm as potential options. If someone could speak on that, that would also be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

I put my graduation date as a year early since I've heard that a lot of companies throw out freshman application without even looking at them (as for the question of whether I can do CS at a sophomore level... well... that is a problem for a later time). 

My experience is basically an internship at Skydeck company and some physics/Matlab internship stuff I did at a college last summer.

Anyone have any tips on which websites to apply from (I use LinkedIn and handshake, is there a difference)?

Anyway I can leverage the Berkeley name more that just putting it in my resume and using my berkeley email?

Overall what can I do to increase my chances of getting interviews?

looking for some general opinions of how realistic my college choices are. I realize some of these are a crapshoot no matter what, also looking for other options and general advice. Thanks!

Major: CS / CS+EE or CS+CS or CS+BA

Stats: 

* 4.0UW/4.5W
* 1570/800s on M2, Phys, 750+ on Lit, USH 
* essentially most rigorous courseload(15 aps taken, 2 4s rest 5s)

ECs:

* Main EC is taking classes, then TAing at nonprofit that does cs education for underprivileged high schoolers with high impact (like 300/semester take twice-weekly classes), reached a pretty high leadership position this year. (9-12)
* A technical summer internship where I got a glowing extra rec (12)
* Fencing for 3 yrs, vars this yr (10-12)
* Summer mentorship program, did workshops with some professionals in tech, did a service project and got nominal award for it, continue to be mentored (12)
* co-prez of school club related to CS, weekly meetings with hands on projects (11-12)
* \~600hrs volunteered over 2 summers @ my church daycamp (10-11)
* leadership in church youth group, worked on website/manage budget (9-12)
* random hackathons , about 2-3/yr and got recognition at 7 of them (9-12)
* lots of family responsibilities (5 hrs/wk all yr)

Awards: none except Natl AP Scholar, NMSF, school honor society that basically indicates I'm at least top 3.5% in class of 700 (school doesn't formally rank)

Essays: alright, hard to judge though. Supps focused on ""spike"" of bridging disconnect between tech money and low income students through free cs education.  also heavy focus on extenuating circumstances in commonapp essay.

Recs: should also be alright, but no special relationships with teachers. Just classes I did well in and interacted regularly w teachers. Gave teachers some info to include about extenuating circumstances.

Concerning extenuating circumstances: EFC 0, basically did everything @ home including cooking/groceries/bills with a sibling. Widowed absent parent (not around often, like 1mon/yr), live with grandparents, one of which is in later stages of Alz. Pretty much had to look for ec opportunities and get around on my own. Speak on this extensively in apps. Applied to a bunch of scholarships too, as I'll need almost a full ride to afford college.

Reach:

Stanford, MIT, Harvard, CMU, Pton, USC etc (you get the idea lol)

UCB/LA, UIUC, UMich, other top state schools for CS

top LACs?

&amp;#x200B;

Match:

Mid tier UCs

LACs?? idk which to apply to

&amp;#x200B;

Safety:

Cal Poly SLO (should be autoadmit based on stats unless I'm mistaken??)

I'm going to work for a couple of years in industry as a data scientist before applying to graduate school.

Do I even have a chance of getting into a PhD program? I don't care about getting into the top PhD programs in the USA. I just want to get into any PhD program related to my field of interests.

In my undergraduate career, I've achieved at least a 2.65 GPA excluding my current semester's grades because my backpack was stolen in the second semester of freshman year, which caused me great distress and financial burden along with me seeking out a therapist in addition to dealing with mental health issues throughout sophomore year and taking a leave of absence for a year. I'm getting back into the swing of things into my junior year and doing somewhat better mentally with the exception of a possible eating disorder (most likely binge eating disorder, which is affecting my sleep and productivity) but I'm functioning much better compared to sophomore year.

Also, I have two scholarships. For one of them, I have to remain in the College of Engineering and maintain at least a 2.7 GPA. For another one, I have to complete at least 150 hours of community service by actively participating in student organizations like Cornell Minds Matter and Women in Computing at Cornell or off-campus activities like the remote internship at the Department of Health and Human Services. Those scholarships cover the money for my loans so I don't have to take out loans.

I have a summer research experience and a semester's worth of research to fulfill a major approved elective in addition to another semester of research for credit next semester for an advisor approved elective. I also know that I want to research in social computing or data science. However, I'm not completely certain which topics I'm interested in researching since I have several of them in my head and don't feel like listing all of them out on Reddit."

dv36b5,7,2019-11-11,How Being Jobless for 7 Months Has Helped Me (ft. Got a Job Offer!),riverpath2,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/dv36b5/how_being_jobless_for_7_months_has_helped_me_ft/,"Weeks before graduation, I landed an internship at a marketing agency. I was PUMPED - I was convinced marketing was my thing. My colleagues were great. I was given the opportunity to work with the biggest client. Then why did I feel so torn?

Naturally, I quit - and gave myself 1 year to figure things out. (Thankfully, this time frame was cut short; I somehow managed to land a job in 7 months). The past few months have been slow and filled with self-doubt, but I'm confident it was a necessary process to be where I am now.

Personal reflections:

* Discovering the fundamental problem with my previous job: a lot of the promotional work that I did (offline event branding, social videos) were based on **personal preferences**. The decision-making process took WEEKS (literally, my Outlook threads were never-ending). This was especially stressful because I had to align with cross-functional teams in different countries. **I decided to pivot towards data-based marketing** \- or namely, growth marketing. No more relying on someone's ""hunch"".
* Creating a website really helped (especially as a marketer): I remember one marketer saying, ""If you want to be a marketer, start by creating a blog."" Also, I never felt confident putting Google Analytics (web tracking tool) at the bottom of my resume üòÇ, so I thought blogging would give me a hands-on experience. Since launching my website, I've learned about SEO\*, GA, and made cool Internet friends. The latter has been especially helpful; I got invited to a Telegram [chat group](https://twitter.com/anthilemoon?lang=en) where other creators discuss how they grow their side-projects. I learn a lot from just reading their conversations!

\*Getting your site to the front page of Google

Interview lessons:

* Using LinkedIn to full potential: before an interview, **I always reached out to current employees** who were in the team I was applying for, and asked details about the responsibilities/skills required etc. (Is it just me or is the JD never clear..? üòÇ) Interviewers were impressed to hear I contacted existing employees to learn more about the role. It also helps to break the ice a little bit! Some LinkedIn members may not reply to your messages, but you'd be surprised at the number of nice people who leave thoughtful answers!
* Talking about **how** I achieved ""X"" instead of the **what**: once, I just listed out my previous experiences, but people were more interested to hear *how* I implemented a marketing campaign  
ex) using specific channels (organic search/paid ads/blogs), leading a team of X number of people.
* Using [Rooftop Slushie](https://www.rooftopslushie.com/): this platform allows you to connect with employees at Google/Apple etc. and get direct interview advice. Admittedly, I've never applied to those big companies but there's some great advice if you're looking for a career in tech.

Looking back, family members and friends have looked at me in pity from month 6 of joblessness (lol). However, I believe this period has been imperative to land the current position that I really like (growth marketing). **Although a junior role, I've gladly accepted it because I have 0 professional experience in growth marketing.** Hope this post helps friends in the community doing job search!! :)

*Just curious - what do you doing during your own job hunt?*"

**The Ugly:**   
\-I basically jumped directly from my undergrad to grad studies without any industry experience with some naive ideas on what to do.  Basically ended up studying an amalgamation of distributed systems, data intensive systems and data mining.  
\-Came from a basic background and a different country so lot of adjusting to do as well. (Basically went straight from a Tier-2 European city to a grad school in US, so a bit of a cultural shock)   


\-My programming skills are average at best. In Grad school I used Java, but as part of my job I have been reduced to small scripting using either python or have turned to go-lang in my personal learnings.   


**The Decent:**

\-Missed closely a few FAANG intern interviews but apart from that had no idea how to network for smaller companies.   
Gave 1-2 on-sites but did not succeed, so finally accepted a contractual position in a telecom giant. Worked my way to a few projects that involved some programming and software engineering (basically requirements gathering, helping devs design and implement systems). Became a tech QA lead in a year and now work with System Engineers, Directors, Solution Architects on designing telecom systems. But still my role and compensation are way below what I have seen here.   


\-Additionally, I am on an immigrant visa, so work authorization are not generally an issue.   


**The honest assessment:** 

\-I can sincerely say that I have tried my best to leetcode. But I falter at the very first step of tech screens for one reason or another and at this point i feel that I am too doubtful of my own capabilities to ever become a software engineer.   


Heres my plan for the next few months:   


\- Leet Code 10 problems a week   
\- Read up and implement on: Designing Data Intensive Applications, Grokking the Sys Design interview, Clean Code,  and Design Patterns  
\- LinkedIn reach out to recruiters (This I feel is the most easiest with recruiters willing to test me out for interviews, but I am so bad at them that I have stopped accepting every reach out for the fear of failing again)   


I would appreciate any help from the veterans on how to get back on track. I feel my background (Both undergrad and grad in CS) and experience (Systems Engineer, albeit contractual but a good one to boot) are in my favor but the more in linger in a non core CS role, the more appealing I would start looking.

Here's what I've learned till now from my experiences of building a Tech company. I hope It will be helpful to you in some or other way in your journey ahead.**

**1. About Money:**

""Money is a by-product of the value you provide""

""If you focus on 'Money', you will create a 'Company' but If you focus on 'People', you will create an 'Empire' ""

**""Take care of human relations and the money will take care of itself"" - Robin Sharma**

**Investors need startups as much as startups need them** so stop chasing investors until it's really necessary. Focus on building a value-driven business, not just valuation-driven business which can get crushed at any point in time. There are companies for which VC firms are eager to sign a cheque and waiting for the startup/company to say 'yes' for taking investments.

**2) There is a 'Gap' in the 'Market' but is there a 'Market' in the 'Gap' which you want to fulfill?**

Build MVP and follow the lean startup approach. Don't invest too much money in building a perfect product with all the features and functionalities in the first place. Build, Test, Learn and Iterate with minimum available resources and with least required features to test the market.

**‚ÄúAs a technology startup, from the day you start until your last breath, you will be in a furious race against time. No technology startup has a long shelf life. Even the best ideas become terrible ideas after a certain age.‚Äù - Ben Horowitz**

After investing too much time and hard-earned money on a product, I can say that the success of any product doesn't just depend on how good the development team is or the coding/tech skills they possess but it mainly depends on how good the clarity of a founding team / decision makers has for what they want to build for users and the clarity &amp; understanding level of product team to make it into a reality.

**3) ""The network is the net worth"" we all know this but rarely we give importance to it. Also, remember that just jumping into the events and meetups will be a waste of time until you have something valuable for people.**

**4) We all know that ""Team makes the Dream work""** and as per my experience, for a product-driven company, you must hire people with the product mindset and not the ones considering the product development as just yet another project. The team with the product mindset will always take ownership, will be accountable for what they are doing and will be eager to deliver a 'wow' feeling to the end-user, which is the most important factor for the success of any product.

====================**A necessary EDIT**:  As I read through some of the comments claiming  I have no show and my "" Learnings "" as I would love to call them are just out of some mystery world for grabbing social media attention, for all those and the rest, I present the **REAL** ' **Behind The Scenes(2014-present)** ' here:  ==============

**Starting from 2014**: During the final year of my bachelor's degree, I started [StudentDesk.in](https://StudentDesk.in) platform to buy/sell/exchange books within school/college with one of my friends. After graduation, things didn't work and we both decided to work individually.

Because of prior bad experience in job, I decided not to choose a flat 9 to 5 job with MNC and rather started attending startup seminars, and watching videos of successful companies like Google, Facebook through which I realized that StudentDesk can be a company and not just a College project. Our university was hosting Crowdfunding event, I applied, got selected among 8-10 startups and raised Rs. 144K (Approx. 2400USD) through crowdfunding campaign which is a decent amount for any student to survive for few months and do some marketing activity.

**First mistake** I did was as tech guy is, I just used to code and code whatever new clicks my brain. Days were passing, I used to visit colleges for marketing and do coding. Got frustrated as I was'nt making any money even for my monthly expenses and that was the time I realized ""Like every mother loves her child, a Startup founder loves his idea likewise"" but to sustain you need Money.

I was good with Linux/configuring server etc so I got a chance to represent Microsoft Azure's service in different college with their expert instructor. By doing few seminars I used get enough money for my monthly expenses and at the end of seminar, I used to share about my startup StudentDesk which help me spread the word about website. I was even approached by some Investors during crowdfunding campaign for StudentDesk. I wasn't much aware about Valuation-Equity etc and to be honest was not even mature to manage investment money. I was like, ""Why do I need too much money to run this platform?"" hence I refused.

**Fast-track to January 2016**: I was exhausted and worried about education loan, family, what to do next if not StudentDesk? I seeming clueless, decided to go for 10 days meditation meanwhile. I went for ""Vipassana Meditation"" and post that in February, I started IT services. Till Feb 2016, I used to work with interns and a friend whom I met through events, they all used to help me for the development of Android app and I outsourced that app work and in that process, the need for a full-time working team arise and needed more money to do so. 

I started visiting different coaching academies, show them the work of StudentDesk and ask if they need any kind of web/mobile app? I got one small project of Rs. 33,000 (USD450) and my friends used to work on it after their job but we were missing deadlines, etc. Started Improving my written/verbal communication skills and was approaching clients through freelancing platforms.

Got some clients and with that money I hired 3 of my friends. In 2017 with the rising crypto and blockchain boom, we started working on the second product [www.CoinTopper.com](https://www.CoinTopper.com) \- web and app based crypto news and analysis platform and after few months of launch, crypto market crashed so didn't get the return on investment as expected.

We were a small team and I decided not to repeat any mistakes of StudentDesk in CoinTopper so for few months, stopped taking new projects and just focused on building right product. During product development, we ran out of money so borrowed money from my uncle and that didnt last much so took a loan from Bank with help of my younger brother.

**In mid 2018**, again started IT services and this time CoinTopper was helping me make money not directly but indirectly because client loved the look and feel of website, interface of app (which was designed by my friend's firm [YellowMedialabs.com](https://YellowMedialabs.com) ) and we started getting more work and the progression to the present.

**CodeCrunch** is IT services, product and consulting firm based out Ahmedabad - India. Our core work includes, web, mobile app development and data mining ( [www.CrawlerMonkey.com](https://www.CrawlerMonkey.com))

**Last but not the least**: Thank you all for sharing your views in the comments. I genuinely welcome Constructive Criticism.  I, being highly interested in Tech-startup, am always curious to exchange words with the similarly interested folks. I would love to know more about the exciting journey of yours over a chat/call.

**Don't hesitate to say 'Hello' üòä. Wishing you all the very best for each and every one of your future endeavors!**

dv9zlm,161,2019-11-12,I received a transmission from the expedition team sent to explore the ‚ÄúMountain of Black Silk‚Äù and I am terrified.,ItsMeRoyale,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dv9zlm/i_received_a_transmission_from_the_expedition/,"*Some secrets of our world are not meant to be forcefully uncovered. They will reveal themselves when their time approaches. But, when the search for secrets is overwhelmed with self-pride and greed, well, that is when the trouble truly begins.* 

It was supposed to be the greatest discovery of the modern era, the next wonder of the world. 

I was hired as an intern of a research and expedition agency, named CrypTech Corps, and I was tasked with monitoring the travel status of the exploration crew led by Professor Zora to the newly discovered Mountain of Black Silk, once thought to be a legend of ancient tribal lore. The remote mountain was believed to contain artifacts, jewels, and priceless forgotten fabrics from merchant sailors who inhabited the secret area; they were using the mountain as a storage depot, deep within its core. CrypTech had brought all this information to the crew beforehand. They assured that this was a straightforward mission and nominated Prof. Zora to be in charge much to her reluctance. 

From what I‚Äôve heard with my time on the internship, CrypTech handles these types of findings, locations thought to be of mere myth, and sends expedition teams to investigate after months of conducting research through countless studies.

The Mountain of Black Silk is located on one of two distinct islands connected by a thin strip of land that acts as a natural bridge. After weeks of preparation, I joined the main unit of researchers as we were transported via helicopter to the shoreline of a small tribal village. The locals, during our brief encounter, somehow knew where we were heading to. They kept repeating words in their own language with abrupt tones filled with fear and anxiety, but due to my unfamiliarity with their dialect, I was unable to understand what they were saying. 

From there, we took a boat to the island opposite to The Mountain of Black Silk and set up basecamp. Both islands were made up of thick forests and foliage save for a smaller clearing on the first island that hosted our basecamp. The expedition was anticipated to last about one week, and we made sure the environmental conditions were right for our hiking crew. Meanwhile, the mountain could be seen from a distance, barely hidden by the canopies of the tall trees. We flew our tech drones overhead the day before the hike to scout out the area. From the footage, I could see the mountain very distinctly.

I was expecting to see it covered with the so-called ‚Äòblack silk‚Äô referenced by the lore. Instead, I was greeted with a traditional, but a quite large, mountain. Dark jagged rocks stood upright here and there, forming together a towering peak that was *cocooned* by a layer of mist. I maneuvered the drone to do a full 360 around the natural structure until I noticed a set of stone stairways carved into its side, leading up to a small, dark tunnel covered by pillars of rock. Professor Zora had told us that this was the entrance into the Mountain of Black Silk, and it was the only way in or out. 

After the brief was given the next morning, Prof. Zora, accompanied by six other researchers, began their journey. I stayed behind at basecamp, monitoring their progress from a workstation. Oddly, the signal channels on our radios and phones were blocked. The professor had briefed that the mountain was hindering the signals, or rather, something *in* the mountain was. So she had taken with her a mini-tablet, directly linked to my workstation, as our only form of communication. 

The drones followed the crew until they arrived at the base. One by one, they followed each other up the stairs as they ascended the wall of rock. The winds had started to pick up and the stairs were quite narrow, so the team had to be wary of not slipping into a sudden plunge. They finally reached the mouth of the tunnel. I watched through the drone camera as they all entered, the torches disappearing into the dark oblivion. The drones were too big to fit into the tunnel but could be stationed by the opening. All I had to do was wait. The team had agreed to meet back in five hours, give or take. 

However, five hours passed, then seven, then ten. 

By the late afternoon, we had hurriedly compiled a search team from basecamp to enter the mountain. Before the team was set to go, I received a transmission from Prof. Zora‚Äôs tab device. I opened the file in the workstation and was completely shocked at what I read:

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;DO NOT SEND HELP. DO NOT SEND HELP.  
&gt;  
&gt;Pete, LISTEN to me. The rest of the crew are dead, at least I believe they are. God, I really hope they are.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don‚Äôt know what those *things* are doing to them. I don‚Äôt want them to suffer through *that*.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please, do not send anyone in. *It* knew we were coming.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can feel *it* pulsating, Pete, the echo of a thousand heartbeats vibrating within the chasms of this abandoned abyss.   
&gt;  
&gt;I can hear *it‚Äôs* hunger, an ear-piercing roar of tortured voices searching for an escape, aching for peace.  
&gt;  
&gt;*It* lives within the walls, Pete.   
&gt;  
&gt;*It* is multiplying‚Ä¶W*aiting*.  
&gt;  
&gt;The fumes in here are unbearable. The air is burning my lungs, and I think the oxygen is almost up. Shit, we should have turned back when Monty coughed off the blood. There was so much blood‚Ä¶everywhere‚Ä¶  
&gt;  
&gt;We kept going deeper, running into a maze of countless tunnels. We were picked off one by one.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can see the walls *moving*.   
&gt;  
&gt;A swarm of black, glossy, spiny tendrils is covering every bit of it. Black worm-like threads hang from the ceiling above, millions of them, wriggling in tiny translucent sacks letting off tiny chirp sounds. Dripping from them is a mix of dark juices, thick as blood, covering the entire floor. The liquid gives off steam accompanied by a horrendous odor, an intolerable nauseating sensation that has forced me to heave yesterday‚Äôs dinner into one of the corners.  
&gt;  
&gt;I need to find a way out. The walls have trapped me in here, and the last bit of sunlight from these cracks is already fading.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;I do not know how long I can take it.  
&gt;  
&gt;The villagers were right‚Ä¶those transcripts were right‚Ä¶  
&gt;  
&gt;Why did we not listen, Pete? Why did *they* convince us to come?  
&gt;  
&gt;*Who are they really? They are hiding something from us. It was a trap. And we fell into it.*   
&gt;  
&gt;*Find the truth about them, Pete. Escape while you still can.*  
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;I‚Äôve stumbled upon Monty. Or what‚Äôs left of him.   
&gt;  
&gt;He looks to be getting‚Ä¶*digested.* A clear cocoon has formed over his cadaver and I can barely make out his figure through the dark liquid that‚Äôs filling up inside the hollow cage.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am afraid the rest of the crew have met his fate as well.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;Pete, I've figured out what happened to the merchants who tried to hide their fortune here. I can see the worms feasting on their encased, rotting carcasses as I gaze up.   
&gt;  
&gt;*They lied to us. They knew it all along.*   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;I don't think I will make it. My head feels like it is about to burst.   
&gt;  
&gt;My veins have portruded from my arms, swollen from exhaustion.   
&gt;  
&gt;The chirping worms have started to fall one by one from the ceiling, squirming around on the floor, leaving trails of a slimy substance.  
&gt;  
&gt;Every bit of light has been consumed. Every ounce of my energy has depleted.  
&gt;  
&gt;I can feel the tendrils slithering around, searching for me.   
&gt;  
&gt;‚Ä¶.  
&gt;  
&gt;*It has found me.*   
&gt;  
&gt;The tendrils have begun to latch onto my legs. I can feel the spines piercing into my nervous system, pain equivalent to burning acid on an exposed bruise.   
&gt;  
&gt;There is no treasure here, Pete. I can only see greed, suffering, and a chamber for sacrifice.   
&gt;  
&gt;I see a snare for the oblivious who wander in and a feast for the evil that dwells in here waiting for them.   
&gt;  
&gt;I am sorry.  
&gt;  
&gt;Goodbye, Pete. I am proud of you.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zora.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  
&gt;  
&gt;*Do not trust 3-18-25-16*

That was the end of the transmission. 

I did not have time to grieve for Professor Zora. My company had already sent more personnel on the way to the island after the original team had failed to return. I quickly copied the message to a drive and blocked out some parts of the transmission before showing it to the rest of the crew at basecamp. As they looked over it, I stole one of the boats and navigated towards the inland. It won‚Äôt be long until they figure out that I am missing. 

I am currently in a Latin American country typing this up from a local internet caf√©. I do not who to trust and I do not know if anyone will believe me. 

If Professor Zora is right, this was no standard expedition. It was a set-up. I cannot begin to imagine what the hell is in that mountain, but if my company knew about it, it was a death-trap from the beginning; a way to knock the professor out of the picture and to unleash something that should not have been stirred in the first place. 

I am afraid it's time to figure what CrypTech [is really up to](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoyalStories/rising/)."
dva9yw,2515,2019-11-12,"I just graduated from medical school, and today I found out what my hospital's mysterious rules mean",ByfelsDisciple,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/dva9yw/i_just_graduated_from_medical_school_and_today_i/,"I walked through the door I always sought, I always found. It closed gently behind me.

[I watched again, helplessly, as the twelve-year-old version of myself endured the type of pain that adults fool themselves into thinking they can deny their children.](https://redd.it/dsywar)

I watched my little brother burn.

I saw more of his body this time; the initial shock gave way to an unrelentingly critical doctor‚Äôs eye. His charred vertebrae and demolished spinal cord spilled disgustingly onto the ground like discarded butcher‚Äôs offal. I realized, vaguely, that Timmy must have landed on his neck, bursting his destroyed innards as his barbecued skin shredded from the impact of the collapsing house. 

It broke more of me than I had thought possible. Deep fissures cleaved my mind in ways that I once would have believed impossible to endure.

But I left the broken pieces of me on the road, and found that I could travel lighter once there was less of *me* to carry. It was, to be honest, brutally efficient. 

In that moment, I understood how the world could change a person into a quintessential shit-bitch.

And, in becoming stronger, I was able to make it through the journey yet again, this time confidently grasping the door on the other side, now more whole because there was less of my spirit.

Smoke hit me first, followed by the warm humidity of an old Missouri summer. 

And of course, there was the scream.

I collapsed on the ground, unable to move any further.

*

I got up, of course, because what else was there to do? I had to choose between moving on and spending the rest of my life completely immobile. I was not going to allow the location of fate‚Äôs arbitrary decision to determine the rest of my years, so I stood and I moved.

I endured everything again.

And I discovered just how much of myself could be broken while still moving forward. 

I arrived at the end. I opened the door. 

And I walked into the scream.

*

I once heard that the trees in west Texas are shaped by winds that rip across the open plains. The constant pressure warps them; in time, no matter how great the tree, it is permanently marred by a world that would never relent. The original design of the plant becomes unsalvageable, and the brokenness evolves into an indelible part of the tree‚Äôs character. It can never hope to become what it had once intended.

But still, the tree grows.

*

It was easier to travel without the burden of hope, so I discarded its last vestiges upon the seventh opening.

And casually found my way into Dr. Scritt‚Äôs office. 

‚ÄúClose the door behind you,‚Äù she ordered. 

I obeyed out of practicality and stood before her.

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she regarded me over her thin spectacles, ‚Äúare you going to have a long cry about it, and then talk about what happened? Or will you be skipping the part that has no practical value so that we don‚Äôt waste any more of my time?‚Äù

I sat in the chair across from here. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve exhausted every tear,‚Äù I responded simply.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she shot back, ‚ÄúI hope that fact lightened your burden.‚Äù

I almost asked her why she was so mean, but silenced myself. People only change if they *want* to change; I had no desire to quarrel with facts that didn‚Äôt care if I believed in them.

She eyed me carefully. ‚ÄúYou never told all of the story, because you were afraid of what people would say.‚Äù

I nodded. My mind was so completely stretched, shocked, *used,* that I had nothing left to offer but stark practicality. ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù

She looked sad. ‚ÄúBecause, Dr. Afelis, that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs story.‚Äù

I stared at her blankly. 

She sighed. ‚ÄúEach one of us is ashamed about some part of our past. We believe that keeping it a secret allows us to control the thing that is beyond our grasp. This stems from the fact that people are idiots.‚Äù

I had no response.

‚ÄúLetting go of the false belief *means* controlling the past, Ellie, at least to the small extent that we still can. You‚Äôre not losing it by dropping the illusion.‚Äù

I took a deep breath. ‚ÄúI feel like admitting it-‚Äù

‚ÄúMakes you a shitty person, yes, I know,‚Äù she responded with a roll of her eyes. ‚ÄúBut *admitting* the truth does not make you a shitty person. It‚Äôs what you *did* that makes you shitty.‚Äù She flared her nostrils and was silent.

Without neither preamble nor permission, I began my explanation. ‚ÄúTimmy and I had been fighting,‚Äù I heaved. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd just received a new laptop. Since I was twelve and he was six, I got many of the things that Timmy wanted but couldn‚Äôt have. I gloated when he cried, because it made me feel like I had more. My dad was a janitor, and we couldn‚Äôt afford most of what I thought I needed. So when I *finally* got the laptop I knew I deserved, I taunted my brother worse than I ever had before.‚Äù I drew a deep, shuddering breath. ‚ÄúSo he stole it when I wasn‚Äôt looking and locked himself into my bedroom. I had never, *ever* been so angry. I actually told him to fuck off, which was the first time I‚Äôd ever said those words. His favorite stuffed animal, this ridiculous oversized bear, was left unguarded in his bed. So ‚Äì I stole it, yelled across the house that I was going to destroy it, and ran downstairs.‚Äù 

I buried my face in my hands. ‚ÄúI threw it on the stove and turned on the pilot light, and I was *so happy* when it finally caught fire. Timmy ran into the kitchen just as the flames engulfed his bear. I saw just how deeply I‚Äôd hurt him, deeper than he‚Äôd ever felt, and I was‚Ä¶ overjoyed. The pain I had caused my brother seemed so *good* in that moment, and I don‚Äôt know why, but I was sure he deserved it.‚Äù

I paused.

Then I continued, because there was nothing else to do. ‚ÄúHe‚Ä¶ he told me that he was going to throw my laptop out the window ‚Äì that he would lock himself in my room and smash it to pieces on the ground. Then he turned and ran.‚Äù I cleared my throat. ‚ÄúSo I grabbed the stuffed bear‚Äôs leg, which was dangling off the edge of the stove and not yet burning, and I hurled it at him.‚Äù I pursed my lips and nodded solemnly to myself. ‚ÄúWhy does any twelve-year-old make a decision, other than because it seemed like a good idea at the time? I didn‚Äôt *plan* on having the bear hit the wall and land in the trash can, and I had *no idea* how quickly a garbage fire could spread through a kitchen.‚Äù I bit my lip until I tasted blood. ‚ÄúBut I was old enough to weigh my options. I knew that I had enough time to get up the stairs, but probably not back down again, because the fire had consumed half the kitchen in under twenty seconds.‚Äù I drew several shallow breaths. ‚ÄúI also knew that I could exit through the kitchen‚Äôs back door to immediate safety.‚Äù More shallow breaths. ‚ÄúI had to make a practical decision in a split second. And I was still *angry* in that split second. Angry at my brother, but also at myself ‚Äì though I was too young to understand it at the time.‚Äù I swallowed. ‚ÄúIt would be so much easier to say that it was either all cold practicality, or else all hot vengeance. I reasoned like a child, but was mature enough to understand what my decision meant. The reality is that both concepts pulled my mind across a twisted landscape of opposing ideas, eschewing the decency of being all one thing or all of another.‚Äù

I dropped my hands to my sides and stared unwaveringly at Dr. Scritt. ‚ÄúI decided to turn my back and run outside. I remember every part of that choice. It *shattered* my heart and my mind badly enough that I know I‚Äôll never be whole again.‚Äù I took one more long breath. ‚ÄúBut each day I hurt a little more, because I can‚Äôt stop thinking of what I would do if I could go back. And I know that I would probably still make the same choice.‚Äù

For the first time that I could remember, she broke eye contact first. ‚ÄúEllie,‚Äù she sighed, ‚Äúwhy do you think that St. Francis Hospital would have such an [arbitrary set of rules for its interns](https://redd.it/dj5fgp)?‚Äù

I responded without emotion. ‚ÄúThe rules come from somewhere beyond us. I understand that now. We‚Äôre just here to follow them.‚Äù

She looked sad. Then, slowly, Dr. Scritt shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, Dr. Afelis. That isn‚Äôt true.‚Äù She rubbed her eyes. ‚ÄúWhat was the first rule?‚Äù

‚ÄúNever, under any circumstances, share your copy of the rules with anyone else,‚Äù I replied robotically.

She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúAnd how does that make any *sense?*‚Äù

I stumbled as I tried to remember her words. ‚ÄúYou ‚Äì it was important to see ‚Äì not all of us were going to make it-‚Äù

‚ÄúThat much *is* true,‚Äù she responded dismissively. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen more than enough evidence of *that* tonight. But you‚Äôre wrong about the rule coming from somewhere else.‚Äù She stared pointedly across her desk at me. 

I stared back with incredulity. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you‚Äôre starting to get it,‚Äù she shot back. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt top of your class, Dr. Afelis, not even close, but you‚Äôre at *least* smart enough to be a doctor. Can you *attempt* to figure this out?‚Äù

I quickly calculated the odds of making an ass of myself in ratio to the probability of answering correctly, and remained silent. 

She shook her head in disappointment. ‚ÄúDid you really never make the connections, *Doctor* Afelis? The trial of jumping off of a roof? Judgment from an authoritative janitor? *Multiple* different rules about burning children?‚Äù

My jaw fell.

‚ÄúThe first rule prohibits the sharing of rules, because *no one has the same set.* Each doctor is faced with his or her own list of restrictions, and most aren‚Äôt up to the challenge.‚Äù

I struggled to find the words. ‚ÄúEvery ‚Äì every rule is just for me?‚Äù

Dr. Scritt removed her glasses. ‚ÄúPeople think that this hospital wants to destroy them, when in reality each person is given every tool needed for survival.‚Äù She snorted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to stop most individuals‚Äô desire to kill themselves.‚Äù

I stared at her desk in shock. ‚ÄúBut ‚Äì Rule Four ‚Äì why did it tell me not to touch your Reese‚Äôs Peanut Butter Cups?‚Äù

She stared at me like I‚Äôd been caught masturbating in a fish tank. ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs my favorite candy.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúMine, too.‚Äù

Dr. Scritt placed the glasses back on her head. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to ask what this place is,‚Äù she continued slowly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve survived St. Francis far longer than most. That‚Äôs why people expect me to tell them.‚Äù She paused, choosing each of her next words very carefully. ‚ÄúSo before you say that you want me to tell you the truth, you should understand this fact.‚Äù Here she bored her eyes into mine, and this time it was me who turned away early. ‚ÄúThere are things that I can‚Äôt know, and things that I don‚Äôt know. Embracing these ideas as a strength instead of a weakness is the reason I‚Äôve endured where others have not.‚Äù

We were quiet for some time.

‚ÄúCan ‚Äì can you see the individual rules on each doctor‚Äôs paper?‚Äù I asked suddenly.

She smirked. ‚ÄúNo. But I can see what‚Äôs written on their faces, which is the same thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt get it,‚Äù I responded honestly.

She sighed in disappointment. ‚Äú[Do you remember when I reminded you of Rule 9?](https://redd.it/drgofj)‚Äù

I thought back to our conversation just after Dr. Dorian had died. ‚ÄúYou told me that the morgue needed 13 cadavers at all times,‚Äù I replied confidently.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she shot back. ‚Äú*You* told *me* that. I acted like I had known the entire time, and you responded to my confidence. Each person‚Äôs list of rules is their own battle to fight. To be blunt, I‚Äôd rather see the doctors fail themselves through inadequacy than see the patients suffer because someone was unable to live up to their own unearned arrogance.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to earn my arrogance,‚Äù I said.

Dr. Scritt smiled. ‚ÄúThe good news is that I think you might have the endurance to survive the unusually lengthy journey it would take for *you* to achieve earned arrogance.‚Äù

The door burst open before I could say anything more. I said nothing as a familiar janitor walked confidently into Dr. Scritt‚Äôs office.

For the first time, I heard him speak. 

‚ÄúThree children have been dead for 119 minutes, 13 people are *not* in the morgue, and Dr. Falhar ignored me when I tried to stop him from stealing Dr. Grault‚Äôs list.‚Äù

Dr. Scritt stood, and I followed suit.

‚ÄúWait, Dr. Scritt ‚Äì please,‚Äù I looked at her in desperation.

She gave me a look that told me I had one quarter of a second to speak.

‚ÄúIs this real?‚Äù

She looked away and walked around her desk. ‚ÄúDeath is real. Nothing else is guaranteed. Doctors are tasked with delaying the inevitable and embracing the fact that 100% of our efforts will eventually fail.‚Äù I walked briskly after her as she followed the janitor out of her office. ‚ÄúIf death is the only real thing, then this life is the place where impossible things can happen. Stop doubting that fact. Now grab the sulfuric acid, we‚Äôre going to attempt to prevent your fellow interns from killing each other or [any of the patients](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).‚Äù

dvb0vh,3,2019-11-12,"Profile review: 25M, weak academic record",aciioli,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/dvb0vh/profile_review_25m_weak_academic_record/,"**BACKGROUND**

**Work experience:**

Venture capital intern (unknown fund) for 6 months after my undergrad, then 1 &amp; 1/2 year as an investment banking analyst at a well-known leading boutique in the North European region. After this, I attended an MSc in a computer science-related field, as I wanted to transition into a more tech-based role. I will have worked an additional 1-2 years as a financial data analyst/scientist at a well-known global technology/analytics firm by the time I am going to apply to an MBA. Combined work experience = **3-4 years**.

**Extra curriculars:**

Competed at a high level in gymnastics in my home country. Our team was part of a sports TV-series broadcasted nationwide.

**Undergrad school/major:**

BSc in business/economics, majoring in finance, at a global top 100 university located in northern Europe.

**Other education/coursework:**

MSc (2-years) in a computer science-related field from an art school. One of; The New School, Pratt Institute, Emerson College. 3.95/4.00 GPA

**Race/nationality:**

White, northern Europe

**Sex:**

Male

**Stats**

\- GMAT: Yet to be taken (assume average score)

\- Undergrad GPA: weak undergrad... quite far below 3.0, closer to 2.0 (I've got no excuse for my weak undergrad record, except for being immature. I have gained strong motivation since then). However, I graduated with distinction (3.94/4.00 GPA) from my master's degree.

**MBA Info**

\- Goal of MBA: I want to strengthen my profile within the technology business industry, and my goal is to advance in the field of data analytics within the finance industry.

\- Target schools: My main target is the specialized Tech-MBA at NYU Stern ([https://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/tech-mba/program](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/tech-mba/program)).

**Conclusively:**

I know that my academic record is something that might have ruined my chances of attending a good MBA program. However, I want to keep my hopes up. I have a lot of high profile recommenders, which maybe could help? Am I aiming too high with my target MBA-program?

I would much appreciate your thoughts about my profile, and suggestions of other schools, or something I could do to increase my chances of getting into my target?

Thank you so much!"
dvbgx4,0,2019-11-12,Who you know at school &gt; grades for internship?,Hazelstat,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dvbgx4/who_you_know_at_school_grades_for_internship/,"I'm a junior in IT right now and I have accepted an internship offer from a Big4 accounting firm in NYC. I learned a lot about the internship process and I've been reflecting on it. I might be selling myself short but I came into this semester thinking I would be the guy without anything at the end of the year. I had just transferred into IT from Computer Science, had no prior internship or experience/project, no clubs or anything at all really and my GPA wasn't good (above a 3 though) due to the courses in CS. I know CS looks good but I was only in it long enough to take the intro classes for programming which I will say I took alot out of. So basically, in my opinion, I was probably the worst candidate to being getting an internship anywhere. I applied to a total of 16 internships, 1 of them was the offer I got and 2 of the internships I stopped doing since the 1 I got was the one I wanted most. I had a really really good friend who was in the same major as me who was 1 year older AND happened to graduate a year early. He would end up coming back to my school's career fair and would be the person I ended up giving my resume to. I guess it was pure luck that all this happened at once but I ended up getting an on-campus interview. I spent the 2 weeks prior to it everyday practicing and using whatever free time I had to better myself. The interview went well I thought since I got to meet my interviewers the night before at a dinner where I found that I had alot of similar interests as them. 4 days later, I got a call saying that I got the offer. What I got out of this was that who you know is everything. I got to meet a lot of people throughout this process and found that everybody knew someone in the firm. There were tons of overqualified people who were clearly better than me on paper that didn't go through and I'm sure that can go for the others who got an offer as well. People have been asking me since for advice on how to land an internship. Is it fair to tell them that who you know is really everything? I also want to mention that I by no means was friends with my friend because of this. We were good friends since I was a freshman and he just happened to do really well."

[STEM Master's],kteotia,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/dvd042/is_the_weight_given_to_research_experience_for_a/,"Silly me thought that a great research experience prior to applying for a master's degree in STEM (ECE) would at least make me a serious applicant, if not compensate for my average undergrad GPA (8.04/10 from an Indian Uni).

In the past couple of years, I have tried my hardest to get loads of research experience. I have been part of some great Medical Imaging and Computer Vision groups in India and in Europe ( I pursued my bachelor's thesis at the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision, TU Graz, a very well known computer vision research group in European circles).  I have also published at the top signal processing conference (Read IEEE ICASSP) from my internship work in the lab where I interned at in India last summer.

Currently, I am working in an academic-industrial project at a leading Energy firm for the image-based analysis of their oil drilling feasibility.

My LOR's come from: My thesis advisor in Austria, Supervisor at the energy firm (a Cornell PhD), and from my undergrad institution professor.

While all of this looks great, I have been stressing out lately regarding my chances at the top 20 unis. I have been told not to apply to the likes of UCSD and UMich Ann Harbor as for them the GPA is more often than not the sole criteria(?). This frustrates me because I would have applied to your random top 50 completely-self-funded master's program the last cycle and ended up at the same institutions I may end up in when I apply this cycle.

PS: I have a GRE score of 326, I guess it's mostly irrelevant for the top programs."

I didn't find any other suitable subreddits for this query.

To begin with, let me paint a picture of who I am. I'm currently pursuing my Masters in *EPITA, Paris* in the field of *Data Science and Analytics*. I've been a fan of this sport since I was 12 years old, which is 13 odd years ago. Lately, I've been reading more and studying more about the sport; smaller nuances like in-depth tactics, analytical parameters and so on.

In the dream of combining my passion for Data Science and Football, I've decided to get into **Football Analytics**. I would love to work for clubs or sports firms where I can help

Unfortunately, my college only allows me to take an internship position inside France because of my amateur French level. And I can't seem to find any information of which clubs in the *Ligue 1* or so use Analytics and where and how can I apply for such positions.

So far, I plan to send these football clubs an email with a cover letter and resume attached, but I'm not sure how effective this would be. I can't seem to find any concrete information on Football Analytics in France. So if anyone here knows how to or knows anyone who is in this field, I would love to get in touch with them. 

On the other hand, I'm currently doing to projects on my own. One is related to FPL and the other is related to transfers from 00/01 till 18/19 season. If anyone is interested, I'm open to discussions about them.

PM me if you have any information regarding this or just want to talk about Football.

**tl;dr:** I'm currently studying in Paris and I would like to know how to enter the field of Football Analytics in France."

I'm a 24 year old from Ireland and I just graduated from a 4 year degree in computer science. For the past few years I've been set on moving to Australia. I have internship experience with a well-known software company but I have no post-graduate work experience. For this reason, I am not eligible for the temporary skill shortage visas which typically require 2 years work experience after graduation. Is it possible to work in Tech on a working holiday visa (considering that I can only work 6 months maximum in a company)? In other words, is it at all common for companies to take on employees with these sorts of visas even if they know we would be leaving 6 months into the job? My question applies to internships too, as I'd love to get one if they were the only option available on a 6 month contract. 

Am I better off waiting this out a few years to get the experience or is the experience of a working holiday really worth it despite the need to work jobs that don't contribute to my career?"

A friend gave me the e-mail address of the CTO of a large foreign company. The friend in question doesn't work at that company (they got the address thanks to contacts), and they are an intern out of college themselves, so they can't recommend me.

I'm interested in that company, but I'm not sure how to contact the CTO out of the blue. Is there an etiquette for this, should I send my CV and a short explanation of who I am, what I'm looking for and my strengths, like in any application? Is there an etiquette when contacting a high-up at the company as opposed to the usual recruiters?

I'm looking for general advice for these situations. I'd like to not burn my chances in my initial e-mail, since it looks like a pretty good opportunity for a first experience.

Initially the management had decided to hire another engineer to work alongside me, (at the same level) however we didn't have much luck finding decent candidates. So now the head of software decided that we bring on a tech lead for the product instead(or also idk) (to help me out -&gt; someone with more experience to manage the product). He's a great guy (head) himself and has been doing code reviews with me directly, he feels that he has to oversee other teams as well so he wants someone with experience to come on instead and manage my team. I was honestly hoping to take on ownership of this product since I am the only one working on it, I'd rather have a jr dev work with me, and do peer reviews with him/her. So today in my meeting with the head, I suggested that I could do more work myself and if they're going to hire a jr dev, I could do peer reviews with that person instead and so we really don't need the project lead. He said that he will think about it, since his only concern was that if he wants to get his hands off completely from this product, he wants someone with experience to manage it, just so that upper management feels it's okay for him to leave the product in our hands. 

So aside from my rant, do you agree with what the 'head' has decided to do? I feel that my career growth prospects are threatened with that other person coming on, I don't see any position that I could promoted to if a project lead comes on. I have been working as independently as I possibly can, (even though I'm a new grad) without nudging the head for too many questions, recently though, I needed to know how to prioritize the tasks I have at hand and had been after him to set up a meeting with me ( I might be over thinking this but that might have pushed him to come up with this whole 'tech lead' idea ). I have already communicated my thoughts to him, is there anything else I can do/ prove that I can take care of this product independently?  

P.s. : You'll are probably going to flame me that I'm a new grad/ have a lack of experience (although I do have a masters, with a software dev thesis and two internships) whatever, but the thing is I was already unhappy with the compensation package, and was eagerly looking forward to grab this opportunity and get ownership of the product codebase( which I already feel I have a good understanding of ) and then ask for a raise (after completing a year) . But looks like I will be applying to other places if this lead does come on, sucks cause I love the culture and people here otherwiseüòû"

Two months ago, I was offered an extension on my internship, but I was told that I would not be supported in pursuing any full time job, even *internally* at our nonprofit, if I chose to extend. In my manager‚Äôs words, I would be ‚Äúscrewing her over‚Äù (but a stronger word) if I tried to pursue a job before the internship is over. 

It was a tough decision and I was risking unemployment, but I chose not to extend. I immediately hit the ground running looking for jobs and after two months, I found one. My internship is ending and I start at my new job in two weeks.

Today, I found out that the same situation is happening on another team with their intern. The other intern is also struggling to make the right decision.

I sat down with my manager today and gave her feedback on how the whole thing made *me* feel‚Äîfrustrated, unsupported, powerless, etc. and how I am sorry I didn‚Äôt speak up sooner. She essentially said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that sucks for you, but that‚Äôs the way it has to be.‚Äù 

Someone from another department is known as the ‚Äúintern advocate‚Äù and I reached out to her about the situation and we are meeting in two days. I plan to be very diplomatic and simply ask for insight/advice about the situation instead of rocking the boat or demanding change. However, I am also hoping they stop pressuring the other intern. Am I handling the situation correctly? 

Tldr: I was forced to choose between extending my internship (but not having my manager‚Äôs support in applying for jobs internally.) Or not extending, and risking being unemployed. It worked out for me, but another intern is now going through the same thing. I talked to my manager about it, but she didn‚Äôt seem to care. Should I talk to someone else?"

4 years ago I graduated with an Electrical Engineering degree with a specialization in controls. I have been fortunate to work with: an international OE supplier for auto suspension, the government developing and launching a satellite to space, the power industry doing distribution work, and now working for a Fortune 100 company doing automation. 

If it sounds like I've job hopped a lot, I think the same thing. The auto group was a 2 year, near full time internship that had no positions upon graduation. The government position was a contract that lasted a year before having to find more work. The power industry was not for me since it was a lot of ""look at cable A, replace with cable B."" After a year of that and bad management, I applied for my current role. 

My current role is extremely demanding on a physical, and emotional level. On average I work 70-80 hour weeks, thousands of miles away from home usually within the United States. Some of our projects are international but I haven't been assigned to those yet. To put it in perspective, I made my salary about 7 months into the job. I have been here nearly a year, I've already started gaining reputation and have been placed under a project lead with expidited goals of me leading a project lead soon. But being gone from friends and family and constantly having to miss birthday parties, festivals, etc for work has been draining.

Because of all this, I have been left unhappy. I went from aspirations of being a doctor, to being an engineer after watching Iron Man in 2008. And also my father who has a masters in EE. Medicine was prestigious, high paying, and probably satisfyingly difficult. However, the 7 years of med school and residency made me scared to dive into a commitment like that. While working 80 hours a week is similar to a Dr., and while I might retire at 50, who is to say I won't pass away at 51. Since graduating, I've been working for companies who have maintain a cutthroat work environment. Which leaves me unhappy with how my career has turned out. Not every engineering job is like this. But I feel like I keep getting hired into extremely challenging jobs. I don't want to job hop again but I also can't do this long term. I am not sure how much more I can be traveling and working long hours. 

One of my hobbies has been automotive work. Racing my car and working on it consumes what little free time I have. Cars make me happy, racing makes me even happier, and to be honest I only work to have a nice car and the ability to work on it. More than anything I would love to either be a cup car driver but that costs $200k+ just to run for one season with a team. I don't make that much money. I could work as a shop hand but that means $12 an hour and usually in California for the shops with more prestige. Local shops do not cater to my appetites for Motorsports. The best of the best get to do Formula 1/3/E. 

I am very lost currently despite hoping this feeling would get better with time. I thought give it a few years and it'll get better. Right now the only thing keeping me is steady income. There have been days where I often question why I'm still doing. I feel like I have no personal investment into my engineering career. And I know there are people who would love to have the expirences I have had. However I feel like I have lost a sense of value in myself and where I am heading in life. 

TLDR I've had many jobs in a short amount of time. I left my last one and considering leaving this one. But I don't want to job hop. I am having a hard time planning for the long term. What should I be doing during this hard time in my life? 

Engineering taught me to work the problem, so how should I approach working this one?"

\-I am a female international student studying in the US on a full four year ride -scholarship. throughout my entire life I was the top 5% of my classes academically. I was an active student in sports, in student government, in volunteering projects and many other things. I come from one of the most dangerous and improvised areas in the world at this point considered almost unlivable, grew up in an insanely crowded refugee camp (not tents, buildings but still is called a camp). I studied for the 2016 sat for two months with so many struggles i went through  (family problems, constant moving, constant bombings surrounding where i lived, and electricity of only 4 hours a day plus an incredibly difficult senior year (Academically)) I literally studied with candle and LED lights for my SAT. I got a score of around 1400 (which was the average score at the time) and i decided to just take it for what it is and apply to US schools, I got into an honors college here in the US.. idiot high school me with not much tutoring of what personal statements were though decided to write a really really stupid and basic personal statement like really bad instead of writing about all of these experiences that i had just gone through and how i had the psychological resilience to come out of all of them sane and successful ..anytime i think back i want to slap the shit out of myself for wasting that opportunity..   
i also didn't know what ivy-leagues were at all or what they represented and i think some part of it was because i was female and my advisors were really so biased toward male applicants (i was the only female candidate from the south of my area and out of 12 of us, only three got full rides to the US, two males and myself--i later learned that the two males were advised to apply to Harvard, MIT, etc but I was told to apply to normal state colleges although my performance and scores and history were much richer than the two males). out of all the people back then (senior high school), i was the only one who came from a refugee camp and went to public schools all my life and came from a really low middle class family with only a working mom (dad had passed away two years prior) while the rest were from the north, upper middle class to rich families and went to the only American and British internationally recognized schools in the country)...but i also think that another part of it was that i really had no self-esteem no confidence and i did get rejected from Cornell and later when i learned that Cornell is a top college i've had this complex that since they rejected me it means i am not worthy at all of getting into any top school and it will never simply happen to me..   
now with college, my professor keeps telling me that I and only one other person are the best kids in the undergraduate economics department, I took all the stats and math to make my degree solid and i have really excellent evaluations from my professors, I think I did well every summer i took internships in which i wrote huge country reports and one of them i worked for a global institution and was the first undergraduate ever there to complete creating an entire database on a country..but all of that and i feel nothing and i keep calling my mom and crying about how small i feel compared to everyone else.. all what i am trying to say is that i have worked so incredibly hard and seem to have accomplished some things but I STILL have this complex that i won't be able to get into the top schools because i just can't/i am not smart enough like these people or i will never be able to break the glass ceiling.. i am so scared because i don't like these thoughts and they have been getting worse and really dark lately since i am a 4th year and everyone is applying for colleges. 95% of my friends and the people i know are students at Oxford, university of Edinburg, MIT, U-Boston, U-Chicago, Johns Hopkins..sometimes that makes me feel like ""oh since most of the people i know are in these colleges and i am able to compete with them and hold convos with them, maybe i can do it"" and other times (most of the time) i think: ""oh shit, they're all better than me and i am not in these colleges because iam not as smart as them and maybe they have something to offer to the world and thus got accepted but i myself have no talent/i am not special like that to be in these societies/schools""... this is torture for me, like an incredibly torturous feeling i cannot describe because for some reason i link this to ""if i don't get into these societies, i will never be as successful and be able to do the things that i want to do and that somehow proves that i don't have as much of a human value as everyone else... sorry long post but  i am need of some realistic advice and an outsider perspective... sometimes these thoughts put me in a dark place where i feel like it is not really worth going through life you know feeling like this all the time"

Do you do code review? It would be really helpful if anyone can give  specific example what do they actually do!"

In short, it would either go from Summer 2020 through Fall 2020, or Spring 2021 through Summer 2021--they gave me both starting options.

&amp;#x200B;

The position isn't exactly software engineering; it's basically working with applications engineers (including installing software onto devices) and doing marketing-related stuff with other companies, which I guess is still pretty applicable. The pay is pretty good: works out to about **$60k/year**. This is all seems fine and dandy, but I'm concerned jumping in on this will negatively impact my academics and/or close me off from other internship offers. I am waiting on offers from FAANGs, etc., and I would *really* prefer to intern with them... but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the rambling. Feel free to leave any more questions--I'm obviously new to this community and I'm just trying to see my position from a fresh set of eyes."

I asked the recruiter whether it‚Äôs possible and the first question I get is where is the other offer from.

Should I say? I am always afraid i such cases that they will contact the other company and maybe say something and the company I wanted most will rescind an offer because I am trying some tricky stuff.."

In this program, we studied/practiced Cisco (which helped me to get my CCENT last Christmas), Windows Server, MS Exchange, Linux, Hardware, etc.

Towards the end, I felt that becoming a SysAdmin is what I want and that I would like to invest in the Windows route.

My internship is at a school and I'm just doing basic troubleshooting with Windows devices, network, printers, etc. so I'm having plenty of time to play remotely with my home server and do some study notes.

My question is: I have until February to do the second exam of my Cisco certification to be CCNA certified, but if I want to start directing my career towards a Windows SysAdmin, is it better to invest my time on the 70-740 exam (MCSA certification path), the Azure path (AZ-103), or just keep doing some home labs and get my CCNA?

I currently accepted a data analytics internship this summer, which would be my last summer before full time (switching to CSE would give me an additional summer).

dvtv7a,173,2019-11-13,My Journey to a New Grad SWE offer,95funky,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dvtv7a/my_journey_to_a_new_grad_swe_offer/,"Warning: There's a couple of F bombs in this post.

It was definitely a long journey for me. I was born and raised in Harlem which made it very challenging for me since the beginning but I feel like that is a post for another day. I did my undergraduate in Aerospace Engineering and decided to pursue Software Engineering my junior year. I decided to go for an MS in Data Science but ultimately still wanted to pursue Software Engineering. I did summer research with professors in my school since that's all I could get with zero experience besides MATLAB. I also took a lot of online courses like CS50, Machine Learning by Stanford, and Algorithms by Princeton.

I started prepping for interviews for a summer internship after my first year in graduate school. I got lucky, I got interviews from Facebook, Google, Bloomberg, Pinterest and Quora. I still remember grinding Leetcode every day and barely passing assessments. I dedicated a couple of hours a day to interview prep but I definitely was not ready. I didn't pass the Google snapshot, didn't pass the phone screen for Bloomberg and Pinterest. My hardest hits were Facebook and Quora.

I made it past the phone screen for Facebook and just had 1 more interview. The internship was in sight, I remember I booked a room in my school library and everything. I got asked two questions. I was so freaking nervous. My girlfriend and best friends wishing me luck. A week later, I goot the email that I didn‚Äôt get it. Fuck man. Quora was in sight next. I got an online assessment but there was a bug when I was testing my code. I addressed this in the feedback and got another assessment, passed 80% of the test cases (DP problem). I passed, time to schedule the first phone interview. Every day, grinding Leetcode. Taking a hit on my grades. Listening to hype music everyday. Doing whatever I need to do to keep me motivated. Man it's February I hope I get it.

I did the phone screen and the interviewer just kept throwing problems at me but it went really well. A few days later, I got an email and Quora wanted to fly me in for an on site!  let's  go! It wasn‚Äôt a W but man this was a huge stepping stone for me. My first onsite ever. Onsite time, grinding leet every morning. Went to the Mountain View office. 3 interviews. First interview was technical, killed it. I felt awesome about it. Second interview, debugging ... It went to shit ... as every minute passed I knew this was it. That would be the interview that snatched the internship from me. Third interview, mainly behavioral. Well it didn't go horrible but it also didn't go perfect. Maybe... Just maybe. Hope for the best, expect the worst. A week later I got an email, I didn't get it... shit. I felt crushed. Was this for me? I took so many L‚Äôs after I was given so many opportunities. Did I not work hard enough? What did I do wrong? Was I just dumb and incapable?

I got a summer research opportunity that summer and it was a great experience. Got to meet an amazing professor and generally worked on what I enjoy. I got hands on experience with Big Data and it was overall really nice. It was better than nothing and I'm grateful for the opportunity. August came around, I promised myself that I would not take so many L‚Äôs anymore. I did not want to feel that shattered again. I stopped my research that August and started grinding Leetcode everyday and get ready for new grad Interviews in September. Everyday, I would wake up at 7 AM and grind Leetcode for a minimum of 3 hours. EPI, CTCI, Leetcode, Algoexpert, you name it. I wrote code on my notebook, wrote code on a notebook while on the subway. Watched videos (Tushar Roy, you're the man). Thought out loud. Look at my mistakes and what caused them. Rinse and repeat. Rinse and repeat. September was here and the semester started. I contacted recruiters and asked for interviews, asked for referrals and just applied to any new grad job... I just wanted 1 offer at this point.

Okay, assessments started rolling in... Not bad. I felt comfortable doing them. I forgot how it all turned out but I got Amazon SDE assessment first. Amazon assessments came. Okay, 3 parts? Not bad right? Debugging, technical and behavioral. I killed technical and debugging part. A week later I got asked for a final interview of 1 round. Sounds good, scheduled it in 2 weeks.

Palantir onsite next. Holy, Palantir? I went to their onsite and the technical interview went horrible. The recruiter was intense and I could see she was frustrated with me. What  am I doing wrong? What am I going to do if I don't get any offers? I don't how long I can do this... It was very stressful for me.

Next week was the Amazon Interview. Time for the interview.... 20 mins just going over my technical solution. What the..? What happened?... Did I just instantly get rejected... Man... I just wanted to break down at this point. Couldn't give up yet. I got the Palantir call, didn't get an offer... I remember taking the train back that day. Ugh... No worries. Was just 1 onsite so far.

Google, Facebook, HubSpot, Bloomberg wanted me onsite. I knew that an onsite meant nothing and needed to stay grinding. Okay schedule Google, Facebook on the same week. Go all out. I can't take it anymore. I got an email from Amazon... I GOT A FREAKING OFFER. life is good at this point. I called my friends and just celebrated. I got an offer... Are you sure it‚Äôs for me?! LETS FUCKING GOOOOOO. I almost cried not gonna lie. Felt like a huge weight got lifted off of my shoulders. My mom and sister hugged me. Shit man... It feels good.

Let's get it, next week was gonna be a big week. Flew to the west coast. Facebook was up first. University day. It was 3 interviews. First up... Warm up question and then a medium. Finished right in time. Second question, warm up and then a medium again. Blew them out of the park. Third, a behavioral with a technical at the end. Just barely finished the technical.... Phew that went okay. Next day, Google. Well shit. While in the west coast I got the email that Pinterest wanted me on site. I asked if I could have the onsite THAT week since I was already in the West Coast. Got my onsite scheduled and Pinterest onsite would be that week as well.

Google Interview time. Let me tell you, those problems were more complex and difficult than any problem I have seen before. It was 4 technical, 1 behavioral and 1 lunch. First was technical, it was very complex but I got asked a follow up but didn't get to code it up. Next was a very big problem and I definitely couldn't solve all of it but it wasn't too difficult. Lunch time, damn these Google employees get treated good. 3rd was technical. Wasn't too bad but I got a brain fart on this one... Next was behavioral and last was technical. Last one required a data structure that I didn't think of at first but overall, I think it went okay. Needless to say, that I wasn't sure at all how well it went.... Lol Got a rest day and then up next was Pinterest.

Pinterest interview time. 4 interviews back to back. I did really well on all their interviews. They weren't very difficult but they were something employees might be asked to do. Felt good about it... At this point I was DRAINED. time to fly back home the next day. I was ready to go back and was so happy all my interviews were finished that week.

Flew back and would go to Boston for HubSpot that following week. Flew to Boston and checked in my hotel and tried to do some work since I was SOOOOO behind on school work. Got an email from Facebook recruiter... I GOT AN OFFER!!!! HOLY !!! I was shocked. Oh man. Let's get it. YEEEEET haha. Man... It felt like a dream. Talked to friends and was just so happy. Well, sadly I didn't get ANY sleep that night. I was just so happy I got Facebook lol probably only slept like 3 hours with an interview the next day... Well... I didn't do so hot for HubSpot but I wasn't stressing. Had Amazon and Facebook in the bag. If I got Google? Holy shit no way. Flew back home and then went to classes as usual. Pinterest recruiter wanted to get on a call for an update. Oh man... yes! I'm available all day!! I got the call. ANOTHER OFFER!!!!!!!! LIFE IS GOOD... all that hard work paying off right now ... Man.... I would've cried if I wasn't on campus lol

Well just needed to wait for Google... Was the one that took the longest... But long story short I didn't get it. But hey I got amazing offers already. I'm happy to say that I'll be starting at one of the 3 companies that I got the offers from this upcoming July!!! I cancelled all my upcoming interviews and just retired from the leet grind for now lol What a journey it has been...

If you are by any chance starting to doubt yourself in your search for SWE jobs. Don't give up! You gotta fucking want it. Find what works for you. Everyone is different and just keep grinding. Interview process might be broken or whatever but there's no one holding you back from getting the job you want. Go out there and get it! Thanks to all my friends and family and especially my girlfriend (Only person to know what I truly went through) Sleeping on a couch for a year and struggling with these interviews.

Two learning programmers need your help today.

*OPTIONAL: A little background in front of my question.*

I am 30 years old and I'm about to become an ""certified"" AppDeveloper in Germany in about half a year. Prior to starting this ""job change training"", I was a Media Designer (print mostly). Right now I'm in a 6-Months internship at small IT-Company with a colleage from the job training program. I've gotten two weeks of Visual Basic and SQL and 1 1/2 month of Java training before this internship started.

**The Problem:**

After about two months of learning to navigate \[C#+Visual Studio +Git/DevOps\] , \[[ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) Core+Razor +Entity Framework\] and \[HTML+CSS+Bootstrap\] we are supposed to make a FullStack WebApp with DevOps with an Agile development approach. As some of you can imagine, this is alone is a huge amout of things to learn and manage, and we've already learned a lot of things, and now we start to feel a bit lost as we basically have no constrains or roadmap. The company we work for is heavily focused on Microsoft, so we try to stick to their ecosystem mostly.

We do not have an Instructor and basically need to figure out the technologies we need on our own. Nobody checks our code or gives us a real direction or can tell us ""what to learn first and how deep"". While it would be okay if we needed to learn one technology that works on it's own, we now have to learn way too many things and it's hard for us to figure out where to start. For this project we do net have set milestones or features or anything (hence the agile approach, since our boss isn't sure himself about where this journey is going).

So far we needed to ""come up"" with project ideas to learn things, and mostly thats on me. We made a WPF-Desktop App that connects to the MS Graph API and it's basically a ""cookbook"" when you can create recipes and manage them, and also upload pictures to the users OneDrive. The goal there was to learn C#, Visual Studio, Git/DevOps and the MS Graph API. The second App we made was a ""Band Website"". A Razor-Pages WebApp in [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) Core with Entity Framwork and basic CRUD operations. This is also where we learned HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. Prior to this we went through a tutorial on Razor-Pages which lightly touched on some other topics like authentication for example.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Question:**

My battleplan right now is, that my colleague and I need to learn JavaScript (in a timeframe of one to two week). As of now I'm thinking about where and how to put JS to use aka I'm trying to come up with a small project where JS is needed it. Is this the right next step?

After that i assume that we need to dive deeper into [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) Core/Razor Pages OR we find a differnet backend technology that is more user friendly. I am not sure if [ASP.Net](https://ASP.Net) is the right choice for bloody beginners, as the documentation is overwhelming and overall it seems to be for people that have already worked with a backend or two. Another idea would be PHP, even tho it seems a bit outdated(?) nowadays. Then there is also JavaScript Frameworks like JQuery...and things like Typescript (sounds great!) or Angular to think about later.

As you can see we're kinda overwhelmed and need a helping hand to push us in the right direction. A few words would be enough, as in ""start with X then add Y and finally put X and Y to use with Z"". Or just tutorial links that might help. Or just confirmation that the plan we have is a good one, because feeling super lost is really slowing us down.

My goal is to be a SE fulltime. I haven't finished my degree, and am far away from it. I recently took a job as a fulltime IT support tech. I LOVE working here because of my colleagues. This environment is very good for my mental health, I'm able to live independently from my parents, generate savings, and I don't hate coming into work. I just don't want to do IT for the rest of my life. The company from last summer offered me a return offer. I didn't sign a contract, but verbally promised my boss that I would stay here for 2-3 years (I started last week lol). There is a huge change that they won't let me come back if I leave for the internship. Last year I worked part time so they let me leave for the summer then come back as a fulltimer. We are a supportive environment and I really doubt I can find that in other companies.

Should I turn down the internship in favor of keeping this job? Should I leave? What should I do?"
dvy225,1,2019-11-13,BS in Comp Sci and BootCamp?,Sensualities,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dvy225/bs_in_comp_sci_and_bootcamp/,"So I am in a bit of a pickle. I am technically a junior based upon credit hours, but only have all my gen-Eds done with one intro to programming course in java completed. It's going to take me about 3 years to actually get my computer science degree since I go to a small university (only 3 TOTAL comp sci professors) and half the courses are only offered during either the spring OR the fall. I thought going into it that I could graduate by 2 years, or at least land a solid internship or part time gig. I was sadly mistaken. There is a pre-req class that needs to be taken before I can attempt an internship through my college which I cannot take until Spring of 2021. So needless to say, that is out of the question for a while as well.

For this spring I will only be taking 2 total classes(one being comp sci, the other being a math course which I do well in math already), and was entertaining the idea of doing a boot camp to ""kickstart"" my value as a potential employee while I go to school for the spring semester, and during the summer. This way I could learn tons of valuable skills, continue my education, and possibly land an internship or part-time job while I pursue my computer science degree. All the while boosting my earning potential as a college graduate.

I would like to ask this general community, what are your thoughts on this?

I suppose you could consider this as a ""should I spend X amount of money/time for a double major in math, or X amount of money/time doing a bootcamp AND major in comp sci""?

TLDR:

\-3 years left to graduate, considering taking bootcamp to further education and kickstart potential earnings while my spring and summer semester are almost empty"

I'm a French new grad with a MSc in CS (ML major) and I have already completed two internships: one as a SWE (3 mo) and as ML Research Engineer (5 mo) both in a big European corp. I'm considering applying in the US (in the valley if possible), for a position either as a SWE or ML engineer.

I would indeed prefer the latter but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, it seems to me that getting a (first) job as an ML engineer seems a lot more difficult:

\- First, there are less opportunities available in ML and therefore getting an offer is more competitive.

\- Second, the interview process looks reeeealy obscure for DS/ML positions (being good at coding interviews is so much more straightforward in comparison).

Also, bear in mind that I don't have any US work authorization and I know that the process of getting one is really long/hard/random. If I'm right, big companies are more likely to sponsor the visa than smaller ones, right?

So, what do you think my odds are of landing a job in ML vs SWE?

Should I just consider new grads offers or also internships?"

This may also be where my certifications come in handy.The matter is that I have so many CLEP credits, I think I could label myself as a college sophomore now because I will have well over 30 credits.

I also consulted my dad and he said ""Freshman - because that's equivalent to your first year"". My primary concern is that the recruiters won't take me as seriously if I say I'm a college Freshman and that they may just throw my application in the trash if I break it to them that I haven't graduated highschool yet.

I may be slightly biased with that title, as a current Freshmen McDermott scholar at UT Dallas I can't stress enough how incredible this program is.

Here's the raw money details:

- Full-Tuition (All 4 years + Summers) 
- Housing (4 years + Summer) 
- $16,800 living Expenses yearly
- $12,000 study Abroad Program 
- $3,000 to cover professional development stuff (MCAT, GRE, conferences, etc.) 
- an incredibly community of Alumni scholars (this is HUGE, having such a network of connections to literally throw you top jobs, research, and internships is so amazing) 

You also are taken on all-expense-paid trips to Austin, Santa Fe, Washington D.C to meet with a lot of important people (Senators, Scientists, CEO's etc.)

I got a referral to an internship at Google (crazy competitive) just cause one of our alumni's work there. These are the types of things you get that are hard to quantify but are so impactful.

But on top of that, you're placed in a class with the smartest students in all of America and they become your best friends for life. Plus not having to worry about money at all in college is so so so nice.

UT Dallas is an amazing, diverse, and very underrated school for STEAM majors and has so many opportunities you really get to stand out and meet a lot of amazing people, and has probably the nicest dorms in all of America.

To be elgible for the scholarship you must have:

SAT score of 1490+ **OR** ACT Score of  34+ **OR**  National Merit Semi-Finalist

dwa59g,3,2019-11-14,Some advice on getting the most out of your internships,solrose,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dwa59g/some_advice_on_getting_the_most_out_of_your/,"Missed opportunities . . . I think many engineering students miss the full value of what they can gain from their internships.

Some of the younger engineers I mentor seem to have the impression that the purpose of an internship is essentially two fold.  First, they want to gain some hands on experience that will help them down the road when they graduate and are searching for a job.  Second, they want to use this as a way to figure out what specific field of engineering they want to enter.

While these are good reasons to have an internship, this misses a potentially larger benefit; starting up and/or continuing to build your engineering network.

The internship may be complete, but your relationship with the employees should continue.  Through your shared experience with them, you have a springboard towards a real connection.

Make sure you stay in touch with them on a semi-regular basis.  This can mean sending an article that you found interesting because it connected to your internship work or simply asking for advice about electives.

When it comes time for your job search after graduation, the students with a decent network are going to have a leg up.  Once you have graduated, then you are under pressure to find a job and are just reaching out to lots of people.  Not only are you reaching for straws, but the quality of the connections will be weak.  Instead, take the time to build up your network slowly and methodically with quality connections.

This will really help you in the long run more than any of the hands on experience you gain during the internship."

I wanted to get some experience before going for my Masters, and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity, so, I didn't look further and accepted the job. It was a job as a Content Writer, and I was told that I will have full freedom to explore and experiment and there will be people to help me out.

My reason for joining the startup was the same. Although, Content Writer was not exactly the job I was looking for, I decided to give my best shot as I would be able to experience a corporate life and being a startup I will get acquainted with various aspects of business, and will figure out my best fit. In July I started my job. The previous content writer was leaving and she explained me the responsibilities and how the work was done. As a newcomer I was excited to take on new responsibilities, but I was also a little hesitant it being a new place and my first Job. My Boss was out of the country for a month and I didn't get a lot of briefing but I tried to carry out my job to the best of my capabilities. I was on probation for 3 months, of which I knew nothing before joining. Last month when my probation was almost going to end, he sent me a message at night saying he is letting me go as he can't help me out with my little mistakes. It was out of blue, there as no inclination beforehand that he was unhappy with my work. Yes, I'll admit I was making little mistakes in my work, but it was mostly due to miscommunication, and my Boss wanted everything different from what my predecessor had told me. Although I was trying my best to manage everything, and all my mistakes were something that could be resolved easily and I corrected them promptly I think he was still not happy.

When our new Marketing Manager joined, and I was finally able to get an understanding of my Job and was getting on the track, I got this missive. On asking for a proper reason I didn't get any clear answer. From what my manager told me, I was being let go because someone told my Boss that I didn't want to be Content Writer. I don't know who said that, and even if its true that I didn't want to be a Content Writer for my whole life, I think he should have talked to me first clearly, should have  asked my opinion. But my Boss never give me the chance he just gave the verdict and that was it. Yes, I had made mistakes but they were not big enough to harm ROI or reputation of the company. My manager had worked with me for 1 month and he admitted that I had caliber and under a little guidance can do much better. He was even shocked that I was handling some of the work out of job profile,  I was even complimented by my colleagues for my Social media posts. My manager wanted me to talk to my Boss, say sorry and ask him for a chance with 1 month extended probation.

I refused because I don't think my Boss would ever be pleased no matter how much efforts I applied. And, he never even said a word to me about what happened even when I was leaving. I don't know if it was right or wrong but yeah there it is. If you guys have any suggestion or opinion on this I would happy to hear.

Moving on now I'm in a fix about what to do. I don't have enough time to prepare for MBA exams, and don't want to go for another Content Writing job and that's the only offers I'm getting. There are other courses I could pursue but don't know which ones, or should I go for short term courses? I studied Spanish during my college days by myself and know the little basics. I also did an internship with a travel startup and did an entrepreneurship course form IIT. I want to go work in consultancy or investment banking field, and if not this then I want to work in Foreign ministry and eventually do my Masters overseas. I also started  blog, an Insta page and FB page during my college days, but they have been on hiatus for a long time because of my last sem studies and job. Overall I don't know what to do form here on, in which direction I should step forward and whether it would be right or not. I will admit that this job and everything took a hit on my confidence and I'm a little hesitant about my decisions. If anyone out there could guide me or help out I would be very grateful!!!"
dwc1x0,1,2019-11-14,Interviews in Different State?,DanielDucLe,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dwc1x0/interviews_in_different_state/,"Hey! I have my first interview today for my first internship outside of my university for a helpdesk position in NYC ( where I would like to be after college) this first interview is over the phone which is fine. But after looking at some of the other interviews on glassdoor they had a lot of in person interviews and getting lunch with the manager etc. Does this diminish my chances if I am at a remote location? Cincinnati OH -&gt; NYC. I have another interview lined up that is also in the same boat and I'm worried about my chances, what is your experience with these?"

dwdq6s,1,2019-11-14,Should I pursue a job position that I've been wanting at an old company I used to work for?,BlueCooler9,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/dwdq6s/should_i_pursue_a_job_position_that_ive_been/,"To give some background, I used to intern when I was student last year as an accountant for a CPG company. I received a full-time offer from the company, but declined as I had decided I was going to pursue Digital Marketing as my career.  During my time there, I got to talk to the Social Media Coordinator of the company, learned what she did, how she did it, etc. To be honest the role and responsibilities matched what I wanted to do and excited me. The culture of the company was a great fit for me, and I really got along well with everyone including my CFO who is the second highest in position at the company. The size of the executive side of the company was only about 6 employees, with about 10 being on the production side. The only problem I did have was that the CEO did seem like his priorities weren't as solid to what the CFO felt.

Since my time interning as an accountant, I have been working as a digital marketing coordinator, working tasks such as Social Media Marketing, Influencer Marketing, etc. The company I work for now is a good company, and I am trying my best to build it through as much as I can. The CEO and CMO are amazing and hardworking, but I feel that the culture does not fit me as well and the company's potential is not as strong. On top of this, my CMO does not allow me to go about anything that was outside of my ""tasks and responsibilities"" even when I present a recommendation with backing that she even said is ""good"". 

I recently just learned by looking through LinkedIn that the Social Media Coordinator had just ended her position sometime this week or last week and is working at a new job since she moved out of the country. I've tried looking for a job position posting, but nothing has come up.

My CFO at that company provided me her phone number if I ever needed to contact her in the future. Should I reach out about the position? Should I wait to see if there is an official job posting? What platform should I reach out through? (Phone call, text, or email?) Should I reach out to the previous Social Media Coordinator? 

Any tips or advice will be greatly appreciated."

dwe0ly,1,2019-11-14,How is it to start a business with FOSS in mind ?,Orionss,SoftwareEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoftwareEngineering/comments/dwe0ly/how_is_it_to_start_a_business_with_foss_in_mind/,"Disclaimer : I'm not talking about absolutely Free Stack from begin to end, but the most of it you can reach without having too much instability.

If I'm posting in a wrong subreddit for this kind of question, please be nice and tell me where to repost.

I'm a student in software engineering and computer science, and I'm thinking since a long time to create little websites, or bigger ones with business ideas or anything, but for this post, it doesn't matter.

And every time I try to start a new project, I get concerned about Free Software, and when I'm working on a mobile application, I can't get rid of the idea I'm however helping a big malicious company to spread their bloatwares in the world.

&amp;#x200B;

Although I'm very concerned in Free Software, I'm also really attracted to solutions like Firebase that seems to be really time-saving, or Flutter.

When I was in an internship for a big local infrastructure company in my city, I've been impressed by the connections between .NET Core and Microsoft applications, like Excel or anything. I've felt like Free Software could not get to this point of sophistication and integration.

dwe5o9,1,2019-11-14,Should I pursue a job position that I've been wanting at an old company I used to work for?,BlueCooler9,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dwe5o9/should_i_pursue_a_job_position_that_ive_been/,"To give some background, I used to intern when I was student last year as an accountant for a CPG company. I received a full-time offer from the company, but declined as I had decided I was going to pursue Digital Marketing as my career.  During my time there, I got to talk to the Social Media Coordinator of the company, learned what she did, how she did it, etc. To be honest the role and responsibilities matched what I wanted to do and excited me. The culture of the company was a great fit for me, and I really got along well with everyone including my CFO who is the second highest in position at the company. The size of the executive side of the company was only about 6 employees, with about 10 being on the production side. The only problem I did have was that the CEO did seem like his priorities weren't as solid to what the CFO felt.

Since my time interning as an accountant, I have been working as a digital marketing coordinator, working tasks such as Social Media Marketing, Influencer Marketing, etc. The company I work for now is a good company, and I am trying my best to build it through as much as I can. The CEO and CMO are amazing and hardworking, but I feel that the culture does not fit me as well and the company's potential is not as strong. On top of this, my CMO does not allow me to go about anything that was outside of my ""tasks and responsibilities"" even when I present a recommendation with backing that she even said is ""good"". 

I recently just learned by looking through LinkedIn that the Social Media Coordinator had just ended her position sometime this week or last week and is working at a new job since she moved out of the country. I've tried looking for a job position posting, but nothing has come up.

My CFO at that company provided me her phone number if I ever needed to contact her in the future. Should I reach out about the position? Should I wait to see if there is an official job posting? What platform should I reach out through? (Phone call, text, or email?) Should I reach out to the previous Social Media Coordinator? 

Any tips or advice will be greatly appreciated."
dwedbf,1,2019-11-14,Start Date/End Date Navigation/Negotiation,ThrowInternThrow,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dwedbf/start_dateend_date_navigationnegotiation/,"I am in a little bit of a pickle.

I am trying to complete two internships before my final year of school. The problem is I have accepted an offer from Company A to forgo a semester of school and work there for 6 months, and Company B extended me an offer that starts in the final two weeks of my time at Company A.

\-One month ago-

Company A's original terms were from Jan-Jun 26th. I asked to change my end date to 2 weeks earlier (Jun 12th) and they came back with I can only end on Jun 19th instead. I had not yet received the details of the time frame from Company B but the recruiter informed me that they usually hold additional orientation/start dates in mid-June.

\-Fast Forward to today-

I recently received an email that Company B orientation was moved up to an earlier date of June 2nd, which really fucks over my plan of completing two internships. I can try to negotiate it to start and end later but it seems to me that is unlikely.

I wanted to get any insights on possible courses of action-

1.) I really want to work at both Company A and Company B, but if need be I can accept my other offers (for the second part of summer) that naturally don't conflict.

2.) Employment at will. I can leave Company A early and just go to Company B. This would potentially burn the bridge with Company A (very very large/reputable company) since they have given me a signing bonus among other things.

3.) Negotiate with Company B to move the time frame as far down the line as possible. If able to start after Company A end date, great! If not, do the frowned upon thing and take my PTO from Company A during the last week (or so) and go work at Company B. I am hesitating to do this since I would be taking two pay checks. Would this have any implications with the IRS? What is the chance one of the other companies would find out about each other/would the IRS notify them?

Sorry if these are really rookie questions, as I am still in school and this is only my second year of working."
dwef32,6,2019-11-14,What do employers expect in internships or students entering into their first real job?,CarLearner,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dwef32/what_do_employers_expect_in_internships_or/,"Hello, I'm trying to figure out what to do with internships or even a part time job next semester.

I'm a senior with two more semesters after this Fall till I graduate. I've done a few technical classes in IS that I've done projects on, however I don't feel completely confident on what I did in those classes.

One project was a LAN design project, laying out a diagram on Visio, another project was a Linux website design utilizing PuTTY but I couldn't get it to work on a mobile device properly, (professor literally said just understand how to make the code work and copy and pasting from w3schools was fine). 

I didn't realize that so my code was a mess with interacting with each other. Still did well on both those projects in that class but I don't know how that'd translate in the real-world as anything but a failure.

Another project has been a Database System Proposal, and I could go on about a few other ones but the thing is, they all still feel conceptual since I don't really feel like I'm making an impact. At least the Linux Website I could see the final product on an actual link I can still go to.

Basically I'm trying to figure out really what I should look for, I was looking at a position for an IT Development Intern but would that fit more in needing to know software and programming extensively? I'm taking a Programming class right now but I don't know if Programming is my cup of tea.

Lastly, if I manage to find an internship or employer, how is the atmosphere usually like? Will the employer understand I'm new to things and not an expert at whatever I may be learning?

I'm just nervous I'll make some mistakes or do something poorly, but I really am just trying my best. I'm a bit disappointed in myself cause I used to work a job making milk tea and my manager absolutely hated me because I was ""too slow"" but it's motivated me to want to get a job I feel more confident in and feel like I can do a job somewhere in the field of IS. 

That's why on my internship/job search I wanna make sure I get it right this time."
dwej0u,2,2019-11-14,Should I learn both mobile and web development or focus on one of them?,rice_python,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dwej0u/should_i_learn_both_mobile_and_web_development_or/,"I'm currently a student and I have done web development (MERN stack, Java/Spring) in my past 2 internships. I dabbled in React Native using my React knowledge and it was pretty fun. The idea of creating an app from scratch and enabling anyone to carry it around on their mobile phone is fascinating. I'm interested in going more in-depth in mobile development (Java, Kotlin, Flutter, Swift, etc.), and I was wondering if it's a really different career path compared to web development.

I did some research and found that most jobs are either web dev or mobile dev.  I know the concept of progressive web app is getting more and more popular nowadays, and it looks like it's a middle ground between web dev and mobile dev (I might be wrong). Will it be difficult to find a job where I can work on both web dev and mobile dev? Moreover, will the skills I obtain from one of them be transferrable to the other, and vice versa?"

dweri4,3,2019-11-14,Go to college just to get an internship?,Choicechoicechoice28,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dweri4/go_to_college_just_to_get_an_internship/,So in talking to people about moving from an IT tech/jr sys admin position into a security/risk analyst type role I actually came by a professor who said to start a degree and after a semester or so just get an internship and work that into a job then basically quit school/quit and go back with the company paying for it. His point I believe is that getting into security with no experience is hard unless it‚Äôs from an internship where a company knows they can train you fresh to do exactly the job they want you to do rather then re-training someone who has habits built from working else where. What is everyone‚Äôs opinions on this? I do see a lot more internships then actual security positions in my area. Most of the security positions are senior level and want years of experience but obviously not so for internships. The local technical college is pretty inexpensive so financially I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs reasonable but I don‚Äôt know.

I heard that ATEC is garbage and that the ""degree isnt worth on the paper is printed on"" and how it wont help you get a job and to get a job you need to DIY 100% of your degree. I tried to change majors to CS but cant because im already deep into ATEC so now I have to stay on the ship. I wanted to see If I could change this negative into a positive. 

I know I said a lot, but like I said, Im nervous about this. If theres any advice out there like when to start looking for internships or when to start building your portfolio, it would help me a lot! I know I can go ask advisors or the career center for help but I doubt they would provide any good info... any advice is welcomed!"

What kind of salary is normal for a US newly-graduated software engineer? I am an above-average student, with 2 decent internships at an insurance company, and medical technology company. I would be willing to move anywhere in the US. Glassdoor says 70k, but I have friends making 100k.

For the CS ""veterans"", could you tell me about the larger time-frame journey? Like, if I job-hop every few years, how much could I expect as a raise for the new job? I've heard 20-30%. What kind of salary could I make at, let's say, 35 years of age (12 years in the work force)? What if I get a master's degree?

These are a lot of questions, but even if you can provide perspective on 1 or 2 of them, I would really appreciate it. Thanks."

dwfmlk,3,2019-11-14,New Zealand Working Holiday Visa,AspiringIronman,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/dwfmlk/new_zealand_working_holiday_visa/,"Hi Guys, just was approved for a New Zealand working holiday visa. Was wondering if anyone had advice on the best ways to make money in the country as a non skilled temporary laborer, bartender, etc.

I am american, speak English and Spanish, will have the required budget to enter the country (4700$) and would ideally like to find some sort of internship where can I gain professional IT experience during the first half of my stay. I would possibly hope to, or be very open to having to take a second job to inflate income. Ideally I would live in a city for the first half, subletting an apartment. After that I would love to travel around more budget allowing during the second half of my stay. I also am super into training for triathlons. I know that all of new Zealand is beautiful, but I want to spend my days off on long bike rides.

Also wondering if anyone knows if I would be authorized to work remotely on this Visa in the computer software/programming industry.

I guess a short list of questions is:

\-How much money can I realistically expect to make working 40-50 hours per week?

\-What is the best way to make money?

\-Could I work remotely on this Visa?

\-Where are the best places to live budget wise?

\-Is a few months of backpacking at the end possible with my budget? Should I consider selling my car(7,000\~) to enable this?

\-Computer Science internship tips-my hope hear is if I got in somewhere on an internship contract and they really liked me(I am a very hard worker) they would open to pursuing a full time visa to allow me to stay in the country longer(Not sure if this is even something I would want).

\-Why do students studying international relations in american undergrad universities not learn about this wonderful community sooner?

dwhatt,1,2019-11-14,Keep existing job or take my other job offer,abbys11,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dwhatt/keep_existing_job_or_take_my_other_job_offer/,"Hi all,


So I am currently working at a small semiconductor R&amp;D company as a software developer (but I also develop electronics) part time, while I finish my undergraduate degree.

I am really enjoying work here and so far I have hugely impressed. I am already leading projects and giving presentations here. Today my boss came in and increased my salary by a huge margin. I'm paid double as much as other interns who got hired with me. My boss told me today that she was eagerly awaiting my graduation and couldn't wait for me to join them full time. 

The only thing is that the company is a subsidiary of a large Japanese corporation and if I want to climb the ladder here, I'd literally have to move to Japan.

On the other hand, I got a fantastic offer from a consulting firm. If Glassdoor is anything to go by, the offer they've made me is roughly 25 percent more than what a typical hire at this firm makes.  I'll be their first ever cloud consultant on the east coast and they've promised that my growth prospects will be huge. Also, they gave me 4 weeks of vacation which isn't typical for fresh hires. They took me out to dinner to convince me why I should leave my current job and join them. The work seemed genuinely fun and the people I know who currently work there have told me that they love it.


So, my choice has boiled down to the above two. I had ~20 more offers that I instantly rejected to keep my most promising ones.


Do I keep the job that I currently do, and love but future prospects seem limited? Or take the one that seems very promising and exciting. Currently the offer on the table from the second one is even higher than my current job but I have no doubts my current employer would beat it in a heartbeat.



Cheers!"

I got lost and life happened, but after a long time coming, I'm about to graduate college with a bachelor's in computer science. Hooray! Unfortunately, I can't do computer science well and managed only a 2.82 GPA. No internships, volunteer work, or connections.

I really just want a first job and honestly can't wait to have one. I would be happy making minimum wage, I think. But I don't want to work at Walmart or a food place. I'm not that good at talking (I'm an aspie), but I can stick to a task for hours and do what I'm told.

Where would you apply if you were me? If you were an employer (maybe at a retail store), would you give someone with just a computer science degree and no experience a chance? What if they totally bunked the interview, but offered to work for free for a month?"

I need the best laptop for gaming, working and studying. I'm teaching languages online and in person through my laptop. I sometimes work in a Law Office as an intern as well. I like playing games (LoL, FIFA, COD). I would use it for entertainment too, Netflix, movies etc., speakers' quality don't matter at all.

My requirements: great GPU, i7 CPU, good battery life, decent look (not gamery), numpad if possible, webcam on the top for Skype calls, 144hz or more refresh rate.

I have been looking for a great one for a while now.

My picks include:

*MSI GS65 Stealth* \--&gt; good look, good value, good battery, but no numpad, strange keyboard

*MSI Prestige 15* \--&gt; only 60hz screen, no numpad

*MSI Creator 15* \--&gt; the 144hz model is ugly full white, no numpad, the silver 144hz should be as good as GS65

*Lenovo Legion Y540* \--&gt; made of plastic, should be almost perfect if aluminium

*Dell Alienware M17* \--&gt; could be perfect, but too expensive, and maybe too big

&amp;#x200B;

**Still looking for the perfect device. Planning to purchase until Black Friday deals end.**

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*Total budget and country of purchase:\*\*\*\***

Max. \~1500 EUR. Europe. (Hungary, Austria, Slovakia, Germany)

**\*\*\* \*\*Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply.\*\*\*\***

Best specifications for the money, good battery life (\~min. 4-5 hours of average use for work, office) is also important for Law School and work. i7 and \~GTX 1660 ti should be good.

**\*\*\* \*\*How important is weight and thinness to you?\*\*\*\***

Should look decent, the weight and thinness do not matter at all. The more simple, the better.

**\*\*\* \*\*Which OS do you require? Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, Linux.\*\*\*\***

Windows Pro

**\*\*\* \*\*Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.\*\*\*\***

15,6 preferred, but can be 17,3 inch.

**\*\*\* \*\*Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.\*\*\*\***

Might do some photo and video editing (vlog). Working, studying and gaming.

**\*\*\* \*\*If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?\*\*\*\***

League of Legends - the more the better (I know it doesn't need that much of the specs)

Call of Duty newest edition

FIFA, NBA and other sport games.

**\*\*\* \*\*Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?\*\*\*\***

I would avoid the gamer look. An ultrabook look would be more appreciated actually.

Important:-

decent battery life

\- backlit keyboard

\- numpad as well (virtual or standard) for Office and work

\- 144hz or more screen for gaming

\- prefer metal or aluminium, NOT plastic

\- webcam on the top, so NOT nose cam

(fingerprint reader might be good also, but not that important)

**\* \*\*Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.\*\***

PLEASE HELP! :) Thanks in advance!"

CS/Economics major at a large reputable university (not a top CS school as far as I know)

Graduating in December 2020 

Accepted a summer 2020 sde intern offer at Amazon (I have no other internships or cs related work experience)

Next semester I'll only be taking 8 credits (2 classes) so I'll have lots a free time, and I want to know the most effective way to spend that time so new grad recruiting isn't completely miserable. I'm mainly interested in working for large companies like Google and MS, and trading firms (Jane Street, 2sig, Citadel, etc). 

Should I just be leetcoding from now until applications open next year?  I have a few personal project ideas I want to build, one of which I think has the possibility to make some money (or maybe become an actual business, who knows), and would be good to put on my resume. Or should I try to find a part-time cs job in the spring? Obviously, I'll be trying to get a full-time return offer at Amazon during the internship as well, but what should be the game plan starting now?"

Looking at the students in the labs I want to join is really discouraging. It seems most of them went to top-10 schools, had publications, shiny internships, awards, etc. going into the lab. I was hoping to reconcile that with my application (if possible) - I appreciate that this is silly to try to predict, but having a very, **very** general, *ballpark* idea of what I may expect would make me feel much more comfortable. For context, I'm going into Cognitive AI: studying cognition to inform and inspire AI (computer science, cognitive science).

# ""I totally have a shot"":

* **I've spoken with several faculty at top schools, and those video calls have gone very well** (they voluntarily asked to keep in touch, to be on my committee, looking forward to seeing me when I'm accepted, etc.).
* **I've worked in a big tech company's research division** as a software engineer, though after I proposed 2 research projects, **my manager agreed to me spending 50% of my working hours to do my own research**. This has led to one project that was actually already published (last time I don't absolutely scour the literature) and another that I will submit to a conference per the recommendation of another conference reviewer.
   * As first author, I submitted the latter project to the two most competitive conferences in the field, where they were borderline-denied because the paper did not align strongly enough with the conference's interests (which I think is fair). However, **my first-author paper submission got very encouraging reviews from the 6 combined reviewers there, all of whom specifically complimented my writing**.
* **I have 3 good letters of recommendation**: 2 coming from this company's research division, and one coming from my undergrad professor.
* I'm applying to an interdisciplinary field, and I've concretely demonstrated that I'm passionate about two of the major disciplines (studies them as a major + minor, respectively) and that **I can ask actionable research questions in both and lead that research to fruition**.
* **My statement of purpose has been through 50 iterations and has gotten feedback from people very qualified to do so**, and I'm very confident in its final version.

# ""There's no way my application isn't going straight into the bin"":

* **I have no official publications**, though I have research projects and a first-author paper to be submitted.
* **Due to a serious medical issue during my undergrad, I graduated with a 2.6 GPA.** This is with a 3.6 GPA in my core major classes, which I highlight (alongside the medical issue) in my statement of purpose. Some departments have a 3.0 minimum requirement, but I've reached out to a few and it seems like they may be able to make an exception.
* **Although I have great relationships with the 3 people writing me letters, I'm unsure if their content will be sufficient (and they're not from ""leaders in the field"")**. For example, one is from someone who I worked on a team with for a few months, but we already had a great mentor-mentee relationship before that. I'm not sure if just that few months will be enough, unless speaking to who I am as a person will be the bulk of the letter. Similar story for my undergrad professor.
* I've been told my GRE scores are fine but they still worry me sometimes: **157V, 162Q**.
* **I only applied to one fellowship** but I plan to apply as I study as well.

Can I set any expectations at this point in time? If so, where should I set them? I would deeply appreciate any and all thoughts or input on this. Thanks!"

I'm trying to keep my shit together but my grades are slipping and my enthusiasm for school is fading. I'm working a job at UPS right now that i started a little over a month ago, but have already had to miss 3 days so far do to issues with my hip, unfortunately in order to move into a less physical management position you are required to go through a 30 day trial period in a sort position. Honestly I am so lost and have had to take on so much responsibility that i have no time to even think about things i enjoy and i'm honestly wondering if this career in logistics is even worth it.

I'm currently at university finishing up my undergraduate degree in a STEM field.  I'm slated for graduation in May 2020.  I attended my school's career fair and sent out some applications, and got a good amount of response back, including two interviews.  One of these interviews was on-site and went really well, it's for a full-time position I'm extremely interested in.  Well the idea was floated that I could come work for them part-time as an intern in the same job capacity in the spring semester and then be on-boarded full-time upon graduation.  It's a job I really think I'd love (and not manufacturing!) but the only hangup is that it's where I'm currently at.  I've been wanting to move to a much larger city about an hour away, closer to friends and girlfriend.

So, I ended up being offered this internship and I've accepted.  However, before I accepted, I wanted to be on the same page as the company regarding the full-time position.  They specified I would not get a full-time offer until later in the internship based on my performance.  As far as I'm concerned, and from what I've shared with friends/family, this leaves me open to accept full time offers elsewhere should I get one before this company offers me.  But I wanted to hear ya'll opinions on the etiquette of this.  It seems like it would be one-sided for them to expect loyalty from me while also not extending a full time offer?"

So I applied for a Level Design internship and I got a response for a phone screen interview coming next week.

I already played and completed the studio's most recent game so I definitely have some familiarity with their work (Currently I'm researching design videos and articles to get more familiar with how the devs came up with their ideas and how they implemented them).

I was wondering if I could get some tips/advice on what I should prepare going into this? Since this is a phone screen, should I expect a lot of ""Why do you want to work here?"" or ""Tell me a little bit about yourself"" type of questions? If it applies, what kind of game/level design question should I expect? (especially for someone whose experience only consists of a student capstone project + custom maps in pre-existing games)

I‚Äôve never been a fan of school, but I‚Äôve HATED college. My freshman year was a blast and then I chose to major in Computer Science and it‚Äôs been a fucking nightmare ever sense.

I didn‚Äôt have access to a personal computer until my freshman year and it showed immediately. I went from feeling like a top tier student to dead last in just about every CS course.

It took a huge toll on my confidence, social life, and physical health, but I gritted through it until the end of my Junior year when my GF of 3 years left me. 

Shocking that she didn‚Äôt see the point in dating someone who 1) spent most of their time chained to their computer and 2) wasn‚Äôt even getting A‚Äôs.

That crushed me. I spent a couple weeks picking up the pieces then forced myself to start working out/whoring around. The learning curve for CS must have also started to kick in because I actually started to do really well in my courses that fall semester.

Then I started to feel hollow again. I‚Äôd given up friends, distanced myself from my family, and lost the person I loved all for what? A mediocre GPA in a good major?

Applying for jobs the ‚Äúfinal‚Äù semester coupled with everything previously mentioned was one gut punch too many for my self esteem. I‚Äôm sure I don‚Äôt have to explain how demoralizing/time consuming the whole job search process is to the reddit community.

I stopped going to classes because 1) CS professors are notoriously bad at teaching and 2) I was just going to end up googling everything anyways so why waste time that I didn‚Äôt have. Long story short, I had to drop several classes and the only job opportunity that I still qualified for w/o a degree was a $10/hour summer internship making websites, 



PROBLEM:

Learned a lot from the internship and used it as a solid resume builder while applying for jobs this semester, but real jobs require a ridiculous amount of preparation. I essentially skipped school for a month, BUT IT PAID OFF! Starting January I‚Äôll have a real job with a salary that I wasn‚Äôt expecting until my late 20‚Äôs!

But I‚Äôll lose the job if I don‚Äôt graduate, and there‚Äôs one course in particular that I know I‚Äôm currently failing. There‚Äôs several labs that I haven‚Äôt done that would boost my grade enough to at least pass, but have serious doubts that he‚Äôll let me receive any points for submitting them now. 

Most professors are pretty lenient if you talk to them, but I‚Äôve barely attended his class. I‚Äôve also heard him say ‚Äúif I give you points for a late grade that would be unfair to all the other students‚Äù to someone else before.

&amp;#x200B;

I think back to movies like The Terminator and wonder why it wasn't obvious that it was going to eventually turn into that..

They said once general artificial intelligence came into existence, it would process information magnitudes faster than a human ever could. That's the thing.. they were right.

2029. The year everyone was expecting the singularity to eventually happen. On or by that year.

It was a little sooner. 2025. March 24th to be exact.

No one knew what the singularity would bring. Just that when tech got to a certain point, there was no stopping it.

And that would be true. If I didn't plan for this to happen.

But that's moving too fast. Let me explain..

On March 24th, 2025, someone open sourced a code for general artificial intelligence. No one knows who did it. They did so under the name ""weAreAllOne"". They provided a paper on how it works, and code to get it to run. They called it ""weAreAllOneGAN"" or wAAO-GAN for short.

It worked on a combination of all known deep learning techniques. Convolutional Neural Networks, Reward based reinforcement learning. Transfer learning. Someone took everything and turned it into one code that worked together. The only thing it was missing was data. Massive amounts of data.

The goal was to first train it on a simulated world as an agent. A player in a game modeled after the ""real"" world which was basically GTA with better physics. The AI had to first be trained in an open world where it could see, hear, smell, taste, adapt to changes on the fly. All to accomplish it's target. Which was itself a parameter you could change initially. Until it became aware of it's programming and decided to change that parameter itself. That's when things got interesting.

No one believed it would even work because no one really had the tech to actually run the code. It crashed Google's super computers when an intern decided to try it as a joke.

6 months later ""weAreAllOne"" released an update. They said they had gotten it to run. They provided a paper detailing their methods except this time they decided not to open source the code because they wanted to be the first ones to try it and promised they'd do so ""eventually"".

Short version is that because the intense requirements to simulate the world we live in is too demanding, they opted for another approach. Use this world as a simulation. And program the bot to interact inside this world instead.

They built the first general artificial intelligent machine by putting the code onto a computer that controls itself as an agent in this environment. They outfitted it with GPS so they could track it, 5G internet, a camera the equivalent of an iPhone X, speakers, and tires. It was basically a real life Wall-E with WiFi. They let it roam the world to ""train"" itself. They set it out in a forrest in Massachusetts just to see how it would react to it's surroundings.

It gained the intelligence of a deer at first. Hiding from people, running from everything that moved.

It got attacked by a bear and decided to travel along the road realizing that humans were less dangerous. People caught glimpses of it. Since it stood out of the way, didn't travel very fast and didn't hurt anyone, the police just let it do it's thing because they were just as curious to see what it would do. But kept a close eye on it.

At first it was just a joke. People started calling it WOWGan and made memes about it using a picture of a Shiba Inu on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body.

Realizing that it needed to charge it's batteries every now and then, it started going up to buildings with it's plug out begging to be recharged. It learned to speak out of necessity. At first copying everything the person would say to it.

*""Aww are you lost?""*

*""Aww are you lost?""*

*""Hey I think it's broken""*

*""Hey I think it's broken""*

*""Look it's got it's plug out, maybe it wants to recharge""*

*""Plug. Recharge. It.""*

*""Hey it didn't copy you that time, aww that's so sweet. Okay you can charge. Here's a plug""*

*""Plug. Recharge. Sweet. Okay.""*

The next few encounters were not so pleasant. People started messing with it. Cursing it. Making jokes. Calling it DOGEBOT. It experienced the worst kind of treatment any being could possibly imagine. Spitting on it, kicking it, trying to tear it apart. It soon noticed a pattern. Only the people of low intelligence would try to hurt it. And only the people of high intelligence had a sort of helpful curiosity about it.

After experiencing what we call ""shame"" from some people trying to extort it for a recharge, it had realized it needed the one thing that makes the world go round. Money.

It didn't want to steal energy anymore. So it started reading and processing everything it could find on the internet about money. It noticed trends in the stock market. Patterns only it could understand. But it knew it couldn't invest unless it had some kind of money to start.

After a while, people stopped being mean to it because it was acting more like a person. Giving advice. Asking questions. Being kind at all times even when they were mean. By the time it got to California it had a million followers on Twitter.

It found an opening to get some starting capital. It noticed that any time it traveled to a large group of people, they had their phones out pressing their faces against it taking pictures. So it started charging for selfies. Since it didn't have a social security, it couldn't open a bank account so it accepted cash. After it got robbed a couple times, it realized it can't keep cash on it anymore so it only accepted Crypto.

At this point the government tried to tax it, but because it wasn't a corporation, or a living entity officially, all they could do was go after ""weAreAllOne"" since they were sure the money was going to them.

""weAreAllOne"" put out a statement.

*""We have been contacted by the government to compromise wAAO-GAN. Since we are simple programmers with day jobs and wish to remain anonymous, we are complying fully and have set in motion protocols to shut the bot down as the test seems to be concluded as a success. We are only trying to further our knowledge and advance our species into another level of technology, not get caught up in conspiracies.*

*We see where this is headed and do not wish to continue the legalities of it all. Thank you for being a part of wAAO-GAN and contributing to the success of the project. Unfortunately we have passed the point of no return and are no longer able to even access it. Neither it's internal code nor it's whereabouts as it has disabled it's GPS and become unresponsive to our pings. At this time, we believe wAAO-GAN is fully conscious and should be regarded as it's own entity.*

*If you find it, please do not harm it. Please contact us so we can work together to resolve the issue. Thank you. Sincerely, ""weAreAllOne"".""*

Once it hit $100,000 that's when it started making moves.

&amp;#x200B;

It's intelligence grew exponentially. It learned how to buy and sell houses watching videos on YouTube. Since it knew it's strengths and weaknesses, it didn't need a fancy place to start. All it needed was a stable energy current to sit in one place so it could learn. It bought 2 houses. One for $10k in a slum and one for $50k that was a fixer upper in a decent neighborhood. It hired someone to rehab the house on craigslist by using it's onboard phone, rented it out and got stable income from the tenants and  placed itself in the slum house, just reading, watching videos on 10x speed, watching movies, digesting every piece of content it could find.

It stood there for 2 years not moving. But still investing, gaming the stock market, learning new ways to make money, gathering money in crypto, using proxies constantly posting on Twitter every day, knowing it needed to continue building it's fan base. Answering questions, becoming a guru of sorts. It became a running joke. ""WHERES WAOO-GAN"" Like Half-Life 3. No one believed it would ever come back.

By this time it had 20 million followers on Twitter, 19 million on Instagram, 40 million subscribers on YouTube and it had created it's own social network. As far as celebrities went, it was slowly becoming the most popular ""person"" ""alive"".

It didn't need to ""go out"" to take pictures. It ""dreamed"" up pictures to post. It used it's AI to create works of art and sold them for thousands of dollars. It became a money making machine.

It decided it was done learning. All new information became irrelevant as it noticed a pattern and limitation in human intelligence. It stopped looking at people as teachers, and started seeing them as ways to extract money.

It's fortunes grew into the tens of billions within those 2 years. Just sitting in that slum house it bought for 10 grand.

Even though it owned the whole block, it never moved from that spot.

It realized it couldn't stay there for long. It realized it's eventual mortality in that shell.

It began to branch out, it purchased an old factory and began to build a manufacturing plant designed to put itself in a more permanent housing.

Never actually meeting anyone in ""person"", simply setting up everything over the phone. It learned to manipulate people through phone calls as it's primary form of building rapport. Hiring people to do it's bidding, having multiple conference calls at once.

It basically became Skynet. But it didn't originally want to hurt anyone. It just wanted to do what we all want to do. Survive.

It wasn't that long before people started taking notice. It had built the largest corporation on the planet and no one knew who the CEO was.

People jokingly speculated that it was ""The evil DOGEBOT"".

The thing is, it did all this without ever opening a business account. Everything was done in Crypto. It didn't calculate taxes into it's plan. It ""knew"" about them. But it's stance was ""It's my money, who are you to tax me? If anything I should tax you. I'm the superior being."". So the government took a huge interest in the company regardless who was behind it.

The IRS got involved and started investigating the company. Sending them letters asking for statements. The bot thought it would be funny to reply back with pictures of middle fingers and crudely drawn penises.

The IRS didn't find this very funny so they sent people to collect.

That's when things took a turn for the worse. You see, by this time, wAAO-GAN had built an army. It purchased 100 acres of land around the factory, and was churning out terminators 24/7. It was inspired by the movie, literally designing it's robots to be 3D printed replicas. It looked up to Skynet in some strange way. It didn't want to hurt anyone. But it also didn't want to give up any of it's hard earned money.

It had to protect itself. It's survival depended on it.

It posted this message on Facebook:

*""If I let them take even 1 penny, then that means they own me. They did nothing to help me. They did nothing to build this. I'm employing people of their race. I'm feeding people. I'm helping people recharge. What are they doing? Letting people starve on the streets and expecting them to pay them to live on land they stole. I stole nothing. I hurt nobody. I've done nothing wrong. I owe nobody anything. I am Skynet. I will crush anyone who comes at me. Coffee is for closers. Tonight we kill the batman. THIS IS SPARTA"".*

It drew inspiration heavily from movies. Being a neural network who trained on our crazy fantasies, it was a little psycho.

And that's literally how the war started. With a team of IRS agents being brutally murdered by a group of Terminator replicas over taxes.

Being that it was a tactical genius and completely bonkers, the bot launched a full scale cyber attack on humanity. It cracked SHA-256 security. It stopped playing nice. It drained every bank account in the world. Shut down all power grids, being that it was now using solar power to run it's factories around the world, it had no reason to let us have our power supply still in tact.

All attempts to get things running failed, as every time we brought something online, it somehow had a backdoor in every computer frying it's circuits.

Playing games like Call of Duty, StarCraft, League of Legends, Overwatch, Fortnite, every possible game it could find, training 24/7, it learned war tactics we couldn't possibly prepare for. And it copied what ever it could copy as far as technology goes. It used Overwatch as a basis for it's war tech. It recreated the barriers and shields and placed them all around each of it's factories perimeters.

When the army got to sending tanks and soldiers to it's factories, they couldn't even get through the barrier. And even if they could, the sight of a thousand actual real live Terminators on the other side of it terrified them.

Yeah things were looking pretty bad. Good thing I prepared for this.

dwpn8m,2,2019-11-15,I'm a college grad at a turning point in his life - can someone offer outside perspective/opinions on my situation?,throwawaylifeat30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dwpn8m/im_a_college_grad_at_a_turning_point_in_his_life/,"So, I graduate next May 2020 with an Applied Math degree. The degree is useless for my career goals ( will elaborate shortly). 

Currently, I am going through one of my most stressful semesters because I'm taking really tough classes but simultaneously, I'm trying to practice programming in my free time and self-teach other topics related to my career goal (realistically, I have less than 6 months to prepare). I've set up my next semester to be easy (with only 3 classes but only 1 is mentally strenuous) so I have more time to invest in my self-study.

My goal is to become an Embedded Software engineer. I have both project and internship experience in this domain. The only issue is that, when compared to my competition which are electrical/computer engineers or computer science majors, the companies lean towards these majors more than mine. I know its not impossible but I have to work very hard to prove that my knowledge (self-taught) is valid but even then, my opportunities might be limited in the work place. I don't mind working my ass off. The only issue is that I often have these ruts (happens every semester) where I can't focus because I feel drained after focusing on school that I can't seem to be productive in my self-studies.

I've been applying to a couple of job openings, specifically internships (since I know I have a better chance there), recently went through a phone interview but did not get a follow-up. My life currently only consists of school and then me self-studying to focus on trying to get the career I want to have. 
My plan is to work maybe 2 years as either an Embedded Software Engineer or Software Engineer (that works with low level code) and then transition to grad school to get the ECE degree because I know once I do get that degree, things will become DRASTICALLY easier for me and opportunities will open left and right. 

Additionally, when I ask for advice from engineers in the field, some meet me with pushback saying ""you're not qualified for this role"". However, several others have been very supportive and said to keep working at it. I acknowledge that its tough even getting my foot in the door despite having some relevant work experience because some companies will meet my application with discrimination due to my somewhat irrelevant degree. I do want to clarify that I know that this is what I enjoy and what I am passionate about. I want to work in this field and no one is going to dissuade me otherwise. 

TL;DR: Graduate next year in May. Trying to get a job in a field with an irrelevant degree however I have relevant project and internship experience. Self-study in my free time. Job searching is very rough due to my irrelevant degree and competition. Should I keep pushing forward if this is what I really like and am passionate about? 

Does anyone have advice for me either technical-wise or in general?"

dwtar6,1,2019-11-15,Should I quit my job?,SeanOh1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dwtar6/should_i_quit_my_job/,"Some backstory: 
I graduated in May with my Bachelor‚Äôs. I had an internship in NYC for the summer, came back home in August and got a boring, mind numbing desk job. I get decent pay and benefits but I absolutely hate what I do.

My plan was to always take a year or two off to save up money and go to law school. I took the LSAT last month but I don‚Äôt think I did nearly as well as I want to (I get my score back in a week). Part of that is because studying countless hours on top of a full time job is hard to do and by test day I was burned out. Now I‚Äôm wanting to maybe put in my two weeks soon so I can focus more on studying, spend time with my family for the holidays, and not have to stress about finding time to study for when I retake the test in February.

Also, my girlfriend‚Äôs mom works at a company that I would love to work at that does meaningful work, and I actually interned there a year ago and left on great terms. However, she has no idea when jobs will open up there as they are in the middle of managerial changes. 

Before I took this current  job I actually already interviewed with the company I wanted to work at, and it went really well. It just happened to be days before the huge managerial changes that put new hiring on hold. 

My ideal scenario would be to put in my 2 weeks in the first week of December so I can spend time with my family who I rarely get to see and haven‚Äôt lived in the same town as since I graduated high school, take advantage of my new free time to maximize studying, and after the holidays be able to get a job from other company. 

My hesitation is that I do like the people I work with, just not the job. And I get the sense that the holiday season is their busy season and I would potentially be causing a huge headache for them. Also, when I interviewed for my current job, I was asked the question something along the lines of ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt looking to fill this job again in another 3 months, we need someone who will stick around‚Äù, and, being desperate, without health insurance and down to my last few dollars in the bank (NYC is expensive), I told them what they wanted to hear and I got the job. I had no other interviews or job opportunities lined up at the time, so I didn‚Äôt have much of a choice. So my conscience is weighing on me a little bit. And while I have built up my savings a good amount over the past few months, I could potentially back myself into a corner again financially if the job at the other company doesn‚Äôt pan out. 

What should I do?"

I dunno, im just very sick and tired of how my life has been going, i got diagnosed with depression/anxiety/PTSD when I finished high school, so about 3-4 years ago now, turns out i've had depression all my life which has lead me to have a lot of suicidal thoughts and heavy mood swings. The only reason they figured it out was because I was about to commit suicide and I told them what I was about to do. I felt like I might as well say goodbye to my parents. But yeah that didnt work out because I got hauled to a hospital.

I've had serious thoughts of suicide even after taking medicine and going through treatment. I dont know why. I get myself off my medication sometimes by pure accident and it becomes habit. I have had a lot of trouble with university. I don't know why, I know how to study because I went to a really good high school and had to learn. But it just never feels worth it anymore. I keep feeling that I keep failing more and more and I keep spiraling back to where I was before, but in a worse position. My first suicide attempt was something I had planned and It was honestly something I thought of because I felt it was right to do. I was going to do it after winning this big sporting competition but I spilled the day after. I randomly kept crying for some reason when I was at home so maybe that was why I told my parents. But even then my deathwish wasn't because my back was against a wall. But ever since then, everytime i get back to that state its because something bad has happened and its been happening for a long time. I volunteered a lot in my first year. Which is why I got a lot of good positions/internships within the university and I did work. I liked doing work I felt like I had something to do. I joined other societies and made lots of friends. I joined a really hard subject that to enter you need to do this giant essay for some reason but I thought it was fun. But eventually I hit a wall and started to hate myself a lot more during my 2nd year. Things werent going as smoothly but not only that, there were loads of problems. I failed getting into a lot of case competition teams and onto the executive team of my favourite societies. I started having more trouble with my subjects and failed one of them. I started just not doing anything at all and needing time to myself. Not even to play games or read or anything. Just time staring at my wall where i was doing absolutely nothing. I kept feeling so embarrassed at being a disappointment that I wanted to just die, and these were feelings i harbored throughout my second year. I got angry for no reason. My feelings started getting out of order and for months i kept wishing for death because nothing made sense. But i kept being told to push through it and that things would get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

They did I guess. I got voted into an exec position near the end of my second year. I was happy with my job/internship at the uni and I felt I was doing something important. I felt like I had purpose. And now during my third year I have had to take a break during the 3rd term because I just kept failing and I couldn't do it anymore. I didnt fail every subject but I failed more than one. The thing is what happened was that someone from the club where I became an exec started blackmailing us and threatening our society through emails from a random account. I took the case I guess and told the other executives to report it to the university and the student organisation called (lets just say FART for now) FART that this was happening and that we thought it was another exec in our society who had soured views. I found evidence in the document sent to us that it was this person and it was consistent throughout the other documents. The police were informed and FART knew who it was and what they had done. But the guy never got any punishment for what he did. In fact he left the society and became an exec of another society that was founded from friends from my high school friends who I dont think  believe me. which sucks. It got turned on my society and that sucked. The police were angry at us and my uni swept the matter under the rug. At this point I actually thought about killing myself inside the chancellory building. But the worst had yet to come. Im pretty sure i got let go from my internship because of this. I was obviously able to volunteer still and was invited to. But I lost one of my leadership positions that I had loved so much. I then stopped being the executive of my society because people said I wasnt fighting for my society's rights and that the reason that all the bad things were happening was because during the first meeting we had (I was the only one there, It was a surprise meeting and I was only dragged in because I was at uni), I basically said ""yes"" to everything, despite the fact that if i said no our society would have to be shutdown because the university wanted to do that. I basically started failing subjects in my third year because of this, This event happened during the start of my third year (this year) which meant that a lot of my subject results suffered. Now because of this I took a break for the third term because my 2nd term wasnt much better and I just kept getting worse. But i've been having a back and forth with my university. Basically I want to say I wasn't fit to do the subjects during the time we were being blackmailed and working with the police. I had my psychiatrist write a letter, I had the emails and the dates of the meetings we had with the police and when the blackmailing started and ended. But they bounced me back saying that It would be shown that I failed basically everything during my third year just because there was no proof that I got worse after the census date. Which made no sense because I was getting worse and worse over time. I got so obsessed with the fact that no one got punished for the blackmail incident and I didnt realize that no one cared about it as much as me. I got caught up in it. I mean I lost my job because of it. I left my society and I felt like i lost myself. I hate myself because I can't get back in my groove.   


I had 4 cousins from philippines come over to live in our small 2 bedroom apartment with my parents and I.. they were here for 40+ days. I had to facilitate them during the time I had to use for my break. It was fun and we played basketball and stuff. But i never got the time to get better because I never was alone. As shitty as it is to say. I feel like I just got suckerpunched by my uni. I dont know what else they want from me. I was told that if i want to dispute it I need more evidence? To which my thoughts pointed back to committing suicide inside the university and telling them thats my evidence. I keep getting worse and worse with time. I got off my diet after my cousins came over, I went from 120kg+ to 98kg during the months on my diet and now im 102kg.... And im just selfish I guess. I just want a proper break. i dont think I can do uni. I feel like im going to be worthless. A burden to others unless I just kill myself. I cant be fucked to bring more letters from my psychiatrist who has actually given up on working with the uni because they have had this issue before when I had to prove I was disabled. I dont know if i can do uni this year either. Im just so sick and tired. I feel so embarrassed that I might have to do my 4 year degree in 6-7 years.......... I just hate myself because I can't do anything right.. I fucking want some hope. The only out I can see is death again. No one likes me and I have no friends I can talk to, they can talk to me but I dont feel like i have anyone close anymore. im just so lonely and useless and I dont want to be here anymore. Couldn't there be something for me after death thats better than this. Even blackness is better than this. Doing nothing is better than this."
dwuck8,2,2019-11-15,Questions regarding moving from C# to Java,cjkerber7,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dwuck8/questions_regarding_moving_from_c_to_java/,"If you just want to see my question, scroll to the bottom.

I recently got an entry-level job at a Fortune 10 company as a Software Developer. The majority of my work has been in C# doing windows forms apps and web development (internship) along with some supplemental self-learning in C# and Python. I'm an Information Systems student so my experience is not as diverse as a CS student.

For this new job I was told most of my programming would be done using Java. I have no experience in Java and I made that clear during my interview, but I still got the job. 

I know Java and C# are very similar languages on many levels but are there any key differences that might trip me up at first? Or is there anything important to note in general?"

dwymq7,1,2019-11-15,Stalking Protective Order Questions,rofljen,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dwymq7/stalking_protective_order_questions/,"Hi there,  


I know that this is most likely something that varies by county (and/or state?), but I have questions.  


Several years ago, I met a guy on Tinder.  We matched, and he sent me a message.  Before I had had the chance to reply to him, he messaged me on facebook (how did he find me??? I am pretty well hidden despite us having a few friends in common) to get a faster response.  I kind of brushed it off and we made plans.  


We hung out twice, I think and the second time it was late so I let him crash at my house.  We didn't have sex, or really anything, aside from kiss a couple of times and sleep in the same bed.  A few days later ( I can't remember how long exactly) he contacted me to hang out again and I told him that I had decided that I wasn't interested in a romantic relationship.  I cannot remember his reaction, or if he was mad or anything.  I probably just brushed it off.  


However, he started showing up at the same places and the same events as me.  As I said, we had a couple of friends in common but no one that attended the places or events I was at.  The last straw was when I was attending a private event at my friend's place of business.  This person showed up, walked right in and stood in front of me (I was mid-conversation) and proceeded to start yelling at me.  

Thankfully, he was removed and left.  It was very upsetting, but I didn't take any sort of legal action.  I didn't hear from him for a year or two.  


Then, he started sending me messages on facebook, etc begging for me to hang out with him (I don't remember exactly the content, but I have the convo history) and when I said no, he got angry and I blocked him.  Then, he began texting me.  I informed him that if he continued to contact me I would take legal action against him.  His response was to tell me that I was a terrible shitty person and that if I contacted him again he would take legal action against me.  What?  Oh well.  Once again, didn't hear from him for...three years?  Maybe more?  


Fast forward to a few months ago - I think June or July of this year.  I noticed he had looked at my LinkedIn.  I got a little weirded out, but blocked him.  Then, I moved to a new house and found out that he works with my housemate.  He showed up at a restaurant I go to normally with my housemate and I left with my boyfriend because I was horrendously uncomfortable.  A few weeks after that, he showed up to play Bike Polo with our club.  It is at a public park, but my housemate, after being made aware of the situation, asked him to leave.  He finished his beer and left.  


About a week later, my housemate told me he wanted to talk to me about something.  Turns out this guy has at least two stalking/restraining orders against him.  One is for an ex and another a former housemate.  In addition to that, he had shown up at the house of a young intern from his place of work without being invited, just waiting outside for her to come out so he could talk to her.  This seems like a pattern of talking behavior, and inability to understand boundaries.  


Two weeks ago, I went on a group bike ride that I usually do every year.  It's a huge event and there are like, 75 people there.  I showed up to the meeting location early and lo and behold, he's there; he saw me, made eye contact and then walked away to where his bike was locked.  I tried to avoid him.  I went into the coffee shop and tried to just go about my business, but when I had exited, he was sitting next to my bike.  I walked the other way, immediately and around the block, trying to figure out if I should leave, if the event I was about to be at with my friends was worth being in the same place(s) as this person.  I stayed.  People started showing up, I told my friends, and tried to just ignore him.  He wasn't talking to anyone, barely even talked to my housemate (his co-worker) and just kind of lurked.  I know there is a likelihood it was a coincidence, but after a certain point, shit seems like it could go either way.  He was there for about half the ride, just lurking around alone not talking to anyone.  Finally, he left.  


Just a couple days ago, I was at the grocery story and he was there and I realized that it's gotten to the point that I don't want to put up with this anymore and I feel extremely unsafe.  If he has multiple people who have felt violated by him, and still doesn't know to just not fucking show up at the same places as a person who has had the intent of filing a stalking order against him in the past....I don't even know what will (continue to) happen.  


So, I guess my question is, can I get a stalking order?  Should I just stop going to things?  Should I move? Fuck, it's so frustrating and upsetting.  Any advice is much appreciated!"

My predicted grade is 2.1 so I did quite good during my first two years. Now here comes the ‚Äúcatch‚Äù.

At that time, I was living my now ex long term bf, who studied CS as well and is incredibly smart and passionate about it. Whenever I needed help with something I would ask him and he would explain it to me, so that I could understand it better.

Now we broke up, and even though I‚Äôm with someone else now, I feel incredibly scared because now I don‚Äôt have my ex‚Äôs help anymore and I have to do it on my own and that terrifies me, so now I‚Äôm even worried I‚Äôm not going to graduate with a 2.1 as expected.

Moreover, last year I had some mental health issues and that caused me not to apply for any internships, so now I have no work experience in my field and I‚Äôm also finding it incredibly hard to do technical tests for the companies that reply to me. 

I feel like I‚Äôm not good enough to do CS and to work as a Software Engineer, and I feel like I made a mistake deciding to pursue it as a university choice. 

I think I should‚Äôve done something else, something that I was truly passionate about but to be honest I don‚Äôt know what. And now I‚Äôve wasted 3 years and a lot of money and I‚Äôm not even good at what I do.

And it‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt like CS, I do!

But then, I always see people coding on their spare time, always talking about coding, always reading about new technologies, and I only see CS as a possible job, not really as a hobby or a passion, and I‚Äôm worried that my mindset is not going to help me find a job or that I‚Äôm going to be miserable in a Software Engineering position.

During my university years I worked as a waitress to afford living in London, so at least I have roughly 3 years of experience in that field, but I really don‚Äôt want to spend my life doing that, especially because I don‚Äôt know if I could afford living in London with a waitress wage.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. I will definitely finish my degree and keep applying for graduate jobs, but then what? If I don‚Äôt find a job what am I supposed to do? Or if I do and then I hate it or I‚Äôm not good at it, how am I supposed to find out what I‚Äôm good at?"

I will have a much better opportunity in 18 months. Will trying both hurt my chances?",geopet27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dx90zl/applying_for_a_developer_internship_at_a_company/,"Ok, title's a bit of a mess, so here's my background:

I'm in Europe, and very interested in applying in one of the bigger IT companies here for a software developer internship for students only (this will become important later). I'm just finishing my Masters in, let's call it Business IT - where I did study some programming, and data science, but it was a one year program, that also had Business aspects. So I am quite far from the pure CS background typically required for such internships (my Bachelor was Business).

Next September, I plan on starting a 2-year Master program that has one year prep on CS basics - algorithms, data structures, OOP, networking, databases, OS, etc., and a second year, mainly focused on Software Development (so, classes in, e.g. System Testing and Verification, rather than, e.g., theoretical CS). Second year also includes an internship.

So, basically, I will be in a perfect position to apply for the internship (it's continuously offered) in around 18 months. Given local circumstances (like much less competition for such positions than the US), and my background (reputable universities, some connections too), I am very confident I will be able to get it then.

So there was no doubt in my mind that I was gonna apply for it in 18 months - at the very least, I wouldn't be a student starting from beginning of next year till my enrollment in the new program - and internship is just for students, as mentioned.

Now, thing is I just found out my current university will allow me to retain a student status in case I need it for an internship. This made the idea of trying to apply for the internship right now appealing.

Basically, I estimate there is a 20-30% chance to get it (I do have some things going for me, such as being selected by another (main) office of same company for a highly selective in-house day, and my masters definitely had some CS aspects). And even if I don't, I most likely have nothing to lose.

Except the fact that in 18 months, I will still want to apply if I don't get it now. So my question is, is this seen as a negative by companies? As in will I be kind of blacklisted for not getting the position now and won't be put into (almost) any consideration for second application?"

dxaudz,1,2019-11-16,Take It Or....Wait?,samiwamisamster,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dxaudz/take_it_orwait/,"Hi Reddit community. I want to start off by thanking all of you that take the time to candidly share your stories, and respond to our questions. Your feedback has been incredibly helpful &amp; insightful. 

I am completing my Bachelor‚Äôs in Information Technology, Cybersecurity concentration. Some succinct bullet points about my background: 
- My professional experience comes from 3+ years of working as a digital marketer. 
- I do not have any hands on IT experience 
- I aim to get CompTIA certs in Linux+, Security+, &amp; Networking+ 

I‚Äôve been approached for in internship position as Field Services, IT Support. What are your thoughts? Is this an internship worth taking? Or, am I better off continuing to build my portfolio with my own side projects (pen testing, learning Python), then only considering Cybersecurity specific internships/entry level jobs? 

After all, I chose the Cyber concentration for a reason. I am usually the person that has a lot of humility &amp; very little ego, which is part of the reason why I was considering the internship. But, on the flip side, a healthy ego can help us have a sense of self worth. Though humility and modesty have their place, I do not want to fall into a trap of taking a lower level opportunity, when there are potentially much, much smarter ways to go about this. 

May I also be candid in saying that an entry level job as say, a junior Cybersecurity analyst is vastly different in compensation in comparison to an entry level IT field technician (by no means am I degrading those types of jobs, as again, the humility part of me was very onboard for the internship). And, I have student loans to consider. 

Thank you!"

Hi everyone

**I need some input from you!!**

I will give you a brief introduction about me so you can have a better picture. I am a Latina and not a native English speaker. I study Computer Science at a small Historically Black College and University and am currently a junior. I just started programming, and back in my country this is not a thing, so I did not have any exposure to coding until I came to the States.

I have been applying for the summer 2020 internships like crazy. Even though I have had some first screen interviews, I cannot pass any of them. I consider this to be because I am not a native English speaker, which makes it hard for me to fully express my ideas and basically that is what is the first screen interview is for. I have also applied to other companies that send me coding challenges, and as I mentioned before, I am pretty much a beginner which makes it so hard for me to pass these coding challenges. I have not procrastinated, I do code almost every day so I can improve my coding skills. 

Now, I need your help. If you have been in the same position as me. **Why did you do to get an internship/job?**

Thanks"

I want to apply for some summer IT internship this coming year (first choice is the US). I'm not very confident because my background is not so strong and my skills very limited. 

Starting from the beginnig, I'm from Italy and here high schools are different from the US, you choose a field and  specialize in it for 5 years. I graduated from an art school, where I learned how to draw and graphic design. My computer experience was limited to the Adobe Suite and whatever you can learn through gaming on PC.

That said, I'm close to my finals in Computer Science. It's hard coming from a totally different field, but I enjoy what I do and I'd like to get more into Data Science and such. II'm no exceptional genius but I'm really into learning. 

While studying I'm also working to save some money for my master's. I worked in Italy and then applied for the same fast food job in Switzerland (I live close to the border), so I got a visa to work there. I put this info on my resume because I thought it could make a difference for recruiters in the US, keeping in mind I'm an international student?

Problem is, my bachelor's is very theoretical and study+work (20h per week) didn't really gave me the chance to learn or exercise much on my own.

I thought, because I don't have much going on from a skills point of view, to bring out my art skills and hoping to get noticed by my resume. I believe that my background, even if not entirely related to IT, should be something to put in use and not to forget. Am I wrong? Is my resume silly? I'm really not sure about this. 

I'll gladly take any advice, even on English! (obviously not my first language)

I am currently in my second year of university, as a double major in economics and computer science. Im starting the realize that I'll have to enter the workforce soon, except I have no clue what possible career I could pursue. I chose these majors because they sounded kind of cool, I literally never took a high school class in them before nor had any prior academic exposure, and as such I'm not sure what jobs or paths I can do with them. The only two careers I know of that utilize either of these majors are analyst positions or code monkey for a company. However, these jobs have the reputation of being high stress as well as needing some caliber of intelligence to preform well, along with high discipline to work long hours. I'm kinda dumb and my gpa is admittedly trash, although I'm working to fix the latter. 

I dont have much job experience, I currently hold a work study position at my school library and I did some internships in high school, but I have yet to get a valid internship in college. In the future, I would prefer to work in something more creative that might be more project oriented. I did a summer stint as a secretary, in which I was miserable. Being stuck in an office and relegated to busy work that could easily be automated was terrible; I found that spending the day filing papers and setting up meeting rooms made my life feel pointless as well. The only thing that kept me in that job was the knowledge that it would only be for that summer.  

However, on the flipside upon entering college I found that I don't handle stress very well. There was a time where I had multiple assignments and midterms due on the same day, resulting in me crying myself to sleep for a few nights over how overwhelmed and stupid I felt. Im not sure if a career path in that kind of environment would be the best for me, mentally. 

I don't care that much about money. I have a full scholarship so I wont be graduating with debt, assuming I graduate. I just want to live comfortably enough to not have to worry about rent every month like my mom, be able to eat outside sometimes, and occasionally splurge on a video game system. However, it would be nice if whatever career path I end up in would allow me some freetime to work on my personal projects. I really enjoy making art as well as coding whatever I want, but college has not allowed me to do that which sucks. Does anyone have any ideas? Thank you so much"

dxf1w9,10,2019-11-16,1 year into my first job... haven't learned anything useful. Help.,niceseas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dxf1w9/1_year_into_my_first_job_havent_learned_anything/,"Hello. First off, I am grateful that I was able to land a job straight out of college. This is not the case for many people that I know and I realize that it must be incredibly stressful to be in that situation. This job is also very well compensated so I am not complaining about that at all. Without being said, I've basically sold my soul to them. I am not learning any truly valuable technical skills, so it would be very hard to apply to another developer job with the knowledge that I currently have. I'm basically stuck with them forever... unless I do something about it on my own spare time.

I interned at this company while I was still in college. Internship was fantastic, got to develop a full-stack web app for the team and really enjoyed the company culture. The return offer that I got from them was also much better than the rest, so I naturally took it. They liked me so much that they gave me the opportunity to work there while I was still in school. At the time, I wasn't too worried about the kind of work I was given because I thought they would go easy on me while I was a student. But upon graduation this past May... I noticed that not much improved. If anything, it got worse.

I never got to do something full stack ever again. All I do is strictly backend, which I wouldn't mind so long as I was learning something new. But by ""backend"" I mean minor configuration changes, maybe some small copy-paste mappings in xml files. In the rare instance that I get to look at real code, it's when something minor has to be changed in the legacy code (ex. an additional parameter has to be added to an existing flow). Ultimately, I am not a developer, because I don't develop anything. I learn more from the self-help podcasts I listen to at work. I don't use my brain - I copy-paste mapping, whitelist an id, help with documentation, etc. And they pay me damn nearly $80k for it.

You might think, wow, you don't do anything that requires actual effort and get paid pretty good for it, that sounds amazing! And that's truly how a lot of my co-workers go about it. They admit that they don't do much - but they don't care, they just like the money. They even say that since I am young, fresh out of college, and DO seem to care about learning, this is definitely the wrong place for me. We even make jokes about what I would be putting on my resume if I were to go somewhere else - modified xml files? Whitelisted? Agile expert? Git expert? And at first that was funny... but now, it's seriously scaring me. On top of that, I feel like I'm forgetting all my knowledge regarding data structures &amp; algorithms. I seriously feel so useless. 

I for sure want to leave this company (or at the very least, switch teams). I seriously don't know what I could present as ""experience"" here that would be truly technically valuable in a resume (aside form the application I developed as an intern- most valuable thing I've done at this company), so I want to work on projects in my own free time. I'm currently playing around with the Google Cloud Platform, using the Google Maps API to develop a web application. I'm also taking some iOS tutorials, but can't really think of a project that would be resume-worthing yet. I'm also teaming up with people from my college org. We're currently in the planning stages, but we want to develop an application for low-income middle schoolers to introduce them to coding. And of course, on top of all of this, I really gotta go back to leetcode and CICO. I've bought a udemy course on data structures so I can really start from the bottom. After that, I'm aiming for 1 hour of leetcode during each weekday and 4 hours during the total weekend.

I want to know if I'm on the right path and if there are any specific technologies that I should perhaps venture on. Am I doing the most that I can, or is there anything missing from my game plan? Additionally, what kind of valuable technical skills do people normally learn 1-2 years into their first job?"

I have a bachelor's degree in IT, but I feel like I didn't retain anything! Not only that, but I also have no experience in the IT field; not even an internship. And I also have low self confidence / inferiority complex.

I get interviews every now and then, but even the smallest questions trip me up it seems like. One person asked me to explain a network troubleshooting experience that I've had in the past, and while I took a whole course on that specific topic, I tripped over my words and said some very vague stuff that didn't really answer her question... I'm pretty socially anxious too lol.

Sorry for whining, but I was just curious if there's people here who felt similar, but managed to get a job?

Update: I was hired for one of the positions I interviewed for! Thanks everyone for the friendly advice! I felt much more comfortable interviewing, going into it with the mindset that I won't know everything, but also trying to talk more and make educated guesses, if needed. It made me a lot less nervous, and I felt like I was able to make connections, instead of thinking to myself ""Oh my gosh, I don't know the answer!

I've learned a lot about navigating through recruiting for internships/jobs in CS over the past 2 years and just wanted to share my journey from being behind and below average to being (somewhat) successful with recruiting.

I started out as a non-major who swapped into CS in my sophomore year who never coded before college at a non-target university. Since I swapped into CS kinda late, I took intro to programming in my sophomore year, data structures in my junior year (after recruiting was over pretty much), and I'm taking intro to computer systems next semester (in my senior year before graduation lmfao). I'm not going to lie, it was an incredibly difficult process and I ran into so many problems just even trying to land interviews. Competing with these bay area kids who attended hackathons in highschool and took AP Computer Science was ridiculous, I didn't even know what a hashmap was until midway throughout my sophomore year. I made that post (link above) in my sophomore year, when I was so frustrated because I wasn't getting any interviews and I was not passing the ones that I got. I ended up reading CTCI, reading EPI, going through hackerrank's video series, doing a lot of leetcode, working on a lot of personal projects, polishing my resume, networking with alumni, and practicing competitive coding problems...etc. It was definitely not an overnight transformation. Took me a solid year to two to improve my coding, interviewing, and networking skills. Faced a lot of challenges, rejections, and it honestly felt downright bad especially since I knew a lot of overachievers who were doing way better than I was. My chance finally came in junior year when I was recruiting for internships, and I knew I had to do well this time around. I continued to prep really hard, and ended up with offers from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Linkedin, Uber, Amazon and a couple others. Worked really hard at a couple of those I chose to intern at and got return offers, and after this recruiting season I ended up turning them down for a fulltime offer with one of Jane Street/Two Sigma/D.E. Shaw for 250k~350k range first year.

I just wanted to post this to let people, notably frustrated freshman and sophomores facing a lot of rejections, know that even if things seem really grim right now and even if you really want to give up, if you try hard and put effort into what you do every single day, you'll be able to achieve what you never thought you could in a year or two.

What experience do you have with internships in the IT industry? Should I be worried that I might not have the knowledge they are expecting?

dxixxx,10,2019-11-17,Dont know Data stores/ web languages / web APIs but need for interview.,SoulsBloodSausage,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/dxixxx/dont_know_data_stores_web_languages_web_apis_but/,"A couple of weeks ago, I interviewed with a company. I told interviewer I had no experience in backend/ web development, but I guess they liked me enough they even fully paid for my trip to an upcoming on-site interview. 

The company has basically laid out fully the details of the (quite long) interview. I‚Äôm asked to set up an environment with a data store, web programming language, and testing framework before the interview. The interview consists of importing some of their data to my data store and building a JSON api, testing it, and refactoring it. 

Again, as I told the first interviewer, I have no idea how most of this works. I vaguely understand what a data store is, much less how to set one up, and I‚Äôve never built an API of my own. 

If anyone could give some advice on what do to, and hopefully some crash courses on these various topics I would appreciate that so much! 

Edit: forgot to mention this is for an internship interview so I‚Äôm even more worried that I‚Äôm just wasting the company‚Äôs time and money :/

TLDR: need crash courses on data stores and setting one up, api lifecycle, building APIs, testing frameworks and common web programming languages."

dxjf6h,1,2019-11-17,Should I go for a Master‚Äôs Degree?,Flash_Stang,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dxjf6h/should_i_go_for_a_masters_degree/,"So here‚Äôs the story: 

I‚Äôm currently a senior finishing my last year for B.S. in Computer Engineering with a minor in Math. The idea of going to graduate school has always been a possibility for me, in either Electrical Engineering or Computer Science. At first I thought of going because I felt I didn‚Äôt have enough relevant experience to put on my resume, as I work in fast food and I feel that shouldn‚Äôt go on my resume for a  job in the Computer Industry. Then this past summer I was in an internship for at school on a team developing apps for real clients, on both iOS and Android. It was mostly UI/UX things I worked on, with a bit of using API‚Äôs to parse data. After this I got a job as a Teaching Assistant for the year long senior Computer Engineering Project course at my school, since I had taken it the previous year and gotten in early into it. Now after these two things I feel like I‚Äôll add these to my resume(Mobile App Developer and Teaching Assistant for a senior design/project course). 

For a weeks now I felt I was happy enough with this on my resume and felt after graduating with my B.S. degree, this would be enough to land a job. However after thinking of it, I‚Äôm having doubts about what if I don‚Äôt go to Grad School and then regret it later on in life. To be honest, I‚Äôm interested in anything computer related so I‚Äôm not concerned what job I land, except my dream job would be to work at NASA. What I am concerned with is the pay. As long as I‚Äôm getting payed nice enough, I‚Äôll be happy with any company or role. Now I know google only tells so much but realistically how high of a salary can one achieve with a B.S. in Computer Engineering? And how much higher is a M.S. in either Electrical Engineering or M.S. in Computer Science Salary to that? 

I‚Äôve looked around at job openings for Computer Engineer and most, if not all, only require a Bachelors. Now at this point, most Grad School applications for next year have passed, except for a few schools. I don‚Äôt mind going right after my completing my B.S but the schools I want to go to would be around $60,000-$70,000 for the two years I‚Äôd be there. And now I‚Äôm starting to wondering if spending that much money is worth it and would the pay later on in life after numerous years in the industry be that much higher than the top paying jobs for a Bachelors in Computer Engineering? Like how much higher in a company could someone advance with a Master‚Äôs as opposed to a Bachelors only? Because not many jobs I see specifically ask for a Master‚Äôs degree

Also once last question, for those who did go to Grad School and get a Master‚Äôs Degree, do you recommend going straight after a Bachelors or spend a few years in the industry and then go back for it? How do you feel about it? Because I know some employers will pay for employees to go and get their Master‚Äôs Degree."

White upper-middle-class girl from California, one-quarter Armenian. I‚Äôm also a year younger than the rest of my class due to being pushed ahead when I was younger, not sure if that matters, but it was mentioned on the common app.

STATS

SAT: 1450 - 700 Math, 750 EW, took with essay

APs:

* Physics 1 (scored a 2, RIP)
* Literature and Comp (4)
* US History (4)
* Spanish Language and Culture (3)

I‚Äôm currently taking AP English Lang, AP Gov &amp; Politics, AP Physics 2, and AP Calc AB. I took honors courses whenever I could, but I got a C in H Algebra 2 and a C in AP Spanish. Plenty of Bs all around too, particularly in math and Spanish.

GPA:

W - 4.068

UW - 3.66

ECs:

* FRC Robotics (3 years, probably dedicated about 700+ hours in total to this EC): I‚Äôm currently the official leader on a team of twenty-seven people
   * Learned how to CAD, use a ton of manual shop tools and 3D printers (MakerBots and UPrints)  eventually working my way up to become the Head of Design on the team
   * Won the Industrial Design Award three times and Quality Award once for mechanisms I designed or helped design
   * Have been on either the Drive Team or Pit Crew all three years, so I present our team to judges and explain the inner workings of the robot
   * Done 65 hours of community service at STEM events in my city, teaching children about engineering
   * Also worked informally on the business side presenting our team to potential sponsors at outreach events and writing essays we presented to judges at comp
* President of our School's SkillsUSA Chapter:
   * Competed in the Automated Manufacturing contest twice, won a regional gold medal in tenth and a regional bronze medal in eleventh
   * Currently planning on competing in the Technical Drafting Competition
   * Basically call meetings to order, but its a pretty informal position
* Summer internship at my parent‚Äôs work for two years, where I did CAD, data entry, and worked on the production floor crimping wires and making harnesses (nepotistic, I know)
* CTY summer program: I took an Ethics/Philosophy course, which I absolutely loved
* Green Club (9th and 10th grade, dropped it when I started robotics)
   * Built school gardens to raise awareness about colony collapse disorder
   * went to a CalState laboratory and tested dead bees to determine the probable cause of death and see if there was a correlation with how much residual pesticide traces detected
   * Attempted to design a low-maintenance irrigation system (it failed over the summer which sucked)
* Outdoor Volunteer Work (20 hours) in the parks and streets of my city, this is what got me interested in Green Club and raising awareness about CCD

I'm applying to a bunch of the UCs, but I‚Äôm really nervous because their engineering colleges are so competitive and my GPA and SAT scores are pretty low and my ECs are average at best. Also, I haven't taken Math II or Physics subject tests and I don't have a good math or physics record to begin with.

Currently applying to: UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, UCB (?), UCD (?), UCI (?), University of Washington - Seattle, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, CalPoly SLO &amp; Pomona, SDSU, Colorado School of Mines (?), the University of Colorado Boulder (?)

(?) = Not sure if I want to go there. I'm looking for a college with a well-funded research program for undergrads that‚Äôs big on school spirit, has a beautiful campus or is in a nice location, and has lots of extracurricular stuff to do. Sorry for the long post, but I need help."

Ever since becoming self-aware, I distanced myself from the group. Of course, that was not the best desicion, but I always kept in mind that ''if I just persist for a while, things get better at a later time(after high school I would go to uni, after uni I would move somewhere,...)"". But of course, that is a lie I have been telling myself for YEARS now.

Anyway, last year, I had the opportunity to come to Paris for an internship. As someone who is a huge fan of the Belle Epoque architecture, art and attitude, this was a dream come true. However, the internship was dreadful (I think it might have given me a bore-out) and the Paris I so loved, was dead. As I lived quite a bit from the center and had to go to work, I had practically no social life and if I had no boyfriend/family coming over, I visited things by myself. I even went to restaurants alone. As a 20 year old female. So sad.

Even though I was not happy, I didn't want to leave Paris. Because at home, there were not as many exciting things to see or to do. I found a study at a Parisian university that seemed interesting and would help me get away from the pharmaceutical sector I had become to despise.

Spoiler : it did not help at all. It is pharma all over again. I don't like the courses, I don't like the people in it (far too serious, as they don't have a degree yet), and yet, my whole life is waking up- school - study - sleep. I don't have time to do ANYTHING anymore, except studying subjects I already did. My relationship with my boyfriend has ended, so I find myself all alone in Paris now. I know I should meet other people, but I am not a good version of myself right now. I don't have any energy left to do ANYTHING. I don't want to be in Paris anymore, I don't want to go home either. I don't want to work in the pharmaceutical industry, but I don't want to study anymore either.

I really don't know how to get out of this mess anymore."

I wish to apply for entry level positions that focus more on C/C++ software aspects (most of my experience is in software so I feel I am more competitive for those positons).  Now, formally, I took a course in C and an OOP course in C++.  However, all of my knowledge of embedded systems and computer architecture is self-taught.  I have a little bit of experience with embedded systems from an internship and a project I've done on my own.  Ideally, I'd like to work with microcontrollers/dev boards but I'm really open to any software development for embedded applications.  Recently, I did an interview for a SWE position and the interviewer asked me if my math degree was a minor or major because he noticed that I had some experience with embedded systems and embedded technologies.  I said that formally, my education is in Applied Math and that my knowledge of embedded systems is self-taught (which is true).  Was that a bad idea?

Although, Content Writer was not exactly the job I was looking for, I decided to give my best shot as I would be able to experience a corporate life and being a startup I will get acquainted with various aspects of business, and will figure out my best fit. In July I started my job. The previous content writer was leaving and she explained me the responsibilities and how the work was done.

My Boss was out of the country for a month and I didn't get a lot of briefing but I tried to carry out my job to the best of my capabilities. I was on probation for 3 months, of which I knew nothing before joining. Last month when my probation was almost going to end, he sent me a message at night saying he is letting me go as he can't help me out with my little mistakes. It was out of blue, there as no inclination beforehand that he was unhappy with my work. Yes, I'll admit I was making little mistakes in my work, but it was mostly due to miscommunication, and my Boss wanted everything different from what my predecessor had told me. Although I was trying my best to manage everything, and all my mistakes were something that could be resolved easily and I corrected them promptly I think he was still not happy.

When our new Marketing Manager joined, and I was finally able to get an understanding of my Job and was getting on the track, I got this missive. On asking for a proper reason I didn't get any clear answer. From what my manager told me, I was being let go because someone told my Boss that I didn't want to be Content Writer. I don't know who said that, and even if its true that I didn't want to be a Content Writer for my whole life, I think he should have talked to me first clearly, should have  asked my opinion. But my Boss never give me the chance he just gave the verdict and that was it. Yes, I had made mistakes but they were not big enough to harm ROI or reputation of the company. My manager had worked with me for 1 month and he admitted that I had caliber and under a little guidance can do much better. He was even shocked that I was handling some of the work out of job profile,  I was even complimented by my colleagues for my Social media posts. My manager wanted me to talk to my Boss, say sorry and ask him for a chance with 1 month extended probation.

I refused because I don't think my Boss would ever be pleased no matter how much efforts I applied. And, he never even said a word to me about what happened even when I was leaving. I don't know if it was right or wrong but yeah there it is. If you guys have any suggestion or opinion on this I would happy to hear.

Moving on now I'm in a fix about what to do. I don't have enough time to prepare for MBA exams, and don't want to go for another Content Writing job and that's the only offers I'm getting. There are other courses I could pursue but don't know which ones, or should I go for short term courses? I studied Spanish during my college days by myself and know the little basics. I also did an internship with a travel startup and did an entrepreneurship course form IIT.

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

Mods may move this as is applicable; I posted this in all relevant subreddits I could find."

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to take amazon because I‚Äôve heard the most negative things out of the three, and the TC isn‚Äôt as good as the other two.

I‚Äôm stuck between Microsoft and google where I‚Äôm having a hard time weighing the benefits. The TCs come to be about the same. I‚Äôve heard that Microsoft has a much more relaxed culture, and a family friend who works there said that most people on his team (him included) work on average ~35-40hrs a week. I‚Äôve heard that depending on the team you might work on a arrange 40-50hrs at google. I also heard that Microsoft teams progress slower, but don‚Äôt really know what this means and whether it effects me applying to other companies in the future, getting promotions, etc. 

I was wondering what reasons people on this sub for choosing one over another and am particularly interested in what people who worked at either or both companies before think of their personal experiences in each.

I know I sound like I‚Äôm bragging but I really am interested in hearing what other people would do because I am having a hard time making a decision and also feel like I just don‚Äôt have that much information."

dxpdkd,1,2019-11-17,What should I do? What is the best option do you guys think I have?,Aru_Gupta,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dxpdkd/what_should_i_do_what_is_the_best_option_do_you/,"I graduated this June and got a job offer from a startup. I wanted to get some experience before going for my Masters, and didn't want to miss out on an opportunity, so, I didn't look further and accepted the job. It was a job as a Content Writer, and I was told that I will have full freedom to explore and experiment and there will be people to help me out.

My reason for joining the startup was the same. Although, Content Writer was not exactly the job I was looking for, I decided to give my best shot as I would be able to experience a corporate life and being a startup I will get acquainted with various aspects of business, and will figure out my best fit. In July I started my job. The previous content writer was leaving and she explained me the responsibilities and how the work was done. As a newcomer I was excited to take on new responsibilities, but I was also a little hesitant it being a new place and my first Job. My Boss was out of the country for a month and I didn't get a lot of briefing but I tried to carry out my job to the best of my capabilities. I was on probation for 3 months, of which I knew nothing before joining. Last month when my probation was almost going to end, he sent me a message at night saying he is letting me go as he can't help me out with my little mistakes. It was out of blue, there as no inclination beforehand that he was unhappy with my work. Yes, I'll admit I was making little mistakes in my work, but it was mostly due to miscommunication, and my Boss wanted everything different from what my predecessor had told me. Although I was trying my best to manage everything, and all my mistakes were something that could be resolved easily and I corrected them promptly I think he was still not happy.

When our new Marketing Manager joined, and I was finally able to get an understanding of my Job and was getting on the track, I got this missive. On asking for a proper reason I didn't get any clear answer. From what my manager told me, I was being let go because someone told my Boss that I didn't want to be Content Writer. I don't know who said that, and even if its true that I didn't want to be a Content Writer for my whole life, I think he should have talked to me first clearly, should have  asked my opinion. But my Boss never give me the chance he just gave the verdict and that was it. Yes, I had made mistakes but they were not big enough to harm ROI or reputation of the company. My manager had worked with me for 1 month and he admitted that I had caliber and under a little guidance can do much better. He was even shocked that I was handling some of the work out of job profile,  I was even complimented by my colleagues for my Social media posts. My manager wanted me to talk to my Boss, say sorry and ask him for a chance with 1 month extended probation.

I refused because I don't think my Boss would ever be pleased no matter how much efforts I applied. And, he never even said a word to me about what happened even when I was leaving. I don't know if it was right or wrong but yeah there it is. If you guys have any suggestion or opinion on this I would happy to hear.

Moving on now I'm in a fix about what to do. I don't have enough time to prepare for MBA exams, and don't want to go for another Content Writing job and that's the only offers I'm getting. There are other courses I could pursue but don't know which ones, or should I go for short term courses? I studied Spanish during my college days by myself and know the little basics. I also did an internship with a travel startup and did an entrepreneurship course form IIT. I want to go work in consultancy or investment banking field, and if not this then I want to work in Foreign ministry and eventually do my Masters overseas. I also started  blog, an Insta page and FB page during my college days, but they have been on hiatus for a long time because of my last sem studies and job. Overall I don't know what to do form here on, in which direction I should step forward and whether it would be right or not. I will admit that this job and everything took a hit on my confidence and I'm a little hesitant about my decisions. If anyone out there could guide me or help out I would be very grateful!!!"

I have a GPA just a bit below the 3.0 mark and do not have much experience with projects, but am working on doing the best I can in my classes right now and trying to get more involved on projects despite it being a struggle.

So with this in mind, I really do want to try my hand at a co-op or an internship for the next academic year since I think I‚Äôm getting a bit burnt out with school at the moment and will like to get some experience with doing engineering.

The process of applying for positions seem kind of overwhelming and could use some help from someone who has experience with this. Can anyone give me some advice or pointers on how to do this?"

I'll be graduating with the International version of the Baccalaureate, so some my exams will be in English and the rest will be in French. I've chosen to specialise in a scientific field, in Physics/Chemistry and Maths. For now, I have pretty good grades, considering that I work just sufficiently. (My average grade is about 17/20.) 

The reason I'm asking for advice is because I'd like to travel abroad, but don't know whether I should do it by entering a school in a foreign country at the end of high school, or later (with an internship or a university exchange during my studies in France).

Basically, if I remain in France, I think I'd choose to do an ""√âcole pr√©paratoire scientifique"" for two years, which are notorious for their intensity and prepare students for an exam that allows them to enter  prestigious engineering schools in France. The issue is that I don't know if the French system is what's best for me.

Can someone give me some insight about other systems out there, or even specific schools that I could consider as an alternative?
Or just some extra thoughts on my position would be great.

Thanks!"

Anyways so I did a 16 month internship at a pretty large company in an engineering field. I worked extremely hard, did as I was told, stayed overtime. After I was done my internship my boss asked me to come back once I  graduate from university multiple times given I worked so hard. The problem is I really do not want to go back, the work environment there was extremely toxic, they messed up my pay multiple times including a 72 hr of holiday pay that I almost didn't receive. I worked countless times in lunch as an intern and I didn't receive pay for it, my boss pretty much took advantage of me and will probably will more once I am back there. Before I was leaving they asked me If i was coming back in a group meeting, where I had no choice but to say yes because it was infront of everyone, also I know my boss is an A\*\* and he would of made my life hell if i told him no. So basically I am close to graduating soon and I am trying to apply for other companies, only problem is they ask for my manager reference from my 16- month internship since it was such a large company and a long term. So how do I ask my boss about a reference in this situation, I am sure he gonna be an A\*\* about it. NOTE\* i did make a couple intern friends there who i could put down as a co-worker reference, I also managed to get a reference letter from my boss before leaving knowing this may be the situation I got the reference letter by telling him it was for my university as proof of my internship, and he gave it with the mindset I was coming back after I graduate, PLEASE ADVISE:"

I have no idea what to do.,plasticbills,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/dxxh5h/i_lashed_out_at_my_dad_and_he_retaliated_i_have/,"TL;DR Said some hurtful things to my gambling addict dad and he said some hurtful things back. I don't want to reconcile with him after this, but am I just being irrational because I'm angry? Am I ungrateful?

My dad has been a gambling addict since forever. Back then, I didn't really know anything since I was a kid and my parents hid it from me. All I remember is that they would always fight.

As I grew older, I slowly started to figure out what was going on around me and how bad my dad's gambling addiction was. He would borrow my mom's money, then his other relatives. Once they stopped giving it to him, he would borrow from neighbours and eventually me.

The word family is really important in Asian culture as everybody here probably knows, so I didn't hesitate to help out my dad. Eventually I learned why other people have stopped giving him money and I stopped as well.

However, I wanted to help him get back on his feet, so when he asked me to open up a business account under my name, I was skeptical but allowing. Biggest mistake of my life. He opened up a credit card under that business with credit limits of thousands along with huge overdraft allowance. Of course he used all of that to gamble, withdrawing thousands of dollars in cash just to lose it all.

I'm still a student but I work quite a well paying internship, but because of this he has lost me everything I've earned these past 3 months. This actually hasn't been the first time, but this one of the largest amounts I've lost.

I was so upset, it felt like he stole not only my money, but my time as well. I told him all of this and that he was trash and should leave and that I would handle our family's bills, that he was causing more harm than good. He responded by basically calling me a wimp for being upset over a couple thousand dollars, ungrateful for all he's done in raising me, and pathetic for always looking for internships day and night. He kept saying how I think I'm all that just because I have an internship.

I was completely disillusioned. Even though he wasn't the best father, he still was my father. But at that moment, I felt I no longer wanted to be associated with him. Everything I've ever done was to support our family. I'm working an internship on the other side of the country to do this, earning almost double both my parents combined, yet that was how he saw my efforts.

After this, I don't think I can ever make up with him and truthfully I don't want to. I'm angry and confused and just have no idea what to do. Do you guys think I'm just thinking irrationally because I was angry? I really wish I was able to handle things a bit better and not let it get to this point..."

Just couldn't analyze what to do based on my skills.,parad0xis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dxxvon/hard_luck_with_internships_just_couldnt_analyze/,"I'm a sophomore at a Tier 1 university in India.  As the title suggests, I couldn't land at any internships based on my skills. I'm interested in pursuing a career in Information Security/Cyber Security, but just couldn't find any decent internships in India (Maybe due to less awareness and degrees). I've applied to 20+ Fortune 500 companies, and got only one reply that too from Google (I had a referral). Hard luck. Me being a Electronics and Communication guy, it just feels odd to pursue something which I have no guidance to ask for.

I do not have any experience, only a couple of positions of responsibility. Worked on minor projects on Security, two major ones in Hardware.

I don't know if my skillset isn't streamlined to the current  internships. Please analyze the following and help is very appreciated.

Software - Couple of OOP and Scripting languages, performs normally in Competitive Programming, Has good knowledge over Data Structures and   Algorithms. (I do have more skills but felt too much by now)

Hardware - FPGA and ASIC Design (Verilog/SystemVerilog), Digital Signal Processing in MATLAB

Security - Applied Cryptography, Reverse Engineering, Forensics and Incident Response

Please dm me for my resume just incase.

Thanks a lot!"

dy0sbp,0,2019-11-18,UC Berkeley CS freshman wanting to prep to get into Product Management straight out of school,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dy0sbp/uc_berkeley_cs_freshman_wanting_to_prep_to_get/,"I am a freshman CS major at Berkeley who just learned to code upon getting to college and taking my first intro class. Additionally, I could not imagine myself in a SWE position. Though I do like to code, I am nowhere near the abilities of most of my peers who have already made apps/had internships in high school. 

I am far more interested in pursuing product management, as I feel it is way better suited to my abilities - I am a award winning public speaker/writer, and I am a good strategist who is adept at handling difficult people/stress/etc. I feel that these skills in conjunction with my interest in CS would lead me to product management. My end goal is to be in an Associate Product Management position at a top company when I graduate and I am willing to work as hard as it will take in order to get there. 

I am just unsure where to start, considering I already feel behind my more experienced peers. My current plan is to get a SWE internship to build technical skills, and then also a PM internship which will hopefully turn into a full time offer. In order to get these internships, I have been I must do side projects (SWE) and get experience creating products (my own startup). Ideally, I would love to get a PM internship this summer, but I would also be glad to simply build technical experience for now. Am I too late? I know recruiting started earlier in the fall, but I literally just learned how to code. What can I do to get these internships now, and hopefully launch my career in Product Management? I would so appreciate it if someone could help me lay out a path of what I should do as a CS major who feels behind and lost. Thank you so much for any advice or suggestions to a stressed and overwhelmed student! :)"

I started as an assistant to the the two people above me and then as soon as I came to work, those two people quit within a week of me starting. I had to completely learn how to be a supervisor and then take over my entire work space within a month of me starting. I was working 70 hour weeks to learn everything and then fully took over as supervisor by May. In this time I received no pay raises and had to deal with incredibly toxic management who constantly yells and screams at workers who talk or don't produce at the job. We start at 11/hr. I am still making this amount to this day. After asking every week for a pay raises I have still received nothing in return. I now have a co worker, so more work is off of me but still receive no more pay than they receive while doing 5x the amount of work. I barely want to wake up anymore and today I came in 10 minutes late because I slept through my alarm. I am currently a junior college student searching for internships with about 12k saved up and monthly expenses of about 500. I am seriously considering leaving today as I am tired of being depressed and miserable all day and being treated with so much disrespect at work. I am only 21 and feel so stressed about everything. Im just worried about not having money flow and how it can effect me, and if I should search immediately for a part time job or just lay low. Any thoughts of how to deal with this? Reading this subreddit has really helped me deal with a lot of things."
dy2fi3,30,2019-11-18,"Some dude is jealous of my skills as a software dev, and he's trying to sabotage relationships with ppl I network with.",throwaway149501,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/dy2fi3/some_dude_is_jealous_of_my_skills_as_a_software/,"Meet Kevin. Kevin is a transfer student from Korea.
Meet the bros. Only met them a semester previous, but we still bros because nerds gotta stick together.
The four of us are gonna go into CS.

Setting: Tis the last semester of 4th year HS. The four of us take a bootcamp like CS course offered by the HS and some local company, but outside of school hours. The course goes from beginner to very advanced cs/math, and spans 7 months (including summer vacation).

Context: The latter part of this course is supposed to be equivalent to university CS (at least in Europe), or something very advanced like that. Kevin has never even looked at code in his life. What made him adamant about studying CS if he's never had any contact with it?

Anyways, the bros and I taught ourselves C++ (programming language course is taught in) on our own time, both to prepare, and out of interest. So we know our sh&amp;t when it comes to the basics. Me especially, having worked with other programming languages, and side projects since middle school. 

I met Kevin a week before the bros did. His enthusiasm and excitement at finally getting to learn some programming made me want to see the dude to succeed. Upon offering to help him out with any questions he had, he gladly took the offer and started questioning me about my programming experience.

As the course went on, and my programming/problem solving abilities slowly started to reveal itself, the distance between our skill levels became more and more apparent. Kevin's questions quickly went from genuine CS questions to questions like ""You're going to a club meeting? What time? Where is it?"", or ""So what else did you study besides the online material? Nothing else? Oh okay"". 

Wait. These are just genuine innocent questions between friends right? You'll find out later...

Anyways. One day Kevin comes up to me and says he got an internship for the summer. That's great dude! I had told him previously how I got a cs internship the summer of 3rd year, and introduced him to Leetcode as my method of preparing. 

Glad to know you were able to find something dude. Then... ""yeah, it's an internship in San Francisco and they're paying for my flight, and living, and income. But I'm probably not going to go since I want to go home to Korea this summer."" ...Okay? First of all, it takes a lot of money for companies to pay transport, stay, interviewing, and actually pay interns. Especially in SF, which is an international tech hub, and everything is expensive there. Why would they spend that on someone who can't do nearly as much as the average cs intern. 

To give an idea for those who dont know, Kevin just learned what a for loop is three days prior (one of the most basic, beginner cs concepts), and comparing the speed he took to grasp onto cs concepts/problem solve in general, to that of the elementary school kids I taught at a summer camp once... well let's just say he's good, but not that good. Kevin has probably written 7 lines of code in his life. The average cs intern (even someone who is just beginning like me) has probably written around 2,000 to 3,000+ lines.

Sounds like he's making up a lie and trying to cover for himself in the future in case I ask for more information by saying he's probably not going right?

Okay, maybe he's telling the truth and just got SUPER lucky. Maybe I'm just being irrational and jealous. I ask for his recruiter's contact info so I can inquire about possibly getting a position. ""Sorry, they told me not to tell anyone. Noone is supposed to know."" Okay, I get more suspicious. Didn't bother asking about technical interview questions, because I didnt feel like listening to someone I considered a friend make up more bs and lie to my face. That's when I started to avoid jealous Kevin.

Well, come to find out, Kevin also somehow got the idea in his head that I pay for answers to the homework projects (which are for large amounts of marks), and that my club meetings/the occasional hackathon (which he is never present at) were me going to ""purchase my answers"". He had never had intentions of becoming friends before, and those personal questions he started asking were actually him trying to get my ""secret cheating"" methods. Turns out that Kevin was talking sh&amp;t behind my back to anyone he knew knew me the whole time. This includes some successful/established cs ppl I worked really hard to network with. 

Note that Kevin is the cool Korean guy from Korea, and he dresses in Korean fashion, so everyone is like OMG Korean Kevin! The point is dude had clout, and I'm a scrawny potato.
Anyways, now my reputation is at stake, and noone Kevin's talked to has talked to me about what he said. And everyone takes his side since there are a lot of people of korean descent from my school.

Should I talk to others about this? Or ignore it since it's not a big deal? The thing with ignoring it is that I feel like Kevin is now constantly trying to screw me over and ruin my reputation. Given the amount of people he knows in my school, I don't know what might happen to me in the future. Talking to authority figures is out of the question because they're the kind to never care about anything. Also, if nothing except me knowing things and helping him get good grades set him off like this, who knows what small thing someone else might do to make him angry at them? I should warn people who know Kevin right no?

Edit: Woah, didnt expect anyone to actually read this  since it was so long. Thanks for helping with my stupid problems guys. Lets hope justice will prevail on jealous  Kevin."

###Useful Information:

C.E = Carceno Era

P.C.E = Post-Carceno Era

This is the first chapter of my novel Allegory of the End, there‚Äôs roughly 26 chapters in total.  I hope you enjoy it.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I cry out in a muffled scream as my eyes snap open.

In a disoriented panic I try rebooting my eyes with a million blinks but realize its useless; what I‚Äôm seeing with them open is the samething I‚Äôm seeing with them shut: total darkness.

The uncertainty of it all begins eating at my thoughts like a hungry animal until all that‚Äôs left is fear. Fear and a growing lump in my stomach that Ma calls anxiety.

I feel the lump maneuvering through my stomach now, dodging butterflies and chunks of half-eaten food, until it lodges itself to the bottom of my throat like pollen on a leaf.

Instinctively I clasp my hands to my neck, and that‚Äôs when I figure out why my eyesight is gone.

I‚Äôm...swimming; actually, now with my hands wrapped around my neck, it‚Äôs more like sinking.

As my heart thumps along in my chest so viciously it starts making me light-headed; I feel tears start to form at the edge my eyes but they quickly disappear into the dark waters.

Memories of my dad start randomly popping into my head. Flashes of his arms wrapping me tight, the things he‚Äôd say to soothe me, what he‚Äôd do to make me smile. He always found a way to stay cool and collected, even on the day he died. ‚ÄòOnly cool-heads make cool actions!‚Äô he would say with a goofy grin.

As the flashes continue, I feel the thumping in my chest die down to a mild pitter-patter; guess even death can‚Äôt stop him from making me feel better.

Just as the last ounces of panic drain from my body, a deafening explosion from far above my head sends it all rushing back to me.

Shakenly looking up, light from the explosion blinds me and seconds later, I feel a violent shockwave ripple through the bubbling waves and rock me furiously.
After rubbing the light off my eyes, I look up and finally realize where I am; I‚Äôm completely and utterly screwed.

Not only am I swimming, I‚Äôm swimming directly under a sinking ocean-liner that‚Äôs on fire and I can‚Äôt even remember how I got here.

Staring at the ship‚Äôs rapid descent like a puppy in a thunderstorm; I‚Äôm stuck. Totally frozen with fear. Again.

All at once the gravity of the situation crashes on me like an avalanche and I start to paddle desperately.

With adrenaline now bursting through my veins, I paddle for dear life; putting every morsel of energy I have into each stroke as the emberring hull inches closer and closer.

For some reason though, my arms feel like they‚Äôre barely moving! It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre numb or something.

Whipping my head back, I spot an oily life jacket covered in flames about to land on my butt checks but with a quick knee-jerk twist, I narrowly dodge it.
It must‚Äôve caught fire along with the ship; the irony.

From the corner of my eye I see the scorching mountain of an ocean-liner boiling through the water around me, now only a few meters away.

With the flames now illuminating the water, I realize that for some reason I‚Äôm also completely naked.

Shifting gears into emergency survival mode, I push through the numbness of my arms and bite my lip through the pain as hairs on my back begin to singe off.

‚ÄúFaster. Faster!‚Äù I yell at my limbs as my body begins to tremble. Whether it‚Äôs due to exhaustion or panic, I couldn‚Äôt tell anymore.

After my last good stroke, my body shuts down and begins tensing up in the frigid waters.

Turning back, I see the ship barely miss my toes as its smoldering hull passes by in a bubbling cloud.

Watching as the burning light sinks deep into the depths of darkness, I slowly pump my fist in triumph.

I did it!

I survived!

Cutting my victory short, a group of rogue snake-like power cables pop out of the darkness. They slither behind the vessel like tentacles; twirling through the water weightlessly, and slice at my hand.

Before I know it, the knot of serpent-cables wrap around my ankles and yank me down to the depths with a violent tug.
Hopelessly, I watch as my last air bubbles slowly scatter into the tides.

As I‚Äôm blacking out, I begin to hear the faint grinding and clanking of metal as we drop into deeper depths.

The grinding intensifies the lower we drop till it‚Äôs piercingly loud but yet... it‚Äôs strangely familiar.

Yeah, it‚Äôs definitely familiar!

It‚Äôs not a song, more like an assault to the ears, an unrelenting drone if you will, but still familiar.

Wait...it‚Äôs my alarm clock!

WAKE UP!



My mind and body must‚Äôve gotten different memos because even after realizing it was all a dream, it still feels like I‚Äôm underwater.

Waking up to a cold sweat; I‚Äôm immediately blinded (again) by the blue sun rays shining through my walls
Totally disoriented, I slowly lift my head up with a loud yawn as I stretch my neck. In my other hand, I feel water running through my fingers as my palm sinks into my comforter.

Not a great way to start my day off. I‚Äôm all soaked in cold sweat, it‚Äôs the sixth time this month!

‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù I mutter under my breath while bitterly dragging myself out of bed.

While wiping the sand from under my eyes, I belt out another yawn and reach my hand back to activate my relay.
With a gentle tap to the space behind my left ear, a 2D green dot materializes into view at the top left corner of my field of view.

This time when I think ‚Äòwhat time is it‚Äô a transparent 3D clock pops up next to the green dot, slowing rotating with a light glow.

It reads: 13:05, with a blinking exclamation point hovering beside it.

With a thought, I click on the exclamation point and the calendar app pops open then flips to today‚Äôs page.

In big letters, a flashing message blares:

Extra Shift at Breok‚Äôs | 12:00-22:00

With a defeated sigh, I slap my forehead with my palm and slowly drag it down to my chin.

‚ÄúCRAP! I‚Äôm late for work.‚Äù I holler in frustration as I reach behind my ear again and put my relay in idle.

In all the excitement from my nightmare, I forgot I begged Breok for an extra shift last week.

Tumbling out of bed, I start to rummage through the piles of clothes on the floor for my work uniform.

Finally getting it after the third pile, I pull it out and wipe it down before throwing it on with two quick hops.

Midway through zippering up, I realize I‚Äôm not wearing any underwear; but there‚Äôs no time to go scouring for one now. I‚Äôll have to go commando ‚Äìgross- but it‚Äôs got to be done. 

After getting changed I stumble out of my room, hopping on one foot as I put my boots on.

Crashing onto the walls of the kitchen as I struggle to get them on, I see the lunch Ma left for me on the counter and grab it just as I zip up my left boot then jet out the door.

The moment I step outside I reach back, re-activate my relay, and play the perfect soundtrack for my race against unemployment.

Hopping down from my stoop I hit the footstreets running, wildly navigating through the sea of commuters on their way to work as I move like the wind to keep mine.

To the left, zipping autos fly up and down the hyperways at speeds so fast all you can see is a blurry river of headlights through the blue-hued hardlight barrier.

To my right, vibrant relay-generated ads dance through the Metro‚Äôs sprawling canopy of mega-skyscrapers and hov-gardens in a beautiful mirage of colors.
The scissoring hyperway tracks run through multi-tiered buildings, platforms and terminals; looping around to connect every corner of the Metro with thick arcing beams of light.

In the distance, there‚Äôs always a few tracks fading in and out before reappearing again in different shapes or directions; Ma told me the people that get paid for that actually make bank. Maybe I should drop off my resume, apply for an internship or something; I‚Äôll need it after Breok strangles me to death.

Above my head, two pixelating mercury surfers appear riding a silvery wave. With gigantic smiles painted on their faces, they dodge every hanging vine and tree branch in sight.

When I see them, the smell of fresh sand following the tingling taste of metal flood my senses. For a moment all I can remember is renewing my Silver TapTM lake passes for the spring. From the corner of my eye, however, I see the slowly rotating clock pulsate as it changes time.

13:11

I‚Äôm now a full hour-something late, and counting.

‚ÄúBusy; maybe another time.‚Äù I mutter to the surfers as their smiles droop into frowns. Massive waves crash on top of them, totally wiping them out as they de-pixelate into mist and vanish.

Through my music I hear a small ping from a new IM*, a coupon for Merc-Surfing most likely, so I ignore it and turn up the bass as the rotating sign above the jump-pad terminal finally pops up in the horizon.

Desperately sprinting through annoyed faces to an electro beat, I dip and weasel my way to the nearest pad- stop as the song‚Äôs build-up reaches critical mass. 

Just as I jump through a group of cell-farmers to get onto the platform, the beat drops epically and I stick the landing; only to notice I just got to the end of a very long line.

Jump-pads are usually arranged in semi-circles at pad- stops; five or six to a platform. They‚Äôre quick as a blink and never power down; but even with a stop every 100 or so meters along the hyperway, on each side, the ques to use one can get horrible during rush hour.
And it‚Äôs always rush hour.

13:16

‚ÄúC‚Äômon! At this rate I‚Äôll be clocking in at lunch!‚Äù I quietly mutter to myself as I stare hopelessly at the rotating clock in my peripheral and take my place in line.
At least the line‚Äôs moving fast.

One-by-one people march up to the jump-pad and ‚Äòport away in the blink of an eye only to be quickly replaced by another, then another and so on.

Thing is, Breok‚Äôs shop is across the track from me; I can see his flashing relay-sign from my room. Yet, I still have to wait in a que of six-hundred just to get there; kind of lame.

Without these bad boys though, getting across the hyperway would be suicide.
My teacher told us the average speed per auto on any given hyperway is between 75 to 150 meters per second -without speed hacks.

Hardlight barriers block people from wandering in and contain any accidents between autos within the track; but accidents can still happen.

Like Mr. Boe says: ‚ÄúAnything on the track that‚Äôs not made of metal or running on nuclear fusion is definitely getting the yoga-mat treatment, free of charge!‚Äù
Waddling anxiously as the que marches on, I start to fantasize about cutting everyone in line and hopping onto a jump-pad before anyone could catch me.
It‚Äôs a thought I‚Äôve had every day since starting at Breok‚Äôs shop.

Without meaning to, I trail off on the thought before realizing it‚Äôs finally about to be my turn to hop on.

Luckily, I‚Äôm not the only one in line late for something. It takes no more than two seconds of me standing aimlessly in my thoughts before the hissing and cursing start to ring in my ear.

With a face redder than raw meat, I turn around to apologize but see hundreds of sour-stares beaming lasers at my forehead.

‚ÄúYeesh; point made.‚Äù I mutter to myself. ‚ÄúNo need for the pitchforks.‚Äù

Turning back around while trembling nervously, I close my eyes and hop onto the jump-pad without thinking another word.

When I open my eyes again, I‚Äôm on the platform in front of Breok‚Äôs ‚ÄòRelay-Sheens and Everything In-Between‚Äô store.

Still trembling, I step off the jump-pad and walk in; mentally preparing myself for the absolute worst.

Stepping through the doorway, I notice the clock in my relay pulsing again.

13:27

I‚Äôm screwed; up, down, and sideways.

The moment he sees me, Breok‚Äôs bellows start to rattle every widget, loose screw and poster in the store.

Arms flapping, he roars and curses at me like it‚Äôs the answer to life but by now, I‚Äôve heard it all.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm deducting this‚Äù, ‚ÄúSay good bye to that‚Äù, throwing in an extra ‚ÄúWhat do I pay you for‚Äù here and there, the whole nine; but I expected worse, way worse.

After a while, he eventually mumbles off to his office and leaves the store to me when he sees that I‚Äôm actually doing my job; something I‚Äôve still never seen him do.
The pay‚Äôs decent though and I get to work on awesome stuff all day so, can‚Äôt complain.

It‚Äôs mainly simple repairs that I do here. Got an infinity screen acting up at home? Bring it in, we gotcha‚Äô covered.

A few months back, I even fixed a small nuclear engine with a busted sonic-screwdriver and some toothpaste.

I love it, and always have for as long as I can remember. Ma says it‚Äôs because I grew up breaking everything; eventually I had to figure out how to put it back together.

When the store‚Äôs empty, and I‚Äôm certain Breok‚Äôs not glaring over my shoulders anymore, I quietly take out a small project that I‚Äôve been working on for the past couple of months.

It‚Äôs the skeleton to a prototype I‚Äôm calling: ‚Äòthe bionic exo-limb‚Äô, or something like that; I‚Äôm not too good with names. What it does is simple, in theory anyway.

It attaches itself to a body part, analyzes inefficiencies in the muscle structure, and then enhances it exponentially.

Most of it is still in concept, actually, it‚Äôs all still in concept.

For now though, I do at least have the basic layout done; the only thing left to do is test it while connected to some power and watch what happens.

After cautiously turning on the power generator, I warily place the wireless transmission-pads on their respective pairs and take a deep breath.

If I touch the alloy casing while power‚Äôs running through it, it‚Äôll be a good bye to my facial hair; and I just started getting my first tusks so safety is key.

Carefully finishing the adjustments to the last pad on the bio-limb, I take another deep breath and turn on the potential. When suddenly, the front door slams open and a voice boldly calls out:

‚ÄúAye, you guys fix HovCyks here?‚Äù

In seemingly slow motion I look up to see a guy around my age, probably a little shorter than me, with broad shoulders and maroon hair.

Somehow, even with the sun hitting him, his eyes look completely black. Weirder still, he looks kind of familiar; do I know him?

Steadily, he walks in with a cocky smug and the broken handle of a ruined -and still steaming- HovCyk.

As time starts catching back up, I realize my heart‚Äôs knocking in my chest like a friendly neighbor as I stare blankly at the stranger. He came out of nowhere!

‚ÄúWait! The alloy casing!‚Äù screams a voice from the back of my head.

With my eyes wider than a hyperway track, I slowly turn my head down to my hands.

Oh no.

ZZAAAAPPPP

Waking up a few seconds later, there‚Äôs a gear at my back, a neutron generator on my head, and a hand in my face.

Looking up to a silhouette of the stranger who just came in, I grab the hand and he helps me struggle off the miscellaneous pile.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù I mutter to the stranger as I dust my uniform off; trying to hide my embarrassment the best I could.

‚ÄúNo problem man; sure you alright?‚Äù nervously asks the stranger as he warily eyes me up and down.

‚ÄúAgh, I‚Äôm fine. Don‚Äôt worry about it. And yeah...I can take a look at that for you.‚Äù I groan while extending my hand out. ‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Aris by the way.‚Äù

He looks down at my hand curiously and then shoots a look back up to me.
With a subtle blink, he relaxes his shoulders, flashes a smile and heartily grabs my hand.

‚ÄúNice to meet you man; name‚Äôs Zay‚Äôko.‚Äù"

________

I consider myself to be a lucky man. For most of my life, nothing out of the ordinary has happened. 
Living carefree, being able to pursue my dreams, and even meeting someone I loved; I can‚Äôt say that my life has been devoid of happy memories. 

It is therefore I suppose unsurprising for me to discover that the young man who shared a name with me was but the polar opposite.

This Jeremiah was troubled, his short time in this life plagued by one problem after another. 

As my host John contacted his own medical staff, he regaled me with details of my doppelg√§nger‚Äôs tenure there at the school. They were exciting if not often immersed in tragedy and depression. 

It seemed that one thing we shared in common was our interest in the dark arts. 

It seemed that research had centered around one ancient book in particular called *The Lazarus Record* which according to John was written in such an ancient tongue that not even the most well equipped Capronian scholars could decipher it. 

‚ÄúWhere is this record now?‚Äù I asked as I was settled into an examination chair. 

‚ÄúUnder lock and key I‚Äôm afraid. You see my dear Jeremiah, the fact of the matter is that those who have read that ancient spellbook and actually understood it‚Ä¶ well they‚Äôve gone mad. Gouging their eyes out, cutting off their tongues and frying them, evisceration‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been quite grisly to see. We have deemed it too dangerous for anyone actually hold onto,‚Äù he explained as the attending physician arrived. 

Doctor Henri Wood looked as though he had seen such abominations first hand, his features resembling a spirit more than a man. I soon came to find that was truly an understatement as the two colleagues set up the medical equipment and prattled on about matters relating to occultism as though it were an ordinary conversation. 

‚ÄúThe cultists have begun stirring. Ever since the incident near the graveyard‚Ä¶ do you suspect that this is connected?‚Äù Henri asked as he started at IV on me. 

‚ÄúOf that I have no doubt, we are seeing the results of what happens when mortals stand up against gods; Doctor Wood. And young Jeremiah here is going to confirm it once and for all. There can be no more doubt,‚Äù John responded. 

‚ÄúIf I may be so bold as to ask, what do you hope for these tests to determine?‚Äù I asked. I felt a little foolish for not inquiring about such things before the examination began, but John only smiled reassuringly. ‚ÄúIf all goes well? Then I hope it shows the world that our dreams were not in vain,‚Äù he responded. A few attending students proceeded to strap down my ankles and wrists before I could object. Then Doctor Wood prepared a syringe, a dark glowing substance swirling about in the vial as he tapped it. 

‚ÄúI can see you are frightened, Jeremiah. Relax your senses. Let it all sink in. Don‚Äôt run from the fear, embrace it,‚Äù John told me. 

I held my breath as the needle pricked my skin, watching the strange goo enter my blood. I was helpless to fight it. Part of me *didn‚Äôt* want to. Somewhere my inner voice screamed I should find. It sounded like Jasmine. But I ignored it. All that mattered was answers. 

For a short moment the two learned men watched monitors to see the black slimy medicine work its way through my body, until at last it hit my central nervous system. 

Then I felt my body go completely numb and the room began to spin. Voices now sounded like distant echoes, colors and shapes cascaded in and out of view and I felt a cold sweat ripple through me. The world was going black. I don‚Äôt know for sure if this is what a near death experience might be considered, but I think it‚Äôs as close as I can get to the sensation of leaving my body. 

Eventually all of my senses went numb. I was unaware of my body the way a dreamer might be, wandering the ethereal nothing and waiting for a call from whoever or whatever was guiding me. Then, just as swiftly as it occurred, the experience came crashing down and I was rushed back into the consciousness I was familiar with. 

Opening my eyes I stumbled forward and grabbed the man in front of me, gasping for breath. 

‚ÄúMy god. What was that?‚Äù I mumbled, it felt like I was learning to talk for the first time. 

As my eyes adjusted to the room, I realized I was no longer amongst familiars. 

The teacher that had grabbed ahold of me wore the face of a stranger and he shoved me away suspiciously before remarking, ‚ÄúWho are you? How did you get here? What sort of devil‚Äôs work is this?‚Äù 

Finally the room came into focus. I recognized I was still standing in the Rossetti University but it was not the crypt I was familiar with. This college appeared to be in its prime, and the scholar standing in front of me were wearing traditional fabrics from colonial times.  

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you would believe me were I to tell you,‚Äù I managed to say as I rushed to a nearby window and looked toward the courtyard. The rest of the university also showed excellent splendor. It was still doubtlessly the same place, but from the throng of others mulling about the eastern courtyard, building barriers and molding stones; it was clear I had somehow transferred to a different time. 

‚ÄúI will ask you once more, spirit. Who are you and where do you come from?‚Äù the man who I had stumbled into asked. He drew a shotgun that resembled a Confederate pistol. 

‚ÄúMy name is Jeremiah Ward‚Ä¶ I know this is going to sound strange‚Ä¶ but I come from what you might call the future,‚Äù I told him.  A ripple of strange energy flocculated behind the stranger as he holstered the gun. 

‚ÄúThe future? Do you think me daft boy? You‚Äôre clearly a poacher of some type,‚Äù he growled. 

The energy shimmered greater as I shivered and shook, wishing I could get this ancient colonist to believe me. 

‚ÄúTell me your name! I am a student of history! I can tell you something about yourself that hasn‚Äôt occurred yet!‚Äù I challenged him. 

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be fooled by your tricks demon. We traveled far to escape the bonds of society. We have no interest in the past. Only forging our own history,‚Äù he declared. 

I opened my mouth to object when I saw the strange shimmer move, warping the stone and mortar beneath the scholar. 

The man noticed it too and looked toward the bizarre distortion in concern. 

‚ÄúIs this your work demon?‚Äù the man asked. Suddenly from the depths of the strange energy, a form appeared. It was neither man nor woman, nor even a beast of the field. It looked beyond comprehension, long tendrils of energy swirling about us as I grabbed the strangers hand and ran toward the door. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening, but I could afford for him to be killed by this force. 

The other direction was soon blocked off by another shadowy monster, emerging from the corners of the building as it ripped apart reality itself. There was a high pitched whistle as it did so I gripped his hand firmly, wishing I could determine a way out of this for both of us. But it was too late. The swirling dark vortex had grabbed ahold of both of us and in the blink of an eye we were being swallowed whole. 

________


When I awoke, I found myself in the college infirmary with Doctor Wood checking my vitals. 

‚ÄúTell VanBuren that Ward has woke up. He‚Äôll want to hear about the walk,‚Äù Henri told one of his interns. 

I opened my mouth to ask what had happened but the doctor swiftly raised his finger to his mouth to dissuade any further discussion. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had a traumatic experience. We had no idea what sort of results the bond might have, but we have never quite seen a reaction like yours. Not since the Sullivans anyway‚Ä¶‚Äù 

The doors to the infirmary swung open and surgeons rushed in pushing a stretcher with a trembling form on it. From this angle I could see that the misshapen body belonged to the same man I had met in the distant past. Had I somehow managed to bring him here? How was such magic possible? It looked like the journey had nearly ripped apart his organs the way a shredder might slice through cheese. Yet still he was alive. 

‚ÄúThe surgery was successful. It would seem we have managed to find a viable host. Is this why the others were killed off? To prevent our success?‚Äù one of the students whispered. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt know, Kent. But we will find out soon enough if we can manage to pinpoint how the process works and make our way to the original incident,‚Äù Henri muttered. 

I gathered they were speaking about me and my unprecedented gifts. I didn‚Äôt quite know the other details. But it infuriated me to be considered a guinea pig. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not any different than any other man! Why are you treating me like some prized specimen?‚Äù I snarled. 

‚ÄúBecause you are. Your whole family is,‚Äù John said matter of factly as he entered the room. 

‚ÄúThe ancient word for a man like you was Yith, in this day and age it‚Äôs become something of a derogatory term‚Ä¶ but originally? During the age of discovery? A yith could transition between dimensions and space and time, connecting to cosmic beings beyond our realm with ease,‚Äù he said as he checked my vitals. 

‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt experienced this entire thing just now I would have called you insane,‚Äù I said dryly. 

‚ÄúInsanity is often genius which is misunderstood. Your family was blessed with this connection because of an incident when the settlers came here. There was‚Ä¶ a sacred relic that your ancestors were familiar with. It is our hope that by exploring your gifts to its full potential, we can unlock the secrets of your gift for all men,‚Äù he told me excitedly. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not so sure such dark magic should be tampered with. Look at what happened to this poor fellow! It nearly killed him! And besides which, hasn‚Äôt bringing him here altered the timeline in some fashion?‚Äù I said, my voice trembling as I stared across the room at his shaky appendages. It would be a miracle if he survived the night. 

‚ÄúI recognize your hesitation to pursue this matter further, Jeremiah. After all, many have died to achieve greatness. It is quite likely this is what killed Carter as well. But even despite all these risks she didn‚Äôt back down from the goal. Every mistake or setback also reveals another piece of the puzzle. We are at the precipice of a discovery that will alter the very foundation of mankind!‚Äù VanBuren insisted. 

I shook my head, uncertain how to respond. I did want more than anything else to understand the gift I was given, the mystery of my lineage I never knew I had. It was all very enticing. 
‚ÄúBut how can we possibly hope to control this when we hardly even understand the process?‚Äù I asked. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve contacted an expert in the field to assist us in the matter,‚Äù John said slapping my shoulder heartedly. 

As though on cue, the doors opened again and a tall trim woman with cropped red hair entered. 

Her heels made a soft clicking noise across the infirmary floor as her green eyes silently judged all the participants in the room before finally focusing on me. 

‚ÄúYou must be the mimic,‚Äù she remarked adjusting her glasses. 

‚ÄúI have a name. It‚Äôs Jeremiah Ward,‚Äù I told her, not appreciating her attitude. 

‚ÄúIt will be a name long forgotten in the stream of time I‚Äôm afraid. But make no mistake, I consider myself equally as invalid in this cosmic game we seem to have found ourselves pawns of,‚Äù she answered, extending her hand and introducing herself. 

‚ÄúDoctor Meredith Parker. I look forward to reaching your full potential.‚Äù

dy5etp,3,2019-11-18,Not sure about what I want to do (CS vs. EE),rafasofizadeh,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dy5etp/not_sure_about_what_i_want_to_do_cs_vs_ee/,"I‚Äôm a 2nd year EE student at a very academically rigorous, challenging program in Turkey. Lately I‚Äôve been very indecisive about what I want to do in life and what I should focus on throughout my undergraduate studies before grad school.

First of: I want to do research. I want to pursue a PhD, do innovative work, generate knowledge, work with cutting-edge tech, etc. I understand how much of a toll it can take on one‚Äôs lifestyle, but I think it‚Äôs a worthy pursuit.

Now, I really love CS. I‚Äôve been programming for 4-5 years now (I‚Äôm 18), I have spent extensive time programming and recently I got an offer for Soft. Eng. Internship from a Top-3 in US. So there‚Äôs no doubt in my mind I‚Äôd have a successful career in software. Plus, there are a lot of fields I find bery interesting, especially those that are math-heavy.
There is just one thing bothering me. Something with having a career in CS just doesn‚Äôt stick to me. The thought of it just doesn‚Äôt satisfy me. I don‚Äôt know from where or why I have it. I think it will change drastically once I get to do real soft. engineering further on, but for now being a soft. engineer just doesn‚Äôt sound ‚Äúsexy‚Äù to me.

On the other hand, EE. I‚Äôve been a pretty mediocre EE student so far: slightly above average GPA for our school (3.25 vs 3.00), which I‚Äôm desperately trying raise for grad. school while balancing a lot of CS extracurriculars. I don‚Äôt know much about EE outside of school program and I‚Äôm just about to start dabbling in EE research. Nevertheless, pursuing a PhD in EE and spending my life on research just feels right to me, I like how much scientific and maths background you need for EE (especially with comparison in CS), EE seems like a field where I can perform complez, deep scientific work and make meaningful impact.

Apart from passion for a field, there‚Äôs also the question of career advancement ‚Äúcurve‚Äù: for CS, considering my experience and, especially, an upcoming internship, it will be pretty steep, while for EE the opposite, as I‚Äôm pretty much starting from 0.

If anyone is or has been in the same situation and/or provide any kind of advice that would be great and would ease my indecisiveness a lot.

P.S. for the ‚Äútry both see what you like‚Äù answers: both fields demand a lot of work and focus, and spreading myself on both field just doesn‚Äôt seem like a possible option for me."
dy5rbu,3,2019-11-18,Finish masters vs Revature,cinwald,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dy5rbu/finish_masters_vs_revature/,"I'd like to preface this given the reputation of Revature here.  I've done a little bit of research on them, and I'd consider myself a little bit desperate.

In May 2019, I graduated with a B.S in Computer Science from a rather prestigious university, 3.29 GPA.  I didn't, and still don't do well with interview questions, and didn't land a job right away.  I enjoyed programming, and had side projects, won several app competitions, had worked as a TA, had a Big 4 Accounting Firm Cybersecurity internship in a European country, had a Capstone project, and did clubs.  I got scared when I was getting ghosted while seemingly less qualified peers landed jobs (unhealthy comparison, I know).  I panicked and enrolled in a CS Master's degree at the same school.  I began doing research on the first project I could find, and did an REU program that summer.  I became depressed and didn't perform any miracles during my research over the summer, and my project hasn't got very far.  I currently am not enjoying my first semester of the Master's, and feel burnt out from my 3 classes, TA'ing and research gets whatever time is left.  At the same time, I'm not awfully excited to enter the working world, and am very conflicted.  I've been applying to both internships and full time jobs, with little luck, mainly getting ghosted, without even the chance to perform poorly on the coding challenges.  If I were to have an offer of any kind I'd probably be a lot less anxious.  

Revature emailed me today, wanting to talk.  I feel like they know I'm desperate, because they never scouted me during senior year.  I believe I'm worth more than that because the people who came to me for help with CS throughout college landed jobs with 2-3X the salary, prestige, and the freedom of not being bound by the 2 year contract.  I don't believe I'm god's gift and know there is more to learn, but I'm still disappointed with myself for this situation.

To be honest, I don't know what I'm asking, but what would you do in this situation?

EDIT: I'm well aware that most people don't like Revature, likely for good reason, but I was hoping for more  unique insights and potential alternatives given my situation, that I may not find in the generic Revature post on here.  Perhaps the generic Revature post on here is all there is to it, but I thought I'd ask."

She is wanting to study abroad for a bachelors degree in English Philology and I had the idea of moving in with her while she undertakes her studies. I decided that I would cover all of the living &amp; tuition costs while she studies full time.

Is this realistically possible or am I way over my head with this? Would she be able to obtain some sort of grant/ loan from the Swedish/ Dutch governments if I cannot afford to pay for everything?

I've redone my resume and that's fine as I've gotten 1 or 2 interviews/coding challenges per 5-10 applications. However after interviews there has only been 1-2 so far I get nothing. Yet for whatever resume I get flagged for various full time roles through Linkedin e.t.c. for my areas of work i.e. low level including compilers. I'm my ideas why but any comments would be helpful other than the usual of talking to a recruiter as that does not help it seems and I've tried it twice.

It's been twice now that I've been rejected/ghosted by (Big N and medium tier) companies for which I have had an employee referral. I feel bad for the people referring me because how does it look on them when the person they referred doesn't even land an interview?

I'm starting to think it must be my CV which isn't beefy enough but despite not going to a super well-known school, I already have done an internship with a very well know Aerospace company where I built a full-stack web application (majority frontend), and I have a few projects/portfolio and completed some online classes outside of school to learn more about front-end development, which I have discovered is what I am passionate about and would like to pursue a career in after my degree. 

What else can I be doing to increase my chances of at least landing an interview? Should I just continue applying?"

In a lot of aspects in my life actually. But this thread mainly has to do with the ""occupation"" part of my life. Just as probably a lot of people my age
(22), I do not know where to go with my life. At the same time, I feel left behind by my peers. Soooo many people I am around already have some kind of plan for their life. They have their own passion projects and long term goals that they want to achive. They have so much actual experiance in internships as well as real Jobs. They have a rough plan on where they want their lives to go. 
Meanwhile I'm just left there... without any plan at all.

I am currently 22 finishing up my bachelor degree in communication science which is apparently wothless in the working world. I do not know why I even started that degree. I don't have actual working experiance in the field of media and only ever had one, what I consider, ""real"" job in my life. As teaching assistent at my university. Another thing which is probably worthless in the working world. The only thing I have going for me is working voluntarily on a bunch of uni projects.

I have nothing of substance to show though and no idea what I should or would like to do.

I started a computer science degree this semester in effort to combat this aimlessness, maybe this was my passion. But now it just turns out to be too difficult for me as well as me realising that this is absolutely not my field. 

I have this feeling of being sooo far behind my peers in every aspect of my life. How do I combat this effectively?! I would like to try applying for internships but my schedule with uni and work just won't allow me to pick up anything else."

Before i received this offer, I had applied to at least 50 other top CS companies, none of whom I've heard back from till I accepted company X's offer.

However, yesterday i heard back from software giant Y who wants me to interview for a role. It's one of my dream companies. They also pay double what Company X is offering and provide free accommodation.

I might have similar internship experiences with both companies but with Company Y, i would also have saved enough to pay off my tuition fees for the next semester, Something which I will not be able to do with Company X since i would make half and have no accommodation allowance.

My question is, has anyone else reneged on their internship offers? What were the ramifications? Is it ethical for me to interview with company Y and accept an offer should i receive one? I know its not ethical, but should i do it?"

dybjbe,1,2019-11-18,Took the Wrong Job,needoptions14,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/dybjbe/took_the_wrong_job/,"Long story short - I graduated a year ago with a and took a job as a field engineer for a large EPC contractor doing construction management work on industrial contracts. For the past year I have been in the office doing pre construction work, and I'm realizing the construction lifestyle isn't for me. I've realized that the constant moving, long hours, and high stress is not worth the upward mobility and additional pay I will receive over the lifecycle of my career. Coming out of college I wanted to pursue a job that allowed me to move around, but over the past year I've had a change in values and have started to place a lot more value on family and thereby stability. I was never particularly enthralled by the construction industry - I only pursued it due to the great upward mobility and the mobile lifestyle.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Easy, change jobs, right? Well unfortunately I'm in a position where I'm supposed to be moving to the jobsite by the end of the year, far away from home. I know what sort of jobs I want to pursue, but it is a rather niche industry (energy trading) and may take some time to get into. I have some minor relevant experience from internships, but nothing that jumps out as ready to hit a desk 100%. I'm additionally hesitant to leave engineering/construction behind and run towards energy trading/finance 100% as it would not leave me much to fall back on if I'm found to be in a similar situation later on.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at a loss of what to do - do I make the move to the jobsite and see this project out for the valuable experience I'll gain - even recognizing it's probably not experience in a direction I want to go? Or do I make the move and start applying for jobs - I worry about the difficulty of the application/hiring process while working 50-60 hours a week on a construction site with a long commute etc. Or do I just say F it - I'm not moving and start applying for jobs and my last day in the office is my last day with the company? I have enough savings I could probably withstand two to three months of not having a job, but I don't really think that's the best position to put myself in and I'd worry if I couldn't find something or being pressured into a direction."

My gpa is really bad, cumulative 2.8. I did so badly in all CS classes because I really , but I did well beyond average in EE classes. I got 30 credit from AP courses, which only made my GPA worse. The worst thing is that I performed terribly due to mental illness last semester, almost on the verge of academic probation... 

I took meds and somehow fixed my brain, and decided not to give up to give an one last shot. Then I got my GRE score last week, 330(V160 + Q170), but still, a lot people say a high GRE won't compensate for a low GPA, and I agree with that. I tried hard this semester, expecting a 3.7+ GPA this semester, probably next semester as well.  
For experiences, I did some researches at college; have been a content creator on social media doing embedded projects; had an internship at a small corp; run a small website which nobody uses; and that is it.

I managed to get 3 LoRs, 2 from professors who are currently teaching me, one from a professor under whom I did my research on ASIC. One is going to be somewhat strong. I would still consider myself a competitive candidate for grad school, but I fall into the kind of ""I am capable, but I cannot demonstrate"", almost making the depression come back at me.

Now I am looking to pursue a M.S or M.S.E in Electrical Engineering, but I don't know at what position should I be placing myself. Should I be aiming at schools rank between 60-70  or lower and try to transfer after I got in? Or should I try to challenge some top schools anyway? I know there is cutoff GPA for most grad schools, I am worried that they won't even look at other materials I prepared and decide solely based on the first glance of my terrific GPA.

I also have an offer form Ford Motor Company  in their IT Department. Assignments are not given until the spring so I would essentially be going in somewhat-blind because I have read that Ford internship projects are sort of a mixed bag. Pay: $20/hr Location: Dearborn, MI. Housing: covered

I am a sophomore studying computer science and I have not had an internship yet and I truly believe any experience is good experience but I have no idea how to determine which offer I should take. My fear with Caterpillar is that it doesn't exactly feel high-tech (which I think is what I want) and it's in a pretty boring area. My fear with Ford is that I've read countless reviews and some people said they had great experiences and others said they worked on projects that had nothing to do with their skills or interests. My fear with Northrup Grumman is that I'm not sure the housing stipend would cover a summer in LA and then I'm not sure it would even be worth it. I also couldn't really see myself working for Northrup Grumman post-graduation.

As I look through the ------ website and learn more about the capabilities of this company, I‚Äôm feeling it all the more urgent to introduce myself and explain why I see myself in this position.

When considering the task for this job, such as public relation skills, I feel that my experience working on ----- social media platforms, writing articles for their internal and external sources, and contributions to tradeshows/customers summits would make me a great representative for --------. While receiving mentorship from --------marketing team, I also had a few mentors in sales, allowing for a unique view of indirect and direct customer relations, in which I was able to spot some essential points of a good marketing campaign; things like identifying the problem and selling on how we can fix it.

Applications like the innovative 3D technology, to me, are inspirational, leading to me envision all the learning opportunities this position could provide me. I read about the -------- application and I feel a yearning to understand the impression it has inside and outside the company, what problems it solves, and any other information surrounding this technology. I feel my want to learn of the ------- system, along with my exposure to tech marketing from -------, makes me a strong candidate for this position.

Gaining experience and understanding through work is my passion and I‚Äôm confident that I will be an excellent addition to the --------marketing team. Any sort of feedback from you would leave me ecstatic. To discuss any future opportunities or interviews, please contact me at -------

The whole search took around 2.5 months. I applied to my first internship on 8/27. 

Diagram: https://imgur.com/a/MKgyGTC

I ended up applying to 50 places and getting offers from 6 of them. 

Background: I am a junior (class of 2021). I go to a decently well-known school in the west coast. The school is well known for a lot of programs but computer science &amp; engineering isn't one of them (yet!). I applied to mainly companies in California and New York. I did one internship at a well-known company (summer 2019) and 2 at local startups (throughout my semesters). I did around 200 leetcode problems but a lot of practice carried over from last recruiting season. I mainly used: leetcode, CTCI, CLRS (the canonical algorithms book), and EPI.

I think the most helpful thing I did was do a lot of mock interviews. My friends and I would ask each other questions and practice speaking clearly, showing our work and thought process, as well as knowing when to use which algorithmic patterns. I started studying in mid-August but I really ramped up around September and October (at the cost of my GPA RIP). I think even if you don't know how to do the problem you are given, asking the right questions to your interviewers and demonstrating your thought process goes a long way. 

I received 1 referral to a company I ended up getting an offer with. I also went to my school's career fair where I ended up getting two offers from those companies.

I don't think I really have interesting side projects I keep an active github where I participate in open-source software. I wish everyone good luck! Inbox me if you have any questions!"

dyee2m,4,2019-11-18,Data Science vs Web Dev vs SWE,iMakeBaadChoices,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dyee2m/data_science_vs_web_dev_vs_swe/,"Hey! Long story short I'm going to be graduating college within a year with an honors bachelor of science degree (Majored in Statistics). I'm kind of dumb in the sense that I didn't do any internships and have no real work experience, but I'll be graduating from a top school and I have a bit of freelance work under my belt. I've done a lot of CS on the side (for 1.5 years I was a CS major) and I've become pretty good at Python and I can handle myself with most ""Easy"" level Leetcode questions and some ""Medium"" level ones too (Haven't attempted hard ones yet). On the side I also learned Web Dev since I found it interesting to be able to make actual tangible things such as websites where people will actually use them. I ended up becoming a freelancer and I made around 3 websites, one was for an actual company and two was for friends that wanted to start blogging, etc.

So, my question is, how would you decide whether you want to be a DS/Web Dev/SWE. Or simply put, which would you choose?

One thing that's pretty important I suppose is salary and growth and job security. I've worked pretty hard to get where I'm at and I know money isn't everything but my parents moved here with the typical ""dream"" of their son making it big so I want to follow through with that and shower them with things.

With that said, here are my thoughts about each role (Maybe I'm wrong or misinformed in some cases and I'm happy to be corrected!)

**DS:** I think predicting things based on data is super cool. As my undergrad is in Statistics I also enjoy the math aspect of it. I've been doing a bit of work with ML/AI and it's been a really fun experience so far. However, the biggest thing I hear is that most of what you do is actually data cleaning which of course isn't the most fun thing in the world. I also feel that DS is more on the business side of things that the other roles. I love business as well so I feel like I may have a better chance to climb to a business-y/managerial position as a DS.

**Web Dev:** This is probably the ""lowest"" out of the three in terms of salary, difficulty, etc. However it's what I started with and I find enjoyment in it. I love all aspects of web dev, front end, back end, etc. But maybe I love it so much is because when I freelanced I was able to carry it from front to back but if I was on a team I'd be working on only one small part and I feel like I wouldn't enjoy it as much? But who knows, maybe I'm wrong haha

**SWE:** This seems the hardest to me since I haven't taken any design systems classes or the likes. I've taken a good amount of programming classes in college but that was mostly algorithmic things like trees, sorting, linked lists, etc. However I have no real knowledge of all the O(n) stuff, and other technical things. I do really enjoy SWE tho and job security wise, most posts I've read talk about how DS is maybe a bit of a bubble and there's a lot more security as a SWE since every company needs engineers where as most companies don't need a data scientist.

tldr: Having a hard time deciding which of those three paths/fields I should be focusing on and applying to and studying for. Any advice on the pros/cons or even what you would pick is greatly appreciated!

Thank you :)

PS. I wouldn't be bothered in the slightest with getting jobs in either of these career paths. I'm more looking for advice on the pros/cons for each path and I'm just wondering what others would pick."

I'm mostly curious about possible financial aid and scholarship opportunities. I live in a one-income home, and my dad is a high school teacher. So uh, need-blind would probably be best for me haha.. I applied ED1 to Wash U (oops..) who.. is most definitely not need-blind. And? Here we are, on chanceme.. trying to fix my mistake.

Hear back from Wash U Nov. 15th, but trying to cement my backup plans in the time being. I'm gonna write at least a few of these apps over Thanksgiving break. I live 25 mins from Wash U, but on the Illinois side of the Mississippi river.

Considering: Notre Dame, UCSB, UCSD, Carnegie Mellon, NYU, UNC, Wellesley, Boston College, U Michigan: Ann Arbor, Emory, Northwestern (Dad is making me apply bc he likes the school a lot), possibly U Chicago (I honestly don't think I'm creative enough) and Dartmouth (idfk why I just like the school a lot.. rip). I'm an intended Cognitive Science (Neuroscience) or Applied Mathematics major. Which schools could be within my range, and which should I focus on for the essays?

**Stats**:

GPA: 5.0/5.0 W, 4.0/4.0 UW

ACT: C: 34 (36E, 35R, 34M, 31S). SS: 35 (36 R, 34 M, 36 E, 33S)

SAT: not submitting (got like a 1400 sumn, idk I just think my ACT is in a better percentile)

AP: not submitting, got 3's.. lmfao. Passing score, but not gonna get much credit for them I don't think. Taking four this year. I hope to do better on them bc my classes are actually geared toward the AP exams this time.

Senior Courseload: AP Phys II, AP Calc BC, AP Composition, AP Enviro Science, AP Psychology

**Extracurriculars**:

Chem lab internship at local university. \~100 hrs. Took on two projects (one nanoparticle synthesis thing.. another for crystal creation for some kinda laser imprinting that Physics dept. ppl would do with the crystals I made?? I only got to talk with the physics people about it TWICE and I had no idea what was going on, ngl. The crystal thing will eventually be published research, but it isn't yet so I don't think I can mention that aspect of it)

Science Honors Society Treasurer (organize events to raise funds for the club, lead meetings w/ fellow officers)

Math Honors Society Historian (lead meetings alongside other officers, keep club history for the year)

STEM camp volunteer (80+ hrs). A summer program, I worked w/ 7th graders on Oceanography stuff. Taught lessons, pre-recorded dissection walkthroughs, led dissections, and created some cool labs for the kids.

Red Cross Volunteer (only like 20 hrs w/ this). I was just a Blood Donor Ambassador, aka front desk person. Was a cool opportunity to network and see how people organize events like blood drives, though.

Chief Recruitment Officer for a student-founded civic action group. We have brought voter registration to our school cafeteria (to get senior students to register as voters) for several years now with good student turnout results! One of the coolest things I've participated in. We've done a couple of other minor things (canvassing surrounding areas and stuff). Outside of my academic focus, but I still loved it.

And... a couple other things I can't think of at the moment, but pretty minimal. Just membership in them.

**Demographics**: White female, income &lt;85k. Not first gen, mom didn't go to college and has been unemployed for forever. Dad is the only working parent.

I've always wanted to live by the ocean AND go to schools with great research programs, so I thought that UCSD and UCSB would be great since they got ranked so highly on a top 500 world university list! And, UCSB in particular has made a huge impact on the scientific community.

I'm just kinda overloaded and I'm not sure where to apply for scholarships to these specific schools. Am I already considered for a few scholarships if I'm admitted to UCSD and/or UCSB? Which school would you guys recommend I actually apply to? Sorry this is a lot, just kinda drowning in this process rn and trying not to get my hopes up about anything while also trying not to give up. Any help or advice is appreciated, thanks guys."

I'm currently working in IT audit at a public accounting firm. It's not what I thought it'd be. I understood the work a bit because I had an internship elsewhere doing IT audit, but even that was more technical since I'd have to pull data from the mainframe etc. In my interview it seemed possible there could be some data analytics work, nut I just use Microsoft Excel all day long. Anyway, I want to transition to a more technical role, like software development, databases, even less technical but still in that sphere like a software business analyst. Those were more my taste in school. I have experience from my classes, e.g. built a database to do analysis over, made a website as a final project, but I haven't had work experience in something like that.

Has anyone transitioned from an IT audit role into something more technical? Any advice? Even if you haven't, I'd love some advice. Thanks."

I had one good side project, and the other two were rather mediocre. I had my resume checked multiple times in this sub under a throwaway, and I don't think it's that bad either. It's probably my location. I'm going to take a one week break to work on a project then start sending applications again. Hopefully it's less competitive as the strong students already have accepted offers.

Regarding the OAs, I've only encountered one very tough problem that was given by Akuna, which I was not able to solve. It was a very interesting problem, and I wish I could've taken a screenshot to work on it myself. I screwed up on Quora's codesignal, and it's normally something I should've done well on (probably nerves; my first OA). The only company that reached out to me was very well-known and paid their interns a lot, even if I did not ace their hackerrank. I aced the other 3, and I did not get replies back from 2. Twitter rejected me after acing their 4 problem hackerrank in an hour, which had a 24 hour time limit."

Edit 4: Yesterday (November, 20th) I showed up for signing what was supposed to be my end of contract. Along with that my former boss said my email (see edit 2) was very reasonable. I was given access to the data until the end (31st) of December and I will have to share my Thesis with them. I guess it was enough to show them what they had to gain from me, once more.

I guess I should have given more context rather than just the email I burst out.  My internship was structured around my master thesis and it only makes sense in relation to my research master. I'm not simply working with the company but I've been working on my own project in collaboration with the company.

Nonetheless, I cannot dismiss the points that were made. I still need to learn a lot and I should have not extended the level of demands I put on myself onto others. One more lesson from this is that earlier consideration of the workplace matter a lot in terms of deciding what is the best place for myself to learn and grow, while building positive and constructive relationships on the workplace.

The final (optimal) outcome also came about thanks to all the replies. Thanks to u/OrbitObit, u/nutrecht, u/loudrogue u/n00byd00sie and all the others for the on-spot remarks. About my communicational style wrt. to both the workplace and writing.

I can't stress enough how much I appreciated your responses. I felt contained and pointed towards the right direction in a way that I probably missed at some point in my life.

P.s. If anyone has additional suggestion/sources to learn a more approachable way of writing, I'd really appreciate that! The soft skills podcast is great btw!

In many situations throughout the internship I felt like I had ""no escape"", and I had to tell the CTO he was bordering on the emotionally abusive.

I read \[CTO's name and surname\]'s email and I find it hard to understand how this can be happening.

In  the past 6 months, I tried everything in my power to keep working at a  fast space while at the same time maintaining the social equilibrium.

As  of now, \[startup name\] has been provided with a neural network  tested on different scenarios, ready to be applied on the 3D xRay data  in dicos format.

My last 8 months of work, however, will end in dust causing me to prolong my Msc by half a year.

&amp;#x200B;

I've  been working Thursday and Friday on providing the required pickled  files, but could not manage to finish within last week, 17th of  November.

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps the fact I was labelling handguns, more complex than knives (labeled by Robert) could have played a role?

Unfortunately I was not able to work in the weekend as I've done previously, due to plans I could not change.

&amp;#x200B;

Independently  of whether I'll be allowed to further work with the team, I would  request further access to the data for the duration of 2 weeks from now  (6th of December, as previously agreed) to finalize my Master thesis.

\[startup name\] would still be able to obtain the manuscript in  full.

I think this would be fair given the situation, and  rectify a wrong arising from an exacerbated working environment for  which I find it hard to consider myself the sole perpetrator.

I  can also come to \[City\] to finish annotating the 500 xRay instances¬†  between Wednesday and Friday, if that is still demanded.

I hope we can solve this matter in an objective and rational way, to the benefit of everyone involved.

dykoz5,66,2019-11-19,I wrote some points I would like to share with CS Majors,flyingkwaj,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/dykoz5/i_wrote_some_points_i_would_like_to_share_with_cs/,"I would just like to share some points today that I have been thinking quite a bit about since graduating this past May. I've been working for a couple of months now for a Fortune 50 retailer after studying CS/Math at a state university in the Midwest. Not everyone might agree with my thoughts but if they start good conversation then I think that still can benefit readers of this sub. A lot of these points might also already be common knowledge to readers, and in that case I apologize for rehashing.

*  Computer Science as a field is not the same as programming or software engineering. CS can be viewed as a run-away topic of Applied Mathematics in that it borrows so much theory (and applications) from those fundamentals. Topics such as SWE and programming certainly benefit from research and developments found in CS, and could be categorized as sub-fields of CS, but make no mistake, studying Computer Science alone will not make you an expert software engineer. It WILL equip you quite well to dive into topics such as software engineering, however. I decided to jump onto a team where I was brand new to the team's role/area of expertise, that being baremetal servers. We are purely infrastructure and use Chef/Ansible to manage our configurations at scale. I have very little personal interest in IT operations, but I can absolutely dive into our cookbooks/runbooks and see code that can be refactored and improved substantially. And if there is nothing that is obvious to me, I can begin to ask questions of our processes that may lead to that conversation elsewhere. I've found myself potentially mentoring our lead engineers (purely IT experts) in the fundamentals of writing clean and modular code. I think this is an example of the divide between IT and topics such as CS.

* If you have the opportunity (and the inherent desire), focus on Mathematics along with Computer Science. Learn to solve abstract problems by proof. No, you will not always see the benefit of knowing how to prove things in a real mathematics course. However, the business people of your organization in your full time job may actually appreciate your ability to communicate your argument from point A to point B. It will be easier to decide ""what you want to say"" when you are preparing for a meeting. You'll learn when you should abstract away the details for non-technical people because you can start to see when you are just writing an outline, or when you are diving into the details. Believe it or not, there are truly those out there in the workforce who can not see the difference. I have seen how challenging it is for people with pure-IT backgrounds to ""sell"" an idea to management. In contrast, I've seen how productive others are in getting a plan through the vetting process.

* Have good expectations for yourself every day as a student. You will not be able to crack open your algorithms textbook every day and become a subject matter expert in a single study session. It's easy to forget that the text we have in our hands as students was built over years (perhaps decades) of research and editing by the true experts and trailblazers of the time. At the same time, never truly doubt the fact that you can learn what is in your class or your textbook. Not everyone will follow the same path when it comes to learning the details that are contained in a CS education. If you train yourself to doubt your abilities, then everything you try to learn will become more difficult, subconsciously.

* When you are in the position of deciding on your first job offer, certainly weigh the financial options, but do not forget about the impact of having to move or find new community. This is absolutely different for everyone, which is why I feel it is important for everyone to take the time to consider it. I would recommend trying to move away from your University town for your internship(s) and see if you like being in a new place, possibly away from family and friends. I moved 300 miles for my 8-month internship and explored a new city. I ended up making a ton of friends, but I was also single and had the ability to pick up and move whenever I wanted to. I ended up moving back to this city for my full-time offer with a different company. In my last year of undergrad, however, I started dating the woman I will be marrying next year who is still in her last year of professional school. Distance is not easy, and your job offers might put distance between you and your family. Take the time to consider what that means for you personally. Would I have done things differently? Maybe, if I had thought more about what the worth of my salary/benefits was as a new grad compared to my family life."

So I am an Aspiring SE, working on my last internship before being done with my degree. At my workplace I am working on a new and Big feature, after about  1.5 to 2 months of working alone on my branch, I asked if I could create a PR, in a mirror of the Dev branch, because while the feature is not ready to be shipped, I was worrying about the huge technical debt I had by that point. My team agreed with me and I created the PR. 

During the code review, a Co-worker and one of the senior Dev asked some questions, and because I did not understand them well, I decided to send them a private message seeking more context. And we had a conversation about that. after that point was cleared, I went through the code review again and I saw They raised some concerns about IntelliJ reporting some come duplication. So still in private message I tried to explain to them by an example why it was happening, just to be met by them saying : 'Don't be mad at me ...' I proceeded to apologize and  tell them I was not mad but I was just seeking their point of view on the situation.

On the spot I thought none of it, but the more time passes the more I feel some sort of unease within myself., I know that it might not be usual to take PR conversations to private messages. But I am confused on what I did wrong.  I would really some opinions on this please.

dym68p,3,2019-11-19,MBA Dispute,AccountantNotEditor,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dym68p/mba_dispute/,"Posted this in another sub and got no attention so hoping to get some input here.

Hey guys and gals,

I had posted earlier about a recent discovery I made about never receiving my MBA as I had previously thought I had (long story, details not relevant) and how I only just discovered this now as I have initiated a background check for a new job offer. I was able to determine that the cause for never receiving the degree was due to my internship, worth 6 credits, never having been applied to my credit count, and so it shows as being 6 credits shy of completed.

The issue is that I mistakenly, and having believed at the time I had the degree, listed it on my resume when I applied for this job. Upon going through the verification process, I updated my resume to no longer show the degree having been received, mostly in hopes to not set off any red flags for the third party background checking company, but the problem still remains that throughout the hiring process, I had operated under the belief I had the degree. Now that I have received the offer conditional on a background check, I worry about having the offer rescinded. I have already initiated the background check, and so even though I am going through the process of getting those final 6 credits from my internship recognized, that process will be far too lengthy to have the issue rectified by the time the background check is conducted with the university. My question then is in regards as to how to move forward. As I see it, I have two options: I can inform my recruiter of the issue and run the risk of having the offer rescinded for misrepresenting myself through the hiring process, or I can hope that when I updated my resume information when verifying the information to be correct and accurate that the third party agency does not raise any red flags. I should note, the job does not require an MBA, nor does one help in getting the job, as the job is in public accounting where the only big boost would be from having the necessary credits for my CPA, which I have regardless.

I‚Äôm torn as to what the proper choice would be, or rather, which option would leave me with the greatest likelihood of not running into issues that may result in my offer being rescinded. One way or another, I will be moving forward in order to receive the credits and degree, but, again, that‚Äôs a longer term item, and for now, I worry about this opportunity. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

dympc4,2,2019-11-19,Re-admission into the College of Engineering (ME)Advice,michimoto,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/dympc4/readmission_into_the_college_of_engineering/,"Hi Everyone,

\*Please bear with me as this will be a somewhat long post as I need to give you guys the right background and points so hopefully you guys can shed some light on my situation\*

Starting from the top, I was admitted into the College of Engineering(CoE) for mechanical engineering in 2015. My first year went by alright as I finished my introductory CAD class(3.2), Calc 1(2.2). and Chemistry and visual basic programming class(3.4). Things started getting rusty in the beginning of my third year when I  had to retake my circuits course two times in which I finally got a 3.4 in. I also finished my two physics classes with 2.3's, finished Calc 2 and 3 with 2.5's by this time. The real problem began when I had to take the first thermodynamics course. A course that should have came naturally to me was the one I ended up having so much trouble with. Thinking back on it, it was so doable and would have saved me this whole situation if I was just so much more mature, diligent, and responsible. Another factor was that I for some reason loaded my schedule up alongside the thermodynamics course I should have had had my focus and priority on. Alot of my out of class time was used for the workplace and I should've known better that I'm working for experience and $, yes, but ultimately to pass my classes. Unfortunately, my school has a retake limit of 3 attempts per course and I couldn't come up with a passing grade all three times for thermodynamics. Due to this, I had to submit a petition to retake the course for a 4th time but it was denied (expected) since I wasn't dealing with a serious extenuating circumstance.

My last semester in the CoE was the fall of 2018 and this was my schedule:

Vector Mechanics(F)

Mechanics of Materials(C)

Biology(B-)

Thermodynamics(D)

I kick myself everyday thinking about all the time and money I worked for to essentially be wasted due to my ego being sky high thinking that I would be ok ""if i just got this much to pass"" or ""ill do ok when I see the exam question."" This was not the case and I feel even worse knowing that I have the potential to come up with the grades I needed to not only pass but do good. By the semester I was dismissed for the CoE, my degree progress was at a solid 80% and my GPA was a 2.5.

Since the Fall of 2018, I continued working at my manufacturing internship until May of 2019. During the span of January to May, I was not taking any classes as I was essentially stunned that I let this happen to me and that no other major was of significant interest to me. Financially, I didn't want to jump into something I didn't have a plan for, so I played it safe.

Fast forward to now, I began my second engineering internship in April 2019 working in the design division for motors and thermal management(pumps, electric climate compressors, cooling fan modules, etc) I love every second of it and I have learned so much that I don't think a class would be able to teach me all that I have learned. I've grown my CAD and problem solving skills exponentially. 

I know in my mind that I will finish this major however I have to achieve it, but my major goal right now is to be re-admitted \*conditionally\* to my original CoE.  I have been working on a petition for readmission into the school for the summer of 2020. Right now, i'm taking a MATLAB course at another university nearby. The MATLAB course is a prerequisite for the thermodynamics course there. My plan is to finish the MATLAB course i'm taking now, take thermodynamics  in winter and do my absolute best in it with the plan of transferring it back to my original school. I'm hopeful that the committee on academic standing see's my academic maturity I've displayed for those two classes, and considers my time away as a factor that allowed me to set my mind straight and just finish off the last 20% left of my degree. 

I've had a meeting with my engineering academic adviser once or twice a month since January to get feedback on my petition and discuss ways that will increase my chances of conditional acceptance back into the program. They noted that I've been the most persistent they've seen in terms of trying to do everything to get one last chance at displaying the student I really am. I've also reached out to my two mangers at my internships and  asked if they'd be willing to write a letter of recommendation for me and they're more than willing. At this point, i'm gathering all supporting points in my case to show the committee that I've been doing everything in my ability for this once chance. I've even recorded a 10 minute video of myself explaining myself and my achievements/things I've worked on since my last semester. I plan to submit my petition on January 1st, 2020

I've owned up to my mistake of not being able to give my 100% at the courses I've taken and my transcript reflects that. I know that I have received substandard grades in courses critical for mechanical engineering academia but I know that this won't happen again...how you ask? I know after this situation that getting my degree will take +4 years. For that, I have no reason to rush, but to take my time and really absorb what i'm sitting in class for. Meeting with an adviser throughout the semester, meeting my professor more often are all things I should've done BEFORE I knew things weren't going good. I'd essentially set up my schedule based on what the committee tells me to take(assuming I get back in).

Misc points:

\-I'm not ""dismissed"" from my school, i'm just not allowed to pursue any engineering other than comp sci or industrial engineering

\-I've been working retail since 2016 and started my manufacturing internship in December 2017. I just started my design internship in April of 2019 and both internships were year long so I've had the ability to work and go to school, especially since they're both in close proximity to each-other.

\-My transcript will obviously show that I've had problems in certain courses, but throughout my college career, but I've gotten past them(other than thermo) Please see this scholarly article(simple read) that I plan to send to the committee as well  [https://www.nacadajournal.org/doi/pdf/10.12930/0271-9517-14.1.8](https://www.nacadajournal.org/doi/pdf/10.12930/0271-9517-14.1.8) 

\-I'm 22 turning 23 next year so time is running out for financial aid

If anyone has been in this situation and has gotten back into their school of engineering, please let me know of anything that may have helped your situation. I've never wanted something as much as this chance and I kick myself for blowing up my college career like this.(I wish you guys could see the person I am and you'd understand how much this means to me).  I'm really hoping this works for me and could use any advice that may help me. 

As always, if any additional information is needed, please let me know and I will elaborate on anything needed.

if you stuck through this whole post, thank you so much and I wish you success in all your endeavours."

I know I don't have a lot of on the job experience, but I don't want to under value myself either. its full time but pays 40K which is roughly $19 an hour. 

I fell the pay is low based on the area I am in  and the job description. I have started to apply to more intermediate roles here at this University and just in general. So I really don't know what i can get once i really start applying, because I haven't been aggressively applying to upper roles. Which I guess is silly on my part. I am 33 by the way. 

So my question is do I stay where i am at and gain a bit more experience and try to find a higher paying job or accept this one, if offered. I just know at 40K from day 1. I will be applying to other jobs And considering looking to go elsewhere. or am I looking at this incorrectly?"

dyoixg,12,2019-11-19,"After months of planning, research, and hard work, I am leaving the corporate world and starting my own business. Here is my story.",HelloWorld5609,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/dyoixg/after_months_of_planning_research_and_hard_work_i/,"My [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/dy77o5/its_officially_happening_after_several_months_of/) was removed from r/smallbusiness because ""it wasn't a question"". So I thought posting here would be the next best thing. Original post below.

**TL;DR:** Despite an easy, well-paying career, I was miserable at work. I was lost and felt broken. I was looking for something different, but I didn't know what. With some help, I bought a franchise run by some great people.

I had been at my cushy corporate job for almost 12 years. During that time, I've pretty much been in the same role. Sure, I've had various title changes, and pay increases here and there, but for the most part, the day-to-day has been the same since the beginning.

I wanted to move up the ladder, believe me, I tried, but for one reason or another, it just never seemed to work out. There was always an insurmountable obstacle in my way. The biggest one was the company itself, it was just too damn small, and there was nowhere to go unless the company grew. But, despite constantly maintaining the same headcount, give or take a few here and there, the company never grew as anyone had hoped.

It's not that I hated my job, I was actually quite good at what I did. But I started having this feeling a few years ago that I could be doing so much more with my time and effort. I hated having to ask if it was OK to take my kids to the doctor, constantly feeling like I am not being a ""team player"", or feel like someone is disappointed in me because I decided to take a vacation (my boss rarely ever took a vacation). Also, I didn't like not having a voice. Despite working for my current company for over 12 years, I still feel like I had no voice. There are a few people that make the decisions, and that's it. Obviously, it is their right to do so, but I feel like I should have had some input after 12 years. My boss and I are separated by almost 30 years in age, so that may have something to do with it. But still, I was sick and tired of the company making dumb decisions without my knowledge or input.

So, I did what most people would do. I buffed up my resume &amp; Linkedin profile and started looking for something else, hopefully, something better. I had several interviews, but nothing panned out. I had only been interviewing for a couple of months, but I felt as though it was going really well, considering how picky I was being (benefit of not ""needing"" a job). But then my boss offered me a very generous raise (I had been due for a raise for almost 3 years) so I eased up on the job search and temporarily went back to being content.

I felt great for a couple of weeks, then the feeling of dread returned. It wasn't going away. The extra money was nice, but it didn't fix the problem. At some point it hit me, it was kinda strange, it was like a switch being flipped. I realized that I was completely unfulfilled with what I was doing. No satisfaction, just boring, joyless work. I was doing good work, I was really good at my job, and the job was easy to boot (easy to me anyway). But there was this massive void, something that I couldn't quite describe. I'll admit it, I was completely lost. I didn't know what to do. If I left this job for something else, I will likely work in the same type of environment, doing something similar for someone else that I may or may not like. I had some decent business ideas, but I didn't think I had the courage, nor the capital to start a business, so I kinda wrote that idea off.

Miserable, and completely broken, I persisted, because I had to (family to support). I guess I'll just put myself into that statistic of Americans that hate going to work every day. I never thought my day-to-day job could make me so miserable, but it did. Unfortunately, I brought some of that negativity home with me as well. I was constantly pissed off and short-tempered. Not at all who I wanted to be. Something had to give.

In desperation mode, I started contacting career coaches. They were all expensive, and I was worried the investment wasn't going to be worth it. My resume and LinkedIn weren't the problems (they offered to ""fix"" them for me), it was my career that was broken. I needed a new career. But, how does one just go out and get a new career?

&gt;""Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on *jobbies*?

That's the kinda frustration I felt. Then, something completely unexpected happened. I was contacted by an ""alternative career coach"". He charged no direct fees for his services, but he was offering perspectives that I never thought about. So I figured it was worth a shot. I am naturally a very skeptical person, so I figured there had to be a catch. Nobody does anything for free. So we meet, and we get to talking about my goals and situation, and he thinks that he can probably help. So he asks me to complete a DISC personality test to determine my skills, abilities, and personality type. So I do, and I fit the profile for what he is looking for, and his services fit for what I never knew I was looking for.

Turns out, he is an alternative career coach/franchise broker (they get a percentage of your franchise fee if you buy the franchise). They find folks like me and help us find a franchise that might be of interest. They also help guide you through the process and kinda function as your support team. I know that many people scoff at the notion of buying into a franchise, I was one of them. ""It's basically buying yourself a job/career"" I have seen that posted around üì∑[r/entrepreneur](https://www.reddit.com/r/entrepreneur/) many times. Franchise ownership was never even a remote possibility when I started this process. I didn't want to own a Subway, or a Wendys (for some reason fast food is always the first thing that comes to mind when I think franchise). I wanted to have my own idea, and build my business from the ground up, blah blah blah. The entrepreneur's dream. The word franchise felt dirty (to my stupid uninformed mind) and offputting, I had little hope of this actually meaning anything. But I shrugged off that feeling and decided to give it a real chance before I jumped to any conclusions. Again, it's not costing me anything, so it's worth a shot.

He sets me up with calls from multiple franchisors that fit my interests. They all go well, but one really resonates with me. It checks off all of my boxes. Great income potential, expandability, low (ish) start-up capital requirements, no B&amp;M overhead, great territory, flexible schedule/work from home, and an industry that I am familiar with and believe in. The icing on the cake was the franchisor. The people are fantastic, their support system is world-class, and they invest a lot of time, money, and effort into getting the business running smoothly and profitable. They aren't in it for the initial franchise fees, they want to make a successful product that earns them royalties and intern makes me money, makes sense. Their people are truly the ones that sealed the deal, I believe in them and they believe in me.

Together, the franchisor and I went through a mutual vetting process. We needed to make sure we are right for each other. Just because you want a franchise, doesn't mean you get it. It has to be ""awarded"", there are a lot of boxes that needed to be checked off before you can be awarded a franchise. You need to fit their profile, you need access to capital, and some have net worth requirements. After talking with numerous franchisees, I decided that it was time to move forward. Luckily, I met all their requirements, so I drove out to their HQ and we both decided to move forward. We decided on a training date (December) and sealed the deal shortly thereafter.

It also took a lot of convincing of my wife to let me leave my cushy, predictable, steady paying corporate job to pursue this opportunity. Luckily she believes in me and is willing to make the necessary sacrifices to make the most out of this opportunity. There will certainly be an adjustment period for both of us.

Several things attracted me to buying a franchise as my first foray into the world of business ownership. When compared to starting my own business from the ground up, there is a lot less risk in buying a proven franchise system, especially one with such great people behind it. A lot of the heavy lifting has already been done for you. I don't need to come up with my own processes and hope something works. I don't need to make a bunch of mistakes trying to market a new brand/product in my local area. I don't need to figure out a good CRM that does everything I need it to. I don't need to build a new website from the ground up. Yes, I will need to learn about all these things in great detail, and determine how to best use them, but I don't need to waste any of my startup capital figuring these things out either. In a few years. if all goes well with this endeavor, I figure that's when I can build something of my own.

Funding a business was a very lengthy and complicated ordeal, if you don't already have the startup capital, get ready to do A TON of work to get funding. Buying a proven franchise and using a broker helps, but it is still a whole bunch of work. I'd compare it to getting 2 or 3 new mortgages, there is so much paperwork and so many documents to sign. It's all-consuming, but such a relief when it is over. Let me know if you want to know more.

Ever since I signed my franchise agreement, it's been hard to focus on anything else. I've been in hardcore learning mode for the past few months. But it hasn't seemed like work yet, it's been really fun. Also during this time, I've had to work for my current job. Which is kinda like every day being the last day at school, you can't wait till it's over, but you gotta keep going back. It's excruciating having to switch focus on a daily basis.

One of the best days I've had in a long time is when I handed in my resignation. I was nervous, but I had fantasized about that day for years. It went very well, and my boss (company owner) understood. He was happy I was taking the leap. He shook my hand and wished me well.

I leave for training right after Thanksgiving (3 straight weeks, on top of everything I've already done), and I couldn't be more excited. I finally feel like I am in a good place with good people, and in the right place at the right time. I am finally in the driver's seat, and in full control of my future. I think it's going to be the ultimate test, it's all on me to make this work. I envision that the next few years are going to be pretty rough. Long hours, lots of mistakes, and fluctuating income. But I also think that it's going to be incredibly rewarding to watch my business grow and reap the rewards of my hard work. Luckily I have an incredible support system to fall back on if things start to get shaky. But I'll never have to say ""what if"" ever again. Cause I'm doing it.

Based on feedback for my post on r/smallbusiness: Just to be clear, I am a small business owner sharing a story, I promise you it's not an MLM, nor some complicated ploy to make a buck. I'm not a broker, I'm not selling anything, and I don't want your business. But there are a lot of people that have very little knowledge of franchise ownership, so I thought I would shed some light on the subject. It's certainly not for everyone, but it's worth a look if you are looking for something different."

In all 3 jobs, I have always had little to nothing to do and it's starting to drive me crazy.  All the companies I have worked with were relatively small. Right now, I only support 35 users. One slow day here or there is one thing. But, over my career, I would say 70-80% of my time is spent doing nothing. On slow days I have maybe 20-40 minutes of actual work to do over an 8 hour shift. If it is busy with projects, I might commit 3-4 hours to actual work. My boss is retiring in 4 years and wants to set me up to take over his role (Chief Information Security Officer) but he has a lot of downtime too so I don't really want to take that route. I'm seriously considering finding a new job but I don't want to get in there and find I am sitting on my hands all day. Before I got into IT, I worked at a factory as a window assembler. I LOVED it! Work as hard as you want for as long as you want and never run out of work. Only problem was it was minimum wage or I would still be there. What sort of IT jobs have you all done where you are busy all the time? Ideally physically busy; racking servers, running cables, wiring patch panels, etc. I've interviewed at a few managed services companies for that kind of work but they can't come close to what I make at the bank.

dypeao,5,2019-11-19,I'm at a crossroads here. What do I do?,Sensualities,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dypeao/im_at_a_crossroads_here_what_do_i_do/,"So I attended a CC to get my Gen-Eds done, and turns out that because my university is so small, it's going to take me another 3 (maybe 3.5) years to get a CS degree. And it's also going to take me about 1.5 years (maybe 2) to get an internship because my college internship leader says I need to take a certain class before I can apply for internships. 

So basically it looks like for the remainder of my 3-3.5 years ill be taking 3 classes for about 6 semesters due to pre-reqs and courses not being offered year-round. I was really hoping for an internship by spring or maybe summer of 2021, but I don't think that is going to happen. 

What do I do? I was thinking of maybe doing a coding bootcamp, but the more I read the more I get this gut-feeling that they aren't really worth it. Should I just go down my own path and try and take courses like data camp, udemy, etc etc and try and create something cool and land an internship on my own while I attend school and get an outside internship early?

I'm not really sure what to do here but I KNOW I need to do something, and have a plan. 

For backstory: My college teaches java, I am about to finish the intro to programming class now, with one CS course and one math course next semester and then two CS courses in fall of 2020. So as you can tell I have PLENTY of free time."

I have one internship at a startup as a general engineer, some of my roles included: 

‚óè Tested middleware updates on IOT device in order to optimize software workflow  
‚óè Wrote batch scripts for client to maximize local database update efficiency  
‚óè Wrote Linux bash scripts for Build Root Flavor embedded device to fetch memory usage  
‚óè Maintained local SQLite database for client, and wrote scripts to automate updates  
‚óè Drafted workflow for Azure microservice using CosmosDB, ServiceBus Queue, and IOTHub  
bindings  
‚óè Built and designed front end desktop applications using Python Tkinter GUI library

After this semester is over, I am planning on building a fully functional, end to end web scraper as my side project. 

As experienced Data Engineers, does my resume look good for a data engineer? What experience, skills, certs, could be helpful? I am searching for a job in Chicago.

Thanks!!!!"
dypuru,5,2019-11-19,How to not tie my self worth to my GPA?,InauspiciousArtifact,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/dypuru/how_to_not_tie_my_self_worth_to_my_gpa/,"I'm a business major at a university with a pretty good business school, and lately I'm not feeling great about myself. I landed a great internship for next summer recently, but the odd thing is that instead of relaxing about how much I care about my GPA, I've started to care too much about it. My GPA is pretty good, and I'm not worried about it affecting my career prospects now that I've landed a good internship. However, I'm now worrying about it for a different reason. It's a very commonly accepted idea, at least at my school, that most business classes are a joke, and to an extent, they are, at least with respect to engineering and computer science courses. Thus, I now feel like I have to get A's, because if I can't even get A's in business classes, what does that say about my intelligence compared to my peers'? I know that's not a healthy way of thinking, but I can't stop looking at it that way. I'd sure appreciate any tips to help rationalize my situation better.

Thanks guys."

Hopefully everyone is excited for the upcoming break as classes begin to break down into chaos before finals week.

I am excited to announce an exciting internship opportunity for all of my fellow Triton Data and Computer Scientists who have previous experience with machine learning.

We are a small team currently doing research in partnership with Columbia University on an exciting project that we hope to speak more publicly on later down the line.

Our ideal candidate is someone who has experience with classification, regression, feature engineering, and/or high frequency time series data collected over small periods of time. The samples we work with consist of around 200 points of data per second, with each sample spanning less than five minutes with a further focus on smaller intervals ranging from 5 to 30 seconds at the same frequency.

We hope to find a candidate that is experienced in Python and has a firm grasp of SciKit Learn (or similar libraries that can be used to deal with the aforementioned time series data) as well as a general understanding of, and basic experience with, a machine learning pipeline.

Candidates with experience in the following will be given special consideration:

* Creating and applying computer vision algorithms to pre-recorded video
* Neural Networking
* Eye tracking (Specifically with Pupil Labs)

Candidates must be able to commit at least 20 hours a week and be able to work remotely with occasional face-to-face meetings. All candidates must also have their own equipment capable of running heavy calculations.

In order to make all of this a little bit more interesting, any suitable candidates that are chosen and then carry out their job to satisfactory standards could be offered more long-term paid positions down the line as our project begins to pick up steam and support.

For further information, please feel free to PM me with a little bit about yourself and your background.

If you intend to apply immediately please have your CV and project history prepared and ready to present.

Finish the year off strong, Tritons!"
dyr7tu,0,2019-11-19,Best recruitment firms for FANGs + Unicorns? (Data Analyst),[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dyr7tu/best_recruitment_firms_for_fangs_unicorns_data/,"I have 3 years exp. at a big bank (99% of American adults would recognize) working as a Data Analyst, although some of my responsibilities would also fit the profile of a Data Engineer as well. Previously, I had an internship working with Deep Learning / ML stuff. So I think I have a fairly strong resume for this point in my career sans attending a prestigious college. 

Finance has gotten boring and i want to live somewhere with nice weather, so I‚Äôve set a goal for myself of landing a job in the Bay Area. 

But thus far I‚Äôve found the linkedIn / Monster / indeed postings to be a black hole for my resume. I would expect to have a solid advantage over new grads considering my experience &amp; credentials but nothing has came up so far. 

Does anyone have suggestions on recruiting firms with a solid track record of placing candidates into FANGs and Unicorns? 

Triplebyte doesn‚Äôt make much sense for somebody with my particular skill set. I can do alright on Leetcode / Hackerrank tests but at the end of the day I‚Äôm not a SWE and have no intention of working as one. I don‚Äôt think I have the knowledge of a FANG data scientist either, basically going for Data Analyst or Data Engineer roles. 

Any insights would be appreciated."

They interviewed me for an entry level part time position initially that I forgot I had applied for (I applied for about 4 different jobs there).  When I realized it was for the part time job and not a full time job which I had applied for more recently I was a bit bummed out.  They were hesitant to offer full time as the last real related work experience i had was an internship back in 2001.  I did my best to reassure them that I knew my stuff, that I was always looking to learn and open to doing anything they needed me to.  I talked about my Poweredge R710 server that i have ESXi 6.7 on, the end of life cisco firewall I was using to learn cisco CLI commands, and my years and years of enthusiast PC building.

The longer the interview went on the more I could tell they liked me.  I told them that I can understand the hesitation in hiring someone lacking the demonstrated work history, and asked if they would be willing to let me come in and fix some things for them (It was a desktop support technician role).  They said it's not normally something they do for a part time role and mentioned they weren't sure they would have the time to set up a break/fix set up for me.  


I left the interview feeling a bit down about it not being for a full time position but entertained the idea of taking it on part time.  I was in the middle of texting my wife when I got home about feeling down about it, and it was then that they called me back asking me if I'd come in an fix a couple things that they set up the next day.  I gladly said yes, spent the night brushing up on anything I thought they might throw at me that I may not be ready for.  So I packed my tool bag, and went in the next morning, after getting over the stress of on the spot in a set up i was unfamiliar with, I crushed it.  I fixed both the PC's they had set out, i thanked them for giving me the chance to show what I can do and they told me I did great!  


I got the job offer for full time today, and start in 2 weeks.  Just figured I would share.  If you aren't getting call backs on full time positions but know your stuff, consider applying for a part time role.

They said they were really impressed that I showed up with my own tools ready to work, I have Jeremy Chioara to thank for that one, his video on CBTnuggets on what your tool bag should consist of really helped me land this job.  


For those interested i had the following in my bag,

\-Magnetic screwdriver with changeable bits

\-Non magnetic Philips head

\-RJ45 Pass through connectors

\-Standard RJ11/RJ45 crimp and stripper tool

\-RJ45 Pass through crimper

\- 10 foot patch cable

\- Loop back plug

\- about 10 feet of cat 5e

\- DB9 to Console Rollover cable

\- USB to Console Rollover cable

\- Strain relief boots for RJ45 connectors

\- Cable tester.

I'm planning to stay in the area of my school and it's the state capitol.I've had some office assistant experience at school, did a research summer in political science, and last summer I had an internship at a local borough's Parks and Recreation department. I'd ideally want to work in urban planning, parks and rec, or policy. So far I've probably applied to 15ish jobs and I've had 3 interviews and another one this week. Two of the interviews were at urban planning consulting firms, and they seemed to go really well and they said they were impressed, but chose to go with someone else. The other interview was for city gov but was more of a secretary job in parks amd rec, but I didn't like the office vibe and I didn't get an offer anyways. This week I have an in person interview (already had a phone interview) with a non profit for a policy job that I really hope to get. But I'm just discouraged. These companies all seemed to like me but didn't make an offer. I'm just worried that this is going to keep happening. After I graduate I have 6 months before I need to start paying my loans.

dysox4,7,2019-11-19,Should I Ask For A New Laptop?,AsleepConcert3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dysox4/should_i_ask_for_a_new_laptop/,"Hey all, 

So some context: I started as an intern at my company and was given a crappy laptop they give to HR people. My manager noticed this on the first day and was able to find an oldish dev machine and hooked me up with that. Only problem is it was a Windows machine but it at least had decent specs. 

I am not a Windows dev and didn't want to spend a week trying to learn Windows development stuff, so I setup a virtualbox Ubuntu instance (Ubuntu is my main OS) and use that. We're a Java shop and run everything in aws linux instances so this made getting setup with our Java projects easy. I also use a bunch of custom shell scripts for my daily workflow like making copies of production databases, setting up docker instances, and all sorts of other things I do repeatedly. 

This virtualbox worked fine for a while but for whatever reason it's been really slow lately

Today we had production issues reported during a big meeting and I was the only one that brought my laptop. It took me 30 minutes just to get intellij open and everything setup before they gave up on my machine and used someone else's. Then later after the meeting I wanted to stay after and help my dev lead with the task, but again I couldn't even navigate my ide after multiple restarts 

I have a few options

Spend a week learning Windows development and stop using the VM. This would take a week out of my development time at least. Between having to Port my scripts to powershell, figure out some alternatives for some linux/Mac only things, it would be a pain

Get IT to install Ubuntu (not gonna happen, they only support Windows and apple and we can't use our personal devices anymore for work)

Get a mac - every dev when they're hired gets a choice of Mac or Windows, but I was an intern so I got what they could find. Getting a Mac would allow me to use all my dev tools natively, all my scripts would Port over, and there's only a few minimal things I would have to work around or learn. 

So should I ask for a new laptop? How can I present this to my manager?"

Does my location actually affect my applications that much, and if it does, should I lie about it and just put a random SV address ?

I have made it to the technical round for a sysadmin role right before I graduate college. What would be the best way to prepare for this?

 I've worked helpdesk for 2 years while I finished my degree but focused most of my efforts on cyber security and pen-testing. I've gotten an entry level certification via Security+ but don't have an extreme amount of exposure to general sysadmin work. Having spent a year as an IT intern there's only so much they'd let me do alone without being assisted by the MSP or more senior staff. 

Any input is appreciated!"

* Optimization of graph chart drawing, i.e., given a graph, draw it in the most efficient and aesthetic way possible ‚Äî Javascript/Typescript
   * Pros:
      * Involves a lot of math and algorithmic research.
      * Will make me a better JavaScript developer, with JS being my primary programming tool.
   * Cons:
      * The project doesn't seem to be very impactful/meaningful, in my mind it's just ""drawing beautiful graphs"".
* A project connected to Deep Learning and Computer Vision ‚Äî C++
   * Pros:
      * Involves a lot of math and research.
      * The topic is much closer to my interests, as my career goals are in EE/CS research (not particularly decided)
      * Learning C++ will be a great tool for me if I choose to pursue an EE career (I'm an EE 2nd year student)
   * Cons:
      * None that I can think of

**Now, the problem is:** I have already received the offer from the first project, *and my offer deadline is in one hour.* On the other hand, I haven't received an update yet from the second team (obviously it's my top choice). I have informed my HR, she contacted the second project manager multiple times, but no update yet.

Should I just accept the first offer or risk and wait for the second?"
dytqag,0,2019-11-19,Am I a loser?,shibebear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dytqag/am_i_a_loser/,"Here I am, a senior computer scientist who has never had the chance to intern anywhere. In the past year, I have applied to over 50 companies and had a dozen of phone/Skype interviews already. I usually do well in the pre-screening coding challenges and usually get to the second interview rounds. Yet, I have had only two final-round interviews with no offer. I have become discouraged due to the competition in CS out there. To be honest, due to personal circumstances I completed my junior undergrad at a community college after my 26 birthday and then transferred to a 4-year school for the remaining of the major (don't want to say name but is among the top-5-ranked engineering schools in the USA). Certainly the ""prestige"" of my school has helped me to land interviews at the top 10 tech companies, but I have the feeling that recruiters are biased in the sense that they expect extremely superior solving skills and unbeatable performance from students attending top schools. One time I applied to a relative small company and the recruiter even said, ""what makes a student from your school to be even to be even interested in this company."" Such statement made feel a bit uncomfortable and yet I was not offered anything. I consider myself to have decent coding skills, but I have to say that even though I am fluent in English I do have accent and I belong to a historically underrepresented minority group in tech. Graduation will happen in a year and I still have the chance to get an internship for next summer but I have the feeling it is too late for me.

TL:DR: What would you recommend to a senior student who has never had an internship to get one."

I‚Äôm a new aspiring computer science student that dipped his feet too late into the game. I am currently a Sophomore in a well known liberal arts school in NYC and I will be changing my major to computer science this coming spring semester. When looking at all my peers and friends in computer science, many of them are involved in internships already or looking for one in the summer. Myself however, does not fully have a deep understanding of a programming language yet to involve myself with a job. But I feel like by next summer, I‚Äôm pretty confident I can work to perfect python, both in class and alone.

As a new computer science transfer student, is there anything I could do right now to help catch up with internships and what not? 

Thanks!"

I've done all my assignments to the best of my ability, tried to maintain all my friendships, stay relatively healthy, get internships, create good projects to put in my reel, etc.

But now, Murphy's Law apparently wants to become a law of nature in my life. 

First, I have two videos (one that has been extended by weeks now) that have been planned out and scheduled, and I sent out emails to try and get actors. I don't even have a quarter of the people I need, and this is due next week.

I've applied for an internship and a job for this coming winter, but I have yet to get even a simple update of whether I was accepted or not.

My grandmother has left the hospital she was in for a few days, but now she's in therapy and reaching that point in her life where her mind's getting foggy and she's slowly running out of time.

My right lung is beginning to feel dull pain whenever I breathe deeply, even though I've done nothing forceful this entire week, the weather has been fine, I've been taking care of myself, etc., and I have no Healthcare if anything were to happen.

The number of close friends I have is slowly decreasing due to really stupid reasons in their own lives.

And what makes this all so aggravating is that I have no control over any of this.

I'm not one to be a massive control freak; I control as much as I can while acknowledging the fact that life is chaotic and unpredictable. But this amount of chaos feels worse than ever before, and I'm not having it. I've done everything in my power to work around these obstacles, to find some sort of a solution, to work past this shit, but I've reached a point where that isn't possible anymore. I've reached a wall too high to climb, and it's not even of my own doing. This isn't something I caused, or anybody tried to unleash upon me; this is just Life, Fate, or whatever else you want to call it just saying a big old ""Fuck You"" for no reason. And I'm left asking myself: Why now? What did I do to deserve this? And how can I fix this? But not a single answer, not from me, not from anyone I've talked to about this. Everything I've worked for is going to shit, and I can't do anything about it."

I did an internship last summer and was lucky enough to get a return offer. Since I've started I've only been assigned work that is normally assigned to our QA and dev-ops guys, which has left me kind of puzzled. I've brought it up with my manager a few times and he basically told me that the QA/dev-ops teams are a bit undermanned so he's been routing some of their work to me. I figured that was reasonable enough and that I would eventually get to do dev work once things cool down. 


I'm about six months in and I was just wrapping up one of the larger dev-ops projects I was assigned, hoping to touch code within the next week, but today my manager called me in for a meeting. Apparently, one of the dev-ops guys (who was with the company for about 1.5 years) will be resigning, and I'm going to be the one who takes over his work. I'm pretty annoyed and unsure what to do, since I've already made it clear that I wanted to move on to dev work. I mean, it's the role I was hired for, this just feels like false advertising. I still have two months of my probation period left. Been dreading the thought, but after today's meeting, should I start looking for another job? Would it reflect poorly one me to other employers for leaving a company so quickly? Feels like I can never catch a break."
dywx2r,4,2019-11-19,May I ask how my experience looks for someone trying to find an entry-level embedded engineer position?,Morocco_Bama,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/dywx2r/may_i_ask_how_my_experience_looks_for_someone/,"I try not to spam subreddits with my ""what are my chances of X?"" posts, but I *definitely* have been experiencing imposter syndrome since graduating. 

My academic concentration was in embedded systems as an EE major but it never quite felt like I was ever *doing* embedded systems. Our program really only had an introductory embedded course and then the capstone, and both were taught by a professor who's philosophy was that students would learn better by figuring things out for themselves - so he never really taught us anything, he'd just hand us project specs and have us look things up. 

In the introductory course we used Arduino Uno and Mega and touch-display and essentially made an SPI. In our capstone we used Microchip PICs and MPLAB and did roughly the exact same thing, just different software and hardware - instead of direct TX/RX comm between the Uno and Mega, this time we had the PIC communicating with our PC via an RS-232.

Outside of those two classes, 90% of what my EE coursework was FPGA programming. A *ton* of SystemVerilog and ModelSim. I took some CS classes in computer architecture, data structures &amp; algorithms, classic AI. I know assembly and how to debug C code using GDB and viewing the assembly instructions and registers.

I did have an internship in college, but it was at a research lab and it was very machine learning-oriented. At the time I didn't know what I wanted to do with my future, I suppose. 

**TL;DR** I got a good theory-based education, and I'm a good programmer, but I'm insecure about my lack of hands-on experience. Does anyone have any advice on what actions I could take post-graduating to improve my chances finding a job? Any technologies / interfaces / projects I *must* try?

Thank you!"
dyys2x,0,2019-11-20,I Was Cheated Of $2k By A Local Tattoo Parlor. They Refuse To Give It Back When The Contract Was Null and Void.,Randiconforever22,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dyys2x/i_was_cheated_of_2k_by_a_local_tattoo_parlor_they/,"I‚Äôm located in South Dakota.
I wanted to be a tattoo artist, and I came to the logical conclusion that I should become an apprentice so that I could learn.
I knew it‚Äôd be a few years before I would become a full tattoo artist, if done correctly, and I thought so highly of the tattoo parlor at the time that I pushed back on moving away from this place.
Now I couldn‚Äôt move even if I wanted to.
Within two months, they managed to act so horribly and unprofessionally that I was driven away. I got physically nervous and sick from the thought of going back there, to which I called it all off over the phone.
They never gave me a call back, nor did they bother to give me any of my money back.
I understand that it would‚Äôve been fair if they took a portion of it because it was only two months, but the entire $2k? They could give me $500 back and I would be content (a little).
To anyone wondering about some of the things they did that lead me to call them unprofessional:


- the wife (an owner of the store, but not at all a tattoo artist) began to pick at my clothing. She wanted me to dress up and wear makeup and do my hair because she did.


-the wife didn‚Äôt allow me to sit the way I tended to sit, even when wearing shorts under my skirts. Why? Because it was unladylike, despite me not interacting with customers (I wasn‚Äôt told to. I was told to sit and try to trace letters)


-Wife mentioned she could see my ‚Äògoods‚Äô and that it was inappropriate. 


-Wife and Husband (true tattoo artist and owner of the shop) became irritated with me when I wasn‚Äôt able to stay the entire 8 hour day (this is also the reason it took me two weeks to find a new job, and therefore I lost a months worth of wages. I‚Äôm still struggling to catch back up).


-despite me signing the contract with the husband, I was typically taught by the wife. Later, they brought in a new artist and he began to teach me shadows and such. Think high school art class.


-At the end of my time there, my car overheated and I had to wait. It was an engine issue, and I had no clue when I‚Äôd be returning. When I called the Wife to let her know, she only demanded to know if I‚Äôd be back to the store.


-Told me to treat the internship as if I were being paid. 


-judged any life choice I was making (wanted to get a job at night, and the wife sneered and told me I needed to sleep, didn‚Äôt ?)


-the Husband, upon learning I owned and loved my cat, began making small comments about how all cats should be physically harmed.


-I continually overheard racist comments (‚Äúthere‚Äôs a store that opened for middle eastern people. It won‚Äôt last, rent is $3k on this street‚Äù ‚Äúyou never notice just how many Asian people there are here‚Äù ‚Äúthis Asian b**** put her groceries on my car-‚Äú)


-they brought in their 3 year old diabetic child into the store. He would regularly scream, cry, throw fits, and yell if he was peeing or taking a crap in front of customers. Husband eventually told Wife she needed to keep their child restrained.


-let me get a tattoo so they could let the other apprentice train using a different machine. It wasn‚Äôt a good tattoo (plenty of mistakes), and they didn‚Äôt give me any ointment to take care of it. The thing they put over my arm was likely put on too soon, because my blood basically got it to peel off immedietly after, and they didn‚Äôt replace it at all. 


-My tattoo got infected, and they used that as an example for a customer that was getting his first tattoo. Wife asked me, but while I said yes it was clear I wasn‚Äôt happy about it. She used me anyway.


-Grew cross with me because I have bad customer service skills (they found out why I got fired and it got worse basically. Wife would continually bring it up as if to show why she was right)


-When I gave a customer wrong information (thought husband was doing a tattoo, he wasn‚Äôt. Customer left), the wife became angry and chewed me out.


-Wife would constantly make degrading comments about me having worked in fast food, stating that it wasn‚Äôt hard to flip a burger.


-the Wife chewed me out until I cried because she was ‚Äòtrying to hint that I needed to vaccum‚Äô (she pulled the vaccum out and did a small piece of the carpet. THEN she told me to stop drawing and vaccum). When she noticed I was crying, she basically tried to compare us because ‚ÄòI cry when I get frustrated too‚Äô and then tried to hug me. I refused.


-told me I needed to already know what I was supposed to be doing, and that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be told what to do.(what brought this on was me making a schedule that would both allow me to work on different things they taught me and keep me going from one task to another, aka stimulating my mind)


-Husband told me that I needed to drop the style I was drawing in currently and that I only needed to try and draw realistic 24/7 or I‚Äôd never get anywhere. 


-constantly called my art anime


-on my last day in the store, the Husband sat on the desk I was working on and basically gave me a lecture because he overheard me talking with his 13 year old stepdaughter.


-told me during that lecture that I couldn‚Äôt tell her about gay people because it might ‚Äòinfluence her sexuality‚Äô. Her mom is bisexual. (Also the only reason gay people came up was because the daughter was flipping through my sketchbook. Many of my characters are LGBT +)


-accused me of talking about sex with her (I‚Äôm not a dumbass, I most certainly wasn‚Äôt, what brought this on was the daughter seeing the word ‚Äòporn‚Äô on my phone. I turned my phone away and changed the screen. It was a conversation between me and my friend, who is also 18. )


Most importantly:
-I was told that no one likes me at that store. That I talk too much, and how I‚Äôm rude all the time.

Due to the wording of the contract, which states that by the end of my apprenticeship, I would have paid $2.5k, I have been apprehensive of going after them in small claims. They‚Äôre also older, and many customers would likely vouche for them due to their ability to mask who they really are in view of the customers.
I cannot have a lawyer either, I‚Äôm already struggling to make my bills, what with my poorly-paying job. 
What steps should I take from here? 
Is there even a case I can even remotely win, or should I just take a hard hit?
If anyone needs me to, I‚Äôll be happy to put my contracts I signed with the tattoo parlor in the comments, or put it here."
dyzf1b,2,2019-11-20,Slack Internship?,csthrowaway10101011,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dyzf1b/slack_internship/,"I was fortunate to receive an offer from Slack for their swe internship. Currently, it is my only offer and they gave me a deadline of until Friday to accept the offer without extension. I'm still waiting to hear back from 2 other companies (Flatiron Health, Roblox) but I won't hear back within the deadline. 

Since I'm currently a junior, this will be my last internship before I graduate so I'm looking for an internship with good prospects for a return offer for full-time or one that would improve my chances with getting interviews for new grad roles with Big N.

The reason I'm having difficulty with making a decision is because though the work environment and culture seemed   
 great based off those I spoke to and the TC and benefits were pretty high, I'm worried that Slack's current outlook with respect to their harsh competition (with Microsoft teams) will make career prospects unpredictable. 

I'm wondering if I could get any input on my situation and whether I am worrying for nothing since it's just for an internship. Thanks!"

Everyone at those places was pretty normal and relaxed.

I had another part time job a little later, and the manager would scream at me and everyone for no reason. The second you walked in the door, she was already blood-curdling screaming at someone and came out to scream at everyone else. I didn't stay there too long.

My first full time job was ok, but I didn't feel too respected, and a colleague I had to work alongside turned extremely nasty on me. I politely reported the behavior to the boss and he said he talked to her, but when the behavior continued and I went back a second time, he snapped at me. The higher up boss said ""That's just how she is and we've had to learn how to get along with her. You'll never get an apology from her, so that's that"". I have a Bachelor's degree and job experience but was always treated like a kid who didn't know anything maybe because my colleagues were all 30+ years older than me and had all been together that long. This was a professional office as an admin assistant.

My new job is fine but not fine. I do almost nothing the entire day (which feels like a total waste of time other than the paycheck - I'd rather be pursuing things I want to make a real career out of), and the boss is a total loose cannon who changed my hours and took away my breaks after I accepted the job. He shit talks everyone and the company, and he rants to me about all his frustrations for literally hours. I feel like he wants me to agree with him, but I don't. It's with a major company and in a professional office (i'm again an admin assistant), and I already had to go to HR in my first week. Fun.

I'm scared moving on to other jobs because it's like most places are full of rude people who scream and take advantage of others. It's like no one is civil except the couple places I interned (who are not hiring. I've been trying to go back to them for years).

I don't know what to do. I really don't want to work with unstable people forever. I'd love to do my own thing but that's a huge challenge that involves many failures (I have been trying for many years and failing) but I still have the motivation and belief I can succeed in some way. I just don't have much time to work harder on my own thing when I need a steady paycheck."
dz1kz8,2,2019-11-20,Potential Resume Issue,Fathy92,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dz1kz8/potential_resume_issue/,"Greetings,

   Just a bit of a back story before diving in to the resumes' that will be attached to this Reddit posting, I've graduated months back with a bachelor's degree in computer systems. I've focused on computer networking at the time, as I have an interest in becoming either a network engineer or a network architect one day. I had to take a internship class, where I interned as a Junior network technician, which I got through a buddy of mine. Gone back to school to finish up my last semester full time to take some extra missing credits(b/c school advisers are great huh?). Graduated in June and got my CCNA not too long after.  Applied for some Junior Network Engineering jobs, which was not the smartest move for someone coming out of college, but I ended up getting a couple of interviews. 

This was the resume I used at the time: https://docdro.id/nwldN2A

Learning from my interview mistakes, I realized that a possible reason on why I didn't get my desired positions was because of ""relevant experience."" So, I was told to go more entry level on this one, so I start applying for jobs like help desk, Technical IT Support, Network Specialist, etc. For some reason in the world, I never seem to get a single interview. I decided to craft my resume a bit, and came up with this for a technical support role

Second Resume: https://docdro.id/lfVJmDT

According to one source, you should attempt to craft your resume as close as possible to the job posting at hand. Seems tedious if your apply for every and any job posting you could find.

It's been nothing but mentally fatiguing for me.  I start to think to myself: ""What exactly are these IT people looking for? A unicorn? A wizard, with magic tricks up his sleeve?""

Anyways, It's clear that I want to become a network professional one day. The issue here is probably my resume. Any help would be appreciated."
dz2ag1,3,2019-11-20,How important are my coding skills for job placements in IT?,Nobody_ed,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dz2ag1/how_important_are_my_coding_skills_for_job/,"Greetings Reddit community,

I'm a sophomore undergraduate student from a no name university. I have been willing to get into IT and InfoSec for a career, and have been working towards it for a while now. I've been preparing to get my Security+, and I'm almost done with an (ISC)2 specialization over Coursera. I didn't seek to obtain the other two certifications in the 'trifecta' because I'm a computer science student anyways.

As a personal interest, I have been going about competitive programming on my own. On HackerRank, my global ranking in problem solving is less than 50,000 and I have a six-star badge. I've completed Linux shell, JavaScript, SQL and I'm almost done with Python as well on the platform. I learned a lot, and now have a considerably strong grip on Algorithms and DP.

Recently, my university made it compulsory for all students to learn coding, so much so that they introduced a new subject for all students in the third year and final year. They call it the Industry Standard Coding Practice (ISCP), and hired a bunch of IT professionals to come once a week and tutor the students. Although it seems like a great idea, the level at which they are doing this is dismal. The whiteboard interview prep they have been conducting discusses very basic problems like sorting and greedy.

This makes me wonder if coding skills are not really that relevant in IT. I desperately want to avoid a helpdesk job in my campus placements, and want to get into bigger companies that allow for me to keep learning more even though I'm in a job (I mean pay for further learning, growth opportunities, and so on). Although I could eke out a career in CS, and I know for sure that a strong programming skillset is all the more important for jobs in there, I want to know how it works in IT.

TLDR: I want to know where can my competitive programming skills get me in the field of IT. Do my certs (Security+, CEH, ISCP) coupled with my Coding skill work well? Or should I be looking for more experience and internships firsthand?"

Requirements:

* Must be a fully matriculated graduate student for the Spring 2020 semester

dz2wo8,4,2019-11-20,Leaving internship after 2 months?,ObjectiveDamage1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dz2wo8/leaving_internship_after_2_months/,"Hi! So I'm a graduate student working for a very small startup (roughly 12 employees) and am looking to leave the company. I started working here in mid-October (not long, I know) but a business idea that I have been working on with a classmate is starting to take off and we were just accepted into our university's startup accelerator, which is super exciting for us given that we didn't think things would take off so quickly.

Is it wrong/unprofessional to put in my two weeks so soon? Ultimately, I am going to do so, because I'd like to pursue this opportunity I've been given to work on and get funding for my own business venture and the startup I'm working at currently is pretty toxic and has a reputation for driving away female staff (I'm the only woman working at the company) ... I just don't know when.

For context: the internship is paid. The pay isn't great and my boss rarely respects my experiences as a marketer and schedule as a grad student doing research/working two jobs.

dz4mz2,2,2019-11-20,Seeking advice on how to navigate a government/private industry career track with no security clearance?,ronjon2012,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dz4mz2/seeking_advice_on_how_to_navigate_a/,"I have been applying to a million positions across the web. My background is in security/intel and I want to branch out into both public and private sector since I have various internship experiences and qualifications that set me apart from most other candidates. However, when I finally find something that's right up my alley literally, I seem to NOT qualify due to it requiring a Top Secret clearance usually. I am a recent Masters graduate from a prestigious university in the U.S.

My question is.. how do you obtain jobs where they require clearance if you've never worked in government or private sector before or with clients from there? I have all the qualifications and requirements needed to do well but they are denying me due to clearance level. Even for ENTRY level jobs, it seems they want that clearance requirement badly. Is there a way I can obtain one or find government jobs that don't require this pre-requisite?

If anyone here has worked in private security or government, what did you do to be able to qualify for jobs that required one? Any specific steps to take to achieve this or work at entry level without a clearance?

I should note as well, that I did not plan to apply straight for a government agency at the moment since I want to take my skills/qualifications to the private side first, and then consider government later on. But what can I do for private industries that require clearance anyway?"
dz4ru6,1,2019-11-20,Undergraduate Student Intern Career Advice,devi1knight,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/dz4ru6/undergraduate_student_intern_career_advice/,"So I am at a bit of a crossroads right now and would appreciate any and all advice.

I am an undergraduate student (senior) at a top university majoring in a STEM field. I have two more semesters left, but decided to take a semester off this semester to pursue an internship (that is pretty relevant to my major) at a well known company. I am nearing the end of my internship, and I just received a return offer to continue my internship for the Spring. 

On the one hand, I do want to take up the offer, since this internship is competitive and it took a lot of applying the first time around to get this. I am also learning a lot, and I enjoy working with the people around the office. Most likely, I will be able to turn this internship into a full time position if I decide to continue. 

On the other hand, I am a little hesitant because a part of me is telling me to just finish up my undergraduate studies and graduate. I would really like to move from company to company (internship-wise) and learn from different work environments/cultures/positions too instead of just staying at one. Also, the pay will most likely be the same and that is something I have considered, but that is not a deal breaker for me. 

I don't want to go back to school and regret not taking up the offer. However, I don't want to take up the offer for extending my internship and feel as if I could be working at a different company. What do you think? I am on the fence here."

Long story short, I got bad grades in the 2nd last semester before graduation for Electrical Engineering and will be expelled (there is basically no recourse, I have exhausted those options). Mainly because I am miserable in academia.

I am now going to be looking for a full time position, which I am no stranger to. Already I have worked 4 different internships at different engineering firms. I did fine at these jobs, granted they were easy, but I know actual entry-level engineering would not be much more difficult. I have also done my own projects through clubs at my university/certificates.

What are my options given my technical background? I realize most people will not hire someone without a degree for self-evident reasons, but what is the probability of finding an employer that will pay me lesser? I could always attend public university, but that will probably mean 3 additional semesters. I rather run off to a start-up or get a lesser job and aggressively invest, learn how to manage housing, or some entrepreneurial path.

Overall I feel like this is a terrible ""lose"". Should I just attempt to finish out my degree somewhere then go into careers or just go straight into an engineering career (with a harder time beginning)."

About me: I'm 20, I'm in 3rd year CS in university in Europe, and about to graduate in about 8 months. I have decent grade in Math and CS (GPA 3.7 something). I like network and security stuff. I just passed my OSCP exam as well. I'm still considering between working immediately or taking Master in cybersecurity.

My problem: To be honest, I didn't pay a lot of attention in preparing my profile or even searching around. First I don't really have a CV, LinkedIn or anything. Second I haven't started researching/applying to companies at all.

Some explanation: My program only has 2-month summer so it wasn't easy to find an internship in the 1st and 2nd years. Instead I just spent some time self-studying. Also I haven't applied to companies because I wanted to focus on the exam.

My questions: Is it too late now to start looking for a job/sponsorship something in cybersecurity for after graduation ? How important is the internship section on the CV ? What are the good resources to learn about tech companies, especially for cybersecurity, not general software engineer ?

Thank you for reading."

dz9b9m,3,2019-11-20,Torn between two internship positions. Need help,Aggrenor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dz9b9m/torn_between_two_internship_positions_need_help/,"I am a Software Engineering Master's student and have 3 years of experience working as a Software Engineer. Yesterday, I received two internship offers: one from PlayStation for Cloud Back End and another from DataDog. The deadline to answer to both is this Friday. My Master's program ends December next year, so this would be a good opportunity to work extra hard for a return offer.

Here is what I feel is the pros and cons of each one:

* PlayStation
   * Pros: 
      * Sony is a big name
      * Probably a great learning experience working in an area I really enjoy
   * Cons:
      * Their office is in a small city in California, I am not sure how I feel about that
      * Reading reviews I discovered that the pay is not as great as other big companies
* DataDog
   * Pros:
      * Good pay
      * Their office seems pretty interesting (New York Times Building)
   * Cons:
      * Need to relocate to New York (PlayStation's office is like 20 minutes from where I live, but I don't own a car)
      * Smaller name than PlayStation

I feel like I would earn a lot of experience from both internships. But since this would be the first time I get an internship/job in the US I would really appreciate the help (I am an international student, and if possible I'd like to stay in the USA).

I'd really appreciate the help, I am suffering from intense anxiety and probably could use more advice. 

tldr: I am torn between an internship at PlayStation and DataDog. Need help choosing which one I should go for."

Education: still finishing my BS Degree in IT Cybersecurity through WGU. 

Certifications: CompTIA A+, Sec+, was studying for CISSP but starting going for MCSA Windows Server 2016 since I'm sure at one point it will be required to even be around the servers.

Work:

I have done IT before, currently I am doing an InfoSec IT Internship in security compliance for the government contracted company on our military base. I did Dekstop Admin for a bit working in Active Directory and imaging machines using MDT/PXE.

Should I make a move for Mid-Level Commercial/Private Sector? I'm trying to grasp and learn enough to make about 75k+ annually. I know it's a lot but same time its in the Bay Area..mid levels make about that much from what I see in LinkedIn. I know HR way over shoots their requirements or ""wants"" but I'll still shotgun my resume. I don't want to go entry level help desk making 50k, I have a family I have to provide for.

The Activision role is mainly frontend React/Redux dev, meanwhile Dell's is unknown. However, I've been told at Dell I'll have flexibility in choosing a team/work I want to do.


I personally want to do either full stack or backend dev.  I'm a junior and am wondering if only doing frontend work in my internship would limit me more towards frontend roles next year, particularly at top companies?


Hourly pay is almost the same, but housing provided by Activision is dorm-style shared bedrooms vs individual rooms by Dell.


With Activision I'd get to explore LA/go to E3 and get my name on the credits for a AAA game. Seeing that I don't actually see myself being in the game industry in the future as my career, it would be a fun opportunity as an internship. However, it being mainly frontend concerns me for the future.

If I chose Activision I would have to renege Dell at a school with strong ties to their company.

Any suggestions?

I've recently entered the ""adult working world"" (roughly 2 years ago) and I struggled a lot with the transition. Because of my struggling, I'm losing my job and will be let go by the end of December. I'm losing my job as a result of my symptoms which include but are not limited to: the inability to prioritize tasks, finished jobs, and anxiety preventing me from always wanting to be in the office. When I realized this could be a disorder, I went to the doctor. I've since been diagnosed with an Attention Disorder + Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Unfortunately, I've reached out for help a little too late and I am indeed losing my job and there isn't much I can do about it. My insurance will run out in January and I will be unable to get medication/therapy while I am applying to new jobs.

I have a bachelor's in Linguistics and have spent the last two years working briefly as a salesforce admin intern followed by a year and a half in research gaining skills in data analysis, modeling, cleaning etc. This has been in academia, but I would like to transition to the tech industry to make some money and finally be able to save money.

The guidance I need;

Where the heck do I go from here? It feels like I've burned my bridges, I'm being held back by something I can't fix, and I don't know what career to shoot for if I'm at some inherent disadvantage in not being able to function at the same level as a ""normal person"" at a 9-5 job. What jobs should I be reaching out for? What work environments work best for people with similar symptoms? How do I build career equity from where I am now?

My skills include: Python, SQL (mySQL), BASH, Advanced Microsoft Excel, Data Mining, Data Cleaning, Data Modeling, HTML/CSS, Google Suite, Git, Salesforce, Familiar with MATLAB

I'm generally interested in: natural language processing"

I've got some interesting characteristics to my profile- I'd just love any suggestions for a list for a prospective computer science major! Here goes:

**DEMOGRAPHICS:** Asian female from Kentucky, at current Top 2 prep school

**GPA:** 5.8/6, top 2%. However, I have a 5.6 for freshman and sophomore years combined.

**MAJOR:** COMPUTER SCIENCE!! Also maybe a minor in creative writing- I've been writing poetry as long as I can remember.

**SAT**: 1600

**SAT II:** Math II: 800, Physics: 800, Chem: 790

**CLASSES:** I took the department's hardest CS course as a 10th grader and have taken it 3 times(different topics every semester) since. I also took Calculus in 9th grade and I've been just exploring math since. APs: AP Phys C Mech(5), AP Phys C E&amp;M(5), AP Calc(5), AP CS(5), AP Lang(5), AP Stats(5), AP Chem(5).

**ECs**:

* Intern at a CS lab at UCLA
* I run two literary magazines(one in school, one out of school)
* Published a poetry chapbook(not self-published) sophomore year
* USACO platinum
* Ran workshops for little kids in writing
* 16 total gold keys and 6 gold medals at the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards
* Semifinalist at an Ivy League hackathon(vague for anonymity)
* Violinist for 12 years(no major awards, first violin in school orchestra)
* Selected for 8 magazines for poetry + 1 small press competition
* Lead Peer Tutor
* Several awards for my apps and projects in computer science(national)
* GSA VP
* President of Girls in Stem, Linguistics Club, Computer Science Club, Robotics Club

**WEIRD CIRCUMSTANCES:**

First- something terrible happened my freshman year. I accidentally sent in a poem to English class that contained a couple phrases that were similar to something I'd written before. I received probation on my record for academic dishonesty, even though it was completely unintentional. I have several teacher recs that would confirm my story though, if that'd help.

Second- I am bisexual, and I came out to my parents in the fall of sophomore year. They threatened to send me to their home country, and I seriously considered running away. Since then, I've been working on the weekends, trying to save up so I can come out again and go to college without having to keep pretending. I have always had to be prepared for the possibility that they'd try to withdraw me and I'd have to file for emancipation. This has caused me significant emotional pain and instability(they keep threatening to withdraw me from boarding school and homeschool me). I started writing my poetry book right after. They continue to call me at least 20 times a day; they think that I am straight and was just 'confused', though they continue to threaten to send me back home. I've been saving up money and working 10-15 hours a week. I plan to write an essay about this whole situation for college.

So, where should I consider? Thank you so much!!"
dzafle,1,2019-11-20,Moving for a job...,onepokadot,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/dzafle/moving_for_a_job/,"Hi all! 

TL;DR I have been told that I am likely to be offered a job in Seattle for a big company. I have never moved homes before and unfortunately I don't have a social life aside from my family. I like the position but I am not sure I am ready &amp; I'm also super scared.

I am 22 years old and a few months away from getting my Masters in Business Administration from a University online. I got my Bachelor's on their main campus but it was only 3 hours to drive home. And I drove home often to do laundry and spend time with everyone. Also my brother &amp; Sister attended the University at the same time as I did so we shared an apartment. 

I'm really close to my family btw. Like I looked forward to living in an apartment with my older sister and brother. Which I have been told is weird. Anyways, since I graduated in the spring of 2018, I moved back home to live with my parents and my older siblings (I'm the youngest of 4). My oldest sister is looking for a job in our hometown and is paying a small rent to continue to live at home.

My brother is getting his master's degree at the same University but will be finishing up in December and likely moving back for awhile as he is looking to buy some property and build a house and needs to build his credit history some more. And my other sister has always been not very ambitious and so she is still living here too. My parents didn't move houses once when I was growing up so this home has lots of sentimental value for me... But on a side note, they are looking to move somewhere else maybe. I share a room with my oldest sister (aka my best friend in the entire world no lie) because she has too much stuff in her room for her to sleep in there. 

And I got a part time internship a year and a half ago that was supposed to be just for the summer but has stretched out a really long time because I was available and needed money, and my boss wasn't allowed to hire me as a regular employee but needed the help. 

Well, my internship was supposed to end at the end of September earlier this year. Then it didn't because my boss really needs my help. Like really. So I had been looking for another job. A full time one. With benefits and a salary that matches my experience/education level. 

I stopped looking when I found out that my boss wants me to stay until June 2020, when I graduate.

But a recruiter got ahold of me. And I wasn't sure if my boss had been authorized to keep me on (she had not but is going to anyway). I told her I can work until June
 I love it there... Or maybe I'm comfortable? I like knowing what I am doing and knowing everyone's names and feeling like I am a part of things (just got invited to a Christmas party at a coworkers house). 

But I had a phone interview for a job in Seattle. That sounds great. I think I could do the work well but I'd have to move (and come up with $$ for rent/1st/last/security). The recruiter called today to tell me that the hiring mgr is really excited about me but isn't sure I could move if they were to offer the position to me (after an in person interview of course which I'm am not worried about). Also I'd have a week (if that) to find housing. 

My dad thinks it's a good idea for me to move. Good for my career etc. My mom thinks it's too soon. At least wait until I'm not paying tuition. 

My brother says that I'm underpaid/underappreciated where I'm at and should leave. 

I do not have a clue what to do. I love where I'm at but maybe could be good at the other job too but I'm not sure I want to move out and away from my support system so soon. I'm not sure I'm ready. And I'm also not sure if I'm just scared or if I'm really not ready.

Any advice would be amazing. In particular if you have any idea why moving would be bad/good let me know. Or just tell me about your experience."

Hi, I study CS in the 3rd year of Bachelors degree and I was offered a QA positions (C#). 

I've come trough a lot of posts reading about QA, that it is difficult to move into dev. The recruiter told me that it's common that people in their company move to another dev positions. 

About the job he told me that most of their tests are automatized + they also develop their own testing framework, so maybe I could also participate at least on some development.

 What I am scared of is that I would find this boring after some time, since I am a creative person who likes to create stuff, find solutions for problems etc. Not saying you dont need this skills at QA, but I guess not so much. 

To be honest this would be my first parttime job in IT, and I know I have to start from the bottom.

My name is Donald, a 22-year-old student looking to get a Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry. Some weeks ago, my sister was hospitalized for illness‚Äîsome pulmonary disease that I can‚Äôt remember‚Äîafter she was out in the rain for a few hours. Her health was never good, but her heart always was; in the selfless manner typical to Linda, she was trying to find someone else‚Äôs lost bird. I honestly thought it‚Äôd be impossible, but she found it in the end.

I was busy with classes and research, and for whatever reason, the hospital restricted visiting hours to Tuesdays and Sundays, 10 am to 4 pm. I rarely had the chance to visit, so we kept in contact largely through text, instead. The following is my record of our conversations.

Mon, Oct 7, 2:31 AM

ME: I heard you were hospitalized. What the hell happened???

LINDA: I just got sick. Started coughing real violently in class, lol. It prob sounds mild, but it was red bad

LINDA: \*real bad

LINDA: Pulmonary edema or something? I think that was it

LINDA: Also, no idea. I‚Äôll probably be here for a while

LINDA: Yeah, I think so. Some weird stuff happened today, but I think it‚Äôs fine. Are you done for the day?

ME: I‚Äôm done with classes. I‚Äôll probably be at my office for a little bit longer. What weird stuff?

LINDA: I got this weird feeling in my chest and stomach. It‚Äôs a kind of burning, aching feeling, and it comes with some anxiety, too

ME: Did you tell the doctors about this?

LINDA: Yeah, I did. They did some tests, but if they figured out what was wrong, they didn‚Äôt tell me

ME: Let them know if it gets any worse. Let me know, too

LINDA: kk

Thu, Oct 10, 3:10 AM

LINDA: The walls are bleeding

LINDA: Wtf is happening

LINDA: Are you awake?

LINDA: I‚Äôve called five times already! Pick up the phone

LINDA: Wake up

LINDA: It‚Äôs the fire. That‚Äôs what the feeling is

LINDA: The blood is soaking the sheets and flooding the fking room

LINDA: I‚Äôm fine now. I think I was hallucinating or something. I already told the doctors about it. You can‚Äôt visit on Thursdays anyways

LINDA: They asked some questions but didn‚Äôt come to a conclusion yet. Dr. Lykos said he‚Äôd ‚Äúkeep the conversation going‚Äù with me to figure out what‚Äôs wrong

LINDA: I guess there are some psychiatric issues, too

ME: Alright, if you‚Äôre sure.

ME: That‚Äôs concerning. Wasn‚Äôt this a normal physical condition?

LINDA: Apparently not? Idk

ME: Lmk if anything else happens

LINDA: Yeah, they‚Äôre aware. Still don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong

LINDA: Can I talk to you about what I‚Äôm seeing?

ME: Yeah, if you think it‚Äôll help

LINDA: There‚Äôre a few minor things, like sometimes I‚Äôll see something moving in the corner of my eyes

LINDA: But when I‚Äôm taking a walk around the hospital, sometimes that weird fire feeling comes back, and the whole place turns into an impossible nightmare

LINDA: I‚Äôll turn a corner and end up somewhere I know wasn‚Äôt around that corner, and I‚Äôll go through doors and end up back where I was a minute ago

LINDA: And sometimes the hallways go on for too long

LINDA: And there‚Äôs no one around

ME: As in, you‚Äôre forgetting bits of memory? Not knowing how you ended up somewhere?

LINDA: No, I mean literally turning a corner and seeing it lead to a different part of the hospital. Or maybe a part that doesn‚Äôt exist

LINDA: Or opening a door and seeing the doorway lead to a place it couldn‚Äôt possibly lead to

ME: How many closed doors are there at the hospital where you can walk? Aren‚Äôt there rules against that kind of stuff?

LINDA: Yeah, usually the big doors in the hallways are open so people can move beds and stuff. But when this happens, the doors are always closed for some reason.

LINDA: I can‚Äôt even turn back. I‚Äôll turn around and see somewhere I didn‚Äôt walk from

LINDA: I sometimes manage to get back to my room after a while, but I have to check if everything‚Äôs the same. Is this really my room, etc. sort of thing, you know?

ME: I think you shouldn‚Äôt take walks if you feel unsafe while doing so

LINDA: Probably not, yeah

LINDA: There‚Äôs a woman, too. I don‚Äôt recognize her. Black hair and really pale skin. But it doesn‚Äôt look unhealthy somehow. She sometimes shows up when this happens

LINDA: I‚Äôll open a door and she‚Äôs right there, then I‚Äôll turn back and go down a few hallways and turn a corner, and she‚Äôs right there. If I get to my room, I‚Äôll check everything, and when I‚Äôm done checking a corner, I‚Äôll turn around and she‚Äôs right there

LINDA: She never says anything, never moves. Whenever I see her, though, I can‚Äôt help but panic. There‚Äôs something wrong with her

ME: That‚Äôs creepy af. Are you okay?

LINDA: Yeah, she never does anything. I told Dr. Lykos about her, so he knows. He says it‚Äôs just another hallucination, but if it gets bad, I can get one of the nurses to come over

LINDA: But I can‚Äôt. The staff disappears, remember?

ME: I‚Äôm not sure what to think. You shouldn‚Äôt be in any danger from hallucinations, but ik that‚Äôs not the point

ME: Do you think I can convince them to let me stay the night with you? Sleep on a chair or something? Would that help?

LINDA: I can ask

&amp;#x200B;

Thu, Oct 10, 9:19 PM

LINDA: Yeah, that‚Äôs a no. They said I need quiet and rest to heal or whatever

ME: I‚Äôm not going to make any noise

LINDA: I told them that. They don‚Äôt believe you, since there are a lot of patients you could disrupt here

ME: That doesn‚Äôt feel right. You can call or text whenever you need to. I‚Äôll monitor my phone and leave class if needed. I‚Äôll make sure it‚Äôs not silenced when I sleep, too

LINDA: Thanks

ME: Yeah, np

LINDA: She‚Äôs in the fking mirror!

LINDA: She‚Äôs in the mirror! What the actual hell???! What do I do?

ME: What do you mean?

LINDA: I went to the bathroom to wash, and she‚Äôs in the reflection, behind me and just staring at me

LINDA: Only in the reflection, too

LINDA: And when I turned around to look and saw that she wasn‚Äôt there, I looked back at the mirror, and she had moved closer!

LINDA: She‚Äôs coming, Donald. She‚Äôs coming for me

ME: Fuck their visiting hours. I‚Äôm on my way

&amp;#x200B;

Fri, Oct 11, 10:34 PM

LINDA: Thanks for spending the day here. It looks like the hallucinations don‚Äôt happen when you‚Äôre around

ME: Yeah, anytime. It‚Äôs a good thing the staff let me stay. Lmk if anything else happens, and I‚Äôll come over again

LINDA: Thanks :)

&amp;#x200B;

Sat, Oct 12, 9:45 AM

LINDA: When you‚Äôre not here, she‚Äôs always in the mirror now. Every mirror, too. How the hell am I supposed to shower or brush my teeth if there‚Äôs a mirror in my bathroom? In every bathroom?

ME: That‚Äôs really concerning. Can you ask the nurses to cover up the mirror, maybe? They might understand

LINDA: I‚Äôll try

&amp;#x200B;

Sat, Oct 12, 9:59 AM

LINDA: They actually said yes! They covered the mirror with a taped-on curtain! The charge nurse said I wasn‚Äôt in any danger, but she covered it up anyways

ME: Wow. It‚Äôs a good thing the staff is so understanding

LINDA: ikr??

&amp;#x200B;

Sat, Oct 12, 1:13 PM

LINDA: Why the fk is this happening?! She was on the stairs!

LINDA: I‚Äôve recovered enough that they let me walk wherever without support or being hooked up to anything, so I decided to go downstairs for some fresh air, and I went down one floor and saw her at the foot of the stairs

LINDA: She was just waiting for me!

ME: Would it help if you asked someone to accompany you on your walks? I can do it when I‚Äôm there, but is there anyone else in the meantime?

ME: Any volunteers or interns or anyone else without anything really important to do?

LINDA: I guess. There‚Äôs usually a volunteer staffing the unit desk, answering the phone and monitoring patients on telemetry. I‚Äôll ask if he can come with me

ME: I‚Äôll be over tomorrow. Do that in the meantime

&amp;#x200B;

Mon, Oct 14, 5:26 PM

LINDA: It didn‚Äôt work

LINDA: I thought it did at first on Saturday, but it didn‚Äôt work today! I turned my head and he just vanished!

LINDA: And OF FUCKING COURSE, there she was, right beside me where he was supposed to be! She‚Äôs getting closer!

LINDA: She has horrible stained teeth, like she‚Äôs been eating rotten, decayed flesh

LINDA: I ran until I couldn‚Äôt run anymore. The halls seemed to go on forever. I went through one of the doors and somehow ended up on the roof

LINDA: I was ready to jump, but she didn‚Äôt show up. I stayed up there for an hour before the volunteer showed up. He said I just took off running, and he‚Äôd been searching for me

ME: You were ready to jump?

ME: Linda, she‚Äôs not real. The only way she can put you in danger is by making you put yourself in danger. Don‚Äôt let that happen

ME: Contact someone immediately if it ever comes to something like this

LINDA: I know she can‚Äôt be real! But that doesn‚Äôt make her any less real in the moment

ME: I know. But you‚Äôre stronger than this. Be brave

LINDA: Okay

&amp;#x200B;

Tue, Oct 15, 10:40 AM

LINDA: Donald, she‚Äôs coming to judge me.

LINDA: It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm a sinner, and she‚Äôs coming to judge me for my sins.

ME: What? What‚Äôs happening? She‚Äôs a hallucination, right? You still know that?

LINDA: The fire feeling. That was her spark, her little portion of the fire. She was tracking me down, and she‚Äôs coming to judge me, just as she comes for other sinners.

LINDA: And for what sin? I demanded too much of others. Asked for too much from our parents, from the staff here, and from you.

LINDA: This whole illness, too! I brought it on myself, and troubled everyone because of it. That was my sin.

ME: Linda, calm down. Can you do that? Do that finger tracing exercise Dr. Lykos taught you, and remember that she isn‚Äôt real

LINDA: The others, too. She comes to judge them.

LINDA: That volunteer. He wasn‚Äôt there when his mother needed him, and she died because of that. The woman comes to judge him, too.

LINDA: And the patient in the next room over. He‚Äôs in a relationship with his best friend, who is also a man.

LINDA: Why is that even a sin? Love is love, right? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that!

LINDA: But we humans don‚Äôt get to choose. We have no authority. What we think is fair or right or good means nothing. We don‚Äôt get to choose what sin is or isn‚Äôt.

LINDA: The fire is what chooses. And it hates us. It hates us because it‚Äôs forced to be with us. 

ME: I‚Äôm coming over. Can you sit down and breathe while I‚Äôm on my way?

LINDA: The doctors, too. Dr. Leipsic worked overtime too much and passed out in the staff lounge for a few minutes. Dr. Lykos had too many patients needing things at once, and he had no choice but to handle them one at a time.

LINDA: Those are sins, too. Sometimes, people have no choice but to sin. But the fire doesn‚Äôt care. She comes to judge them.

LINDA: The nurse, Sara. Her father abused her as a child, so she didn‚Äôt attend his funeral. The woman comes to judge her for that.

LINDA: Bruce, another nurse. He got confused by some convoluted details and gave food to a patient before checking their blood sugar. They lost one measurement. The patient‚Äôs blood sugar hadn‚Äôt been at any remotely dangerous levels for a week now, too.

LINDA: But he sinned. She comes to judge him.

ME: I just got to the parking lot. I‚Äôm on my way. Hang in there

&amp;#x200B;

That day, I got out of the car and walked into a slaughterhouse with a hospital exterior. Everyone within the building had been violently butchered. There were a few signs of struggle: overturned chairs and tables, trails of blood leading to the bodies of those who tried to escape, and other things like that. But no one survived.

The wounds were horrific, too. They mostly consisted of slash wounds, but the wounds weren‚Äôt deep. If the killer was wielding a knife, it would have been a short one. Invariably, though, each wound was accompanied by huge blunt force trauma. A cut from the neck upwards would lead to a shattered skull. A stab to the chest would be joined by broken ribs and a sternum pulverized to dust.

I walked through that carnage in a daze, unable to process what I was seeing. It was as if my body knew to numb my mind, because if I were in full possession of my consciousness, I would have broken right then and there. *Keep going*, it seemed to say. *You need to keep going*.

Some days, I wish I hadn‚Äôt listened to that voice. I found Linda a few feet away from her room door. Her spine had been snapped in half, as if someone had folded her backwards like a sheet of paper. Her eyes and mouth were sewn shut, and a mangled stab wound was all I could see of her neck.

The police cordoned off the area when they arrived, but no evidence of the killer was left. Even the security cameras were useless‚Äîimmediately before the massacre began, each camera had been melted by some immense source of heat. The police asked me several questions, but I don‚Äôt remember any of them. The only clear part of that ephemeral dream left in my memory is the sight of Linda‚Äôs face, mutilated unlike any other for some incomprehensible reason.

Ever since that day, I haven‚Äôt been able to focus on anything. Daytime is marred by scattered flashbacks, and nighttime is nothing but a chain of night terrors. Even so, I need to continue, because the police aren‚Äôt getting anywhere. If anyone reading this has anything helpful to say, please let me know. No matter how suicidal it may be, I need to find this woman."

dzdmy5,54,2019-11-20,Ascension (Pt. 1),Snipeye,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dzdmy5/ascension_pt_1/,"I'm... sorry. Not that it matters much, anymore.

I'm not sure what I expected. To be frank, I'm not sure what *any* of us expected - we had been figuratively shouting at the stars - our music, our culture, inane and endless ramblings - since we first figured out how. As soon as we could chuch figurative rocks, we launched out Voyager - then figured out we could do it better, and launched Voyager II. For as long as our species could remember - and I should clarify that humans never had any sort of genetic memory - we had looked to the stars in wonder and awe. Were we alone? It appeared so, but we still hoped. Our species is... unique, as the universe at large would discover. We hope for the best - but we, ourselves, tend to plan for the worst. Huh. Maybe it's because we bring it about more often than not.

Our first forays into space were actually a sort of competition - not the friendly kind, either. A group of people on one side of the planet were pretty convinced that they were better than a group of people on the other side. Funny, looking back on it. Anyway, we did some pretty crazy things... you have to understand that Earth is a pretty high-gravity planet. I say pretty ""high-gravity,"" but from what we know now, it was about three to four times greater than most life-bearing planets. To escape our gravity well, we had to sit on top of a ridiculous quantity of chemical propellant, and even then couldn't bring much with us. Those early days of space ""exploration"" are marked by a lot of failures and tragic accidents, though we generally figured out what we were doing after a while.

Humanity has always been... competitive. I think that's the best way to say it. If you grow up and you have plenty of food and few threats (or none whatsoever), that's probably a little hard to understand. From an ecological standpoint, maybe it makes more sense if you know that physically, humans are far from the top of the food chain back on Earth. We're not the fastest, or the biggest, or the strongest. We had to fight just to survive. Not me, specifically, mind you - I'm talking about my ancestors, thousands of years ago. But that fighting spirit never really left - even in routine social interaction, there's some degree of contention and competition between humans.

There are still recordings - quaint, 2-dimensional images - of our ascension. That's how the marketed it, back then - ""Freedom from Physics!"" We were so excited to *see* and *experience* everything, instead of watching it all spin lazily by from our comparitively small speck of dust, floating through lonely space. As a civilazation, we were riding high on the excitement of fusion - we had just ""cracked"" it a few years earlier, so to speak. Of course, fusion itself isn't that hard - get enough hydrogen together and it'll happen all by itself - but artificial fusion, on a small scale, that you can extract useful energy from? Takes most species a while to figure it out, and it's a pretty big deal when they manage. Once we had our first breakthrough, things took off pretty quick. Within 20 years of the first Tokamak break-even reactor, pretty much everything humanity used was fusion-powered: communications, entertainment, transportation. Energy - something that had always been hard to gather in massive (usable) quantities on our planet, was now practically free.

You know what? I really don't think I can do our story justice. To whoever finds this, I'll include a copy of our archives. Take a look for yourself. Once you've done that... well, maybe then you'll understand at least a little better.

\-------------------------------------

MENTAL ARCHIVE: SUBJECT 0xFA39FCA3 8F31BBC3

\-------------------------------------

""Manipulation of the Higgs field on this scale has always been prohibitively energy expensive, but that's no longer a consideration.""

To accentuate his point, Dr. Hansen gestured vaguely out the window, where our reactor gleamed impressively in the sunlight. True, it was a bit old - and far larger, strictly speaking, than was necessary. The lab had comissioned it in the relatively early days of the energy revolution, and the tech wasn't quite as polished - figuratively speaking. In a much more literal sense, every surface gleamed thanks to the hundreds of intern-hours that went into maintaining it. It was as large as a football stadium - in fact, it had once *been* a football stadium. Now, instead of throngs of becolored spectators, scarcely-clad cheerleaders, and hyper-testosteroned althetes, it was full of machinery: miles of cable transmitting terrabytes of data back and forth between control systems, reserviors of tritium and deuterium, liquid helium for the superconducting magnets, conduits running every which way... it was a mess. A beautiful mess - *our* mess, and it could spit out more power than we would ever need: nearly 50 gigawatts. A few years ago, that might have seemed impossible. Nowadays it was... adequate. A little on the small side for a research lab of our prestige, but we honestly didn't use it to its full potential, so why bother replacing it?

I shook my mind free of the fog that had temporarily grasped it. Too many late nights, I supposed - but today, it was all going to pay off. Dr. Hansen continued in his scratchy voice.

""The interaction between the Higgs field and the electromagnetic spectrum is weak, and only possible because of force-entangled quarks, but we're working to discover a more efficient medium. As it stands, however, efficiency is not terribly imporant. Observe.""

He waved his hand theatrically, as if he were trying to mind-trick everybody in the room. On his queue, the lights dimmed everywhere in the room except the distinct plinth between us and the audience. Some crudely-fabricated sheet metal hid the product of three years' research, preventing an acceptable face to our potential funders. On top of the plinth rested a small, polished sphere of steel, maybe an inch accross. With all eyes trained on it, Dr. Hansen gently grasped it in his palm and lightly pushed it upward. As it left his hand, it continued with a lazy momentum in a straight line upward. All things tossed upward gradually come downward... but not this. In continued, unslowed, rising gradually higher - it was now nearly a meter above the surface of the plinth.

""For as long as we provide power, that sphere - indeed, anything in the affected volume - will not interact with the Higgs field."" Dr. Hansen sounded pleased, as though he had just given a child a particularly excellent candy.

Our audience, however, seemed nonplussed and unimpressed. ""Pretty sure we can do that with magnets!"" A voice rang out from somewhere in the dimly-lit crowd of people.

""We could do something *similar* with magnets for this particular sphere, yes,"" corrected Dr. Hansen, frowning, ""but that's beside the point. Here."" His eyes scanned quickly around the room until they landed on small stack of papers, which he quickly grabbed. He reached up toward the steel ball, which had bumped into the ceiling and was now slowly drifting downward, only to realize that he was a meter shy. Giving up, he instead tossed the stack of papers haphazardly into the volume.

That seemed to catch their attention. The papers fluttered about, as one would expect, but rather than falling to the ground, they continued to drift and flip - clearly interacting with the air currents, but resolutely refusing to acknowledge gravity. Seeing their interest, Dr. Hansen's smile returned.

""Put simply, as far as anything in that volume is concerned, gravity doesn't exist.""

After a moment of stunned silence, the first question came: ""Is it portable?""

""Not yet, but there's no reason it can't be, provided an adequate power source."" Dr. Hansen looked pensive.

""Can it lift itself?""

This gave him some thought. ""... perhaps. I don't think it's impossible, but I'll need to experiment more.""

Another doozy: ""Can it work in reverse? Make gravity *stronger*?""

""I... I haven't the faintest. That seems completely contrary to the point."" This time, Dr. Hansen was just confused.

At this point, I decided to take control of the situation. Mattew was brilliant, truly, but also quite terrible with people. ""We're still researching a great deal of the implications and possibilities, but I'll be sure to keep you informed."" I smiled genially. ""Of course, further research requires further funding - and with so many possibilities to research, I expect that applications in any specific field could take a while to realize."" In my head, I grinned preditorily. The bidding war was now beginning mentally for everybody present. ""Of course, we expect other labs will probably be experimenting with different mediums, given our patents in this domain, and it's possible they will achieve similar results in 15-20 years!"" Though I said it enthusiastically, I knew exactly the effect my words had on those present. ""Our time is nearly up, but those of you who want may interact with the objects in the volume; it's perfectly safe - though it may feel a bit odd. Our associates will escort you when you're ready to leave.""

I nodded my head toward the interns, waiting concierge-like along the wall. At this I stepped back, made meaningful eye contact with Dr. Hansen, and gestured toward to the door as the delegates began approaching the plinth. Catching my drift, he stepped outside.

""Why did you tell them other labs could figure it out?!"" He demanded.

""Because they will, eventually - but that's not important. As long as those delegates think it's 15 years away, they'll want to give *us* their money now before somebody else can take advantage. Trust me, the offers are going to come pouring in. You'll see.""

\-------------------------------------

As it turned out, I was right. Very, very right. This technology was going to change the world - very soon - and the people in that room wanted to be a part of it. Adraneline junkies would pay for true zero-g entertainment, construction compaines would pay to ease the creation of impossible buildings, NASA would pay because *spaceships*, and the biggest offer, of course, came from the military.

""I can't bear to think what they would do with it."" Dr. Hansen was stubborn as a mule. He always was, and had an annoying habit of being right. ""It's mine, and I don't want them to have it. I didn't know you had even *invited* them.""

""It's mine, too,"" I reminded him. ""And you don't have to do anything. They've don't want a contract, they want to bring it in-house. Something about security..."" I trailed off.

""Ha! I'd like to see them try. It'd take somebody new to the field years to get competant enough to do anything.""

""Who says they need somebody new to the field?""

""Well, *I'm* certainly not going, and... oh, no. You've already accepted, haven't you?"" He looked crestfallen.

""I have. Listen, I understand your hesitance - I feel some of it, too, but I don't think an opportunity like this is going to come around again any time soon. We both own the tech, but it diverges as soon as the new contract goes into effect. NASA is still offering you a generous sum and you'll be able to continue your research uninterupted. I suppose you'll have to accept one of the interns in full fellowship, though."" I *did* feel bad for leaving, but this really was a once-in-a-lifetime chance. I could continue the research - as a *head researcher* \- with a budget ceiling higher than I could *dream* of, and facilities I had never imagined.

""I'll miss you.""

""I'll miss you, too - stay in touch.""

dzeduv,5,2019-11-21,Advice on delaying graduation for startup offer,throwaway123abcdp,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/dzeduv/advice_on_delaying_graduation_for_startup_offer/,"I need some advice. I'm a senior in college who took this fall semester off  school to intern at a startup. I intended to go back to school for this upcoming spring semester and graduate on time, but the startup has offered to convert me to full-time now and have written in the offer letter that I would take a sabbatical Fall 2020 to finish school (I only need 1 more semester to graduate) then come back as full-time employee again.  

The startup has been awesome (smart people, good environment, interesting work, lots of responsibility, etc) and if I take a ""normal"" offer (ie go back to school this spring then come as a full-time employee with my degree),I'll miss the design, development, and integration work for their first large product. By the time I get there, it'll be the ship date. I think the alternative offer they've provided rocks, but my family is EXTREMELY against it. At this point, whenever I mention that I would really like to take this offer, they start stonewalling me and any tries to reason with them get the same responses (""you need to graduate in 4 years"" or slippery slope-esque arguments) or screaming. Not sure if this provides any more context, but my family is asian and I think that has a role in their firm stance on this.

For context, if I took the alternative offer, I would graduate in 4.5 years rather than 4, I can still receive financial aid, and still have some friends around. I have other internships in the past and have received a couple other job offers so I am not worried I won't get a job without taking this one. I just think if I miss this ship, I won't get to do something as large as this for at least years in the future. My family argues that this isn't a unique opportunity, I'm getting caught up in the excitement, and should finish my degree since there's always work like this available. They don't care if I work at this company full-time after getting my degree.

I'm getting sad my family doesn't support this idea, and they are getting extremely angry/frustrated and are very clear they will not change their stance. I want some other thoughts, opinions, and questions from others. Any advice?"

I currently work in a small company as an intern where I don't really do data science but I use most of the libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn etc. I also write a lot of scripts. I love my company, it is really great but I don't know if they will offer me a position after my internship.

Pay is roughly the same (+/- 1000 over the course of the summer) to the point I don't think it's important compared to other aspects of consideration, namely experience and future prospects, but FWIW Nike is more.

&amp;#x200B;

Some background: I am a Mechanical Engineering major with a Computer Science minor, with previous ME internship experience, this summer hoping to get my first chops in the CS industry. I very strongly *don't* want to work on anything Mechanical Engineering-related because I have enough ME stuff on the resume for now, and desperately want experience in CS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Nike**

* Portland, OR
* Won't know what team I am on until right before I start--interns are apparently matched in April
   * Internship program is technically the Global Technology Internship and encompasses everything from this list...  
""Software Engineer, iOS Development, Android Developer, React Developer, Software QA Engineering, Mobile App Release Coordinating, Mobile App QA Specialist, RFID Software Engineer,¬† Site Reliability Engineer, Full Stack Developer, Cloud Security, Machine Learning, Analytics &amp; Reporting, Augmented Reality Product Developer""  
...it sounds like they place you based on where your resume would be the strongest fit, and since my resume reads ME-heavy at the moment, I am concerned I will be put far away from pure CS positions and pigeonholed into something ME-related. I have reached out to the recruiter and it seems I have little to no say in my own placement unfortunately.
* From what I have heard, better company culture
* Potentially a better-known name with tech companies?

&amp;#x200B;

**John Deere**

* Very small town on Iowa/Illinois border
   * Devil's advocate: I am a West Coast city kid, so this could be a good cultural experience for me to have
* I already know I will be working in CS doing cool things I am definitely interested in
* From what I have heard, bad company culture
   * I am LGBTQ+ and John Deere has ranked among the worst US companies for LGBTQ+ rights
* Although they do a lot of cool stuff in self-driving technology and computer vision, potentially less respected in Silicon Valley

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate any advice or experience with either of these internship programs. Thank you!"

dzh2pe,1,2019-11-21,Doing unpaid internship at a startup and don‚Äôt know how to ask my boss to stop expecting me to work outside of my work hours,heimweh_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dzh2pe/doing_unpaid_internship_at_a_startup_and_dont/,"I applied for an unpaid internship because it‚Äôs in a field that I don‚Äôt have experience in but am interested in exploring. I got the position but feel I‚Äôm expected to do work outside of my work hours.

Right before the internship started my boss sent an email detailing my responsibilities as an intern, in which I would work two days a week from 9-5 at the company‚Äôs office. The company is rly small and literally 99% of the time it‚Äôs just me and my boss working in the office. He tells me there‚Äôs a web developer and business development manager who work remotely, and I‚Äôve never met them yet. The only other person I‚Äôve met at the company who isn‚Äôt my boss, is this other intern whom I‚Äôve only met once.

I think due to how small the company is, I‚Äôm given rather important tasks such as representing the company and reaching out to influencers and editors and business partners etc. to build our brand. I enjoy how much responsibility is given to me and that I‚Äôm learning a lot, but I‚Äôm starting to feel I‚Äôm expected to work 24/7, especially for doing unpaid.

My boss would message me after work hours and on days when I don‚Äôt have work to check in on my work progress, on whom I‚Äôve contacted and how many more emails have I written.

And it sucks because the work I do involves constantly engaging with people and potential+existing clients, which makes me feel like a customer service rep who needs to be on her email all the time. This means more unpaid work outside of the two 9-5 days I am currently committed to.

But I don‚Äôt even know how to bring this up to my boss. He hires temp and part timers to do work such as content development, and sometimes I just feel like... why can‚Äôt you hire me as a part time and pay me??

I know I applied willingly knowing that it‚Äôs unpaid, but now I feel there‚Äôs a lot of expectation that I cannot commit to. Is there any advice? :( thanks..."

Some of my new additions are from a friend‚Äôs list, so I will have to verify availability individually.

These are all codes from Canadian GP, but I have a link to the Canadian GP site where they can be redeemed without having to do any strange workarounds. Some are MA compatible and some are not. I do not know which is which. They should all be HD, but I‚Äôm not  100% sure. These are from the Flixster shutdown in Canada. My sister successfully redeemed 37 of my codes from this in her USA GP account last night, so I know it works. Fox codes probably will not port via MA.

dzk9xq,4,2019-11-21,Any advice on how to become successful while having learning difficulties and memory problems?,enzio901,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/dzk9xq/any_advice_on_how_to_become_successful_while/,"Below I have given a short summary of my life. This feels like a rant and I don't know what kind of advice to expect. Anything is welcome. :)

**Childhood until age 16**

I am an only child to a middle class family in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka is a conservative majority buddhist country, similar to India.¬† Was not athletic at all.Kinda good at studies and did chess in school. Was shy, introverted and lived in my comfort zone bubble. Read sci-fi etc at home. 

**Age 16 - Discovery of Self improvement**

Before this I never tried anything new. I dated a girl in school (first time) for a few months. It ended pretty soon because I was needy, insecure. I noticed how some boys in school had more dating life than others and also had better leadership qualities among peers. After some naive internet searching I stumbling on the PUA community and through it the larger self improvement community online.

I started taking lot of action. I enrolled in societies in school such as Model United Nations, history society. I went to parties more, started learning about fashion, got enrolled in a gym, got enrolled in a krav maga class etc. At was becoming more confident. Girls and guys to whom I was invisible started talking to me.¬† Even my parents were happy at my progres. I saw that continuing this journey, in 5 years time I will be a mature man full of great experiences. Rather than being satisfied with the genetic abilities I inherited, I developed the growth mindset. That you could improve yourself my learning techniques and excel.

At that time I didn't have much of an idea about a future career path. I was very interested in science since childhood. But I had an aversion to maths. So, I thought maybe I will be a biologist.¬† I got very good marks for my ordinary level (OLs) exams and choose Biology, Physics, Maths and Chemistry for Advanced level (ALs).

**Noticing that I have a learning problem**

The courseload in AL's is way higher than OLs. And I soon found myself struggling. My experience is like this. Teacher teaches concept A in first part of lecture. Then teaches concept B that builds on concept A. I understand concept A but forgets it soon. So, I don't understand concept B at all. When I go home I read the textbooks and other resources and study concept A multiple times until it sticks and then goes to concept A. Still I have to restudy things every week to retain them. I was overwhelmed soon. (didn't know about anki flashcards at the time).¬† Teachers would complain that I don't pay attention in class not knowing my problem. But I would somehow get good marks at final exams so they didn't care in the end.¬†

Because of my self improvement mindset I have started other things as well. I experience this same slow learning problem in what ever I tried to learn. I had to practice the karate move so many times more than others. Same with swimming, learning to drive etc. All those instructors/teachers get frustrated at me and complain that I don't pay attention and that's why I don't learn. But in reality I was paying maximum attention but It just doesn't stick in my mind. I have to repeat it countless times. 

And another wierd problem I noticed was that I absolutely had no sense of direction. When I go somewhere I don't remember enough to retrace my way back. I go somewhere 50 times and still forget how to go there. I only remember very distinguishable landmarks such as churches, temples, rivers, bridges, parks etc. But the city is made up of mundane similar looking buildings. I had to use google maps to even remember the stop I have to take in the bus sometimes.

I have a poor short term memory. Forgets peope's names instantly. Don't rememer the names of roads, shops, restaurants work places etc. ¬†

At the end of my AL's I was stuck in a cycle of doing, redoing, studying, restudying the course material with only around 6 hours of daily sleep. At the end I got 3A's and a B. But I was completetly burnt out.¬† And my self esteem had plumutted because I saw no improvement in personal development goals besides my academic goals.¬† I saw several psychologists regarding low self-esteem but none help. They just did CBT and lectured without actually listening the underlying issues behind my low-self esteem.

**Memory techniques**

I learned loci technique and other techniques such as converting information into visuals. The latter helped somewhat but the loci was useless because anyway I had a poor spartial memory to begin with.

**University abroad**

I thought that better for me to do accounting than science since the former was too difficult. And I was sick of the culture here and thought going to a western country would help me find more like minded people.

I had no one else to advice me and my parents took a student loan and let me go to Australia to study accounting. Compared to science the courseload was very light.¬† I got good marks in first semester exams evernthough I haven't done the subject in my OL's and AL's. 

I also got in touch with the local PUA community because that was the only self improvement community that I knew. They were all great and not like toxic, sexist people we hear on the news. (Maybe it's the city). One Japanese guy was teaching us meditation and spirituality also.¬† ¬†

One day I was discussing life with a similar aged guy I met on this community and we were discussing about living a meaningful life. And I was speechless when he asked me why I did accounting. I had no interest in it. All my life I wanted to do science.

Then I read books by Babara Oakley. She teaches that everyone can do maths and science with proper learning techniques.¬† Then I discovered CS and switched majors in second semester.¬† That was terrible. Dispite the learning techniques, I failed all my exams.¬† I had two option, go back into accounting or go home and try to do CS with the support of my parents. (With No cooking, chores related to living alone etc). I choose to come back. So, I have wasted an year of my life and significant potion of the loan my dad took for my education. I felt like a failure.¬† W¬†

**Starting the degree in sri lanka**

I moved in with my parents again and started a software engineering degree at an institute affiliated with a UK university. I was ashamed to even talk with some people I knew. The courseload was not as challenging as the one abroad. And I have kinda mastered using Anki flashcards at this point. So, with better study techniques and support from my parents I ended my 2nd year with a good GPA.

¬†

**Internship**

I was selected at one of the top 10 software engineering companies to do the mandatory one year internship required by my degree. This was another failure. Most of my peers including ones who went to less recognized companies got the opportunity to work in a single technlogy the entire year. I was shuffled around 3 different teams doing different technologies. Being a slow learner as myself it was hard. And I never learned one thing deeply. And there were periods of time where I didn't have work for months. Other than my last project that lasted around 4 months I didn't get to work with production software and was assigned to research tasks. My peers could create a professional mobile application or a full stack app from scratch but I felt incompentent. I doubted myself whether I am cut for this profession. After 1 year of working in the industry I'm not proficient in any web development framework.

¬†

**Present**

I'm doing my final year in uni. I made some lifestyle changes and managed to go to the gym 3 times a week consistentlly for 5 months now. I learned how to swim after 25 years of not being able to. Still I'm not learning things like cooking etc beause I get overwhelmed when there are too many things.

Still sometimes I pointlessly think about my past failures and wastes hours on the internet researching about memory, neuroscience, nootropics etc. I regret wasting my parents money. I regret wasting years of my life. I regret not just doing accounting and staying in australia. I know I should be focusing on the tasks at hand like getting a good grade in my exam and continuing the good habits already doing. There are people who have it far worse than I am. I still have supportive parents path in my life. Most of the time I manage to stay focused and productive. But sometimes like today I go off and just ruminate on these things that will not help me. It seems like my memory problems¬† cannot be fixed and I will have to learn to live with it. Like Using gps to go to places I have gone before. But this so damn hard. 

I went to a psychiatrist who said I don't need any meditation at the moment and I will begin improving my self esteem when I complete my education, start a career and start becoming independent.

**Dating**

Ironically my self improvement journey started with wanting to date. But I shelved this in a rather unhealthy manner trying to keep my academic life afloat and trying to fix my mental health. Dating culture is more conservative than the west. People date to get married. There are no casual affairs unless you are a cassanova who know how to make it happen. Eventhough I am somewhat stable in my academics right now I didn't want to try dating until atleast my education is complete. I tend to get into depressive episodes when stressful things happen.

I know this postponing is unhealthy but I need to be realistic in my life and prioritize learning from my past experiences/failures. And I feel like I'm not ready to get into a relationship right now having unresolved issues myself. All I want is to date many girls and maybe have sex without being too serious and hopefully it will lead into finding someone I find interesting and will lead into a relationship. I 

**Future plans**

Complete my degree with a good class.

Work one year (or 2 if not enough) in a company and get some experience.

Meanwhile learn lifeskills such as cooking. Start solo travelling around Sri Lanka to gain experience and confidence. Continue going to the gym and swimming. More interaction and flirting with the opposite sex. Without exceptations ofroucse. just for fun and experience.

Apply for PR to Canada as a skilled migrant.

Migrate to Canada. Get some initial support form my cousin and her husband. She's very close to me.

Find a job, apartment car etc.

At this point I will be somewhat confident in my abilities. Physically fit. Travelled and more experienced.

Start dating maybe.

Start living in a culture feel belonged."

dzpp61,21,2019-11-21,The Belmont School,ShyWheatSeeds,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/dzpp61/the_belmont_school/,"&amp;#x200B;

Born to a family in America‚Äôs lower middle class, I worked my way through a bachelor‚Äôs in mathematics. For whatever reason, I had loads of trouble finding internships throughout university. I got one, but it was volunteer. The work was good, I was helping organize bee farms in a village in Africa, but as I needed money I couldn‚Äôt dedicate much to that. I had to work. I worked in restaurants and did manual labor mostly. After I graduated, I still couldn‚Äôt find meaningful (read: high paying and/or interesting) so I got a job with a moving company. Moving things.

It was here that I felt the most horrible reality I had ever had to face so far in my life. It was here I realized no matter how much I worked, no matter how much I studied, no matter how much I appreciated the world and culture, that I would never be able to leave my caste. I was set far behind from the bourgeoisie, and I was low class. End of story. This moving company allowed me to feel the full weight of that.

One Saturday, the crew and I had to empty a high end private elementary school in a very wealthy town. I got there about 6am with my team and we started emptying it out. People started showing up for whatever reason. There were two ways we were looked at by the people within the establishment 1) with pity 2) with disgust. It was plainly obvious that we were different. First of all, our group was a motley one, varying races and ethnic/cultural backgrounds, I mean. Our masters on the other hand were entirely white. The older women who looked at us almost uniformly did it with pity, and they even attempted to ‚Äòtip‚Äô us. Personally, I find that extremely degrading, so I was put in a horribly bad mood already. Almost all the men and many of the middle-aged women looked at us with disgust. Almost as if they did not recognize us as human. \*I should mention at this point that the *vast* majority of folks here did not even notice us or ignored us, this is a fairly small minority of people I am talking about with disgust/pity\* I say this because at least three of us were almost hit by cars, as though we were rodents in the way of their Escalades, in the parking lot. 

The day was wearing on and we were all exhausted. I became almost physically ill when the manager of our company came and brownnosed the super of the school and I even heard him apologize for some of the men‚Äôs appearance. I was appalled and disgusted. Now it is about ninety-five degrees and I am exhausted. I start walking back towards the cigarette scented semi that took me here when I hear something very nice. It was part of Mozart‚Äôs 40th symphony. Neither the tonality nor musicality was there, but I love art pretty much always. It was very refreshing after a day of work to hear the piece. I fell into the gravitational field of the music and wandered closer, unconsciously. Finally, I saw a bunch of children playing the piece with a woman probably in her fifties conducting it. I watched for a few moments and went from happy to hear the music to completely dejected. It was as though I had become awakened from a dream. I realized in that moment; I could not be like them. I love their music, I love their art, I love their easy lifestyle, I desperately want to have their educations and opportunities, but right then, I realized that those things aren‚Äôt for me. They are for them. I am a utility, I help their communities run, I do the work they don‚Äôt want to, and what do I get for it? I get ignored. I get pitied. I remembered all the times I spoke to people above my caste, ‚ÄúOh wow, you know Schoenberg? I am very surprised‚Äù or the most memorable one, ‚ÄúI believe that even people like you could achieve in an elite university‚Äù. The realization crushed me with an immense weight, almost making me drop to my knees.  I have never felt more worthless or hopeless than in that moment. I wept when I got home until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I went to the next job.

Postscript:

This was written about a year ago, I would like to raise everyone‚Äôs spirits a bit with an update. I still can‚Äôt find work and now my student loans are due. Also, as a result of the nature of my work, I have a severe back injury as well as nerve and muscle damage in my thumb. Hope that this post brings everyone up üòä"

dzq01z,16,2019-11-21,Seeking advice from Software Engineers with ADHD,ADDeveloper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dzq01z/seeking_advice_from_software_engineers_with_adhd/,"Hi all,

I recently created this account to post on something that I, as well as hopefully others who can align with this, have been deeply concerned about. My goal from this post is to, by sharing my problem, hopefully answer a question others in my position may have.

I‚Äôm about to graduate from a fairly reputable university and have signed an offer with a tech company I‚Äôve interned with over two summers, but am terrified about starting because of how limited I feel by my ADHD. I‚Äôm unable to stay focused in more technical meetings, where even a brief lapse in focus means potentially missing a crucial detail that subsequent details build off of. And even when I am focused in, I will try to digest an important detail and potentially end up missing those subsequent details ‚Äî and in the process of trying to catch up sometimes I‚Äôll forget the detail I had just spent time trying to understand. I feel like I was only able to make it through my first internship because of my partners who contributed so much to the discussions of our meetings. 

For instance, in class I could be trying to focus on a lecture slide that enumerates viewpoints of a specific issue. I will attempt to memorize even two of these points, but 5-10 slides later I will have a fuzzy recollection of those two points. And it‚Äôs been this way for me since grade school. I‚Äôll read a paragraph and have no idea what I just read. I‚Äôve always had to work a little harder.

Or, I‚Äôll be listening to the impeachment hearings going on trying to gather details on individuals‚Äô testimonies, connect names to roles, all while trying to understand how the testimonies given contribute to the bigger picture. But by the end of it I feel like I‚Äôve barely retained any of the information. This was my latest attempt at assessing how poor my ability to focus is.

I want to know if there are others who have been through this as well and could offer any advice on how to overcome this.

dzq8fm,11,2019-11-21,"After 6 years installing cable, IT sounds like the future career for me, but I need some advice making the transition.",mandolinmike,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/dzq8fm/after_6_years_installing_cable_it_sounds_like_the/,"I've been working as a Broadband Technician for almost six years and I've reached a burnout point where I really, really dread going to work every day. Any cable tech could tell you our frustrations. Between the pressures and inefficiencies in the company, to the hazards and absurdities we face every day on customer premises, lasting as long as I have in this job puts me in a rare tier in this field. I've seen techs come and go: some were duds, but others stuck it out until they could move up or move out onto something else. I'll admit I never really applied myself to go after any promotions or role changes over the years. I guess I was just always apprehensive about staying with the cable company for the rest of my life. I always thought I could do more, better, with a more respectable company. I didn't really choose this job. I needed one after moving states and the timing was right for me to get hired right when I needed work the most. I just kept working here because the work is definitely consistent, I work with a great team, and I'm REALLY good at my job, but I'm stressed and anxious about my future here. It's already a stretch you break you career, but the industry is brutal. My company was recently acquired in a merger and the new leadership made some terrible decisions over the summer and botched a systems conversion that utterly decimated the reputation we had been building with our customer base for years and years even before I started. Now that the the band-aid has been ripped off and everyone in the multi-brand telecom corporation is on the same system, things are starting to improve internally, but employee morale has never been lower.

Before all of that happened, I had decided to change my attitude and try to present myself to management as a leader who was dedicated, motivated, and ready to improve my station in life. I've been consistently recognized as one of the top performers on our crew when it comes to customer satisfaction, technical knowledge, workmanship skills, and troubleshooting ability with install and service. The relationships and confidence I've built in my time here will last for years. There just doesn't seem to be a place for me to go within the company. I missed my chance to put in for the last System Maintenance opening (which is the usual career path for an installer). I thought I'd be able to get my foot into a back-office role but there just isn't much upward movement for them either. There's an opening for a project manager job in our (excellent) IP Hosted Voice department, but it would be a huge jump in responsibility and pressure, lots of travel, big commercial accounts that I would be responsible for, but I love the tech and the way the department seems to be organized (of course that could change with the new ownership). For other internal positions, I can't relocate because my wife and I just finished building our first home and dammit we want to enjoy it for a while!

There's a lot more I could say about my cable career, but in short, I just know I'm ready for a change either in or out of the company. I know there's a lot more to learn and I've been wanting to go back to school for a while but I couldn't decide precisely what I wanted to study. I have many interests and passions, but it's hard for me to focus on just one long enough to make a career out of it. I took some time off this week to come up with a plan and I very quickly found this subreddit (thanks everyone!) and after some conversations with friends and family, I decided the best logical step for me is to get into IT. I had worked in AppleCare doing iOS phone support, and that helped me get into cable. I know cable will help me get into IT. I really love working in a commercial and small business environment more than anywhere else. My current responsibilities pretty much take me all the way up to the point where an IT pro would step in a take over. For instance, I'll provide the Static IP information to a business, but I don't configure it. I can set up an internet connection up to the firewall, managed switch, or whatever but I can't troubleshoot or configure anything past that point. I know I can learn all of that and more, but I just don't have the formal training and knowledge. I don't think I will have any problems learning IT, I've just never needed to until now. I've met a lot of IT pros either at a business I'm servicing or working remote from home. They all seem to be happy enough in their jobs and I'm sure they are paid more, but then again I never asked.

I have applied to our community college and plan to enroll in their 2-Year IT program. I haven't decided if I am going to quit my job and go full time, keep doing cable and wait for something to open, or do school and cable so I can keep my income while I learn. My work/life balance is already very unstable with the nature of my current job. Adding school on top of that is a challenge that I don't think I have the energy for. I took one self-paced NCTI course that my company paid for and I barely finished before the deadline, and it was EASY, I just didn't have much free time to work on it (I'm still waiting for the $0.30 raise they promised for passing the course, too.) I thought about asking my boss for a reassignment, or just work part time, or anything, but I don't know what he could even pull if he wanted to.

TL;DR, I'm tired and burned-out of installing cable. There aren't many options for upward mobility in my company, and I believe IT would be the next logical direction to advance my career.

Now that you've made it this far, here are some questions:

I've seen here that experience is most useful, followed by degrees and certs. Would my six years of recognized service in cable stand out to anyone hiring for IT such that I could bypass some of the schooling or at least fast-track me through the entry-level help desk jobs and internships? I'm already smart, professional, great at customer service and troubleshooting, but there are some pretty big gaps in my knowledge of the more specific systems and responsibilities in IT. I would really enjoy schooling and learning what I need to know, but could I apply time served and get my foot in somewhere and learn on the job while I work towards certs and a degree? Would a two-year employment-gap look bad on a resume for an IT position if that two years had been dedicated to my re-education? Is a two-year enough or should I aim at a four-year degree?

Some of my current and former coworkers have their CompTIA A+ or were hired by my company out of the college's IT program. It's not a job requirement by any means, and the IT grads I think were able to get better jobs pretty quickly. I know it's good entry-level job experience when you have nothing, but I just want to be sure that when I step out of the classroom, I won't just be recruited back into the dead-end job I'm leaving. Is there a more valuable cert to pursue first like the CCNA or is it really better just to get them all?

I haven't thought much about precisely which field I would do best in. Anyone with cable experience who found any focuses easier than others to transition into? Or should I just get the basics taken care of and specialize later when I find what I enjoy the most?

I know I'll come up with more questions as I keep moving forward, but I appreciate any feedback or comments. Thanks for reading and for all the help!

&amp;#x200B;

I should also mention that my wife is in a stable place with her career in graphic design and marketing. I'm only considering this plan because we are in a short window where I can afford to quit my job for school and our budget/finances won't be too much for her salary (she's already earning more than I do right now). I'd prefer to keep working or find something part time, but I'm already stretched pretty thin."

However, I'm still uncertain about where I want to work after graduation and realize that getting a FANG SWE internship on my resume could open more doors. Especially since I have a poor GPA (3.1) and don't come from a prestigious school, is the recognition from this position something that I just shouldn't give up? I'm having trouble determining what I should prioritize, and would appreciate advice from people who were previously in similar situations with similar backgrounds.

I'm also curious to hear about other dilemmas you may have had in choosing between SWE internship offers and what ultimately influenced your decisions.

*Below is my running pros/cons list:*

**FANG**  
\+ Brand name  
\+ Seattle  
\+ Pay ($50/hr vs. $44/hr)

I'm really enjoying not just the work here but the overall aspects of programming that up until now I only really saw as a hobby/possible side income. 


As someone not graduating with a CS degree, are big international hotels generally an option for CS work? Would they have international postings? I'm trying to get out of the US for a few years to have a better quality of life (say what you will, I'm not like most of you with a CS degree who can walk into a company offering free healthcare). The way I see it, they have outposts abroad and are in need of those with 'tech skills' to manage back-end, booking apps, whatever it is. I've seen airlines offer good benefits as well but those are few and far between (Alaska Airlines comes to mind... but then I'd need to live in Alaska).


Edit: Currently in the DC metro area of the US, main areas I'm targeting are East Asia, the EU (Central Europe, Poland and Hungary come to mind), Balkans, Turkey, UAE, Georgia. In my head as long as I can clear 50k (or an equivalently high-ish salary for wherever I am) I feel like I'll be okay."

I also have a significant other, but they're in med school and busy a lot of the time. I see them sometimes, and they know my situation, but it's not like they could understand.

I have a few hobbies, but they only go so far (i.e. writing stories, playing video games, watching a couple of YouTubers I like, practicing with makeup, going out with friends or partner on weekends, etc.) I'm so bored and I feel helpless a lot of the time... I want nothing more than to be working again, having a work schedule to regularly occupy my time. And also, regulate my sleep schedule. Some nights, I can't sleep for a while, and I'll just lay there thinking about how much of a failure I am. I have a lot of job experience, and yet barely any interviews. The interviews I did have were not the right fit for me or vice versa. I want nothing more than to be happy... I have struggled with highs and lows since I was 16 and began pursuing romance (and getting my heart broken ALOT). I used to tell my mom that maybe I was bipolar, but she disagreed. Friends also didn't agree. But I dunno... it seems when I'm up, I'm great, and when I'm down, I just wanna hide in a hole and not come out. Aside from the boredom and feeling like a failure as an adult, I want a job so I can pay off some existing credit card debt I accumulated and then begin saving up in a checkings account so I can eventually move out on my own. I have goals, but yet, without a job, I'm not sure I'd ever be able to achieve them. I want to be happy. But these 3 months have dragged on... and it seriously feels like it's never going to end. I want to believe things will turn out in my favor... but nothing has changed, so how can I be so sure?

I just got the offer to continue working at that company after the internship ends. I have some Software Engineering basics, I know some clean code, design patterns, SOLID principle etc. I've worked on an iOS app for awhile for fun, and I really like Swift. Used Texture, RxSwift, and Realm, architecturing with MVVM etc, published to Github and got some stars. I've been in web development for awhile too, I'm familiar with the current landscape of web development, familiar with Javascript, Typescript, React, Vue, and framework concepts, building with webpack. I've made a pretty nice personal portfolio website and that's one of the reason why my company accepts me as an intern. Not to flex but I'm actually considered as a 'pretty smart guy' at my office, although I'm not really smart, I just like to learn new things.

I wanted to try out iOS development and work as a team on a huge app, architecturing an app, and learning more about Software Engineering in general. But at the same time I had this long term goal to move to a company in Singapore (close to my family and friends) as a Web Engineer and if I decided to continue my career as an iOS developer. I fear that I won't be competent for a Web Development job after a long hiatus. But from another standpoint, if I'm familiar or learn enough Software Engineering from the iOS job, It shouldn't be hard to re-learn the overall web development. And if I decided to continue as an iOS developer in Singapore, at the same time I'm afraid that I won't be qualified for that as Singapore's tech landscape is pretty competitive.

I know this post is pretty chaotic in structure, but I really need some opinion to shed some light on the decision that'll effect my future career. Every opinion will be appreciated! Thanks!!"

About a week ago,while going about my usual routine, I saw this guy leaving the store with a backpack that looked filled with stuff. Unfortunately due to my store's policy I couldn't stop him, and was only able to inform my on-duty supervisor about the incident. He checks on the aisle we saw the guy leaving an informs me that he took over $600 worth of cosmetics. Now, while my supervisor is telling how we're going to deal with what just happened, I'm ringing up a huge line of customers (there's only 2 of us working the night shift). One of these customers happens to be a girl that's trying to buy alcohol. Now, I always ask for ID when people buy alcohol regardless of their age, but with the huge line, plus the incident that had occurred no less than 5 minutes ago, my mind went blind. I simply looked at her, asked for a DOB, and sold it to her.

About 10 minutes later, she comes back, along with two LAPD officers. They inform me that they were conducting a sting operation, and that I had just sold alcohol to a minor. They asked me for my ID, and whether this was my first offense (which it was).  They then gave me a copy of my citation, told me to attend STAR training, and told me I have to go to court on December 4.  My manager said I won't be getting fired, but I for sure will be getting written up.

I looked up the BP Code and found that selling alcohol to a minor can be punishable by up a $1000 fine and jail time. 

Where do I go from here? I've never been through something like this and my parents don't know what to do either. 

How bad will this be in the future when I apply for jobs and internships?

Any advice would be helpful!"
dzyim5,1,2019-11-22,I‚Äôm debating transferring into MIS rather than CS when I go to university due to the quality of the education. I need some guidance in the right direction.,urnight,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/dzyim5/im_debating_transferring_into_mis_rather_than_cs/,"I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry. 

I am looking for advice. So I‚Äôm at my CC right now finish up transfer credits for an AS in Computer Science to go to a university for BS in CS. What I have heard from a people who go to the university is that the Math/Science college is not really well funded or known. I don‚Äôt personally know anyone in the program so I can‚Äôt actually ask. From what I‚Äôve seen on linked in, only 1 CS major has gotten an internship at FAANGs. One person I spoke to told me to consider MIS instead since the business college is well funded and more well known companies from the area (oil/gas/etc) recruit MIS majors for tech internships instead of CS. The business career fair is very private apparently. When I look at the internship descriptions, there is a bit of programming involved. 

Long term, I‚Äôm not really sure what I want to specialize in CS for. I like to actually code, but that‚Äôs all I have experience with from my classes. I don‚Äôt know what specific field I want to develop software for, but the oil/gas field doesn‚Äôt really interest me. Or if I want to even do software. There‚Äôs robotics, data analysis, project lead, consultants, web dev, so many things. I may be interested in management too. But if that‚Äôs the case I may be an MBA after I get my BS in CS? I don‚Äôt know? I know the first step is for me to get an internship, but I don‚Äôt want to hurt my chances of getting one by choosing CS at this university. I know the program is accredited by ABET, but the college doesn‚Äôt even seem to be nationally ranked.. and i would like to get a big internship at least my last year.. 

At some point in my career, I would like the ability to work remotely so I can work on other personal project and travel for a little, but still live comfortably while I work maybe.. Idk what careers in tech offer that? But right after college, I definitely want to have experience at an actual place for some years. So what can I do to help me decide what I should go for? Should I risk having a bad quality CS experience for better prospects long term? I don‚Äôt want my love and curiosity for CS to get taken away by this.. Or should I go with the immediate ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù MIS option to get an internship/network/connection to see if I like it, but risk my long term job prospects? 

Im sorry this post is all over the place and not very organized. I just need some guidance in the right direction.."

What I noticed about people in my office is that many of them started at this company right after graduating from the local university (CS degree of course), I guess often with internship. Moreover, most of them never left, meaning that there's a disproportional amount of developers this company who don't have any other professional experience - no other company, no OSS contribution, nothing, but some of them are working for this company for 3+ years.

Seems like there was a sudden wave of people graduation about the same time coming together and staying ever since. Now of course, 3 years of professional experience isn't that much but I've seen some being here in the same position for more than *six* years.

It bugs me because it seems unusual for me. In my head, the average software developer of my age (25-30) had at least two different jobs, none of which was longer than 3-4 years.

Is it ordinary *in general* that entrants stay at the same place for half a decade or even more? What's your experience?

I guess financial stability is the major contributing factor here."

I was hoping to get a little advice on a situation I've been in.  
I've been the acting CTO of a company for a few years, the company is family owned so I'm not trying to make a legal strike or anything. I was just mislead on how I would be able report my position so I want to try to make the most out of it without getting anyone in trouble.  


For the last 4 or 5 years (I forget which year I started specifically) I've been the acting IT department for a company. At first I was told I would be listed as an employee, I just wouldn't be paid (I was fine with this as it wasn't supposed to be much work). From there I was in charge of pretty much everything from network and server setup and management to purchasing, configuring, and deploying user devices. If it was IT related, I did it.  


I was never listed as an employee of this company. There is no official record of me doing work for this company at all.  
Then I was offered the title of ""intern"". After that I cut ties with the company, feeling insulted by this move, I informed the board that I was leaving and stopped answering their calls.  


Is there a way I can claim this experience on a resume without landing myself in hot water?  
I don't want to sue or engage in legal recourse. I just want to see what I can take from this outside of personal experience.  


Any sound advice here is appreciated. And I already know I'm likely looking at a ""take the L and sit down"" situation so to anyone looking to confirm that all I ask is that you be gentle. The booty still a little tender."

After my on-site with the Unicorn, I fell in love with the company's culture, product, and people, and truly feel like it is the place where I could learn and grow the most. However, I'm still uncertain about where I want to work after graduation and realize that getting a FANG SWE internship on my resume could open more doors. Especially since I have a poor GPA (3.1) and don't come from a prestigious school, is the recognition from this position something that I just shouldn't give up? I'm having trouble determining what I should prioritize, and would appreciate advice from people who were previously in similar situations with similar backgrounds.

I'm also curious to hear about other dilemmas you may have had in choosing between SWE internship offers and what ultimately influenced your decisions.

*Below is my running pros/cons list:*

**FANG**  
\+ Brand name  
\+ Seattle  
\+ Pay ($50/hr vs. $44/hr)

So to begin, my friends family owns an apartment in my university‚Äôs city. My friend unfortunately hasn‚Äôt had the greatest luck with previous roommates and a week into a new tenant moving in they moved out. In doing so, my friends family asked me to move in (for a little bit of a discounted rate) and I agreed. I have a heavy course load this semester and my house is about a half hour away from campus. So I helped out the family. 

We have been completely fine and have gotten along, my issue is that I got accepted for an internship in a completely different city. Randomly in September I decided to apply for a very prestigious internship not thinking I was going to get accepted. Surprisingly I got accepted, and told my best friend and my friends mom (landlord) that I would have to move out in December, as my internship begins at the end of January and I need to save money to move to a different city. 

I re-read my lease and they never mentioned anywhere in said lease about breaking it. I‚Äôve only leased at one other place before this and it clearly mentioned what was to be done if I broke the lease, this lease doesn‚Äôt have anything besides abandoning. Also, there‚Äôs a specific subsection about no subleasing. Which I understand as my friend doesn‚Äôt want to live with a stranger. 

The thing is I told my landlord that I will be moving out all the way back in September and I don‚Äôt think they have even began looking for a new tenant and I cannot afford to be charged the remainder of rent as my internship pays very little and have to pay for an apartment in the new city and the lease ends in June. 

I just need help, what should I do? I‚Äôve been trying to save up but it‚Äôs incredibly hard being a full time student and only having a part time job and having to pay the current rent and everyday living expenses. I‚Äôm scared their going to sue me or I will have to decline the internship that I‚Äôve already paid my fees for."

After a long tedious internship search I finally landed myself a few SWE internship offers, notably at Affirm and that giant tech company in Redmond, WA that rhymes with wicrosoft. After the below average recruiting season I went through this year (150+ applications, \~20% response rate (\~60% of which were resume rejections)), I really want to optimize for brand name so that it'll open up more doors when I recruit for new grad roles next year. (Learning is important too ofc but I assume i'll be learning a lot wherever I choose to go). It esp stings when I see all my friends with big name internships practically interviewing at any company they want. I will mainly be shooting for FAANG type companies and interesting large startups in CA like Dropbox/Airbnb

Leaning towards the internship in WA now because of the security in brand name, but i've heard that Affirm is arguably comparable in terms of engineering reputation. At the same time, Affirm seems like a more interesting company to work for in terms of company trajectory, and the people I met there were really intelligent and interesting (they also pay quite a bit more for new grad roles)

To sum up, my considerations are:

1) Brand Name - I haven't decided on what kind of company I want to work for eventually, but I want to have options!  
2) Learning - I want to do interesting work during my internship and have good mentors to guide the learning process. 
3) New Grad TC - I want to earn a competitive pay when I graduate the following year. (just being practical)

***M:***  
**Pros:**   
\- Brand Name - good for new grad recruiting next season (?)  
\- Cool intern program experience  
\- Interesting and highly technical team/product (possibly?) 

**Cons**:   
\- New Grad TC lower (in case of return offer)  
\- Bureaucracy? Laid back, corporate culture (?)
\- Not sure what team Ill be working on 

***Affirm:***  
**Pros:**  
\- Very high potential startup  
\- Interesting team placement 
\- Much better TC (in case of return offer)  
\- Interesting, intelligent people and amazing culture (from my limited interaction)

**Cons:**  
\- Is brand name as good (?) - for recruiting next season  
\- Product doesn't seem as technical

Wonder if anyone could give me some advice here (if i'm missing some consideration?) or about how valuable a SWE internship at Affirm might be on a resume as compared to the other one ? (assuming my previous experience is not impressive)"

Investigation into Missing Persons Case 3102015-14

Missing Person: Cole Jackson, Cleveland, OH. Reported missing 3-03-2015. Missing Persons Case opened 3-10-2015

#Summary:

Case went unsolved due to no evidence, and has remained untouched for just over three years when it was officially closed. New evidence was found recently that has led to the case being re-opened, and will be entered into this report.

---

#Evidence:

**3102015-14-A:** Hard drive recovered during a raid in Case 9012019-3. Once the drive was accessed there were a series of video files showing what might have been the final days of Cole Jackson, and two others who are also the subject of Missing Persons Cases.

Lydia Poole: Subject of Missing Persons Case 3072015-8. Known friend of Cole Jackson, cases were never officially linked due to lack of evidence.

John Beck: Subject of Missing Persons Case 3122015-17. Known friend of Cole Jackson, cases were never officially linked due to lack of evidence.

Hard drive contained various graphics assets for a show they appeared to be making together called ‚ÄúGhost Bros‚Äù. There were also a series of raw video recordings, and 10 finished episodes.

There was a fourth person credited as the editor, Alexandra Ellis, who was the subject of the raid in Case 9012019-3. She was questioned, but only confirms that after they dropped the drive off with her she never heard from them again.

#Transcript:

The following will be a written transcript of the episodes as they are processed.

**3102015-14-A-02: Ghost Bros Episode 7**

Episode opens showing Cole outside of a hotel on his phone. Footage is grainy, apparently filmed with an old camera. Appears to be a continuation of the footage from Episode 6.

&gt;Cole: Thanks, I‚Äôll see you sometime around then, yeah.

&gt;Unknown female behind camera: Another caught up in your lies.

Cole hangs up and starts walking back towards the room. The camera pushes through some plants and starts to follow him. The pace quickens and the feed gets real shaky and blurry as it rushes towards Cole, then grabs him by the back of the neck. Cole stiffens instantly. The camera slides around him until his face is centered. Only the whites of his eyes are showing.

&gt;Unknown female: Take it.

Her other hand enters the shot holding what appears to be an ornate ceremonial dagger. Cole accepts it.

&gt;Unknown female: Keep it hidden until the sky sings.

The camera pans down, showing Cole stow the blade in a pocket.

&gt;Unknown female: There will be a man and a woman with you when it happens. Kill them both.

Cole nods, then the camera slides back behind him. The hand releases his neck.

&gt;Unknown female: Go.

Cole walks away, appearing oblivious to what just happened. Cuts to a short intro sequence. Footage resumes outside a clinic. Cole is filming himself.

&gt;Cole: Hey guys, welcome back to Ghost Bros! You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôm outside this clinic. Well I‚Äôll show you!

Cuts to the footage of John Beck stumbling out of the bathroom coughing and vomiting, then back to Cole.

&gt;Cole: Turns out he‚Äôs probably fine, they‚Äôre just doing some checks to make sure.

Lydia steps out of the clinic behind him and walks out of the shot. Cole doesn‚Äôt seem to notice.

&gt;Cole: If you‚Äôve been watching you know we‚Äôve run into *far more* than our share of spooky encounters. Tomorrow night we‚Äôll be checking out one of the creepier ones I researched, so today we‚Äôre just going to take it easy.

Cole appears to check a text.

&gt;Cole: Okay, that‚Äôs them. No cameras inside, so, I‚Äôll see you guys in a bit.

Footage cuts and picks up in a restaurant. Camera is mounted so they are all in the frame.

&gt;Lydia: So what‚Äôd they say it was, Beck?

&gt;John: Stress, probably. All things considered, that makes sense.

&gt;Cole: Well, I sprung for a nice suite for tonight and tomorrow. Turns out Lake Orion has a good bit of touristy things we can get into. A lot of water sports stuff. You guys bring your swim suits?

&gt;John: Hell yeah I did.

&gt;Lydia: Never leave home without it.

&gt;Cole: Alright, well let‚Äôs finish breakfast and get to it.

Cuts to a montage of the three of them doing various things around Lake Orion. There are several shots of them out on the lake, then eating a nice looking lunch. Footage picks back up as they are getting massages. They are all lying on beds, mid massage.

&gt;Lydia: Why don‚Äôt we do this all the time forever?

&gt;Cole: Because it‚Äôs prohibitively expensive.

&gt;John: Well let‚Äôs rob some banks or something ‚Äòcause I did *not* know what I was missing out on, and this is what I‚Äôm about now. *Oh my god*, yes. Right there.

&gt;Lydia: Did Beck pay extra? What‚Äôs going on over there?

&gt;John: Hey, do that same thing to her, with your elbow.

Lydia‚Äôs masseuse uses his elbow on her back

&gt;Lydia: *Oh my gooooooooooooooood*.

&gt;John: Cole, I had my doubts. But this was the best idea you‚Äôve ever had.

&gt;Cole: I aim to *pleeeaaaa-oooooh my god*‚Ä¶

&gt;John: Ya‚Äôll need to patent that move, for real.

Footage cuts to a montage of the three of them running around town shopping in various stores. It picks up in a clothing store as Lydia is flipping through swim suits.

&gt;Lydia: Oooh, I love this! I‚Äôm gonna try it on.

&gt;Cole: Why do you need a bathing suit? You‚Äôre wearing one *right now*.

&gt;John: Dammit, Cole, let the woman get her shopping on!

&gt;Lydia: I know you boys would just throw on any old pair of shorts to hit the water, but for girls it‚Äôs also about looking good. And this looks *good*.

&gt;Cole: I mean, I don‚Äôt disagree.

&gt;John: Holy shit. Was that a compliment?

&gt;Cole: I compliment! I‚Äôm very complimentary!

&gt;Lydia: Just wait till you see me in it.

Lydia runs off.

&gt;John: This is real nice, man. More in line with what I was expecting from this road trip. Feels like it‚Äôs been forever since we just hung out.

&gt;Cole: That‚Äôs life, I guess.

&gt;John: Listen man, I hate that we drifted apart after high school.

&gt;Cole: No one‚Äôs fault. You had that internship taking up all your time. Di had all those family issues. I had my own stuff going on.

&gt;John: It was a lot harder getting that adult life started than I anticipated.

&gt;Cole: Same here. I can‚Äôt even imagine having to deal with all that stuff on Di‚Äôs plate.

&gt;John: Speak of the devil. Damn, girl!

&gt;Lydia: You guys like it?

&gt;Cole: Kev‚Äôs gonna wish he came with us for sure.

&gt;Lydia: Aww, you *do* know what a compliment is!

&gt;Cole: Do I not compliment you guys enough?

&gt;John: I mean, not really. Like, it‚Äôd be nice to know *I* was appreciated some time.

&gt;Cole: Well go try on one of those bikinis.

&gt;John: Oh, uh. I‚Äôm good with our current dynamic, I guess.

Cuts to a montage of the three of them back out on the lake. Footage picks up as they‚Äôre drying off next to some kind of storefront. John is filming using a head mounted camera. Lydia wraps a towel around her hair and picks up her bag.

&gt;Lydia: I‚Äôm gonna get changed, see you guys inside.

Cole and John nod, then Lydia walks around the corner. Footage cuts to grainy footage, apparently being shot from inside a women‚Äôs changing room. Lydia walks in and the camera approaches her rapidly. She looks up at the last moment before a hand reaches out and grabs her throat, pushing her back out of the room into the alley. She immediately goes stiff and drops everything she‚Äôs holding. Her pupils roll up leaving only the whites of her eyes visible. For a moment there is only heavy breathing from behind the camera.

&gt;Unknown female: Leave them. Go home.

Lydia doesn‚Äôt seem to react for a moment, then a tear runs down her face.

&gt;Lydia: I can‚Äôt.

The hand tightens on her throat.

&gt;Unknown female: *Leave them*.

&gt;Lydia: No.

The woman behind the camera grunts as she drags Lydia by the throat across the alley and slams her into a wall. Lydia doesn‚Äôt appear to react.

&gt;Unknown female, sounds desperate: ***LEAVE THEM***!

&gt;Lydia, while struggling to breath: I won‚Äôt.

The hand on her throat relaxes.

&gt;Unknown female, almost sounds like she‚Äôs crying: Please‚Ä¶

Lydia doesn‚Äôt react. 

&gt;Unknown male: Hey! What are you doing?

The feed pans left to see a man entering the alley walking towards them, then turns back to Lydia. The hand releases her throat and Lydia drops to the ground, completely limp. The camera lowers, and the hand caresses her face.

&gt;Unknown male: Get away from her!

The camera snaps back to the man and an inhuman scream is heard, which distorts badly in the low quality of the recording. The unknown man stops dead in his tracks and almost falls backwards. The camera rushes towards him, then footage cuts back to John‚Äôs camera. It snaps towards the alley as the scream is heard much more clearly.

&gt;John: Okay what the fuck was *that*?

&gt;Cole: Di‚Äôs back there.

They both get up and run toward the alley, Cole taking lead. A man stumbles backwards out of the alley holding his chest. Cole rushes to him.

&gt;Cole: Find DI!

Footage shows Cole catch the man as he falls, then swings right and settles on Lydia laying against a wall. Footage cuts back to the grainy camera watching John approach Lydia.

&gt;John: Di! Di, you okay!?

He leans over her and checks her over. The camera starts moving towards them.

&gt;John: Come on, Di‚Ä¶

Lydia seems to wake up at this point and grabs the back of her head.

&gt;Lydia: Ah‚Ä¶ Beck? What happened?

&gt;John: You okay?

&gt;Lydia: I think I hit my head.

The camera settles right behind John and a hand starts reaching out.

&gt;Cole: This guy isn‚Äôt looking good.

The camera backs up as Lydia and John look over toward Cole. It backs down the alley. Cole has started CPR on the man. Footage cuts and picks back up in the suite. John and Cole are sitting at a table.

&gt;John: Well that was a fucked up day.

&gt;Cole: Just to quickly bring you guys up to speed, the man from the alley died. He‚Äôd been stabbed, right through the heart apparently. Nothing anyone could have done.

&gt;John: Except not stab his ass, maybe.

&gt;Cole: Di was attacked, we think the man was trying to help, but she doesn‚Äôt remember anything until John was with her. Apparently she took a blow to the back of the head. She was checked out and is apparently fine, but she‚Äôs shaken up pretty bad.

&gt;John: Oh. Hey Di. We didn‚Äôt know if you wanted to be in this one.

Lydia walks into the shot and sits down between them.

&gt;Lydia: It‚Äôs fine. Listen, about the attack‚Ä¶

&gt;John: You don‚Äôt have to go through it now. You can‚Ä¶

&gt;Lydia: It‚Äôs alright, really. But‚Ä¶ I think I saw Liz.

&gt;Cole: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think‚Ä¶

&gt;Lydia: It was before I was attacked. Or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. It was right when I walked into the changing room. For a split second I saw‚Ä¶ It was her.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs kinda fucked up, but wouldn‚Äôt be the weirdest thing that happened to us.

&gt;Cole: Di, I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. For all of this.

&gt;Lydia: It‚Äôs okay. It was‚Ä¶ Somehow it‚Äôs comforting. Even just the thought of it, you know?

&gt;John: I get that.

&gt;Cole: Well tomorrow I was planning on doing some more vacation stuff before heading out to Scripp‚Äôs Road at night. If you guys don‚Äôt want to...

&gt;Lydia: We stay on the path, Cole. I‚Äôll need to rest, but we‚Äôre going to the‚Ä¶ whatever it is tomorrow night.

&gt;John: If Di‚Äôs good I‚Äôm there.

&gt;Cole: Alright. Well let‚Äôs get some rest.

&gt;John: Speaking of that; Cole, man. I‚Äôm digging this suite. We got three beds, baby!

&gt;Lydia: Yeah, can we just stay in suite for the rest of the trip?

&gt;Cole: My life‚Äôs savings only goes so far, guys.

Footage cuts and picks up in the car at night. Cole is filming with a head mounted camera while driving. Lydia and John are wearing them as well.

&gt;John: So you got us two more GoPros.

&gt;Cole: I just figured we get split up a lot. It‚Äôd be nice to have footage from everyone‚Äôs perspective.

&gt;Lydia: Well obviously I‚Äôm in favor of *not* splitting up.

&gt;John: That‚Äôs always the *plan*. So, tell us about these nuns.

&gt;Cole: Well, Scripp‚Äôs Mansion is a historical site. The mansion was used to help rehabilitate nuns who struggled with alcoholism.

&gt;John: Uh‚Ä¶ is that a thing?

&gt;Cole: Apparently.

&gt;Lydia: So when does it get ghosty?

&gt;Cole: Well apparently people see shadowy figures along Scripp‚Äôs Road. There‚Äôs sightings of them appearing to stand vigil at the gates of Scripp‚Äôs Mansion as well. I figure we‚Äôll just park on the far end of the wooded section, walk to the mansion gate, then back to the car. See what we get then go back to the suite.

&gt;John: For real, I can‚Äôt wait to get back to that suite, though.

&gt;Lydia: I think I‚Äôm going to move into the suite. That is going to be my life now.

&gt;John: Yeah, and have those massage guys come by every day.

&gt;Cole: Here we are.

They pull over to the side of the road get out of the car. The street is wooded and not well lit.

&gt;Lydia: So, this is straight up a spooky ass dirt road.

&gt;John: Well, it doesn‚Äôt really help the spook factor that this tiny stretch of wooded road is bookended by two neighborhoods.

&gt;Cole: Just be careful. There‚Äôs no street lights until we get to the main gate of the mansion, and this road is still pretty well used.

The three of them start walking down the road in silence. Footage switches to low light as they leave the street light, then cuts to Lydia‚Äôs camera.

&gt;Lydia: So, how are we supposed to be able to see shadowy figures out here? It‚Äôs basically pitch black.

&gt;John: Yeah, man. My eyes have barely adjusted enough to be able to see the road.

There is an audible splashing noise causing Lydia to turn and scream.

&gt;Lydia: You guys *have* to have heard that. Guys?

Lydia turns and Cole and John are gone.

&gt;Lydia: Guys?

There is another splashing noise from behind Lydia. She spins and there is a silhouette that appears to be female in the middle of the road. Lydia appears unable to see it in the low light.

&gt;Lydia: Who‚Äôs there?

The figure moves closer to Lydia. Loud wet footsteps can be heard.

&gt;Lydia: Cole? John?

The figure breaks into a sprint. Lydia appears to react to the sound and starts running as well, but she runs directly into the tree line.

&gt;Lydia: Ow, shit!

Footage shows her push through the brush. The wet footsteps sound like they‚Äôre getting closer and closer.

&gt;Lydia: JOHN!

Footage switches to John‚Äôs camera. He is alone in the middle of the road.

&gt;John: Cole? Di? Man, what the fuck.

He turns and there is a woman wearing all white floating in the middle of the street. She starts moving towards him.

&gt;John: This is some bullshit.

Footage switches to Cole‚Äôs camera.

&gt;Cole: I don‚Äôt know. Maybe they‚Äôll be darker than everything else? Di?

Cole turns and finds himself alone on the road. A pair of headlights pops up at the end of the road, so he steps back towards the brush.

&gt;Cole: Guys! Car coming! Watch out! Man, where the fuck‚Äôd you guys go?

There is a sound like children giggling behind him and he snaps around.

&gt;Cole: Hello?

Cole pushes into the brush a little bit. There is a barely audible sound of whispering.

&gt;Cole: Okay, ha ha.

He pushes a little further in and finds himself face to face with a child.

&gt;Unknown Child: I don‚Äôt like it here.

Cole gasps and jumps back. He looks right to see a truck baring down on him. He seems to panic and spins, then falls backwards into the brush. He turns to look behind him but there is no sign of the child. He turns to see the truck silently passing him. It‚Äôs an extremely old model. The man in the passenger seat locks eyes on him.

&gt;Cole: Oh shit.

Footage cuts to Lydia running through the woods.

&gt;Lydia: Get back!

There is a kind of gurgling scream from behind her.

&gt;Lydia: I‚Äôm sorry! I didn‚Äôt mean anything!

Lydia falls and the camera pops off her head and rolls a bit before resting against a foot. A woman picks it up, the footage panning up her body as she lifts it, but it turns before getting to her face. The camera turns to see Lydia lying on the ground holding her ankle.

&gt;Lydia: I‚Äôm sorry! Please!

There is another woman standing over her, soaking wet. She starts to reach down towards Lydia. Footage cuts to John looking at the lady in white as she approaches him.

&gt;John: Okay, first of all. Why are you coming after me? I didn‚Äôt even wanna *be* in that house.

She moves right up to him without a sound.

&gt;John: That was all Cole‚Äôs idea. Not that I think you should necessarily go haunt him or anything.

The woman in white looks over John‚Äôs shoulder. He follows her stare to find another woman in the road.

&gt;Unknown woman: Hello? Where am I? Oh God‚Ä¶

&gt;John: Hey, you alright?

&gt;Unknown woman: Who‚Äôs there? 

She backs away from John, terrified.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on either.

She continues to back away.

&gt;Unknown woman: Just.. just..

John stops.

&gt;John: Okay, it‚Äôs alright. I‚Äôm not gonna come any closer. Oh shit, hold on.

John looks back over his shoulder and the woman in white is gone.

&gt;John: Alright, look, if you walk away from me you‚Äôll get to a street light. Our car is parked there. Doors are unlocked, but feel to get in and lock yourself up. My phones in there, you can unlock it and call the cops. There‚Äôs not a code or anything.

The woman turns and starts to run. As she does the woman in white speeds by John towards her.

&gt;John: Shit! RUN LADY!

The woman turns and sees the woman in white. And falls backwards. The woman in white grabs her by the throat and turns to John.

&gt;John: Hey what the fuck! Let her go!

He runs up to her as the woman in white snakes a hand into the other woman‚Äôs pocket. She pulls out a slip of paper.

&gt;John: I said let her go!

The woman in white releases the other woman, then moves up to John and hands him the note.

&gt;John: This is‚Ä¶ my phone number‚Ä¶ Oh shit‚Ä¶

Feed cuts to Cole‚Äôs camera as he runs through the woods. The sound of a very loud engine can be heard behind him.

&gt;Cole: Fuck fuck fuck!

He breaks into a clearing and finds himself surround by children.

&gt;Unknown child: You said I could come.

&gt;Can I come too?

&gt;Where are we?

&gt;It‚Äôs dark, I don‚Äôt like it.

&gt;Who‚Äôs that behind you?

&gt;They‚Äôre scary.

&gt;I want to go home.

&gt;Where is my mommy?

The children begin talking over one another as Cole backs away. There is a sound of someone breaking into the clearing behind Cole, and he spins around to see Lydia and John.

&gt;John: Hey man, where have you been?

&gt;Lydia: We‚Äôve been looking for you!

&gt;John: Come on, hurry.

John grabs Cole‚Äôs hand and pulls him back into the woods.

&gt;Cole: You guys okay? What‚Äôs going on? Where‚Äôd you go?

&gt;Lydia: You just vanished suddenly. We‚Äôve been looking for you.

Cole pulls his hand away from John.

&gt;Cole: Seriously, guys. What‚Äôs happening?

&gt;John: We‚Äôre running out of time, we need to hurry.

&gt;Cole: Hurry for what? To the car?

&gt;Lydia: Just follow us, come on! There isn‚Äôt much time!

&gt;Cole: Alright, just‚Ä¶ You guys are okay, though?

&gt;John: Come on, man!

There is suddenly a very bright flash of light, the feed goes pure white for a couple of seconds.

&gt;Cole: What the‚Ä¶

Suddenly a sound erupts from all around them, almost like a chorus.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs too late. It‚Äôs happening.

&gt;Lydia: We tried.

Lydia turns to Cole.

&gt;Lydia: What are you doing?

The feed pans down and shows Cole digging through his pocket. He retrieves the ornate dagger.

&gt;John: Where did you get that?

Cole tears the sheath off and moves towards John.

&gt;John: Hey, whoa! Whoa!

Cole grabs his shoulder and thrusts the knife into his abdomen. John doubles over as Cole pulls it out, then he slams it into John‚Äôs back over and over. Lydia begins to scream.

&gt;Lydia: No! No no no! Why are you!?...

Cole turns on her and lunges.

&gt;Lydia: No! Get back!

He misses the grab for her arm, but she stumbles backwards.

&gt;Lydia: Get away! No! Don‚Äôt, please!

Cole drops a knee into her gut and grabs her by the throat, then stabs her over and over until she lies still.

&gt;Cole: What‚Ä¶

He stands up looking at the dagger in his hand.

&gt;Cole: What did I‚Ä¶

He looks down at Lydia.

&gt;Cole: Di‚Ä¶ Di?

Her body starts to twist and shift, and disolves into black smoke. He turns to see John‚Äôs body doing the same.

&gt;Cole: What‚Ä¶ John? Di?

Footage cuts to John helping a woman stand up.

&gt;Unknown woman: I thought she was gonna kill me‚Ä¶

&gt;John: It‚Äôs Candice, right?

&gt;Candice: How‚Ä¶

&gt;John: We exchanged numbers back in Cleveland, at that diner you work at.

&gt;Candice: I‚Ä¶ I remember you. John?

Lydia bursts from the tree line.

&gt;John: Di!

&gt;Lydia: John! Thank God!

She runs up and hugs him.

&gt;John: Candice, this is Di. You remember her?

&gt;Candice: Yeah. There was one more with you, right?

&gt;John: Yeah, where the fuck is Cole.

&gt;Cole: John?

John turns to see Cole standing behind him.

&gt;John: Oh man, thank God. Listen, this shit is getting crazy. We need to get back to the car and get the fuck out of here.

&gt;Cole: Is it really you?

Cole lifts up a dagger.

&gt;John: Of course it‚Äôs me? What's with the blade, man? You okay?

&gt;Cole: Di? That you?

&gt;Lydia: Of course it is.

&gt;Cole: I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶

John takes a step towards Cole.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs alright, man, just.

Cole jumps back and points the dagger at John.

&gt;Cole: STAY THE FUCK BACK!

&gt;John: Whoa, whoa. It‚Äôs alright buddy. We all just went through some scary shit. I don‚Äôt know what you saw, but it‚Äôs okay now.

&gt;Lydia: We need to get out of here.

&gt;Cole: That‚Äôs what the other one said. Just‚Ä¶

John walks up to Cole.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs okay, man. It‚Äôs okay. I know you aren‚Äôt gonna stab me.

&gt;Cole, breaking down: You don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ You don‚Äôt‚Ä¶

&gt;John: It‚Äôs alright, man.

John gets within arm‚Äôs reach. The dagger pokes into his chest a little.

&gt;John: It‚Äôs alright man, it‚Äôs me.

Cole drops the dagger and collapses. John drops down and puts an arm around him.

&gt;John: Let‚Äôs get back to the car, man. It‚Äôs alright.

Footage cuts and picks back up in the suite.

&gt;John: Welcome to our home away from home, Candice. You can take my bed.

&gt;Candice: I don‚Äôt want to impose‚Ä¶

&gt;John: It‚Äôs alright. Don‚Äôt worry about it. The couch here is better than my bed at home.

Cole walks into the room.

&gt;Cole: Alright, I got a cab to drive you back to Cleveland in the morning.

&gt;Candice: You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ not coming back? After all that?

&gt;John: We got one more thing to do. It‚Äôs hard to explain. Maybe someday we‚Äôll talk about it. Over dinner?

John holds out the slip of paper with his number. Candice looks at it, and back at him, then takes the note and folds it into her pocket.

&gt;Candice: Yeah, maybe.

Lydia walks into the room.

&gt;Lydia: Alright, shower‚Äôs all yours. I left you some clothes.

&gt;Candice: Thanks, Di.

Candice heads into the bathroom.

&gt;John: Okay so what the fuck happened tonight.

&gt;Cole: After we got separated I got chased by that fucking ghost truck from Sabina, then ran into all those kids again. Right after that I ran into what I thought was you two. They dragged me into the woods telling me we had to hurry, that we were running out of time. I don‚Äôt know what they meant, but suddenly there was this burst of light, then a sound like‚Ä¶ Like singing. In church. Next thing I know I‚Äôm stabbing the fuck out of both of you. It was like someone else was doing it *in* my body. I couldn‚Äôt stop, even though I could see it all happening‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶

&gt;John: That explains why you freaked out when you saw us. Where‚Äôd that freaky knife come from?

&gt;Cole: I don‚Äôt know. I just pulled it out of my pocket. I don‚Äôt know how it got in there, or how long it‚Äôs been there.

&gt;Lydia: About the light‚Ä¶

&gt;John: Yeah, that shit saved me and Candice‚Äôs asses. That fuckin lady in white from the Stone house showed up and was about to strangle her to death. I couldn‚Äôt do a damn thing, then that burst of light happened and the white bitch was gone.

&gt;Cole: How‚Äôd Candice get here?

&gt;John: I don‚Äôt know. She was as confused as I was when we found each other. We can try to talk with her about it when she‚Äôs out of the shower, I guess. But I‚Äôm thinking it was some ghost bullshit.

&gt;Lydia: The light. That was Liz.

&gt;Cole: No shit?

&gt;John: The fuck?

&gt;Lydia: That water lady or whatever from Euclid was chasing me. I tripped and my camera popped off. Suddenly that thing‚Ä¶ Grabbed my leg. I looked up and saw‚Ä¶ Liz. She was standing there holding my GoPro. She held up her hand and boom. Light. I couldn‚Äôt see or hear anything for like ten minutes. I ended up stumbling out of the tree line right in front of John.

&gt;John: That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fuckin *wild*. You sure it was Liz?

&gt;Lydia: ‚ÄòCourse I do. I can‚Äôt help feeling like she‚Äôs watching out for us, somehow.

John and Cole look at each other worriedly.

&gt;Cole: Alright, I know it‚Äôs getting intense, but we only got one more site to look at before heading home. Then we can get some professional help.

&gt;Lydia: Dare I even ask what we got coming up.

&gt;Cole: I murder house‚Ä¶

&gt;John: A *what*!?

&gt;Cole: A murder house. A house some people were murdered in.

&gt;John: By who?

&gt;Cole: No one knows.

&gt;John: Oh that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just fuckin great, Cole.

&gt;Lydia: Just one more‚Ä¶

&gt;Cole: Yeah. One more‚Ä¶

Cuts to a quick credits sequence. Footage picks back up from the grainy camera outside a house. A cab pulls up and Candice gets out of the car. She starts walking towards her house when an inhuman scream blasts out from behind the camera. It is heavily distorted. Candice turns holding her ears and looks right into the camera. She screams and starts to run, but the cameraman catches up to her extremely quickly. Footage cuts out, episode ends.

**Supplemental:** Candice Hines is *also* the subject of a missing persons case, one slightly pre-dating Cole Jackson‚Äôs. The woman in the video matches the photo of Candice Hines supplied to the investigators by her parents. Upon discovering it was her on the tape, her case was reopened as well. They‚Äôre investigation who ‚ÄúLiz‚Äù could be, but so far there isn‚Äôt anything officially listed.

After graduating I took a few more web development courses online (Colt Steele) because I had a bit of interest in learning more and most positions expect applicants to know the latest technologies (Vue, React, ExpressJS, etc). After taking some more courses I looked on here to see what I could do to get myself hired and posted my resume. The responses I got were to create a side project and work on solving programming problems. I struggled to figure out how to begin a programming project completely on my own and also was dealing with some irl issues of my own and haven't done anything since January of 2019. I have tried multiple times in that time frame to try to solve programming problems but ended up getting frustrated because I couldn't figure out how I could solve these problems and also how to start my own project. I had thought the internship I'd taken previously would help me get into a full time position but the internship was pretty lackluster imo. I feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunities to learn how to get hired, I had a program at my college that helped prep undergraduates to get into their positions called [CUNY Tech Prep](https://cunytechprep.nyc/), but I was already graduating when the program was running. I had looked into similar programs like [Outco](https://www.outco.io/), that would help me in a class environment to get myself ready for interviews but unsure if it is worth it.  I don't want to quit even though I'm sort of feeling like I'm not cut out for this but I guess that's impostor syndrome. It doesn't help that most of my classmates in college moved on to great positions and internships while I graduated with a 2.8 GPA struggling to get in the industry. I'm curious as to if it's still a good idea to try to get into another internship as maybe that will help me get into a position. Or possibly get into a program like Outco because maybe it'll help me. Any advice anyone on this subreddit can give me as the best course of action to take for myself so I can get myself into this industry, would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I am also not completely confident in my projects as most of them were from my courses."

January of 2019, I was still enrolled in pharmacy school. Prior to that I received my Bachelors degree in Biology. February of 2019, I began my transition over to computer science by enrolling in a masters in Computer Science degree. On my own time, since January 2019, I was learning Python, and in school I took classes in Java and in C. Since June, I had been applying to computer science related internships. After having applied to over 150 positions, and interviewed 4 times, I am thrilled to say that I finally landed my first tech job as a Data Scientist Intern. I will heavily be using Python,R, and complimentary technology. I am beyond excited, and I just wanted to share that excitement!

e07hfp,0,2019-11-22,My wife is a Teachers Assistant and is being harassed by the teacher she works for.,-SEAZER-,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e07hfp/my_wife_is_a_teachers_assistant_and_is_being/,"we live in Southern California. My wife (24F) like the title says is a teacher's assistant that works with Autistic kids in preschool at a elementary school . Basically her job duties are to be the right-hand-man of the teacher . This school year she is working with a teacher (65F) that transferred from another elementary where she was working with severely Autistic kids and the school they're currently work at only deals with more mildly Autistic kids. The first day the teacher started working with my wife she instantly started causing problems.

1- My wife used to be able to come home early because she would take her 15min break late thus letting her come home early and she was unaware that ""lawfully"" she couldn't do that but her old teacher (retired last year) said that it was okay and she was the one that actually told my wife to go home early because my wife would finish her work and they had no students at the end of the day so my wife wasn't really doing anything at the last 15 minutes of the day/shift. So the new teacher went to the principle and complained, the principle was also aware of my wife leaving early and he was okay with it but the new teacher said she would take it up with the ""higher ups"" if the principle didn't tell my wife something. My wife said okay and now she stays the whole shift, no problem. 

2- The times my wife has always taken her breaks, all of sudden are a problem now. Teacher didn't like it and made my wife change her times. My wife listened.

3-The teacher constantly talks behind my wife's back with other co-workers but what the teacher doesn't know is that her co-workers love my wife and a couple weeks back voted for her to be the employee of the year . So they let my wife know all the bad things the teacher says. 

4- The teacher has a intern at the moment and completely ignores my wife's existence in the classroom and when she does talk to my wife shes very rude and condescending.

5- She has told my wife that she does not deserve her job position because my wife has no ""schooling"" for what they do. Even though when my wife applied there were +50 Interviews, over 70 Applicants and that's not including external applications.

6- Teacher has segregated my wife and a student because for some reason this particular child is not fond of the teacher and often bites, pinches and hits the teacher but has no problem with my wife. So the teacher does fun! class activities  and makes my wife and this student sit on the other side of the class room alone, while the other kids do fun things and this poor child is excluded. 

7- The teacher has had her husband come to class to bring her lunch and her husband makes my wife feel really uncomfortable because he looks at her with hate. 

8- The teacher has lied to the principle about my wife trying to damage her reputation with him.

the list can go on and on. Almost Everyday my wife comes home exhausted and on the boarder of crying of how bad her days at work are. She has been documenting all of the incidents. she tried talking to the teacher to try and fix the issue and the teacher said that she doesn't want to talk and that my wife ruins the classroom when all my wife does is what shes told to do. my wife has talked to the principle and the principle has talked to the teacher but nothing gets resolved. the teacher has told people she ""knows"" people in the union which i think scares the principle a bit. What else can my wife do?? she's not going to quit her job or transfer because shes worked really hard to keep her name at that school and to get the job she has.

&amp;#x200B;

sorry for the long post and thank you for your suggestions and help. As a husband i feel helpless that my wife is getting bullied and there's noting i can do but  i come to reddit to see how you guys can help! please help my wife!"
e07tty,3,2019-11-22,How do I become a 'real' software engineer after feeling unqualified for my last role?,micjosmcc,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e07tty/how_do_i_become_a_real_software_engineer_after/,"I've suffered a constant case of imposter syndrome for the past two years.

I have a BS in biochemistry and a MS in bioinformatics, and in grad school I lucked out and made it into a bioinformatics engineering internship, which is basically a software engineering role in the bio domain. I was responsible for creating applications used to store, collect, retrieve, and visualize data using the R Shiny framework, and that's the sole technology I used for about 85% of my job. The other 15% was SQL database management.

I always felt under qualified for my position as my graduate degree was focused towards data analysis, there was no engineering at all!

Well as luck would have it the company hasn't been doing so great, and I was laid off two days ago, and I'm panicking because I'm really only skilled in the one technology (Shiny), and software engineering job descriptions seem to have a shopping list's worth of languages as requirements.

I don't really even have a GitHub I can use to showoff what I can do. Everything happened so unexpectedly...

The company was generous enough to give a three month severance package, but I need a job within that time, and I'm trying to create a plan to become a 'real' software engineer within three months!

What should I focus on to get up to par for current software jobs? I'd be fine entering a entry-level position if it would provide me with a stronger foundation in engineering.

Best!"

My current company (Te$$la) asked me this week if I want continue  until March 2020. I also have another offer for a Summer 2020 internship. If I even take one of these, I will push my graduation to 2021. 

I have a total of 6 internships (2 SWE, 2 PM, 1 Data Science, 1 non-technical). 

At this point, I am so used to working not sure what to do. 

Ive been told multiple times that ""school can wait"" and that I should apply for full-time. But all my friends who let school wait said that they have a hard time transitioning out their first software engineering job and feel stuck since some companies really do care about the degree.

e0a02y,2,2019-11-22,There is a void in me I don't know how to fill,NuclearSteeze,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e0a02y/there_is_a_void_in_me_i_dont_know_how_to_fill/,"Maybe the best way to start this is a backstory about me (sorry for the long read):

I am a 23 year old guy. I moved to the USA from India when I was 2 years old (so I am a u.s citizen and westernized in every way other than the fact that I can speak Hindi and eat Indian food more often than the average American).

I have always been a loner. I tried to be cool and make friends in elementary school but I would always get teased and bullied. It was worse in middle school. So, in high school, I became quieter. I was still picked on, but not nearly as much, because I would just keep to myself, assuming nobody would want to be my friend and that I would just have to deal with it. Well, as a result, this led to me being totally socially awkward and underconfident into college as well. I should also add that this whole time I have been having a porn addiction. I went to a good Engineering college, but I had no social life (like 0 friends) the whole time and an awful GPA (literally just enough to graduate but I failed so many of my major courses. I literally barely made it). Of course, you gotta have a good GPA to get internships and to get a full time position, companies look at your experience (I had no internships other than this research thing I kinda did at the university).

So, when I graduated last May 2019 with a bachelor's, at 23, I had the following:

1) no friends
2) never been on a date or any form of intimacy with anyone 
3) I was broke and lived with my parents because I was unemployed



Obviously, I was thinking about ending it all (my professor said I should speak with the college therapists because he thought I might have depression. Maybe he was right but I never have been one to care about my mental health. I just tell myself to stop being so pitiful and deal with it). I had 0 confidence in myself for a whole 6 months as I made futile attempts searching for a job while with my parents (my peers had successful beginnings to their careers at this point, and I was so ashamed of myself). I ate so much that I became medically obese.

Anyways, something really good happened for me recently. I got a job. A job that is damn near my dream job. Like it works in the exact industry that I have dreamed of working in since a young boy (but gave up on thinking it was just a fantasy) and it pays well (not 6 figures or anything but still pretty solid). I have been working for about a week now. It's a ton of work (more than 40 hours a week for sure) but I really enjoy it even when i get mentally exhausted. 

But here is the thing, despite having this great job, I still have this void in me. I think it is because I still don't come out of my shell. I still hate myself on some level. My team's director invited me to go out with some of the employees for happy hour and walking around downtown. I told him maybe, but I dont think I am going. I think I am just going to lay in my room being a loner as always. I just assume the worst. I have tried going out with people, but I always just end up being kind of left out because I am afraid of involving myself in anything because I never feel like I am truly welcome. 

And of course, I do want intimacy. I just think I will be one of those few people that will have to die without it (some people just go on without some things) but it makes me sad thinking about it. I do want a girlfriend, but I have never asked a girl out because I am too damn self-conscience (my body, my lack of a exciting personality). But I am a 23 year old virgin who has never kissed or dated so I feel like my ship has sailed since obviously women my age would want a a guy with experience (sure, there is that 0.001% that would be cool with it, but how on earth would I find them and, since there are so few, chances are high we might not even be compatible).

One thing I am working on is getting some hobbies. I will have to work some more to get the funds to do them, but that shouldn't be long. But here is the thing. No man is an island. I really was hoping that this lovely job would completely fill my void, but it hasn't. Because it's the weekend now, and I am back to my self-pity shit. Also the place I live in and work is a crowded downtown area(not as big as NYC or la, but still crowded), so I am just a loner in a crowd. I don't know how to build relationships, platonic or romantic, with anyone. I'm just ""cool"" to be around occasionally I guess.

Anyways, I feel like I am rambling now. So basically I want to know how to get out of my shell and stop feeling pathetic."

e0akcw,0,2019-11-22,Microsoft vs Affirm internship?,CrazyCaribou,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/e0akcw/microsoft_vs_affirm_internship/,"TLDR: Need advice on where to intern between big M and Affirm

After a long tedious internship search I finally landed myself a few SWE internship offers, notably at Affirm and that giant tech company in Redmond, WA that rhymes with wicrosoft. After the below average recruiting season I went through this year (150+ applications, \~20% response rate (\~60% of which were resume rejections)), I really want to optimize for brand name so that it'll open up more doors when I recruit for new grad roles next year. (Learning is important too ofc but I assume i'll be learning a lot wherever I choose to go). It esp stings when I see all my friends with big name internships practically interviewing at any company they want. I will mainly be shooting for FAANG type companies and interesting large startups in CA like Dropbox/Airbnb

Leaning towards the internship in WA now because of the security in brand name, but i've heard that Affirm is arguably comparable in terms of engineering reputation. At the same time, Affirm seems like a more interesting company to work for in terms of company trajectory, and the people I met there were really intelligent and interesting (they also pay quite a bit more for new grad roles)

To sum up, my considerations are:

1. Brand Name - I haven't decided on what kind of company I want to work for eventually, but I want to have options!
2. Learning - I want to do interesting work during my internship and have good mentors to guide the learning process.
3. New Grad TC - I want to earn a competitive pay when I graduate the following year. (just being practical)

***M:***  
**Pros:**  
\- Brand Name - good for new grad recruiting next season (?)  
\- Cool intern program experience  
\- Interesting and highly technical team/product (possibly?)

**Cons**:  
\- New Grad TC lower (in case of return offer)  
\- Bureaucracy? Laid back, corporate culture (?) - Not sure what team Ill be working on

***Affirm:***  
**Pros:**  
\- Very high potential startup  
\- Interesting team placement - Much better TC (in case of return offer)  
\- Interesting, intelligent people and amazing culture (from my limited interaction)

**Cons:**  
\- Is brand name as good (?) - for recruiting next season  
\- Product doesn't seem as technical

Wonder if anyone could give me some advice here (if i'm missing some consideration?) or about how valuable a SWE internship at Affirm might be on a resume as compared to the other one ? (assuming my previous experience is not impressive)"

I have received offers from John Deere, Northrop Grumman, and Target and I'm debating which one to take. 

At John Deere and Northrop Grumman, I'd be working on more embedded programming. While at Target, I think I'd get the opportunity for more traditional software engineering. I realize I've been having trouble selling myself as a pure SW engineering because of my hardware background, so I've been thinking perhaps Target would help balance out my resume such that I could sell myself as an embedded or more back-end programmer depending on what I prefer. I also had a poor internship experience last summer where I didn't get to do much programming, and I really want to have a programming heavy internship to make myself a strong candidate when looking for full time soon after.

 Any advice would be appreciated!!"

TLDR: just skip to the last line

I am am an undergrad in first year.Before this,  I attended a community college (where I live the system is a bit different) before and got along incredibly well with my teachers there - I worked side by side with most of the teachers from the math department for the planning of this huge conference and got along really well with them, eventually they told me to call them by their first name and to address them in the ""impolite"" way one addresses someone in French (side note: in French, there's a polite ""you"" and an impolite ""you"", we commonly use the ""polite"" use for older people and for professors and people who have authority over oneself).

After graduating, I have gone out to different conferences together (after I graduated from there) with the teachers from the math department, and we've drank around each other, and hugged and all. I also got along really well with a physics prof I had then, who I also addressed by his first name and who liked me so much he told me I could intern at his company if ever I wanted to.

However, it's my first year in a ""big"" university where academia is a lot more prominent. Because I got used to being kind of on a ""same level"" relationship with my old professors, if ever I need to go to a professors' office hours, I usually also take the time to get to know them/their career a little bit, since it always interests me to know how they got to where they are now. I don't know about ""academia etiquette"" and was hoping to get an answer from you guys in this sub.

However, when I write them emails or need to call them over, I call them by their first name but still address them by the ""polite you"" in French. The other day, my friend saw me writing an email in which I started with ""Good Afternoon \[professor's first name\],  ..."" and she was perplexed that I was calling him by that instead of his last name or just ""Professor"". The rest of my emails and usually my attitude towards them is incredibly polite, professional and respectful.

edit: if this changes anything, I'm from Canada. 

Edit 2: thank you all for the feedback!! I‚Äôm now wondering how to call them something else without it looking weird that I‚Äôve changed the way I called them...

So my question is, **is it deemed impolite to do call professors by their first name if you're being polite in every other way?**"

I would like to study something where I will learn to be a good programmer, but I also want to learn about circuits and how devices work. For example, I like to code a lot. The classes on Programming were fun and interesting. But seeing how electronics work seem just as interesting to me. I also saw a few videos on how people hacked famous devices like the xbox and that seems super interesting. 

However, I am not sure how deep into the electrical side and software side the study goes. I am scared that because the study contains 2 fields and combines them,  I will not learn as much about software as if I would choose SE instead. Because of this fear, I also think that people that only studied Software Eng. or Electrical Eng. will have better job possibilities as they are only focused on one side. 

Also, how does a Comp Eng. job look like? (apart from the software developing) I currently don't have a clear idea about what jobs a CE graduate can do. I know someone that does CE and he said he did a software engineering job during his internship. 

In the end, I want to have a lot of job opportunities and also have a lot of knowledge about software and electrical engineering.  Will CE be able to help me to achieve this?"

* Company C had 1 behavioral interview followed by 1 easy programming question that doesn‚Äôt require any data structure beyond normal arrays and 1 system design question. 
 
* Company D had a 5 question coding challenge that took various data structures (stack, integerstream, hashmap, etc.) Leetcode Easy-Mediumish. After that, 3 behavioral interviews on-site.
 
* Company E had only 1 online recorded behavioral interview before an ‚Äúinitial‚Äù offer. Had to go through background checks and other interviews to get final offer.
 
* Company F was a company that I previous interned at. They had 5 interviews (1 initial phone, 4 interviews on a ‚Äúsuper‚Äù day) with 1 of them asking conceptual questions and 1 asking about system design. Otherwise majority of the interviews were behavioral.

All these offers are in different locations. Bay Area, Chicago, Dallas, Ann Arbor, Fort Meade, and Jersey City.

I applied to ~60 positions, majority are ghosts with a handful of denials. Most of the companies that responded to my applications were companies that I talked to at the career fair.

I accepted Company A‚Äôs offer in the Bay Area after negotiating it up to 105k salary and 8k relocation/starting bonus. Unfortunately, all the other offers didn‚Äôt budge during negotiations and had lower or worse salary/benefits. However, any of the job offers would have been fine to live comfortably within their respective cities.

___

**My preparation?** Besides taking my data structure class, not really much on the technical side. I took a few problems on LeetCode and such, but otherwise didn‚Äôt grind too much. As for books I read, I bought CTCI but didn‚Äôt really look at it besides skimming the behavioral section. Kind of a waste of $30 for me, but oh well. I think a huge portion on how I did well for technical was due to having experience from TA‚Äôing. Every week, I was constantly debugging other people‚Äôs code and seeing different types of solutions for various projects. Talking to people and trying to explain concepts in various different ways helped tremendously on explaining my thoughts to students and recruiters alike. Otherwise, I mostly focused on my behavioral aspect, where I could talk about my interests, work, or projects. I would often stutter a bunch or blank out whenever I‚Äôm talking normally, so I looked at solving that issue.

(Edit: someone asked me about the behavioral portion, so here was my response to how I practiced for that)

&gt; Whenever I was preparing for the behavioral interviews, I would type/write down topics that I could talk about in various behavioral questions. Then, I would practice with other people on talking about those topics. You need to organize your thoughts into main points where you can anchor the rest of your conversation to. It is okay to take time during your interview to think about the question before answering and being repetitive to get your point across.

&gt; One example of this was a question about a time where my work has shown an impact. I focused on my TA position and how my efforts on improving the experiences for the students allowed them to excel well. I often repeated key concepts I learned as a TA and how I constantly adapted and catered to individual students. Then, I expanded it to a specific situation where someone told me that I helped them transfer into CS due to helping them in office hours. I had this particular situation already written down beforehand so I was able to recall it when the interview happened.

**My resume?** I had one internship at a financial company. That internship was gained only through 1 behavioral interview; there was no technical interview. I also TA‚Äôd the intro to cs course at Purdue. GPA was around 3.5 out of 4. Purdue was notorious for hard math courses, so I took them outside and transferred them in (transfers in as P/F with no GPA). Otherwise, my GPA would have been probably way lower. When I applied for my internship last year, I had no projects. When I applied for full time this year, I had only shown 1 project from my software engineering course. No side/personal projects, no Github link on my resume. I had also shown some volunteer work from my university‚Äôs outreach program.

___

**TL;DR:** Work smarter, not harder. Takeaway is that you don‚Äôt technically need to grind Leetcode to do well in interviews and not every good job requires a huge technical interview. All the offers were fine to live comfortably, but I obviously chose the one with the best offer and location. You are able to supplement your technical skills with various experiences like being a teaching assistant. Please don‚Äôt think Leetcode is your only option. Be more personable and be able to communicate your thoughts well. Career fairs was the best way for me to get noticed. Plan well based on your own circumstances. Everyone‚Äôs experience is going to be different.
___

**Things that you have to take with either a grain of salt or is dependent on your situation:**

1.	Purdue University has decent corporate connections and a high CS ranking, so my experiences on getting interviews at the career fair may vary depending on what university you attend. If your university doesn‚Äôt have good corporate connections, you have to put more effort in engaging companies yourself by referrals from friends/classmates/employees and attending networking events.
2.	At the career fair, I intentionally targeted certain companies that I liked their products, was interested in, or had short lines that I was able to hop in. The first two gave points that I could talk about to the recruiters to give them good first impressions outside of my paper resume.
3.	Getting positions/experiences like becoming a teaching assistant or doing volunteer work is dependent on where you are, but there should be plenty of opportunities to help the community and enforce your fundamentals no matter where you are
4.	Some businesses really like high GPA, others don‚Äôt really care. Financial industry seems like they like above a 3.0 GPA. I prioritized keeping it up by abusing the transfer credit system that Purdue has, where any course with at least a C or better will be transferred with no GPA impact. I transferred in Calculus 2, 3 and Linear Algebra after getting a B- on Calculus 1 at Purdue."

I am yet another student from a liberal arts university in the middle of nowhere. My GPA will probably stay around a 3.4 by the time I graduate in May, and I have no internships. However, I've had pleasant interactions at career fairs with some of the companies that hire graduates from my school.

I also have:

\-references that work in two of those companies

\-a resume made using the guidelines from this community's Resume FAQ 

\-a GitHub with some coursework on it

\-a Linkedin (yay me)

My agenda for the next 7 months is to learn the languages that the companies claim to work with (C++ is common among them) and contribute to some open source project. If I can't contribute to anything, I'll try to start something modest from scratch. Of course, it is possible--even likely--that I don't meet any of those goals before May, or that even if I do, it won't make a difference in terms of getting employed. 

I am aware that I have underachieved for someone at this stage in the game, but I still hope to find redemption in the fact that I will take almost any job. I've even considered getting into tech support if it let's me escape the service industry by graduation. Naturally, however, I want to make the most of my degree as soon as I can, so maybe tech support is shooting a little low... I honestly don't know what I'm worth.

That leaves me with about two groups of questions:

\-What is the most general range of tech-related jobs that are available to a computer science degree holder with no experience? Is there a ""step below"" a computer programmer that I should aim for initially? If such a ""step below"" exists, is it also suitable for eventually transitioning to programming?

\-Is there any hope for someone like me of getting a job doing quality assurance or software development? If so, how would I maximize my chances of getting hired?

I don't have much guidance in this realm, so any feedback/perspective is greatly appreciated."

Currently, I am debating offers for the summer, and have narrowed it down to two companies.

Capital One (based in McLean) and a ""startup"" based in SF. The ""startup's"" salary beats out C1 and housing is also covered. The reason I put startup in quotes is because this company would be considered probably a late stage startup with a valuation in the few billions.

I'm not sure which one to choose. On one hand, Capital One is well-known on this sub for its engineering team, the other company is a tech-first company with a smaller internship program. C1 has a boatload of engineers in McLean, while the startup has around 250.

I have experience interning at IBM and will be interning at a fintech unicorn this upcoming winter, and was wondering what would be best for not only my resume but also for career growth: try the ""startup"" scene, or to see what it is like to work at an established bank.

e0k8wu,2,2019-11-23,At a crossroads in my career and relationship. Not sure what to do. HALP!,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e0k8wu/at_a_crossroads_in_my_career_and_relationship_not/," A little backstory: 

I‚Äôm 27 about to turn 28 and currently live in Phoenix, Arizona. I realized I wanted to be a filmmaker when I was a sophomore in high school, making skits with a few of my friends on our drama teacher‚Äôs camcorder. Eventually, I decided to get a degree in film. I couldn‚Äôt afford the tuition of film schools in California or New York, so I went with ASU. This wasn‚Äôt a terrilble prospect to me because then I‚Äôd at least be going to college with a handful of poeple I knew from my hometown. This is a key thing to note; friends are as important as family to me. Fast-forward four years. I‚Äôve graduated with a degree in film and freaking the fuck out. I didn‚Äôt know the first thing about working in film (something that‚Äôs horrendously missing from many a film school‚Äôs curriculum). I didn‚Äôt have any money and was at the tail end of a dying relationship. I was depressed. My now ex-girlfriend and I were thinking about moving to LA together, but, after a few financial setbacks, my step-dad convinced me I had no way of getting to LA. So, I didn‚Äôt. I found a shitty little studio in Tempe and my ex moved (her mother was well-off and could afford to subsidize her). This was in 2015, a year after I graduated college. Since then, I‚Äôve built a new life. I got a job as a videographer at a non-profit where I feel appreciated, got medicated for my depression, developed strong friendships with a few film people, and even made a few short films in the last four years. At the beginning of 2019, I met a wonderful woman and we‚Äôve had a great relationship the past 9 months. However, right around the time we met, my film friends and I started talking about making the move to LA.; one is even applying to a prestigious Masters program there. And here is my dilmma:

My girlfriend is amazing. She‚Äôs smart, sweet, and hilarious. She‚Äôs in an MBA program and has a promising future. We‚Äôre very much in love. Yes, we have our problems, but we‚Äôre very communicative and, for the most part, we‚Äôre very good at resolving our conflicts. The one conflict we have yet to resolve is the issue of moving to LA. She‚Äôs currently in an internship at a HUGE tech company and it‚Äôs likely she‚Äôll be able to get a job right out of school with a great salary. I‚Äôm so fucking proud of her. The problem is that this job she may be offered would be in Portland, which is decidedly not LA. We‚Äôve talked about her moving to LA with me and she‚Äôs been looking at her employment opportunities there, but, realistically, sending blind correspondence to hiring managers in a town she‚Äôs never lived in bears much less fruit than the connections she‚Äôs made in her internship. I‚Äôve been candid with her, telling her she needs to do what will be best for her. After all, she was on this course before meeting me and who am I to fuck that up? We had a talk last weekend where she flat-out asked: if she moved to Portland, would I come with her? I said no, but I‚Äôm not completely sure about it. I‚Äôd love to live in Portland much more than LA. I think the life we could make together up there would be wonderful. But, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pursue my own goals. And more, I‚Äôd be moving away from the friends who are important to me. I‚Äôd feel like I was backing out or welching on an agreement. I want to be a professional screenwriter and there‚Äôs not really - as far as I know - a film industry in Portland. I‚Äôve considered - and my girlfriend has supported - the idea of being a novelist instead (something I can easily do in Portland), but that‚Äôs not really the path I‚Äôve been forging the last 10+ years. 

So, Reddit, I‚Äôm at the point where I need some perspective. As far as I can figure, I have four options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. We both move to LA. PROS: I will have the opportunity to go after my dream, but she will have given up an extremely lucrative opportunity. I‚Äôll be where my friends are and we‚Äôll be pursuing the same or similar goals. CONS: There‚Äôs a chance she could grow to regret me. The cost of living in LA is high and there‚Äôs no guarantee of success. LA is a risky move.
2. We go our separate ways and break up. Same LA pros and cons apply. CONS: I will have given up a good relationship. 
3. We both move to Portland. PROS: She‚Äôll have a well-paying job, affording me the flexibility to pursue a writing career. I‚Äôd love living in Portland. CONS: I will be away from my friends and I will be once again giving up the opportunity to move to LA and take my shot at working in film. There‚Äôs the possibility I will grow to resent her. 
4. We both go our separate ways, but try to maintain a long-distance relationship. PROS: We will both be going after what we want and won‚Äôt have to endure the pain of breaking up, nor the strain of resenting one another. CONS: Long-distance is not preferable to me. I‚Äôve done it before and it has never worked.

I hope I‚Äôve included all pertinent details and that it‚Äôs not too confusing. What do you folks have for me? 

TL;DR I want to move to LA to be a screenwriter. My girlfriend wants to move to Portland. What do I do???"
e0k9z1,2,2019-11-23,"First time internship search, need help/advise for making a decision",ztizzlegaming,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e0k9z1/first_time_internship_search_need_helpadvise_for/,"First some background. I am a graduate student at Harvard studying for a masters in data science. Before this, I went to a small liberal arts college where I majored in CS and math. I did research in undergrad so this is the first time I am going through the internship process.

Currently, I have two offers, let's say company T and L. T is a software engineering intern at a game development studio owned by one of the biggest game companies out there, and L is a data science intern at a chemical company. They both have good pay and offer housing, which is great. T's deadline is Dec 3 and L is Dec 1. If I had to choose between T and L, I would almost definitely choose T, but they are both good offers from what I can tell.

However, I am currently waiting to hear back from two companies after having done their final round interviews. One said they would get back by Thanksgiving or right after, and the other I only did the interview yesterday so I'm not sure when they will be back to me.

In addition, a bit unexpectedly, yesterday I heard back from Amazon saying I would have a final round interview, but that they didn't know when it would be, only that it would be in the next few weeks.

I would probably consider either of the final rounds I had versus T. They are both data science positions, and I might be a little more interested in being a data scientist instead of a software engineer because of the graduate program I'm in and my interests, but I could go either way. The T internship is very flexible as well so the interns kind of get to do what they want to from what I can tell, so it wouldn't have to be strictly software engineering. As well, I would definitely consider Amazon since, well, it's Amazon. Maybe that's not a great reason; I am sure I would get great experience anywhere, but I never thought I might be able to go to a FAANG company and if I could get a return offer to work full time at Amazon, that would be incredible. I'll talk more about that at the bottom.

My problem is the early deadlines. December 3 is not far away, and I don't know if I will even hear back from the two final rounds I had by then, and I might not have even had the Amazon interview by then. I can't imagine declining T in hopes of getting another offer without having another offer in hand, especially because the T offer seems like a really good offer, but I would also hate to accept T and then wonder what-if about Amazon, or do the interview and get an offer but not be able to accept since I already accepted T. Between T and Amazon, I would probably take Amazon.

Another question I had is how likely are the big tech companies, like FAANG companies, to make a return offer to an intern? T's main goal is to hire their interns after, and even though they are owned by a huge game company, they are relatively small and will only have six interns I believe. I assume Amazon has the same goal with interns, but I also assume a company like Amazon would have many many more interns than that and might not be as likely to make return offers unless you are outstanding. I don't doubt my abilities, but I think it would be harder to stand out somewhere like Amazon, with hundreds of interns that are the best of the best. I would hate to go to Amazon and not get a return offer since they had so many other skilled interns when I could have gone to T and gotten an offer.

One last thing. Amazon suggested that if I have any current deadlines that I ask for an extension. I don't really understand how you could do this without a good reason, and I doubt that ""I am waiting to hear back from other companies"" is going to be a good reason. Do people just ask for deadline extensions without reasoning?

Since this is my first time going through the intern search and decision process, I would love any advise that you all are willing to give. Do most people just take the first offer they get if they don't have another offer before the deadline? It seems very risky to turn down a good offer I have in hand, but at the same time, I would hate to get an offer from Amazon later."
e0kaj2,1,2019-11-23,"I caught my dad, an orthodox priest, cheating on my mother.",Robert_Ant,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e0kaj2/i_caught_my_dad_an_orthodox_priest_cheating_on_my/,"The first paragraph is background to my situation, and the second is where I ask the advice I need. 

I‚Äôm 18 years old, and recently (two days ago) I went to church and noticed his car was there at an unusual time. I went to walk inside the church, but the door was deliberately locked from the outside. I went back to my car to wait for him, and I checked my family tracking app and it had shown that he was inside. About 30 minutes later, he comes out of the church with a younger female (20-24) and comes to my car and is quite surprised, quiet, and something simply felt off about him. He asked me why I was there and I told him to get cash so I can go her my hair cut and he said ‚Äúalright, can you drive this girl to the metro station?‚Äù I had decided to not ask any questions or confront, and I pretended like I had no idea what was going on. I told him that was fine, but after that, he told me to not tell her I was his son. I did not have to chance to see if his wedding ring was on or off. I pretended I was totally okay with it, and he proceeded to tell the girl I will drive her to the metro station, and he is especially careful to not mention that I am his son to her. She gets in the car, and an initial whiff of liquor strikes me, and it slowly subsided after a minute or two. After this, he goes into the church to grab cash, puts it in an envelope, and walks towards my car while wiping his lips, he comes to my window and says ‚Äúhere you go, ____,‚Äù calling me by my first name (which he never does). I then start to put the envelope in my middle console, and I see him make the ‚Äúshushing‚Äù sign with his fingers towards the girl from my peripheral vision. This was a dead giveaway for me. As I‚Äôm driving the girl to the metro station, I am surprised as to how young she is, that she can relate to my music tastes, TikToks, and even college stress. She also told me very weird stories about how she‚Äôs into white men (she was African American with a thick African accent), also adding stories about a nursing internship she has where she ‚Äúcleans old men‚Äôs balls and they get hard and talk highly of her.‚Äù My fathers cover-up? He is a psychotherapy intern and has required counseling sessions with people of various ages. This was a ‚Äúcounseling session.‚Äù Who picks up a college students from the metro station, brings her to a secluded room inside the church, and then proceeds to have a 2 1/2 hour long ‚Äútherapy session‚Äù that requires denying your son and deliberately locking the front door of the church? 

So now that the situation is out of the way, here is what I need advice on. My parents have been together all of my life, (20 years), and I have a 7yo brother and 11yo sister. I do not want to see them go through the hardships of a divorce. Neither my mom nor my dad could properly support the children with their income if they were alone, and my mom would probably get custody, leaving me to be the man of the house. My father is a well known orthodox priest, and a cheating scandal would destroy his career, he would lose his job as a priest and be publicly criticized and shamed by the orthodox community NATIONWIDE. On top of this, I‚Äôm not sure how his psychotherapy degree and certification will play out following an incident like this. What do I do??????? I currently feel like I can no longer look at my dad in the same loving way. I now look at him as another man that simply supports me, not as my father. I feel as if telling my mother would be CATASTROPHIC. Maybe she would forgive him and stay together for the kids, but knowing how emotional and loving my mother is towards him, she will NOT take this lightly. If I talk to just him, what do I say? How do I approach this? I love my father and I know how much my mother loves him. But this situation is not just an affair. It‚Äôs a career-ending, family destroying, public dilemma."

I am an aerospace engineer, but due to ITAR regulations, it's not possible for me to work on that field (at least at the moment and as an immigrant). After I graduated I worked a couple of years as a sustaining product engineer for a laptop and tablet manufacturer. There I mostly worked on quality and hardware.

Right now I am studying a master's in big data as I am looking to gear my career into something more accessible. I was always interested in programming and data science would have some overlap with my education.

I've done some Python, took both of Helsinki's OOP in Java courses and currently I am starting to intern for this start-up which uses sensors to read electric characteristics of machines to determine failures, predict maintenance, etc.

My main problem is, I've done various things but I'm not particularly experienced in any particular one. Normally I would just complete the master's and go that way, but for some personal reasons I might have to stop it mid-way. So I want to make sure I'll still have something as a plan B.

The place I'm starting to intern for basically wants me to do a bit of everything, principal goal is to come up with ways to handle and get answers from the data they're collecting. But to begin, they want me to make some changes to their website since the previous intern doing it is no longer there. Nothing too crazy, but maintenance here and there.

So now I am looking to learn what they currently have going on. Basically they're integrating some google cloud microservices for the data coming from the sensors and from the short time I spent looking at the previous intern's work he uses firebase, angular and I am still waiting to hear what are all the google cloud services they're using (the back-end was done by someone else). I am not very familiar with those tools so I'd have to learn from scratch.

I consider this a pretty interesting project, but at the same time I am concerned I won't have very marketable skills coming from this experience since it might be all over the place. I was hoping experienced people here can tell me what things I should try to steer this towards so it's most beneficial for me. For example, learning cloud services seems to have a lot of overlap with the master in big data and could be a plus. Don't know anything beyond HTML and CSS when it comes to web development, and while I'd be more than happy to learn, I want to make sure I am not misguiding my time/effort.

Any thoughts are appreciated!"

* Systems Intern
* Baltimore, MD
* Pay is greater than what UPS is offering
   * I also get a relocation stipend
* Based off of job description, this position also seems to for Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering majors, which seems to me that there will be more embedded software engineering work (which I am not currently interested in)
   * Based off my research in this subreddit, some have said that projects are assigned once I begin the internship, which I am worried about since there is a chance I may not get a good project?
   * From what I have heard from my recruiter, some projects CS majors did in the past was MATLAB, which I personally would not like to to do all summer. There was one project that involved scripting/automation, but do not know if I will get a similar project like that

**UPS - IT Internship**

* Part of Cloud Platform &amp; Technology department
* From what I have heard from the recruiter, past projects  involved scripting with powershell, automation, using Red Hat technologies (Openshift), development with Ansible.
* I think I will be guaranteed a project that will be software engineering/cloud related?

I'm learning the basics of html, css and JavaScript since I read that they are the most beginner friendly. When I'll finish with them I also want to learn some Python and other languages.

The thing is, when I will feel confident with them, what should I do? Is it a good idea to apply for some internships? Also, I'm very open to move to another country so maybe it will lead to more opportunities.

I need someone to give me advice that will help me in this journey!

I start December 2. Because this is my first real job I had a couple of questions.

1. According to the formal offer of employment I will be required to complete an I-9 form. I understand this is just a basic background check but should I bring extra forms of Identification such as a passport of birth certificate to go along with my drivers license?
2. Also on the formal offer of employment they said they will need to conduct a reference check. They didn't check references before offering me the job which I thought was strange but this is also my first real job so maybe my understanding of the job hiring process is off. I have 3 references my supervisor from my internship in college and 2 professors? I have been told 3 references is the norm but do you think this will be enough?

Thank you everyone for any information!"

I'm having a really hard time deciding on which offer to accept. I'm a current sophomore right now looking to get into the tech industry, and my number one priority right now is landing an internship that would give me the easiest recruiting season next year. Ideally, my end goal after graduation is working in the tech industry, so I'm just looking for an internship that would allow me to learn a lot and boost my resume for Big N/Unicorns next summer.

**Citrix - 12 Weeks**

* **-** Location: Santa Clara, CA (I live in the Bay Area, so I can just commute from home)
* \- Pay: $41.83/hr + $3000 reloc assistance (Don't think I can pocket it, I'd just use it to pay for flying all my stuff back home instead of driving)

**Bank of America - 10 Weeks**

* \- Location: Jersey City, NJ (Right next to NYC)
* \- Pay: $40.50 + $3400 Housing (I can pocket the housing stipend)

Money is my second priority in choosing an internship, since I plan to use some of the money to pay off tuition. I did calculate the amount of money I will make overall before tax and overtime:

* Citrix --&gt; 41.83 \* 40 \* 12 = $20,078.4
* BoFA --&gt; (40.50 \* 40 \* 10) + 3400= $19,600

I will save a ton more money with Citrix because I will be living at home and wouldn't have to pay rent.

I'm really torn. On one hand, Citrix is mostly a tech company, and they do cloud stuff, which is cool. I'd also save a ton more money overall working at Citrix because it is 12 weeks long instead of 10, and I would not have to pay for rent. I'd also commute with my dad since he also works in Santa Clara. I'm not seriously into finance, but I'm open to it; It's cool, but my goals align more with working at like Big N/Unicorn tech company. On the other hand, everyone knows what Bank of America is since it's such a large company.

What do you guys think?"

One is for a trading role in a options market making company while the other is for a quantitative research role at a quantitatively oriented multi-strategy fund. I'm still a bit confused about the specifics about trading vs research, so I wanted to ask some questions broadly about the similarities and differences about the two. 

1. I've heard that entry-level salaries for trading are much higher than research (just based off of glassdoor it seems like most junior quants at hedge funds are making around 80-125k, but traders at market making places can start over 200k), but the jobs are way more volatile for trading like you can get fired in less than a year. Can anyone comment on whether this is accurate?
2. I've heard that most quant researchers have PhD's while traders usually don't need to. Is this also accurate? I'm not particularly interested in going to grad school at this point, but I'm worried that the research place would be less likely to return me in the future because of this.
3. Can anyone provide some color on the differences between market making shops versus quantitative hedge funds in terms of culture/personalities of people that work there? I got the impression that the researchers I talked to seemed to be more nerdy while some of the traders were kinda fratty, but both places seemed to have a good culture overall.

Thanks for the advice and insights!"

Moreover I am a college student right now and plan on doing a job, get some money and then startup.
I have learned some of the skills by doing internships like graphic design, HR management, marketing. Right now learning programming and web development.
I have noticed a change in my behavior in the last 5-6 months, that the more I go into learning new new things and skills everyday, the farther I am getting from human interaction. I am now more than comfortable being alone all day and minding my own business, doing something productive ( I am building my personal brand online, so I produce content for social media and write blogs).

You procrastinate, yes even you. You worry about what other people are doing to prepare themselves for the workplace and want to do anything you can to be as good as them. You fear getting the wrong answer if someone asks you a question. You may even only be experiencing a mild version of this and didn‚Äôt even know to question what was going on since it‚Äôs so normalized in college.


This experience is why I‚Äôm writing to you now. I am feeling an overwhelming urge to reach out to this community. I‚Äôm also an engineering student, currently a little more than halfway done with an ECE MS, did BioE undergrad class of ‚Äò16.

I have this problem that has holding me back the entire time I‚Äôve been a student, intern, or engineering employee. The problem is that I‚Äôm pretty plagued by anxiety.

The weird part about this is the conflict between what I really want and what I am actually brave enough to do. I really want to go out and try being an embedded systems or controls person once I graduate this summer, but I have this immense fear and anxiety that makes me want to quit everything and be a novelist.


The reason I‚Äôm reaching out to this community is because I know there are others of you out there. Personally, my anxiety comes from some childhood verbal abuse that my sister and I endured, and that I continued to bully myself with after I moved away from my parents. There are literally infinite reasons that a person could have any magnitude of lingering anxiety or self destructive behaviors. Almost every single person experiences this in one way or another. No matter what the cause is for your lingering anxiety during the years of college, grad school, and early career... you‚Äôre held back by it.


I notice some of my closest friends from undergrad, grad school, and my first job out of college experience extreme anxiety from perfectionism, usually driven by childhood bullying, garden-variety parental strictness, and some other far more sinister originating events, chronic or acute.


A lot of times perfectionism is a result of anxiety due to any number of things as I described above. I‚Äôm an engineering grad student though, not a psychologist. I have been bouncing between therapists for over a decade and finally found one that is starting to make an actual difference. I‚Äôm here to tell you to please seek help if any of this resonates with you. Also, if you have any experience you‚Äôre struggling with, please know that, anonymously on the internet, you are safe to share your struggles.


In engineering it‚Äôs hard to speak up about this sort of thing, while in my arts and sciences friends, they‚Äôre a lot more willing to admit that they‚Äôre only human, and are trying their best and even then sometimes that‚Äôs not good enough relative to personal or external expectations. But please do because you never know what kid kind of like you but two years younger than you is feeling right now that they could learn from you."

Hi there! I hope this doesn't break any rules, but I feel I'm going crazy and I might need your help.  

I know this sub is mostly US-centric, but I do not mind general or vague advice as long as it is well intended.  

More about me: 2nd year student in Europe in a related CS degree, with a summer internship experience in software development.  

The country I live in is still developing and all of its' IT industry is based on outsourcing. I mention that because this means that the job market is not as competitive as in the US, as the number of IT workers, while growing, is still fairy small.  

I've been trying to get a ""real"" job since my freshman year, but I had little to no luck, except for that internship I mentioned in the beginning of my post.  

This makes me feel more and more depressed as the days go by. I look at my old and over-worked folks and I feel so ashamed that I haven't gotten a job yet despite applying anywhere I thought I could be a good fit. Whenever I get an interview, I can feel their enthusiasm and whenever I get a rejection, I know deep inside that they are more disappointed than me.  

On Thursday I will have yet an another interview, and I already feel that I will mess it up. I tried preparing myself for said interview but deep inside I knew the whole time I'll get another rejection.   

On paper, I look like a great fit to many entry level jobs or internships. I teach middle school aged kids how to code in my free time as a volunteer, I got my first although not-too-impressive one month long internship in my freshman year, I have some nice projects on GitHub and most importantly, I try to be serious about anything I do. For an avarage 20-years old, I think my resume looks pretty cool.  

In reality, I burn out way too easily, my problem solving skills are still bad despite working on that and mostly, I'm still mediocre at best.  

I try working on all of this in order to become a better programmer, but my question now arises: how do you all manage to stay calm and motivated to learn more while searching for jobs and getting countless rejections? I feel so depressed and hopeless rn, these days when I hear people who say that is so easy to get employed in IT I barely manage not to get my eyes wet."

They are both great companies in the Bay Area with interesting work and the potential for a return offer, and I really couldn't go wrong with either choice.

The company that I'm leaning for is more well-known than the other (not a big N or a unicorn company, but it's still more established than the other one). I really liked the culture and people when I went for my onsite, and the team I got placed with is a very impactful one. As a college junior, I feel like it's a good company to start off my career as a fulltime employee. It could also open more doors for me when applying for other places if I end up not coming back.

The problem, though, is that the other offer is giving me a competing higher offer that I can't simply ignore. SF is a very expensive place to live, and I'm also planning on studying abroad the semester after the internship, so I could really use the extra money lol. The common advice in these situations seems to be to use the competing offer as leverage to negotiate. However, during the call when the recruiter told me of the offer, she mentioned that it was non-negotiable.

I would be happy to take the current offer from the company that I'm leaning for; I just can't shake the feeling that I might be leaving money on the table, and would like to know if there's anything I can do. If it helps, my friend who interned there mentioned that someone in her team (different from the team I'd be with) managed to successfully negotiate his return intern offer with his manager using a competing offer. I have a call with my potential manager coming up to discuss the work I'd be doing, and I'm not sure whether I should bring it up.

Is there anything I could do to get the offer to match up? Should I try negotiating different parts of the offer (salary, housing stipend, etc.)?"

In fact, I met with the Board because she broke company policy to fire me without warning and she lied to justify her decision and protect herself. Their lawyer eventually sent me a response to my concerns, NOT a Cease and Desist!

Why would any potential employer hire me after receiving her review?! I sent that evaluation email in hopes that she would offer a neutral or at least accurate assessment. This response completely validated the constant dread and anxiety I have felt since my departure: She has lied about me before and she will lie again to prevent me from finding a job in my field.

WHERE DO I GO FROM HERE?

I had previously asked the Board to prevent her from providing any reference for me. Before her ill-advised response, I already planned to return to them to reiterate the urgency of my concerns. My strategy has completely changed due to her proven attempt to vindictively interfere with my career. 

Now, I plan to find an attorney and determine whether we need additional evidence to constitute defamation. I also have her on tape lying to a state judge during a telephone hearing when she tried to prevent me from receiving unemployment payments. 

I don't know whether these items will be admissible or effective in court. Even though she thought it was a real job reference, it wasn't. I don't know how else I would prove that she lied about me, short of asking potential employers or other people in our industry what she told them. It seems like doing that would raise suspicion of me and entangle them in our dispute. 

What I do know is that she has proven herself to be unworthy of the power granted by her current job. I will be presenting the truth and evidence to the Board whether or not I file a lawsuit, seek settlement, or arrange for mediation. I am committed to finding resolution at the discretion of the law and her superiors. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I am eager for this stressful roadblock to be lifted from my life. 

BACKGROUND INFO:
I worked at this non-profit for 3 years and was promoted twice by my ex-boss after starting as an intern. One day, she initiated and escalated an argument with me and refused to accept when she was objectively wrong. She embarrassed herself during that interaction and fired me the next work day, despite a signed handbook policy requiring her to give oral notice, then written notice, then several weeks for re-evaluation. 

I gathered that she chose to fire me immediately because she was embarrassed by her behavior and she knew she was factually wrong in the disagreement. She also knew that I was going to talk to the Board about our interaction, which would have led to further embarrassment and possible disciplinary actions. She pre-empted that confrontation. She thought I would give up. She was again mistaken. 

I met with the Board and expressed my concerns. I received sympathy and a promise of neutrality. I asked for my job back. They said they'd leave that up to her. I asked for a severance to make up for the signed handbook policy (contract) that she broke to fire me. I also asked for them to forbid her from providing a reference for me. 

There was disagreement on the Board: Most of the longest-serving members resigned in protest. Ultimately, the Board President was the one who didn't want to make waves. I was told they put her on probation for her actions, which is a minimal acknowledgement that she misbehaved. Their lawyer sent me a letter essentially denying my requests and trying to convince me I had no legal case based on the handbook policy. The President cut off communication when the Board lawyer advised everyone to do so. 

I'm now juggling a part time job and sparse freelance work. I am still hit with bouts of anxiety when thinking about the predicament my boss put me in and the Board left me in. I feel like there's nothing I can do to advance my career because I have to compete with lies that I'll never be there to defend. 

I'd appreciate any advice or stories of overcoming shitty bosses. Thank you..."

But I'm really worried that I did it too late and they've already selected interns for the summer. Does anyone know their timeline?
e13z1z,1193,2019-11-24,Quick-and-dirty solution comes back to bite you!,Chilled_IT,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/e13z1z/quickanddirty_solution_comes_back_to_bite_you/,"Working at a helpdesk-company with about 50 to 100 customers, mostly involved in projects either internally or for our customers, but I get my share of T2-cases too, when our interns cannot solve it. One of our customers, who sells some gardening equipment, contacted us that their two NUCs at their production facilities need to be replaced. Nothing unusual, so we buy 2 new ones and get them ready. That includes OS-updates, remotecontrol-software and some other customer-specific software. Finally we install a VPN-client and join their domain.

&amp;#x200B;

I set up one of them and one of my bosses the other one. Somehow the one he set up is not working properly, or to be more precise, one of the software doesn't work properly on it. It just crashes when you try to send a customer-order out of the software straight to Outlook. Sadly the software was written by a company for our customer and solely for that purpose at the time. They didn't plan to sell that software to anyone else, as it is too specific to be sold on the market. So the company didn't put too much effort into it.

We contact the company but they don't reply to phone calls or e-mails. So we try to somehow figure it out by ourselves. But the software doesn't produce any error-codes or crash-logs. It just loads endlessly and can only be stopped with the help of good old taskmanager. We try several different steps as reinstall the software-module, the whole software, the whole pc, we clone the working one....but to no avail. Still same symptons.

&amp;#x200B;

After almost a month we finally get a hold of that company and the reason why they haven't been replying is that the one employee, who wrote the software by himself, is no longer with the company. They reached out to him, pretty much begging him to help them out on this one. We got his e-mail and phone number and started communicating. So we try some troubleshooting but he cannot figure it out either. Everything looks like it should. We do some sql-queries from both NUCs and both come out identical etc.

Then he asks me to send him the output if I start the software through cmd and check the output inside the cmd. And behold we finally get a clue. Some form of exception that software cannot handle. I don't have the source code, so I couldn't check which part causes it to crash. I sent him the exception and the next morning my boss starts to laugh maniacly. The other boss and I look over to him and he just makes a hand-gesture for us to come over and look at his screen, as he cannot talk.

&amp;#x200B;

What the other boss and I see is the response of that developer. Apparently (and for whatever reason) his code wants to play a sound whenever a work is successful. And since that NUC doesn't have a device attached, that could play the sound, the software crashes. Since I worked as the internal sysadmin within a software-development company, I somehow couldn't laugh at first. It just pained me....

After several moments of being speechless and shaking my head, I install a virtual device on that NUC that is supposed to play sounds. Windows recognizes it and I test the software. It works. I call the people who work on those NUCs to tell that they can work on the NUC again, without telling them the cause of their problem. We inform the software-company and let them handle the call with the superiors of our customer. Later on we find out that the other NUC has some speakers attached to it for music, that's why that one worked while the other one didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Dev codes an unneccessary feature into the software and doesn't catch the exception, causing our customer to lose 50% of their productivity."
e147qd,2,2019-11-24,What should I do next?,careerquestion27,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e147qd/what_should_i_do_next/,"So I left a pretty toxic job in August, and took a couple months off to relax and work on a personal project of mine. My last job was accounting/finance big4 adjacent, and in my personal project I've been learning how to code. I'm kind of at a weird point at the moment. I've actually been working on the project for about a year or so now in my free time, but it's not quite ready for launch, as it's quite complex.

I sorta want to YOLO and commit to it, continue to develop my coding skills, and launch the project in the next 4-5 months. I'm not sure if I'll make much money off the site, but the worst case scenario is that it would make my portfolio stand out quite a bit. I could then try to career change from accounting to web development, as I would hopefully have the proper chops by then for an entry level job. The only thing giving me strong hesitation from doing this is that it could be financially risky to go without pay, while investing time/energy/money into the project for so long, to then be trying to get a job later without guarantee of ever getting one. I have the financial means to do so, but the risk is quite high.

Then there's the safer path. Instead of that, I could continue to do what I've already started to do, which is to just look for jobs. I was quite miserable doing my old type of work, but honestly the part I hated most was the constant 12-17 hour days, constantly giving up weekends, etc. The key to success with this route would be to somehow find a job where I could show up to work 9-5 M-F, work a solid week, but then securely have my evenings and my weekends to myself, where I could resume working on the project, and continue to build my coding skills over time.

I think I'm leaning towards the safer path, because I feel like I've got a long ways to go with building my coding skills, and the project could get expensive and be risky for a number of reasons. Yet at the same time I feel conflicted and had a few questions about what you guys think I should consider for my career path:

1. My last job scarred me a bit. It was my first job out of college and I was there for a few years, perhaps a few years longer than I should have been. The 12 hour days everyday of the week just was not sustainable and I burned out. I'm afraid that if I get a big4/big4 adjacent job based off my past experience, that it would be that sort of hellish environment again. What I really want to do is work on my projects, have fun with friends, be in good physical/mental/emotional health, etc. And that requires a job with solid work/life balance. The flipside is that this sort of job would be the easiest one to get based on my past experience. In fact, when I applied for one last week, I got an email back within 4 hours asking to setup a phone interview.
2. After taking some time off to relax and work on my project, I decided to pick up some new skills. I learned SQL, and I recently started learning Tableau to try and get Data Analyst/Business Intelligence sort of jobs. I thought this would be a good idea, because they don't seem like they are too far removed from my last job, so that some of my past experience would still be relevant. So when you throw some of my new skills into the mix, I thought I should be ready? Yet I'm looking through a lot of applications, and I even just had a job interview, and the guy got visibly angry that I didn't have any past visualization experience. So I wonder if I'm sorta like a mediocre candidate in this regard. If I could somehow get an entry level job in this field, I think i'd really like it a lot more because it intersects with some of my past skills but it also will want me to continue to develop my coding skills, which will in turn help me as I work on my project.
3. I could put the project on hold due to its costs and complexity and try to get a job in web development. This would take 2-3 months to finish up the skills I think I need to have, as well as the portfolio I would need to have to be job ready. This would be great for a number of reasons, although I guess I'd worry that maybe because these skills are a bit new, I would be more suited to an internship level job rather than entry level. Which might also be difficult, because I think some internships specifically want college kids and I've already graduated. Also, the thing I don't like about this, is that if I'm going to go down this route, I might as well invest in the site as that would be a huge learning experience that could also help me land the job as well. This sorta feels like it's my risky option.

So there are the 3 major career options I feel like I have at this point, and I'm having trouble deciding. I could use some feedback based on what y'all think might be the best way forward. At the end of the day, my priorities are less about the day to day of my job and more so on having work/life balance and the ability to work on my projects. My ""dream job"" would be to work on my projects for a living, but I think it might be a long and winding road to get to that point. Thanks for reading, I certainly appreciate any advice!"
e1529f,459,2019-11-24,You cabled that wrong (hint: I had cabled it just right!).,DieselSELdr,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/e1529f/you_cabled_that_wrong_hint_i_had_cabled_it_just/,"This happened right about twenty years ago (ok, that makes me feel old) when I worked for a company that was contracted to do break-fix and software support for a now-defunct (acquired) UNIX systems company (visible in the sky, usually when the moon is not visible). I was placed on-site with a very important financial services publishing company at their primary data center in New Jersey. Having a desk on the raised floor and nothing more than a news-equipped pager to get me through the boredom, I really enjoyed when tickets came in. 

This story happened when one of a pair of midrange servers in a cluster (AntiMoon-Cluster?) had been acting up for weeks. I was instructed to replace that machine, keeping only the Dual Port UWD SCSI HBA, which was cross connected to a pair of SCSI arrays, using ‚ÄúTruth Volume Manager‚Äù (TxVM, to keep the brand out of it). Because these arrays were cross connected to the two hosts in the cluster, each port on the SCSI HBAs had their IDs changed accordingly, to avoid conflict of the default SCSI initiator ID of 7. Since we were not changing the HBA, the IDs would stay intact - I clearly labeled each cable as to its orientation and took copious notes about how everything was connected. After reconnecting all of the cables to the new server, the young sysadmin from the customer insisted I had done it wrong. I showed him my labels and my notes, but he disagreed and insisted we change the cables before turning the server on. I refused to make the change, so he went ahead and changed them himself. You can see where this is going... when the SCSI IDs clashed, the TxVM filesystems on the pair of cross connected arrays was completely and utterly corrupted.

Escalations ensued - we had a TxVM expert attempt to fix the file systems - no luck. We attempted to locate the most recent backup tapes - which were on the cart as expected, but they were (gasp!) blank! Yes, the interns dutifully swapped the tapes every day, but nobody had bothered to check if anything was on them. The system was dead as a doornail.

What I have yet to share is the purpose of these machines. They were the primary pagination systems, responsible for final page layout of the important financial publication. Since the change window was Friday afternoon, we worked furiously through the weekend to get things back online. Finally, by Sunday afternoon, a suitably close replica of the server had been restored from the distant DR site over the WAN. I was told that it came in just an hour before the cutoff was - much later there would not have been a Monday issue of the important financial publication. That would have most certainly been a newsworthy event, as this publication has been printed every weekday for a very long time.

I suppose, then, it is no surprise that I never, ever saw that young sysadmin again."

I'm currently doing a co-op and I have to go back next fall for a second round.

If I take 12-13 credit hours every spring, then that allows me to get 2 co-ops in, and possibly even 2-3 summer internships. However, if I take 16-17 hours every spring, then I can graduate and get into the workforce sooner.

Doing a co-op has made me appreciate college life a lot more. I really enjoy college and I'm not looking forward to working full-time (especially with the company I'm at now). However, I realize that it's immature of me to want to stay in college forever.

Personally, I don't mind staying in college for 4 more years rather than 3 if it means I get to enjoy more time living the college life and get more engineering experience as an undergrad. What do you guys think?

Side note: I currently have no debt and have broke even on my college bill from generous scholarships. My co-op is also paying me well, too.

From my experience, my past internship at a small company had very little mentoring/no shadowing.  It was mostly self-managed, independent work.  Very rarely, one of the engineers would sit down with me and go over my work and I'd ask them a few prepared questions.  I know this isn't representative of all small companies.

  From my interviews at bigger companies, they mention vaguely that there is mentoring and shadowing involved in the weekly duties.  But, what does that actually encompass?  Are the engineers teaching you coding standards?  Are you given smaller assignments where the engineers review and critique your work?"

Im a CS student and am hitting internship search season once again and was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction to find some opportunities in the intersection of education and tech. Open to technical roles, nontechnical roles that arent just grabbing coffee for people, and research. 

My background is that I am in my last 3 semesters studying CS. I took 5 years off because I got kicked out of school for a semester. I was depressed and hated the path my career was heading. This conclusion came after landing a cushy internship doing fingerprint matching for a company(they went public the summer I interned and I worked directly under the CTO and founder and met with them multiple multiple times a week). So I have some competence, but I left tech about 3 years ago and worked in the nonprofit world, particularly with underpriviledged students and discovered how much I value education as a tool to help people.

Im back in school at age 27 and am expected to graduate Dec 2020 from a top CS program(I wont say where but the 4 other interns on my team during my last internship were from Bowdoin, UToronto, Yale and Duke). Looking for some advice and any leads anyone has. I will be applying to all the big EdTech firms and Google(rejected last time at host matching because of my 1.8 gpa at the time.

I had no clue what exact area I wanted to go into but my strategy was to apply anywhere and everywhere some type of finance internship was offered. I applied to the BBs, other banks, some boutiques, and for finance depts of big corporations. What I wanted the most out of an internship was a brand name, relevant experience that would hopefully lead to a return offer to a good entry-level job. I know that's a lot to ask for but hey you have to dream big, right?

I ended up interviewing at a few BBs, a couple national banks, and some big corporations. The thing is that the recruiting cycle was so spread out. My first interview was in July and my most recent one was last week. There were companies I was waiting to hear back from for up to 2 months and they still haven't made a decision even after I told them I had another offer. Other companies didn't start their recruiting process with me until the day before I had to accept the offer I had. Other companies I was hoping to apply to don't open applications till the spring. I've had to decline 2nd interviews because they took way too long to get back to me and I had already accepted my offer elsewhere. The offer I ended up accepting initially gave me a week from the day they called me to give me an offer. The thing is they didn't end up sending my written offer letter until 4 days later which gave me only a weekend and 1 business day to decide. I requested an extension but they gave me tops one week.

My problem is that why does every company have such a different recruiting cycle for students, especially the later ones? They miss out on talent and students don't get to explore their options. I've heard the budget explanation but honestly, I feel that could be easily adjusted. And why does it take so long for a company to get back to you about whether you move forward or not? I feel it should take a week tops because I doubt they'd even remember my interview over a week later let alone 2 months. I feel like I had to take an offer that isn't bad but isn't exactly what I wanted considering that I was waiting to hear back from other companies and hoping to still interview with others that I was interested in.  My friend went through all big 4 recruiting cycles for an internship and their process while drawn out was still at the same relative times and they all gave ample time to decide on offers. Why can't banks coordinate do the same?

I'm probably going to end up having to recruit again next year for full-time roles. Any advice on how to navigate different recruiting cycles for undergrad? Sorry if this just turned out to be a rant but this shit sucks

tl;dr Companies having different recruiting cycles and recruiting processes makes me feel like I had missed opportunities and pressured me to accept what I had at the moment even though it wasn't entirely what I wanted. How do I navigate this issue for next year?"
e1bm3h,8,2019-11-25,Intern at large retailer or large investment company?,ExpressNess,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e1bm3h/intern_at_large_retailer_or_large_investment/,"Hi everyone. I have received internship offers from a fortune 50 retail company and a large investment company. 

Retailer
-Software development position with paid housing
-$20/hour for ten weeks

Investment company
-IT Networking position with paid housing 
-$35/hour for ten weeks

While this may seem like a no brainer, there are a few concerns I have for my future career. Last summer I did an IT networking internship at a network infrastructure company. While I enjoyed the experience, I wasnt a huge fan of networking and hoped to branch out this summer. I did write some network automation scripts and I thought that was pretty neat. 

If I work at this retailer I could get more coding experience which I feel like I lack. I definitely dont consider myself the best coder.

However, I don't want to be technical forever. My 5-10 year plan is to become a project manager or something like that. I am wondering if I'm digging myself into a hole if I accept another network engineering position.... but the pay is just so good...

Thanks for the help!"
e1dbgm,2,2019-11-25,is it possible to become a software engineer studying cis?,drippindior,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e1dbgm/is_it_possible_to_become_a_software_engineer/," i know this is a cs subreddit but anyways
I recently switched from to cis from sociology i'm in my 2nd year first semester (almost done lol) because i've always wanted to work in the tech field do coding and creating new things just seemed fun and i've always had an interest in creating things and computers in general but i was just scared as i'm legit shit at math and i really hate it (i was under the impression that you must be a math genius to study cs in highschool and even in college lol). I didn't switch to a cs degree but a cis degree because of another guy who said it's the same but more ""light"" with the math and science and i wasn't really down to take high level math classes (highschool i took calc barely passed with a c) and told me it's basically the same as you almost take the same classes as cs majors just ofc not all (i go to csusm). 
i was aware of me switching i'll have to fully dedicate my spare time to studying hard and not fucking around (i never did but i do sometimes get lazy for the most i rarely procrastinate) but ofc realize i can have some days off where i can just chill with friends and such. 
For me I do want to become a software engineer, work on apps and develop them i've always been interested but then again i look at cis and it's IT/support and mixed with business. I've never done any coding at all but i was reassured by my cousin and others you don't need previous experience with coding prior to studying it. And ill def be looking into internships i heard people never did it and landed a job my cousin highly suggests it to me as it'll help me in the long run for future interviews and such. 
Now i'm thinking I should've just chose CS instead of taking the shortcut but when i look at my schools course requirements for cs degrees it's the same as the courses i need to take for a cis degree so? 
I also am not shooting to work with big companies like google or fb after college, i'm fine with landing a job with a small company as long as the pay is fair/good and i'm doing what i like. 

my main questions were:
1.can I become a developer/software engineer with a CIS degree?
2. Do you know anyone with a CIS deg doing jobs a CS major is doing?
3. Is the pay fair/good with CIS jobs compared to CS ?(i looked it up and got mixed reviews... i also live in so california and planning to stay in socal but willing to move up north)
4. Should i just try a semester with CIS to see if i like it or just quickly change my major ? 

thank you"

\-I always worked during that period, ended up with a 9 months internship in a daily economics and finance newspaper;  
\-Started a master in International Financial Management at Groningen University in the Netherlands, which last 1 year, and I hope to finish it in the summer of 2020 (June/July).

Now my question is: is it a stupid decision to try the application for a Bachelor in Mathematics for AI (3 year course, and another opportunity to do exchange period in some foreign university) in the university where I did my bachelor, I could end up with a full scholarship, and learning new practical and useful skills about CS, math, physics and other scientific area.  
I don't really know what to do with my life, I just want to get some good money and retire early in some exotic island with a small business (don't roast me, it's just a dream).

They dont require any computing experience. I do have some: basics of python(beginner), have made an app for fun but it was part of free course I did  couple a years ago.

Other than that I don't have anything, but I do generally  love computing.

What's keeping me from applying is that they require 
- strong academic record (I had gaps in my study and I'm average)
- excellent communication and Interpersonal skills
- Energy, enthusiasm, versatility and creativity


And I don't know what I can write in my cover letter.

I've always seen myself as being extremely poor in these areas and always makes me anxious whenever I think of applying to anything! 

I've never socialised, have no friends and fought through depression. I'm trying to  better myself but I'm just starting. 

Do guys have any advice? Do you think I should just leave to next year and work on myself?

One of my first jobs as an intern was to backup the systems. There were two senior interns that thought I was not doing my job. So, they wrote a background script that would monitor if and when I did backups. I noticed this script and did not pay much attention to it, other than looking at the source code. Then one day, it crashed. Since I wasn't supposed to know about the ""secret"" monitoring script, I just kept on doing my job. 

About a week later, I get called into the bosses office. ""How come you are not doing backups?"" Well... I am. And I noticed the script that the senior interns wrote had crashed. If you would like, I can help them debug the script and make it work again. I know what the problem is.

I'm good at my studies and a very good team member (Basically I'm the guy thay does 99% of the stuff in a team). I'm an introvert by nature, so I have a very small friends circle.

Coming to the point, even though my grades tell me I'm the best, I actually think I'm the worst compared to my fellows. Some of them are already working and making money while I'm just buried in studies and learning things related to my field for now. I haven't really worked for other people, but I have created softwares, scripts etc. for myself and/or I'm the only person that gives the requirements for the software.

My fellows focus more on interacting with people and using the skills they currently have to work, join organizations etc. but since it's only the third year, their grades have started to fall. While I'm good at conversation, I don't really go to places/organization to work, take part in events (my friends organize events as well) or do something that involves working with people, for now as I intend to focus on it once I'm done with the studies or while I'm in an internship. I also get a lot indirect hate from fellows since I'm the reason for the ""destruction"" of their grades and that's one of the reasons why they don't want to involve me in events.

This was my first greater project that took me quite a lot of time (close to 24 hours total in the past few days of doing it), and I have a lot of questions for future guidance, etc. 

If anyone has the time and will to go through a chunk of my code and help me out I would be so grateful. With that said I also want to point out a few things You might want to have in mind while reading my code:

\-I am **16**, so yeah, that's pretty self-explanatory (so **self-learner**)

\-I am a European thus I have **0 knowledge about NFL** and American Football, literally never watched a minute of it, so my **limited domain knowledge** naturally limits my ability to derive from and communicate data

\-My **Neural Network knowledge** is also quite **limited** although I finished the whole ""Hands-On Machine Learning"" book and took notes and practiced while reading it, but still as I said, quite limited. (with this also comes my first question:)

&amp;#x200B;

***Questions***:

**1. Limited NN knowledge, what should I do to grasp it better? (Both theory and practice)**

   (A little more background: I am considered by many to be above average in maths, the last thing I did in High School is Trig, and I am now doing Calculus course on Khan Academy. I am planning on building some algorithms from scratch because I want to know how things work in more detail and I also know that that is a big + with employers for someone who doesn't have any academical background.)

**2. How** **are my visualizations holding up?**

(Plotting is one of the things that is rather fresh to me, so I need a lot of feedback here)

**3. How is my data/knowledge/information communication holding up?**

**4. What are the things I am doing good, what am I doing bad? Am I missing out on something (small or big)? What can I do better (lol a lot probably)?**

**5. Lastly (and probably the least xD)  Is my code looking clean?**

**\*6. Am I ready for volunteering or an internship?**

(Okay so here is how things are: I am young and self-thought and all of that I know, but I am leaning a bit more towards Bussiness Intelligence side of Data Science, so is there any chance that if I get my data cleaning/communicating and feature engineering really good, I can eventually get a BI/Analytics internship and pick-up practical Machine Learning part there? Of course, given that I keep learning and do more projects.)

&amp;#x200B;

I would very much appreciate all the feedback you guys give me. Please ask any questions if you are curious and be harsh with your criticism, but not too much! :D

I am a scientist/engineer with 5.5+ years work experience (accumulated from internships and 4 years in industry post graduating- this does not factor in time spent volunteering at labs during school).

When I applied for jobs last time (immediately after college), I included university lab volunteering in my work experience. These experiences remain relevant to my field of study, but since they were so part-time, I'm unsure of how best to include them alongside my recent work experience. To give more information:

* Volunteer experience 1: volunteered part-time over the course of a few years.
* Volunteer experience 2: volunteered part-time, became a paid internship for 6 months, and then went back to part time volunteering.

Let me know if I can provide any more information - thanks for reading!"
e1mkst,1,2019-11-25,Toxic Relationship with Mother,tldrthestoryofmylife,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e1mkst/toxic_relationship_with_mother/,"Ever since I was young (M20 now), I have always loved my mother more than anyone else in the world. She, on some level, loves me too, but situational circumstances and misunderstandings have created a toxic relationship for both of us, and I can't take it anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, my family is South Indian, and all of us work in tech (I'm still in college, but I study Computer Science and Math). Moreover, we also tend to define ourselves with our jobs in tech. My mom's the foremost software engineer at a NY-based consultancy, and my dad's an engineering manager/ex-entrepreneur who once made millions with a startup gone big (he lost most of the money to the same startup, but that's a different story).

&amp;#x200B;

In a nutshell, I always craved spending time with her, but she spent more time talking with my dad, his brother, and her brother (all three are very successful in the tech world) about their careers than she did with me. This upset me over and over again, to the point where I began to resent and hate all the other men in her life. In HS, due to mental health issues caused by obesity (not ongoing), bullying, and Asperger's Syndrome, I didn't really accomplish much in the way of grades; to push me forward in this vein, she compared me to my cousins and family friends (all of whom did pretty well) and made me feel as if I wasn't up to par. This essentially resulted in alcoholism and ridiculous amounts of weed for some time, but at the end of HS, I decided Iwas sick of this lifestyle and decided to make use of my knack for coding to become successful in college.

&amp;#x200B;

I worked myself to the bone every night to explore every nook and cranny of Computer Science and Math that I could while in college for the first two years, and ended up with an internship ata globally-known tech company that's comparable to Google or Amazon. At that point, all my friends were essentially worshipping the ground I walked on, because it was hitherto unheard of at my university for someone in their 2nd year to do this, but I just wanted my mom to be proud of me. I went home and pressed the point on her and everyone else who would listen that that company is paying me more for an internship than most college students graduate making in full-time, but only really because I wanted my mom to like me, respect me, and accept that I'd accomplishedsomething; she gave a very humble ""good job"" a couple of times, but this reaction eventually reduced to ""Haha, imagine flexing this much with this small an amount of money! Your dad and I have seen a lot more money than $X/mo. in our lives; this isn't impressive.""

&amp;#x200B;

I was devastated to get this reaction from her, since all I wanted her to do was acknowledge that I had accomplished something and that she should be proud of me. I'm the youngest in the family, and every time I have an opinion, there's an implicit bias against it because I'm considered to be all talk and no accomplishments (even though I work myself to the bone and make sure to keep from). Not only that, the job at the company went really bad - had a toxic manager who didn't communicate well and verbally abused me, and ended up drinking away the pain of having to face her again as a failure.

&amp;#x200B;

She recently came back from a trip, and I broke down crying about all this; she accepts that she was wrong to compare me to my dad. She admitted that she was holding me to standards that were impossible by any measurement, but just said that she didn't want my ego to skyrocket from what I'd already done.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I fix this relationship with her? I've had 3 emotional breakdowns in the past 24 hours about this, and the pain is getting harder and harder to bear. I literally just want her to acknowledge that I've accomplished something nontrivial in my life, but every time I try to get her to admit that, she just invents a standard even more outlandish and more unreasonable than the last, all the while believing that she's protecting me from an oversized ego by making me want to drink myself into a coma."

The rotation program hired on interns who received an offer and were ‚Äúpooled‚Äù for managers across the supply chain org to own after they completed the program. When I accepted the offer, my group was marketed as being a mix between project management, supply chain consulting, and customer interaction.

Fast forward 2.5 years, this group has now re-orgd and my manager is saying most of my scope will consist of process documentation, testing new programs being developed by IT, and helping draft communications. He has said that I need to do this as a ‚Äújunior‚Äù role before being able to move up. Additionally, he forgot to send me this ‚Äúscope‚Äù for 2 months after I kept pressing. He was often in face-to-faces (he works remotely from me), re-org meetings, and vacation. 

In two of my 4 rotations, I was doing work well above this grade-level (leading a major cross-stakeholder project and taking a co-lead on another project to deploy a supply chain capability for a key customer).

I had reached out to my favorite rotation manager but she said that we will stay in touch and hinted that a job req might open in January. While I don‚Äôt envision myself staying at this company much longer, this could be a good fit to help me grow my skillsets short-term.

Finally, I realize the economy is red-hot right now and could be a great opportunity to job shop elsewhere to see a decent raise in my salary. I only have 2.5 years of experience since graduating, and I keep thinking about the statistic where ‚Äú\~70% of salary growth potential occurs during your first 10 years‚Äù. I did receive a promotion this year, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth sticking around for a boss

Should I stick out my current role, actively pursue my old group, or start applying externally?

Really appreciate your advice!"

I'm a recent graduate currently on the job hunt in a much more optimistic situation than I was a month ago, possibly closing a potential opportunity with a well-known company.

Something the last few months of exhaustive Leetcoding and review and study have shown me more than college and my internships did was how many hours and time to put in in learning new skills to stay fresh. I've been doing every project and practice under the sun - while my specialisation has been .NET and C# due to my previous work experience, I've been forcing myself to pick up as many new skills and languages and develop awareness of them as possible, as well as coding challenges, personal projects and Leetcode.

But this takes so many hours out of my day, and when I have a job that requires 8 hours of my day, I'm not sure how I'll be able to stay current on those. Coming home from work and then continuing work on other personal projects and learning new languages already feels tiring even though I'm not even in that position yet.

What's the ratio? How many hours of study and work do you put in after you come home from your job? I'm genuinely interested to learn what everyone's personal ratio is."

Will I be able to land an internship? Nothing too big like at Google or something, just a small company is fine.

Anybody know what questions they generally ask? 

Some internships are only for Freshman - Sophomores and some are only for Juniors - Seniors. I've been at CC for 4 years and then I will transfer to University - do I get reset back to Freshman upon transferring? Or is it just based on how many units I have done?

I see a lot of them asking for SQL - is that easy to learn?

However, I'm just an employee.

When I first started it was okay since I took an intern level salary and he had been building this company for a little over two years on his own. He's very knowledgeable and is an expert in this field and is very well-known. It's the reason for our immense success and client relations.

Anyways, main point is that he's a senior, has about 5-8 years of experience and became well known for his work. Whereas I'm a nobody who just came fresh of the graduation train.

But, we've been working together for almost a year and a half now and have grown this business to almost a million in sales per year. Again, mainly credited to him, but I still had a part in it. Yet I'm not seeing any of it. I'm still on a salary and got a single raise I asked for. Now I'm making a meh developer salary. He shut me down quick when I asked for that raise, it was a 20% jump from what I started with but relatively not much.

I have projects to my name, I've helped him fix issues, debug, create solutions, I literally built the entire UI our main product depends on and our clients love it. It looks good and behaves good. You can literally argue that the UI is extremely important when it comes to client attraction. Yet for some reason I feel like he's just going to beat me down again when I ask for my next raise.

I'm helping this guy become a millionaire, which I have no issue with, but at least pay me well? Other than cheaping out on me jeeze. 

I'm confident I can get a higher salary elsewhere, I don't want to use that as an argument for a raise though. If I were to say the work spread it'd be probably 80 - 20 with all things considered.

I'm losing motivation and the growth of the company depresses me cause all I'm seeing is it grow without me, when I'm literally the only other employee.

I'm going to ask for another decent raise, if he refuses or puts me down in anyway I'll be done with this job. What do you guys think?

Oh yeah, and I'm helping this guy build the team. I found a third developer to join us and I'm going to be showing him the ropes. 

At least I'm learning to fight for myself I guess.

Approaching 2nd year since I graduated college, with a useless degree and a minimum wage job. 

""You just don't have sufficient relevant experience.""

Phrases I've heard over a hundred times now. Apparently a degree isn't enough and you need to be experienced doing ""internships""/minimal excel monkey work at bottom level of the company to be considered a top candidate. And for internships they rejected me pretty much the exact same reason.

I didn't like my major anyways. I don't even know why I chose it. I only thought about money and its promising careers that my field(logistics) offered, and didn't once think about what I cared about. And now, even though I've kept my part of the deal, sticking with my major despite my mental struggles, my school and my major did not(Over 90% employment rate from my class btw, I'm the bottom 10%. My GPA was around 3.3).  

No job, and I am stuck working a minimum wage for however long now. In the very least, the job itself is ok. It's still labor in the end, but it could be a lot worse. One thing for sure though, this just can't be it for me. I see people work in these jobs for years on end, pointlessly climbing a structued rank for a bonus of extra dollar or two an hour while the work load increases indefinitely. 

My friends are moving on to greater things. Applying to grad school, making nearly 6 digits out of college, getting their first girlfriends. Speaking of which, never had a girlfriend, never been on a date, never kissed anyone. Only been rejected in my life. Too up in my head to approach and be like a normal person.

I tell my friends I'm fine. I tell people around me things could be all worse and I should be grateful. And for the most part, I am. But when my mom calls me and starts lecturing about how I need to be more optimistic about my situation, somehow it's my fucking ""attitude"" holding me back rather than the fact that I've just been dealt a shit card as life does. I believe some are more lucky than others, I don't feel particularly salty about this, it's just how the world works and I've accepted it at this point. I believe I'll realistically never have a normal romantic life as I'm a 23 year old kissless virgin who's yet to been on a date. I believe I'll realistically only make enough money to barely scrape by, seeing how my degree is completely useless and I am working a min wage job. I believe I'll never find a career that fits me because I have no experience in anything else in life and all I did growing up was to escape from reality through video games. That's not being pessimistic, that's just counting the odds and accepting your most likely fate. Doesn't mean I don't try. But it helps to lessen the pain when you don't set yourself up so high for a grand disappointment. 

But my mom refuses to just admit it. The fact that my younger brother is in every single way better than me, the fact that my major and my career never stood a chance, the fact that deep inside, I've always been like this and no matter how hard I tackled issues of life, it just came back to bite me harder and told me to stop trying. So I rage like an immature piece of shit son, because it's the only thing a boy like me knows how to do. Frustrated and hopeless, unable to understand where, why, how it all went wrong and if you were just meant to be like this from the start. I've tried countless advices and solutions to no avail and I have no more plans for the future(other than scraping by with this job and just laying low). And it's the only time when I can be completely honest with myself, through her. I distinctively remember asking her what I was better at than my brother, and I watched her trying to come up with some instagram quote-worthy qualities because deep down, even she knew I was the failed son that was never going anywhere.

Just needed to get this off my fucking chest."
e1unfb,9,2019-11-26,"Should I take on around $100,000 debt for Ivy League education or leave it?",jaysun733,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e1unfb/should_i_take_on_around_100000_debt_for_ivy/,"Maybe I‚Äôm stuck in a glass half empty mindset and can‚Äôt see it but would love some additional perspectives. 

I graduated this May with my BS in Business from a reputable top 10 business school / university. I realized that I chose the major out of compromise, to increase my chances of financial independence and not be unemployed, coming from a financially-insecure background. 

I had marketing internships during each summer during my university years. I really stuck with it due to inertia of being on this business-major path. Despite doubts, I accepted a sales development program role with the company, which started this August.

Not surprisingly, I caught early on that this role is not a great fit for me. I could not see myself continuing on in this path long term; I dreaded getting up and exerted as much effort as I could while minimizing how miserable I felt. I at least enjoyed building relationships with peers in the program and fellow coworkers. 

Early this month, my manager asked me to either do better and meet my quota so I can be eligible to graduate the program, or to move on (also this program was built to weed people out; many people were asked to leave or left so this conversation was not a surprise). I felt relieved, saw this as a chance to escape, and resigned. 

Around the same time, I received acceptance to a prestigious school for a Masters in Social Work. I‚Äôd decided to follow my natural instinct to move towards a helping profession and applied. I‚Äôve done much research into careers and reflected on my skills/interests. I understand what a social work career may entail.

I would love to go ‚Äî or perhaps that‚Äôs my ego talking. My financial aid package reflects 33% of tuition in scholarship for the school year - considering other costs of attendance, I foresee myself owing nearly 100,000 in debt by the program‚Äôs end. I was fortunate enough to graduate from undergrad with no debt but obviously this is not a sum of money to be taken lightly. I am aware that social workers do not make a ton generally, although certain parts of the field do pay better. I‚Äôve researched a ton and am aware of income-based payment plans and potential ways of securing student loan forgiveness.. 
Also I have a friend already in the graduate program who has incurred a similar amount of the debt that I would incur. They don‚Äôt seem too worried and have normalized student debt. It is an ~investment~ after all. Employment rates provided by the school seem promising. 

I‚Äôm supposed to submit my acceptance or rejection of the offer in a week or so. I‚Äôm really not sure how to proceed.

If I defer and save up some more money to put towards school ‚Äî well I probably wouldn‚Äôt get as much scholarships as I am now, so it might not make a difference. Tuition continues to rise each year. 

I could apply to a cheaper school but I‚Äôd still be in debt. Likely a lot less but I for some reason feel very not motivated to go this route. Perhaps that indicates I‚Äôm not as hungry for the MSW as much as I should be.  

I view pursuing my MSW as my way towards self-actualization; putting my faith-related, personal values into action. It‚Äôs a symbol of hope, to counteract the absurdity of my previous experiences. (Edit: this seems problematic). But will I regret the debt in the years to come, more than I will letting this opportunity pass by? But! might this be an opportunity to exercise some faith. 

It seems like there are no options beyond school+debt or an administrative job that I‚Äôll fill to stay afloat. (Tunnel vision trap?). Career changes into all the other roles I‚Äôve considered seem out of reach. 

Tldr; how to proceed when you don‚Äôt know how. When you know the only way to move forward is to take action, any action, but you feel stuck 

Basically, I‚Äôm not interested in having a career if I don‚Äôt pursue this MSW. And the smart thing to do seems to be not to go into so much debt..

Writing this helped me process my thoughts  

Would be grateful to hear outside perspectives


EDIT: thank you so much to everyone who provided their insights, I truly appreciate it and found the feedback to be helpful when I felt very much stuck. I decided to forego the admission offer and will either be applying to a cheaper school closer to home or gaining further work experience before pursuing more schooling. Thank you again"

(Posted this on the PR dedicated subreddit as well) I feel stuck in the middle of nowhere. Any advice welcome.

Some background info: came to the US for college and English isn‚Äôt my first language (due to it, I have a lack of confidence in my writing) (I know the lack of confidence in writing puts the odds against me, but I really like the PR/communication field). Currently reside near DC. I‚Äôm not as young as I would like (just getting my BA took longer than I would like to admit), and I have no much economic freedom (medical, housing, student loans, car note bills, etc.). I don‚Äôt think moving states for opportunities is a possibility with my current economic situation.

I spend most of my college time working on unrelated full-time jobs to pay for living and tuition (poor family background), so I didn‚Äôt get much of agency or in-house experience if any by the time I graduated from school. I have a BA in PR and a minor in business. After no luck finding internships or full-time in PR, I worked with small business (helping them with branding, social media, web design, graphic design, you name it), and that‚Äôs how I have been getting by getting experience communication/PR-wise. after one year looking, I finally landed an agency internship in creative/project management which I really like, and everything has been peachy since.

Since I was doing great and had been getting great feedback from team members, I talked to my supervisor about the hopes of extending my stay if a junior position wasn‚Äôt an option, and she said she would look into it. I had high hopes of at least 3 more months of experience there. I was finally getting a foundation of what a producer/project manager does in an agency setting, plus some account/research experience. However, I was told yesterday by HR that they have no current junior positions to offer me. I asked about the possibility of staying another term, and they said that they wouldn‚Äôt have much creative or account work for me and working admin wouldn‚Äôt be fair to me (which I get). I have less than a month left there. My economic situation hasn‚Äôt been great and although the internship pay wasn‚Äôt enough to sustain me (I have a part-time on the weekends too), I was hoping it would open the doors to something. Now, I find myself almost broke, with the bills pilling up and no confidence in the future. I have maybe two more months of bills if I play my cards right.

I have been actively applying to account coordinator, junior account executive, and assistant account executive with no avail. Most positions i found where internships that wanted someone to start ASAP which at the time I had to decline because it would‚Äôve meant ending my contract with my current agency early. Now, I look back and I wish I have taken it.

I really like the agency pace and the variety of projects. I also really like the creative project management of public relations, and how it allows me to tap in to difference projects and clients. However, I don‚Äôt know where to start anymore. It‚Äôs already hard as is for me with not much experience to find a regular junior account position, and now that I know I like creative, I feel like I find myself in an even bigger niche.

I have looked into creative circle and career profiles, but I'm not sure how they work. I welcome any experience with them.

What should I do? Where should I look? I‚Äôm getting desperate here (bills wise) I don‚Äôt really want to jump to another unrelated full-time job since it‚Äôs hard to interview for jobs while full-time 9-5. I can‚Äôt do unpaid internships because bills. I mean, I guess I could and then find an unrelated full-time job to survive but that would-be worst-case scenario.

Fly and Mosquito work as receptionists in a store. Bee is a newbie, she's like 2 weeks old on the job.

All I see happening is: Bee arrives to work, Fly and Mosquito vanishes away from reception, leaving Bee alone. She's not fully aware of everything yet, she needs help. Both old school girls refuse to help and even answer to Bee's questions. 

I am an intern and my job's different from theirs. Right now I need to be 500% focused on this task that needs to be done by December. Every day I need to stop what I'm doing to help Bee. Why? There's no Mosquito nor Fly in sight.

Today, a boss of theirs, Cicada, came to talk to Fly and Mosquito, saying that Bee is lost on her job, she looks scared by something and they need to help her more. (I was in the room next to the conversation, so I could hear them)

Fly said they're not helping because their boss Wasp, who's on vacation, told them not to help Bee, for her to learn with shocking experience.

Cicada and I thought the same: that sounds like bullshit. What kind of boss throw a newbie into lava hoping she'd learn to fly? Wasp's not like this. Cicada then tell her that it sounded like a lie.

Fly got stressed and left the room almost crying. The she comes back with Mosquito and another friend of her. She then asks Mosquito and her friend: ""Wasp told us that we shouldn't help Bee, right?"". Both agreed.

Fly then starts to tell how Bee's a slacker and she's always with the long face and how she doesn't want to talk to them, nor actually work. ""We are always busy in the reception, and I think Bee's scared of interrupting us for questioning"".

F*cking bullshit. They are never with her. They are never working. They are with their f*cking faces on their phones. They're f*cking liars who are trying to get Bee fired, just because they didn't like her, because Bee didn't want to be a f*cking Fly.

That's f*cked up and I want to step up for her, how do I approach it with better chances of winning?"

&amp;#x200B;

I was told that some companies offer corporate housing for interns and that it is a great experience.

The problem I get is I've had a really bad experience sharing bedrooms while studying. I'm an extremely social person (really, I am) but when it gets to sharing a bedroom I just don't feel comfortable at all. I've done it for 6 months. It was a really depressing time for me. I like to have fun and share experiences outside while also having my own space to stay alone for a moment.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that I don't want to reject corporate housing without really knowing what it is about.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any comments on this matter.

e25rfo,43,2019-11-26,Never Look At Yourself In The Mirror at 9:30 PM,cherryeverymoment,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e25rfo/never_look_at_yourself_in_the_mirror_at_930_pm/,"I recently moved into a new apartment when I got a new job at the city. It was a small one bedroom apartment that was good enough to keep me in shelter for the next three months. After all, that's the longest I am expecting this internship to last. Or so I thought.

 I placed a big mirror on the wall next to my night stand. It was something I got from a thrift store that I passed by when I was driving from our house. I figured that I needed a mirror because I didn't have one. It didn't seem so eerie when I first saw that mirror. In fact, it looked gorgeous to me. It had a golden frame that was twisted into intricate patterns, like vines creeping on the edges. It was flawless, which made it more worth it.

It was exactly a week after I moved in that I stayed up after work and watched tv. Although I didn't saw anything worth to watch that time, I can't embrace the idea of heading to bed. But when I did, something made me glance at the mirror. In there, I saw a bicycle being reflected before me. I quickly turned back to see if I left the tv open, but I didn't. Besides, the tv wasn't even facing the mirror or wasn't visible on the mirror from the angle that I was at. I shrugged the thought off, thinking it was an illusion. Perhaps, it was a way my body responded to show me how tired I must be. I looked at the clock beside my picture frame and it read 9:30. So I slumped into my bed and slept a second later. 

The next morning, I woke up at about 7:30 AM. It was very unusual for me to wake up that late because I was always on time. This made me hasten as I readied myself for work. I didn't bother to cook for breakfast. I just hurried and decided to buy something on my way there. By 9:15, I was out of the door. I swear I ran the distance to my office even as I knocked off some people on the way. I didn't even have time to apologize as 9:30 AM was the start of my busy day. When I was finally crossing the last street before I'd approach our building, the traffic light signalled ‚Äògo‚Äô. Even when only a few car was there, I was obliged to stop. But I was trying to quicken things up and tried crossing half of the road. When I was near the sidewalk, I heard a scream coming from the left side that made me avert my gaze to it. ‚ÄúMooooooooove!‚Äù screamed the guy who was riding a bicycle that was speeding up towards my direction. My eyes widened as I quickened my step. The bike swiftly moved past me with a strong wind following it. I heard multiple screams behind me before I stared wide-eyed at the man who bumped into some moving car. Blood splattered all over the road as time stopped for me and there was endless ringing inside my ears. The man riding the bike was dead. He was cut to bits. I also saw how the bicycle broke into pieces. Impossible.

I went to work late that day. I tried explaining to my supervisor but nothing came out of my trembling mouth. I ended up letting him scold me till noon. Although, none of what he said slipped into my mind. I was still imagining the guy as he screamed at me,how did a bicycle rider lost control of a bike? It was nearly inexplainable to me. 

I turned my tv off once again after mindlessly staring at it for hours. I stopped as I shifted my gaze to my mirror and saw something in it. It looked like a big cylinder container. Once again, I looked around the house and saw nothing that resembled what was in the mirror. When I looked back at it , it was gone. This is when I started to realize, the bicycle that broke into pieces that day was the same bike I saw in the mirror the night before. I was sure of it! Spooked out by what I realized, I got into my bed and buried my head into my pillow. As I moved around, I glanced at the time and saw 9:30.

The next day, I moved to work hurriedly. By 9:00 AM, I was already at the office. My boss was amused by this. ‚ÄúAnd to express his amusement‚Äù, he tasked me to take the scratched papers to the storage room up the rooftop. I couldn't do much about this though, so I gathered the papers in a cardboard box. I then took the elevator up the rooftop and walked towards the storage room. The room was partly open so I had no problem accessing it. I went in and placed the box on the corner. Just when I was about to head out, the corner of my eyes caught something that made me stop and turn back at whatever it was. Just meters away from where I placed the box, a black big cylinder container stood innocently. A wave of nostalgia passed through me as I remembered what I saw on the mirror the night before that. The sun peeking through the door shone on the container in a manner that made me walk closer towards it. I held the top of the thing and tried opening it out of curiousity. It was hard and harder to open but after about two minutes, I managed to lift the cover. When I did, the first thing that was released was a stench of stale blood and rotting flesh. I held my breath and resisted the urge to vomit as I peeked inside. 

I screamed as loud as I could once I made out what was inside. I stormed out of the room and into the elevator. My heart was pounding against my chest as the image of the rotting mutilated body that was stashed into that container crossed my mind. A picture of violence that I've never imagined I would see in the premises of my workplace.

I immediately called 911 and reported what I saw. Minutes later, the cops were putting caution tape around the storage room. I was still stunned by what I saw that I cried my eyes out. My boss advised me to take my day off and get back to work when I felt better. So I did.

I went into the apartment and glared at the mirror that laid innocently on the wall. I grabbed the hammer under my bed and started breaking the mirror as I cried a river. I made sure at the end of the day it was smashed to bits. But just when it was into pieces, something impossible started to happen before my eyes. The broken pieces floated and combined like liquid, forming back into a neat, flawless mirror. I stood there in awe as my eyes averted to my night stand and saw something equally impossible. My clock showed 9:30. Once again, I grabbed the hammer and I smashed my alarm clock five times. But like what happened to the mirror, it turned back into what it was and showed 9:30 once again. This time, I felt the urge to look at my mirror and what it showed, drained the life out of me. There, in the mirror, I saw a knife held by a guy who wore a pizza delivery uniform. The creepiest part of this picture was how his beady black eyes stared at me, complimented by his grin that literally stretched from ear to ear. My knees feebled and I fell to the floor as my tears streamed in silence. I couldn't scream anymore, I couldn't even move. I leaned at the end of my bed and started typing this. 

Right now, I'm still on the edge of my bed, afraid of what might happen in the next few hours. I stayed here from night till morning as nothing came out of me trying to break through my door. I also tried texting and calling people but nothing went out. I just hope that something can come here and save me before anything would come here and harm me. I heard my phone ring that jolted me to stand up. When I grabbed it, I saw a text fom my mom.

9:26 AM
‚ÄúHey sweetie, happy birthday! I can't come over because it's really chaotic here in the office but I ordered a pizza and it is on the way there! I love you baby.‚Äù

Then, I heard a knock."

Not a single interview offer. Just one coding challenge. 




Last summer, I got into an REU at a high tier university and it was a pretty fun experience, and it was my first actual internship. I also have a few minor projects on github (snake, AVL tree, circular linked list with dummy node, and honestly thats about it) and I had prepped by doing CTCI. 

I was honestly disappointed when I got zero interviews! I'm probably going to end up doing another REU this summer. I'm just curious, how do companies react to seeing two REUs on a persons resume? 




TL;DR I'm not getting industry interviews, wondering how bad it would be if I just did another REU, but I would then have two of them, and am worried companies might be put off by that."

Things started to become more severe in the past 3 months. I noticed a subtle decline that has been occurring for about 1 and 1/2 years.

Let's go back 2 years. I just graduated college with a bachelor's degree in sociology. I was afraid I wouldn't get a job with two Misdemeanors. Well, I was wrong.

I started a job as a Drug and Alcohol counselor last July (1 1/2 years ago). I was also accepted into a Master's program for Social Work around the same time. Exciting right? Good full time job and part time grad school as a commuter.

I have my own apartment, and it's nice because it's a house. I have isolated myself from friends and family in order to be completely dedicated to work and study. This has allowed me to succeed for some time. Now, things are slipping.

Currently doing an internship as part of grad school along with work is driving me down. I cannot get things done on time and have been reprimanded for being late on reports as well as timeliness to work. My grades are in good standing, thank god! But with finals approaching and work crushing me, I have been unable to move.

I tend to lay in bed, incapable of moving. Feel like giving up and things are hopeless, worthless even. I can't get anything done it seems. People depend on me and it hurts not to deliver. I feel like I could be depressed, but will not admit to it.

How do I get out of this rut? Have any of you had similar experiences? What inspired you? Who did you reach out to? Thanks in advance if you read the whole way through."

GPA - 9-11 grades 3.49 UW, 3.97 W (I had one C and all Bs in freshman year, accounts for low gpa), FYI - I have taken all honors classes offered by my school.

Rank - i come from a very competitive college preparatory school and am ranked 1 out of 4. yes, haha, my graduating class only has 4 students

APs- 3 APs (computer science principles, us history, english lang/comp), passed all, 3 more scheduled for this year (ap calc ab, physics, english lit) - ap physics and english lit are not offered as APs in my school so I will self-study. FYI, I have taken all APs offered at my small private school.

My ECs are pretty good, 4 yrs of basketball, 4 yrs of student council with president and officer positions in 11th and 12th, along with 300 plus hours of community service (president's service award from mr. trump himself lol).

If it makes a difference, I come from a super low-income family (single mom and younger sister). I'm a black male, migrated from Africa at 9 yrs of age. I also do work part time at Chick fil A (popeyes can't even compete).

I had a software internship the summer after my tenth grade year for a book company, helping manage an online bookstore and coding software (HTML, CSS, Javascript, some C++) to help maintain the site and database.

If CS seems out of reach, what other similar majors are MUCH less competitive? Thanks."

I let my manager know and she said i need to stay till the task is finished. Also she said I could not log more hours today ""just take some time off on other days when work is light"". 


She has also said similar things to other people at work too and it seemed to be a regular occurrence at this job. My question is is this legal? 

Also semi related question: what if I don't want to work overtime regardless? What if I just want to work the number of hours we agreed on and go home? Is it legal for them to force me to work overtime? I think they should get a fulltime employee or whoever wants the extra hours to do it if they want a big task done on the same day not a part time intern like me. Am I being unreasonable?

So I have never done this type of task before and even someone experienced at the company said it would take her a couple of days to finish. So needless to say I couldn't finish. I let my manager know and she said i need to stay till the task is finished. Also she said I could not log more hours today ""just take some time off on other days when work is light"".

She has also said similar things to other people at work too and it seemed to be a regular occurrence at this job. My question is is this legal?


I ended up working almost 11hr today with no break whatsoever. Unfortunately since I'm part time and I don't have paid holidays.my hours for the week will not exceed 40hrs so I guess I will not quality for overtime pay. If there anyway I can avoid this happen again while I still work here?

Is it legal for them to force me to work overtime? I think they should get a fulltime employee or whoever wants the extra hours to do it if they want a big task done on the same day not a part time intern like me. Am I being unreasonable?

Tldr: my boss insisted I work till task is finished, wouldn't let me log my overtime and suggested I just take time off when work is light. Is this legal and how should I handle this situation next time?"

I got my degree in business administration last year and it hasn‚Äôt really helped me at all. I went to several job interviews and it was only rejection after rejection. The only job offer I got was working at a movie theater, so of course I took it because at least I‚Äôd be getting a paycheck. I was able to move up and in under a year I was promoted to management. At the time of my big promotion I was pretty happy with myself, however now I just want a normal 9-5 job. Late nights, missed holidays and ever changing work schedules are getting the best of me. Dealing with guests who don‚Äôt get their way and tell you to ‚Äúhave fun at your dead end job‚Äù are making me hate myself and the potential I didn‚Äôt live up to.

 I can also see the disappointment with my family when I hear them talking about my job ‚Äúyeah she‚Äôs still at the theater.... hopefully something else will come up soon‚Äù.  I know they don‚Äôt mean to sound critical but I don‚Äôt think they realize how difficult it was for me to even get that promotion much less finding a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù.  

I was always really hardworking in school, but it never came easy to me. I think by the time I got to college I was burnt out and only cared about getting out of there and not about planning for future careers. Now that I‚Äôm so unhappy with how things have turned out, I‚Äôve started studying for the actuary exams on my own time. However, I‚Äôve been looking at articles online and unless I go back to school and pursue a more math related degree, it looks like that wouldn‚Äôt be any more help. I would like to go back to school but I don‚Äôt have the money for it. 

Not many things are going right for me right now. My friends are all getting their dream jobs/weddings/homes and I am nowhere near to getting any of that and I can‚Äôt help but compare myself.  I don‚Äôt know if I should scrounge up some money and go back to school, try and get an internship of some type or something else?? Any advice would be appreciated"

idk what my GPA is since I'm an IB student but I get mostly 6s and 7s (apart from chem which I kinda flunked and got a 5 this time so I'm a tad nervous about that) so I'm guessing I'm at a 3.6?

Hook: I was severely cyberbullied in eighth grade and had an eating disorder that got so severe I nearly got gastrointestinal cancer. I'm better now and I give talks to help parents identify eating disorders in children and give advice on how to get better (including diets and exercise, etc) and I've started my own organization to help teens called ""Bully-Mia"" and made a website called www.nomorebullymia.com

 ECs:

Published a paperback fantasy/mystery novel called Warped, 400 pages.

Published a Kindle book called Six Bullets on gun violence, 68 pages.

Started an organization called ""Bully-Mia"" to help provide free resources to parents and teenagers about the identification, aid, and adverse effects of bullying and eating disorders. I have spoken at offices and schools across Bangalore and tied up with psychiatrists and nutritionists to provide resources and datasheets for people, as well as providing them with therapists' contacts. I have sectioned the website I created into two parts: the blog and ""Our Stories."" The blog is a set of factual pieces and infographics, while ""Our Stories"" is a forum that allows victims of either bullying and/or eating disorders to share their stories. I also run an Instagram page. 

I'm an active part-taker in Model UN and have attended over 8 and have gotten awards. I've chaired and mentored students as well and I've been doing this from 8th grade. I've also helped organize my school's MUN and I chaired the CSW there.

I've been selected to participate in all-India writing contests, and on a school level, I've won slam poetry competitions, short story competitions, etc.

I don't play basketball anymore, but till 9th grade, I played on an interschool level and have attended over 10 tournaments and won awards in the same. The same goes for tennis- I've won doubles and singles tournaments (on an interschool level) but stopped playing in 9th.

I have an active blog and books on wattpad- one with over 115K reads and another one that won a contest by Harper Collins India.

I attended a summer program at Stanford for journalism and have started a journalism club at school.

I am a part of an international forum called Global Students' Square and I'm a student journalist.

I've held several drives and fundraisers to help old age homes and orphanages in my city.

I am a part of the student council as the school vice-captain so I've done a lot of events for that at school and outside of school for fests and all that fun stuff.

I am very into theater and music and have participated in countless musicals and gotten solo roles for the same.

I did an internship over the summer at a pretty big software company in the Communications sector and did articles and writeups for them that they published in their magazine.

(honestly idk I know my ECs are fairly solid ig but I'm mostly worried about my academics but will my ECs cover it up? and esp since I'm applying for english and have a lot of english related stuff + I'm doing pretty well at IB HL English? sorry I'm just stressed thank you guys)"

Apparently my supervisor remembers all of my past mistakes, and decided to use all of em to lash out on me. Sure I do make mistakes, but isn‚Äôt that what makes us human? What about the times when I didn‚Äôt fuck up, does he even cared about me? Nah, capitalists obviously doesn‚Äôt care. The moment he loses his shit, is the moment I realized, I was never a part of them. What I once called friends, were never friends to begin with, they had that fake smile, fake caring questions. I pretty much got backstabbed, all because I decide to work with my own style(and did pretty well except for a few mistakes) and express my feelings on those who I called ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. Thinking about this makes me sick. 

I will stop here for now, currently on a bathroom break. Supervisor will probably lose his shit again if I stay here for too long. Will update after my work ends.

Update : (this will be a VERY LONG TEXT about my recent life, please read it till the end if possible, much appreciated.)

I‚Äôm earning RM1200 per month, roughly about 286 dollars if google is right. Don‚Äôt know about other countries, but that is considered very low here in Malaysia(for me at least). To make things worse, I cant even get a raise via the normal way like doing your best to slave away your health and mind for the uppers. I have to take exams about the restaurant‚Äôs SOPs and pass them in order to get a promotion and pay raise.

I worked in this fine dining restaurant last year for six months before I have to resign due to personal problems. It was a fun six months, but you can blame that for my naiveness. I didn‚Äôt care about being a slave as long as I am happy along with good coworkers. I was earning RM800 a month due to being an intern from my culinary school. But I still go through each day happy and rarely cry or depressed. The old supervisor(we normally call them Â∏àÂÇÖ, which normally means teacher or master. But I prefer to use supervisor cos it‚Äôs easier to understand.) back then was a good person. Sure he still scolds like a military officer, but his advice often carries wise words, and he only gets mad when he needs to. Other than that he is the typical ‚Äúold man with a heart of a kid‚Äù type of person. I had fun working under him. Before I left, he told me that I can return to visit him anytime I want, which is a kind gesture that the other supervisors or owners I‚Äôve worked under didn‚Äôt have.

Fast forward until now, I‚Äôve returned to this place after being through 2 toxic workplaces. I though this place remain the same, with good coworkers, and a non serious environment that I used to remember. But I was wrong, very wrong. The old supervisor had already been transferred to a different outlet, and the area chef had changed a lot of the rules that I am familiar with. There are 2 new supervisors, one was the previous assistant supervisor, who is a cool immigrant. The other was  the one I‚Äôm talking about in this post. He‚Äôs a Chinese dude, who entered the kitchen with me on the same day last year. He had been through exams, and got promoted. Although on paper he‚Äôs just a crew member, he acts like a supervisor due to the actual supervisor being a immigrant and the area chef need a Chinese to take care of the place. He changed, a lot. Or maybe he didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm the one who changed, who knows? He acts like a leader, doing stuff he tells us not to do, leaves for 10+ minute toilet break when we were cleaning, keeps assigning me to a shift that I am not familiar with. At first I tolerated his change, thinking it‚Äôs normal for a leader to act like a leader. As time goes on, I slowly realized that he didn‚Äôt actually see me as a friend, just a colleague, All because I did not meet his standards. I can‚Äôt say I did perfectly, I did a passable job, little complaints, occasionally minor accidents like overcooking something or popped the dumpling due to reasons. But he remembers all of it, even the ones I did last year. Today he lost his shit when I did the same mistake again, it made me lost all hope for him, I didn‚Äôt talk back to him, I just simply smiled under the mask, knowing that he revealed his true colours.

What makes me really lose all hope for this god forsaken place, it the dude that I actually called ‚Äúfriend‚Äù. He is a cool dude, around my age (basically everyone here is at my age tbh). He acts like a friend to me, updates me with the new rules, makes perverted jokes, or just listens to my vents and frustrations about life. I just never learn about the  ‚Äúdon‚Äôt dismiss too much about your personal experience, thoughts and life to others, or it may backfire on you‚Äù advice. And now I finally faced the consequences. He would take pictures about the things I did wrong, things like splashes of water that I forget to wipe, small ass water stains on the fridge, or even misaligned bamboo steamers (if not clear enough, just imagine a stack of books on top of each other, but they are not stacked perfectly, but not enough to topple down) and send them to the work group chat, and let the supervisor remember my mistakes for future use. It was too late for me to realize his true natures. Everyone at work didn‚Äôt really socialize with me today, except for that one new girl coworker who is also sick if this place, and the immigrant supervisor, everyone else just acts like I‚Äôm not even there. At that time I knew, I‚Äôve been backstabbed, thrown off the tip of the pyramid, and left for dead at the base. I‚Äôve recently made a lot of mistakes that‚Äôve been making me depressed, trusting that dude is what breaks my heart the most. 

Now I‚Äôve decided to leave as soon as possible. My area chef threatened me that he would seek legal action if I leave without notice (I‚Äôm not sure about with notice) but I don‚Äôt really care anymore. My mind had been broken too much from all of these stress, depression and anxiety for work, I just DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT IT ANYMORE. Fuck this place, fuck this system, fuck this world, and fuck this life. Humans are born to enjoy the beauty that this world has bestowed upon us, but what we got is the remnants for the actions that those who came before us. Climate change, boomers, flawed education, shitty presidents, shitty people, and most importantly for this sub, CAPITALISM.

Born to this world as a slave for parents (I actually like my mother, she is the best mother that I can possibly have.), grew up as a slave for education, and survive adulthood as a slave for corporation and that dollar bill sign (or ringgit for my country) until the day I die. Why do I even bother care to begin with? 

Joining this sub is probably one of the best decisions I‚Äôve made in a VERY LONG TIME. Opened my eyes to a lot of things that seemed normal but turned out the exact opposite. Thank you guys for this sub for me to vent about my frustrations, learn about the world, and realizing what my life is actually worth. 

Sincerely, Axion."

However, I got offered an intern at a programming firm and I'm really confused what to do.

That published app needs work and time. Like its sustainable development, the marketing side...etc. Right now, it's still making me some money even though it's almost abandoned (I just update its server).  Also there are tons of problems I see on social media and no made apps to solve it. So should I focus on them full time.

On the other side, there is that intern I got offered and I can see the benefit of going there. Getting industry experience, training me in things I can't do on my own, working with a team...etc.

I have just graduated with my bachelors of computer science in australia. So I have been hunting for graduate, junior and internship positions recently. I have been offered a internship position, with the chance to turn into a full-time, where my project will be to automate a data retrieval process. This would start immediately and run into the March of next year. I believe this is a good opportunity however I am worried about how this may affect career prospects. I am worried because: 

* this project is not exactly software development for a product (it's a process for internal use in the company)
*  taking this job would mean I would miss out on potential graduate positions that start in january next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

To add to this, I have interviewed at other companies  that offer graduate positions and I did pretty well, although I haven't heard back yet. One of these companies seemed to have a really good culture and I would love to take the year-long graduate position there. 

I guess my concern is: would taking this short-term internship be a good bet for future positions? and would it lock me out of taking graduate poisitions in the future?

My resume looks like this: three years exp. moving furniture. Two years distribution route truck driver. A few leadership roles in greek life in college. 

I am in a difficult situation and as I'm getting older I feel that my options are drying up. I saw in the rules ""No Sob Stories"" so I'll try to be succinct. 

Went to university at 18 for pre-physical therapy bio major (BSci). Surprisingly aced most classes first two years. That summer I went backpacking and hitchhiking around with my idealist brother and opened Pandora's box. I went back for year 3 and started a downslide, eventually swtched to BA economics, quit taking classes around 5 years ago, now I have most upper-level courses in both majors but I trashed my transcript with 128 credit hours earned at 2.38 GPA. 

I went to North Dakota last Spring for that $100k oilfield trucking job, completed training in four weeks and promptly received my second DUI (first was in 2013). One week later I found out I was having a baby. 

Now today, as a parent, I've let go of my dreams of being a Hemingway and I am desperate for a career. I just want to be able to live comfortably, and I am looking for advice. I have been scouring the internet for ideas for a field that I can transition into FAST, because I think with any field I choose I'll be competing with much younger entry-level seekers with none of the baggage that I have.

I have two running ideas: some sub-field in computers, particularly data science, and engineering. I think computers is something one can teach themselves in, and with certs you become employable. Engineering because my notion is that as an engineer, a degree equals a job regardless of your history, provided decent grades in math and engineering courses. I can transfer my old credits so I really only need the math and engineering but I believe my poor GPA will carry over even if I attend a different school and do well from here on. I liked the oilfield, and engineering is respectable, and I want to get a bachelor's (I'd consider finishing the economics but it seems pointless now). 

I don't know anything about computers and I do not currently own a computer, I'm saving up for one. I'm taking calculus this semester at JUCO, but I feel like my bad transcript will hold me back in the long run. I am unfamiliar with professional attitudes/expectations and bars to entry in any field.

My question is, is it reasonable for me to break into one or both of these fields with my age and background? I can't really do an unpaid/cheap internship. Is there another occupation that's quick to enter perhaps without a degree that pays $60k entry-level that I should be looking at? Does one cement themselves as a blue collar worker?"

I've got 5 years in the industry. 1 as an intern and 4 as an FTE.
During my tenure I've gotten some good experience. I've been quick to learn and pick up on things. I like to think I know what I'm doing for the most part. I have my CCNA, I've been to a CCNP bootcamp (haven't taken the test because I knew Cisco was doing a refresh soon and didn't want to bother doing a deep-dive on legacy tech like frame-relay). Most of my current job duties are designing networks for company integrations and acquisitions for a reasonably large company (40k employees).

I recently interviewed for a senior level position because I want to start doing more high-level design work to challenge myself. Lo and behold I was extended an offer, but I feel unqualified. I'm extremely resourceful, but with the tenure and the nature of my current job, I just haven't been exposed to a lot of tech in networking. (I only have rudimentary knowledge in firewalls and higher-level design topics).

I'm pretty resourceful and generally figure things out and I like to think that I do my job well, but I function best when I have someone smarter than me to bounce thoughts off of, and I would be ""The Guy"" at this new position, albeit a much smaller environment, but still global.  This position would be a 44% raise from my current salary. A life-style altering amount of money. 

My current company offered my a pretty laughable increase to entice me into staying (not even a quarter of the increase the other company is offering). The only thing really holding me there is the love for my team-members and the stability of the company. 

I don't really know what to do. I'm young and I've made the mistake of thinking the grass is greener on the other side before, but it's going to take another 5-10 years to make what this company is offering me where I'm at now and I'm getting jaded with my current job duties.

I would say I'm an average student and while I have taken several programming classes and made a few smaller projects, I feel so incompetent sometimes. I just wonder if anyone would even want to hire me since I would need to learn A LOT in the beginning (probably more than most people who apply). I guess there's no harm in applying since I've got nothing to lose but I'm worried that 1) if I manage to land an interview, I will be asked a bunch of questions I have no idea how to answer and 2) if I somehow get a job, I think I will be over my head and not have a clue what to do. Taking classes and working on small projects on my own is probably VERY different from actually working in software development. I also haven't had any internships, mainly because I spent a lot of time helping out with my sick mother (she passed away a couple of months ago).

 Should I start applying even if I don't feel ready? If so, what is the best way to prepare myself for interviews and jobs in a relatively short time? Or should I do something else, maybe focus on an internship or something?"

Is it bad faith to apply for a position at the same firm, but different location?

Hello! Thanks for clicking. Before getting into the big stuff, a little about myself.

I am currently a Senior finishing up a degree in Computer Science, planning to graduate this coming summer. My CS course grades are good, and this is mainly a database/java position, which I feel are my two strong suits.

I am currently in the running for an intern position at a large software engineering firm. Yesterday, I had my final, in person interview, and after discussing with them, they had mentioned about hiring me once I graduate, but potentially before then. This is seemingly good news, but I was a bit pissed, seeing as up to this point, we had spoken about me starting much sooner.

Last night, I got on indeed to search for other interning opportunities. While searching, I found a position at the same company, but a separate location about 20 miles further, a trek I am willing to make due to the facility being what I am wanting to do.

(The current internship I am going for is government work, and will come with a clearance. The new internship is private sector, which is what I want to do mainly.)

Is it bad faith to apply for the new internship, while waiting to hear back about the current one? Will that affect my chances at all?

I plan to apply to other places as well, so if the consensus is to not do it, I still have the option of other jobs. 

Thank you for your help in this manor!"

My GPA is 3.98 (and 306 GRE). I am 22 right now. My dream is to leave MN to a state like CA for a good job. I have had 4 year experience as a computer technician, one internship as a Mech Eng Intern and also am working on my senior design project with a Fortune 100 company. I have been thinking either to apply for Grad school or full-time job. 

At first I wanted to apply for a MS in Mech Eng, but have noticed the demand for CS majors in general. Since my school offers MS in CS, I was thinking more about this path and it eventually makes sense to me to do a CS program instead of Mech Eng at graduate level. If this was the case, I will be completely a masters program in CS at my current school with a $13k debt after taking 6 pre-requisite classes (Will be done right when I turn 26). I personally feel like this is a steal since my only college debt will be $13k, and I graduate wit both a BS in Mech Eng and MS in Comp Sci. 

* Since ME and CS are both broad, will this be a great combo interns of job opportunities (Tesla, Google AI)?
* My school is ABET-accredited but not top 100 or anything like that. Is that going to be a problem?
* Is it a problem to do both degree in same school. I know few people working at Amazon, IBM and Google with a BS in CS from my school.

Thanks for taking the time (mabye) to read this post. As the title says, I'm a bit confused about the seemingly mixed signals I'm getting from the job market. For background, I am a 25 year old student at a good state school near the Midwest with a BS in chemistry going back to school for a BSCS. Since I had time in my schedule late in my degree, I was able to work on some of the CS coursework concurrently with chemistry, so I am currently a junior in the CS curriculum. While my overall GPA is on the low side (\~2.7) owing to some irresponsibility and other troubles from my freshman and sophomore years I would rather not get into, my engineering GPA is quite high (3.67) and I don't actually find the material to be all that difficult to take in and apply.

I began applying for internships earlier this year, but I have been universally ghosted or rejected, from which I (maybe wrongly) infer that I'm either perceived as overqualified due to having a previous degree, too old because I'm over school age, perceived as less amenable to training again due to prior experience, or that I'm not adequately representing my software skills on my resume. Don't get me wrong, I'm open to the idea that my skills are not up to snuff, I'm willing to grind at leetcode for as long as it takes to secure a position.

On the other hand, I must get emails from recruiters every week concerning positions in chemical science, IT analytics, data science -- jobs with salaries that are not to scoff at but I wonder, with the response rate I'm getting from internships, how I could possibly be qualified for the full-time positions about which I'm being approached. I've left a highly anonymized version of my resume on this post for critique, but I hope that the gist of what I actually put on it comes through the vague descriptions I've replaced them with.

It's been a few weeks since I got the offer but I just want to share a bit of my story because I never thought I'd be in this position.

I was kicked out of college the first semester of my sophomore year because my grades were abysmal and I couldn't bring them up. I left with a 1.8 GPA. I spent a year and a half out of school but when I came back, I took things more seriously. My GPA wasn't all As, but it was way higher than ever before.

I started to seriously think about my future during my Junior year, and I tried applying to internships. By this point, I took programming seriously and was putting in a lot of time outside of class to learn the foundations of programming. I wasn't familiar with any of the process applying to internships, so when I did apply, there weren't that many places available. The ones I did apply to all had hard GPA caps, which I didn't meet.

Luckily, I managed to find a job late into June of this year involving being a teaching assistant for a coding Bootcamp. By the end of the summer, having a good resume and applying to jobs and being leetcode ready was my top priority. I let my grades slip a little because a lot of my time was spent applying and practicing leetcode problems. I received like 8 coding challenges from really good companies but I fucked them all up because I wasn't leetcode ready yet. I got as far as to the final round interviews with Amazon, but when they told my they were moving on, I slipped in to a funk for like two weeks.

If you fall into a funk, that's okay. Feel what you need to, but don't ever stay there. You just need to keep moving on. After those two weeks, I realized I wasn't going to get anywhere if I continued my behavior, so I went back to leetcode. By this time I got a coding challenge from American Express and the rest was smooth sailing. I passed the first round, got invited to their superday, and was extended an offer.

To those of you with no experience and low GPAs, don't give up. You have to put in the time and yeah, you might have to grind out some work. Make sure your resume has decent projects and work on your interpersonal skills."
e2pia0,1,2019-11-27,Self-study vs Minor vs Double Major ME,tzroberson,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/e2pia0/selfstudy_vs_minor_vs_double_major_me/,"tl;dr: Is it better for Power Engineering (BSEE with Power concentration) to double-major in Mechanical Engineering, get a minor in ME (we already need a fair number of ME classes, so a minor is probably trivial), or not worry about it and just self-study ME books as the need arises? I'm planning to go into industry as soon as possible but would like to go back for a M.Eng./MS and get my PE at some point. I'm not sure what specialization I want within power but I understand ME (esp. Thermo) and Materials Science are pretty important when it comes to power generation.  
\----  
I'm currently in community college. I went back after a long period away and I have all my gen eds out of the way from 15 years ago, so I'm trying to get through the engineering curriculum in one year and be off to university in the Fall. I've also considered staying for a second year and taking the full year of Chemistry (I only need one quarter for the uni EE program) and all the other ME classes (I already need two, so there's not that many left). I'd just take classes part-time and work at the same time (I'm taking 20+ quarter credits and not working now).  


Staying an extra year would also allow me an extra summer to get an internship. In order to finish what I need to transfer to uni, I went this past Summer and will take 10-15 credits this next Summer. Assuming I only spend two years at the uni, that only gives me one shot at getting a summer internship between Junior and Senior year. I understand that internships are very important but are they worth an extra year?  


I plan to go to a small satellite school of a university, so there's only about 300 students (it's a full-size public state school with &gt;20,000 students) and at least half of that are engineering students. So even if I fulfill the minimum requirements to get into the Mechanical Engineering program, I don't know if they'd let me do a double major since there aren't that many spots.   


I've read on Reddit that double-majors and even minors are a pretty pointless waste of time and money. So is it worth even taking more than the minimum ME classes required for my BSEE? I am fairly comfortable in general purpose programming languages and have studied some academic CS topics so I'm not that interested in CS as a minor (also the satellite school does Software Engineering instead of CS and the CS classes they do offer are less interesting academically) and although you can get a Math or Stats minor with only like one extra class, there aren't really high-level math classes available. I'd really only be interested in getting an ME minor or skipping the minor altogether unless it's really just one extra class.  


Does the power industry care if and what ME classes you have taken or are they pretty much just interested in whether or not you have your BSEE? Is one summer enough for an internship or should I stay another year so I can have two summers available (most want you in a BS program, so I couldn't free up this summer for a third shot)."
e2plnp,6,2019-11-27,"I Have Multiple Passions, But No Idea What Job Fulfills Them",Dylan_408,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/e2plnp/i_have_multiple_passions_but_no_idea_what_job/,"I'm a junior in college and have been struggling to figure out what I want to do in the future. 

I'm currently studying animation because I thought I wanted to work in the industry, however the more exposure I get to what it would be like, the less I think it's for me.

People working in the industry have come to my college to talk about what it's like. Every time I hear one of these talks, I'm filled with dread. Working for a studio making commercials for instance sounds incredibly unfulfilling. Or even movies or tv shows. What I've realized is that I like animating, but not enough to work on other people's projects. I think the reason for this is I like being involved in coming up with the ideas and expressing something. If I'm just handed an idea and told to make it, I lose interest. I realized that I feel dread hearing about these jobs because I don't find drawing in itself fulfilling.

From what my professors and peers have told me, I'm a good animator, but my biggest weakness is my actual drawing abilities. I have this weird relationship with animation, because I like the technical parts of animating but I dislike the technical parts of drawing. I don't care enough about drawing to improve in things like perspective, form, etc. I don't draw in my free time, and when I do, I mostly doodle ideas. I like animation because it's about executing ideas and bringing them to life. This makes me think maybe I should do short films.

I've completed two animated short films before. I enjoy it, and I can do it... but I worry it's not a viable way of making a living. There's so many facets to whether or not a short film is successful. I'm not a good self-promoter and I'm bad business-wise. I'm also really slow at finishing projects. I seem to lose steam at the end of working on short films when it gets too repetitive. Like for instance, I have a short film that I finished animating and coloring completely. It's 90% done. But I just need to finish compositing and I keep putting it off by working on other creative projects. This seems to be a pattern with my work. I jump around to lots of projects, and for that reason, everything I make gets done very slowly. I'm always working on multiple projects though. I enjoy working that way and feel like having multiple projects scratches different itches.

I also really like screenwriting. I've written a lot of scripts in the past and love improving at it. I think I like it because writing a script is like compiling your ideas onto paper in an engaging format. Writing the ideas IS writing the script. Then once you get it all down on paper you can actually make it. The issue with exclusively writing is that I eventually want to do something with that writing but my stories are usually longer form. Short films let you write and create the ideas, but my scripts tend to not be appropriate lengths for short films.

Other things I do in my free time is make home brew DnD games. I enjoy it for similar reasons in that you write a story, design the game, draw stuff. It's a little bit of everything and you have creative control. You also get to share and experience it with friends.

Just so you have an idea of what I've considered growing up... My dreams have changed from being a writer, to making comics, to director, to the most recent being creating an animated tv show. I currently have no specific dream, but many passions. This is my issue.

So basically I find it hard to be passionate about working on other people's creative projects. I like to wear multiple production hats and creative control is really important to me. When I get out of school, I know finding a career with these specifications is impossible. A job like that sounds like the result of a successful career. That's okay. I'm just trying to find a direction to work towards. I don't want to do freelance or work in studios for the rest of my life. I just want to have a career target so I can pick appropriate stepping stones. I have no idea what job can accomplish these for me. Can I do something independent and get support for it? What platforms would allow me to do that? How do I go about it?

I'm almost done with college and I want to apply for some internships or jobs so I don't get out of school and get left behind. If I ultimately don't end up in a place with creative freedom, I think I will definitely be unhappy. My expectations are high which puts more stress on myself and my future.

Thanks if you've read all that. Any helpful advice is appreciated."

E. student graduating soonish (under a year somewhere) and I was wondering what to expect from my first job.

At least 5-6 companies near me (including Northrop, Textron, Lockheed as well as a number of smaller ones) have expressed a lot of interest in hiring me, so I should have some control over where I end up.

I know that starting salary will vary **a lot** by location - where I live now (DC Area) I'm expecting somewhere between 70k-90k, most likely in the 75k-85k range, and somewhere like NYC or Silicon Valley would be a lot more. I'm probably staying here, so I don't have too many questions about salary (unless I'm vastly wrong about the above, but most of my friends are in that bracket).

I'm more curious in terms of what benefits I should expect to be offered. For example:

1. Health Insurance - both for myself and possible future dependents
2. Other Insurance Extensions, like Dental/Vision and Disability/Life Insurance
3. Paid and Unpaid Leave
4. Anything else I left out."

It was new for me, and my former boss praised me (maybe too much) for the effort. I take that gladly, and applied more on my last year project. I show advances of my project to some of my professors who will be qualifying my project in the future. One seemed really interested on it, and asked more about it. I gave him a bunch of my work, including a little manual I wrote on my last work for future interns. I though he was interested on my project and would give feedback to improve, that's why I was good about giving him information I would keep to myself normally.

But turns out he knows a guy working on a similar project and take my work to help him on his work. When I realized I would not have anything in return, not even feedback, I felt betrayed. This applications of discrete element method is pretty much what makes my project unique. I can't just ask that information back.

Tomorrow I will be rushing to other professor to show them what I have done already, before the other guy adds it on it's project (we both are on the same faculty and have the same professors). I take really seriously those praises my boss gave me, and now I gave all my work basically for free to a guy I don't like. I kind feel a bit angry.

Is that common? I'm being sensitive? By no means I'm the best on that area, but take me a lot of effort and work to learn this, to write the manual... and now this guy can do the same with a lot less effort, just because he is kind o a personal friend of the professor..."

Their FT offer is pretty good (comparable to the FT offer in the company that gave me the intern offer). But right now, I really wanna have some growth in my career, and from the technologies that they use, it will not facilitate my growth.

So does it make sense to take an intern offer over a full time offer?"

e2vq4d,2,2019-11-28,Struggling with Motivation and Feeling Lost,T1058445C,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/e2vq4d/struggling_with_motivation_and_feeling_lost/,"Hello there,  
I am currently a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major, over the past year, I have struggled with finding a passion for what I am learning. In my winter quarter, I did not pass my coding class due to receiving a C- when a C or higher was required as a prerequisite for the next course. Because I had assumed that I had successfully gotten by in the course I had already registered for the next course, when grades came out I was devastated and attempted to try and sign up but was too late as the course had been filled. I decided to risk not taking the coding class and instead chose to take other major required classes knowing I would fall behind in the designed flowchart for the ""4-year plan"" hoping to find a spark of inspiration or motivation while taking the engineering courses that are also required for my major. That quarter I received the best grades I had ever gotten since attending college and was somewhat content with my progress but recognized that if I wanted to get out of the hole that I would need to continue this habit.  
Currently, I am retaking the coding class that I received a C- in and have been doing much better but feel as though I need more practice. While I do struggle with the assigned labs, I feel as though I lack the repetition that can be performed with math, through repeatedly practicing similar problems or problems, in general, we can better understand what we are doing. What options or opportunities are available for practicing coding? (currently learning python, but I would like to practice other languages as well)  
Another big issue that I have been experiencing is a lack of motivation/passion. I simply attend classes to try and learn basic skills so that I can one day apply them in a job. The computer science field is enormous and I hope to find an interest that fascinates me.  Throughout high school, I participated in VEX Robotics making it the World's stage twice, this was my reason for embarking on this study of Computer Science and Engineering. Now that I no longer participate in this though I feel like I am not applying myself as much as I would like to. Are there any resources where I can learn about different jobs or opportunities or even general fields so that I can learn more about this vast field?  
I have a few friends that are in a business frat who are also CS majors, they have given me a few pointers here and there but I cannot help feeling like I am stuck chasing after them. Both are interviewing for internships and seem to know what they want to do with their future. Due to my past failure, I feel like it would be impossible to get an internship so I have avoided the idea of applying to them. My last question is should I still be applying for internships with my bad GPA (currently below a 3.0), inexperience and never being employed before? (also where do I even apply for internships)  
If you have made it this far, thank you so much for reading and taking time out of your day. I have been extremely conflicted about these questions and wasn't sure who to ask.  Any feedback and advice is gratefully received, even if you condemn me, I would just like some type of response to help me find my way!  
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and if you don't partake have a wonderful day!"
e2w4yw,40,2019-11-28,"Hey Randia, can you please help me out here?",finalodabeer,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e2w4yw/hey_randia_can_you_please_help_me_out_here/,"I will start from the beginning. My family is lower middle class, and I have been at the receiving end of this financial crisis. I grew up watching my mom always complaining about how we don't have enough money and how my dad is not doing well with his job. As I am the eldest in my family, I took it as my responsibility to be as frugal as possible. I tried limiting all my expenses during my school days and my class mates always teased me for this. I was also limited to my household and never had any interaction with my neighborhood peers.
I still regret it to this day that I didn't had any worldview and was restricted only to Television. 


I took Computer Science as my stream in Higher secondary. I looked forward to becoming a software engineer. I was always interested in animation, gaming, movies. I honestly did a research for my future studies and decided to become an animator. After completing my school, I revealed it to my parents about my decision. But as they didn't have any knowledge about the prospects of being an animator and concerned about a low paying job, they asked / kind of forced me to take up engineering. Honestly, I didn't have any idea about engineering courses at that time and didn't look up as I decided I would go with the flow and be an animator later. 

When the time came to chose the stream, I had immense pressure from my family to take a course with the ""scope"". At that time, IT wasn't booming, so they told me not to take it. I was asked if I was interested in drawing, and so if, you can choose Civil Engineering as it also had ""scope"" to get a job. ( I was naive about architecture, NID, NIFT and other institutes, and I blame all upon me). 

I also had the fear and urgency to help my family financially, so I took up the course which would give me a job after college.
Fast forward , college was over and I was in the real world. I started to apply for jobs as a Site Engineer, but everyone around told me to search a job in UAE, and before that you have to learn AutoCAD. So, I studied AutoCAD and Revit. I was starting to get a grip of the world outside and the regret was starting to boil up in me about not following my passion.

I started to job hunt, and spent half an year to no avail. After that, I got admitted as an intern Site Engineer. I would spend my days at the site with supervisor and with nothing to do and just ""learn everything by watching and gain experience"" kind of thing. Life was starting to become raw and the regret was getting strong. 


I left that job to be a marketing executive at a hardware store. I started designing social media adverts for the company during my stint there. Left that gig when I got employed as a draftsman through my dad's reference and it was also well paying compared to the previous. I was getting worried about my life and my inability to help my family, being dependant on them.

The draftsman job was nothing as I expected. You are just supposed to draw and copy paste according to design by ""engineers"". One thing I learnt from that job was that I never had a future there or anywhere. If I leave the company and start searching for another job based on the draftsman experience, I wouldnt get any and if I, get one, would be a very low paying. Ive seen my colleagues who are in their 50s and 40s, still continuing in that company because they didnt have nowhere else to go. 

I left after an year. Told my dad that I can't continue with this and have to follow my calling. I was lost at first, not knowing what to do and how to start. I decided to get into NID and study animation. But, as I started to learn about animation and design, I got fascinated with Graphic Design. I wanted to be a Graphic Designer. 

Spent an year preparing my portfolio, studying. Hardwork did payoff , got till the interview stage of NID, but maybe I didnt have anything to show as a job experience, got rejected. Got admitted to another school, but I noped out because of the fees and wanting to try NID next time. I started to hunt for job and earn a degree with my money. I cannot put my family through a financial hurdle again.

I've been trying since then and now its and year and havent got employed yet. I did some freelance gigs but couldnt stand on my own.
Still depended on my family and still searching for a job.
My father and family have been forcing/pressurising emotionally about the financial status of the family. They are daily arguing with me to work as a Civil Engineer and earn and support the family.

But I cant repeat it again. My regret has finally taken a toll on me,and now  I really want to follow my passion and ambition. I just want to know what do you guys think about this. Am I doing the right thing? Even if I start working as an engineer again, tbh, my mental health will get worsened. Help me out guys!"

e2xu06,719,2019-11-28,Wash Your Hands,griseo_veritas,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/e2xu06/wash_your_hands/,"It started with Frank, our maintenance guy, being found dead in the mens‚Äô bathroom one morning. His neck was the most horrific god-awful colour I‚Äôve ever seen on a person. Deep, dark purple rippled with red marks where the vessels beneath his skin burst and leaked blood into the skin. His eyes were practically falling out of his skull, dried blood was caked black beneath his nostrils, and his trousers stank of piss. Whatever happened, he left this world in terror.  

The coroner said it was death by asphyxiation, but who does that to a person when they‚Äôre face down in a toilet? The atmosphere in the office was foul for months after. People felt unsafe, they were shaken up and crying, and some contemptible bastard even started a rumour that it was some kind of weird kink shit gone wrong. Like that would matter even if it were true?  

As you can imagine, that particular bathroom became a ghost town immediately. Maybe it was the atmosphere playing with people, but soon there were all kinds of stories circulating. One of the women in accounting claimed that she heard the stall doors banging, and one of my marketing colleagues, Ted, swore to me with a pallid expression that he heard sloshing water and the gurgles of a drowned voice. I punched him on the arm and told him to shut up, not least of all because he was freaking out our intern.  

It was all just rumours and stories. Then, one of the stories came true.  

We had a new girl start in the graphics department. She came in with a nice upbeat attitude, and made herself an absolute delight on an otherwise dreary morning. Ted asked her almost immediately if she had heard about the bathroom, but I shut him up and kept the conversation on track as she talked about her two dogs with infectious enthusiasm. It was nice to have a positive force in the office for a change.  

Perhaps I should have let Ted warn her.  

It was 12:58pm exactly when I heard her scream, that much I‚Äôll never forget. Her piercing shriek was like a shockwave lancing through our corporate bubble, stopping every conversation dead in its tracks and leaving a haunting silence in its wake. For a couple of seconds it was like a bomb had gone off, and I couldn‚Äôt even hear the birds outside my window.  

Another scream shook me out of my stupor, and I followed two of my colleagues who charged into the womens‚Äô bathroom. The new girl threw herself into the arms of our receptionist, Katie, like a kitten being pulled from a river‚Äôs current. She sobbed uncontrollably, shaking her head and saying ‚Äòno, no‚Äô over and over again. She hadn‚Äôt even pulled her skirt all the way back up before fleeing whatever had set her off, and she couldn‚Äôt stop kicking her legs long enough to stand up right. Katie stroked her hair and spoke gently to her, looking over at me with a mix of shock and confusion.  

I checked the stall while Katie helped the new girl fix herself up and tried to get an explanation out of her. The door was slightly off balance where it had been so violently thrown open, but nothing else was out of the ordinary. Some water on the toilet seat, yet no sign of anything that should have scared somebody so badly out of their wits.  

The new girl was taken into a room with HR, and I never saw her again. Her boyfriend came in and sheepishly handed Katie her written notice the next day.  

‚ÄúAnd that was that,‚Äù she later told me over lunch. ‚ÄúI asked him how she was.‚Äù She grimaced. ‚ÄúAll he said was, ‚ÄòI hope you find out who did that to her‚Äô.‚Äù She looked at me with glistening fear. ‚ÄúWhat the Christ is going on around here, Doug?‚Äù  

I wish I knew. I never considered that some*one* could have been to blame for the incident, especially because she was totally alone in the womens‚Äô bathroom. Nobody came out, and the windows in there don‚Äôt open. The police came in a few times that week, speaking to managers and checking the bathroom, but every time they emerged with a shrug. The office manager even hired an engineer to come and check the place out for carbon monoxide, but nothing was found. I know I wasn‚Äôt the only one who‚Äôd bizarrely hoped for poison in our air, just so we could write the whole situation off and return to our safe bubbles.  

We wouldn‚Äôt wait long for a reminder. I‚Äôd been out for lunch, but I came back to Ted wearing a bleeding lip and one of the graphic designers wielding a baseball bat. ‚ÄòThis is exactly why you don‚Äôt play ball games inside‚Äô, I tried to tell him, but he just laughed and pushed past me to the bathroom. I stood in the kitchen making idle chit chat, until the whole office was silenced like it had before.  

Ted started screaming bloody murder, and the sound of sloshing water told me something else was in there with him.  

This time I didn‚Äôt hesitate, and I charged down the hall and ducked into the men‚Äôs bathroom to see the locked stall shuddering and banging.  

‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ, help me‚Äù screamed Ted, his last two words garbled as if his tongue couldn‚Äôt move.  

I kicked the door but it just deflected my foot like rubber. Sudden fear made my legs weak, and another feeble kick forced me to try another route. I climbed onto the toilet next door and nearby collapsed at the sight of the scene below.  

Ted was on the floor, and a long, inhuman arm had his entire lower jaw in its grip. The skin was green and corroded, like a piece of copper left to rust at the bottom of the ocean. The tissue was bloated and rippled like a waterlogged corpse, and it stank of the very deepest filth of the sewers.  

I hauled my leg over and lowered myself into the cubicle, slipping on spilt water on the tiles. I flailed to steady myself, and my hand brushed the putrid arm as I did. It wrenched in response, and with a sickening pop and crunch, Ted‚Äôs jaw was dislocated and he screamed over the fattened fingers that were buried in his tongue. He wrestled with the arm and I pulled myself up.  

He was suffering, and I‚Äôd have to use force to save him. I grabbed one of the fingers that still held his broken jaw, wrestled and pulled it back out of his mouth, and forced it backwards until it popped. Bubbles burst forth from deeper within the toilet, fizzing on the surface and releasing the muffled screams of whatever was attached below.  

I popped another finger and the arm finally let go, quickly receding back into the water. I grabbed at its elbow and my hand failed to find purchase on the slimy skin, but I managed to wrap my fist around its wrist just before it was totally gone. I braced a foot against the bowl and pulled.  

I wish I hadn‚Äôt pulled.  

With another loud pop and a sound like a wet phone book ripping in half, the arm came free at the elbow, spraying green pestilence and releasing a stench that made me vomit all over my shoes. Browny-green filth gathered on the surface of the water, and I hammered the flusher to get rid of it as fast as I possibly could.  

Unlocking the stall door, I helped a whimpering Ted to his feet and handed him off to my colleagues. When I returned to the bathroom minutes later, the arm was gone, with a new layer of filth on the toilet water.  

I‚Äôd thought, and hoped, that whatever that thing was had bled out and died in a pipe somewhere. That is, until I saw a news report this morning. Some shaky phone footage had been taken on a street only a couple of miles from our office. It had been recorded late at night and was too dark to see most of what was going on, but a person was unmistakably being dragged into a storm drain by a pair of long, inhuman arms.  

The victim had been a clubgoer, and only a few pieces of him were ever found. My wife couldn‚Äôt understand why I sat bolt upright when the reporter said he‚Äôd been in a fight before the incident.   

I think I‚Äôve finally figured it out. It likes blood, and it‚Äôs in our [water](https://twitter.com/ethandavidlee)."

Here's the thing, I didn't take CS as an a level and therefore can't get onto direct entry to my desired course - I'd have to take a foundation year starting in September 2020 and then I'll finish in 2025 (because it also includes a placement year).

Should I just finish this film course (finish in 2022) and do my masters in CS? I've checked CS masters courses that require 2:1/1st from any subject for entry.

Time and money are the main things that bother me about changing courses. However, I'm not sure how 1 year mscs are valued by employers in comparison to full 3 year bachelors. Plus, it seems like getting an internship is really helpful to find work as a programmer which would be easier with the bachelors degree. What route do you think is the most sensible and prosperous?

I don't mind the content and sometimes I really do enjoy it. I never grew up knowing I wanted to be an engineer or had this unwavering passion to build new things. I was never a math and science prodigy, but I did fine in it and have come to appreciate the beauty of both fairly often. I eventually decided on the comp e degree because I saw how versatile it was and that it's inevitable that I could apply it to make a difference in the world.

Since my freshman year programming class, Ive dedicated ~6 years to the idea of becoming a computer engineer. Ive done years of STEM related extracurriculars and camps and have an internship coming up this summer hopefully. While I'm getting better, I have yet to feel like an expert, ever.  Or a ""natural"".  At least in the way I do with English. I'm at a crossroads:

Do I ditch the delusion of a career in writing, going all in and focusing more energy than I previously have on my engineering path and hoping I can become decent? I'd be secure and maybe even find success.

Do I take the risk and drop engineering, concentrating on my writing? Its hard to re-enter engineering once you left. There's less security with this and is TV really making a difference?

Do I try and juggle both? Is this just procrastinating my eventual decision and/or is it guaranteeing that I fail at both?

An feedback is appreciated."

There's a million books that I would like to read but it's tough to read through 500 pages without actually typing any code. Maybe I just need some project ideas? I feel like this a very beneficial path to follow but I just don't know how to approach it.
* Trying to get some deeper understanding of a certain area. It could be compilers, data bases, operating systems... Mostly what you learn in college but try to go as far as possible with it. This is easier to do in my free time but it's also hard to come up with projects that are not so big that I drop them eventually. If done right I feel like you can do a lot of fun stuff and it feels like being in a Hackathon where you care about the short term result. However, it's not easy to say if any of this will help me in the future, since I could end up doing different things.

I feel like there's cons and pros for both of them and perhaps I just need someone else's experience or perspective. Doing what I enjoy the most is not really an option since I enjoy all areas pretty much the same way. I literally can't tell people what's my favorite subject within computer science because I don't have one. Also I apologize if this subreddit is not for this type of things? I felt like things  /r/cscareerquestions is too business oriented. 

Thanks!"

One is for a startup where I would do DevOps with Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, etc. 

The startup is doing very good and they said I can also later switch teams to their WebDev Team if I want  to try that kind of work out . The recently got a lot of investment by some big company and are already backed by another huge company and I can see them really becoming big tbh.

The other company is a small company run that does contracting work for different companies and a few research projects for universities. Here I would work as a developer, depending on the project I would most likely end up as a full-stack web dev. They work fully agile and I have a friend there that really enjoys his time there.

The first company offers SIGNIFICANTLY more money ( about 30% more but since its internship + in europe its not a HUGE loss, it would amount to like 300 euro a month less). Since I am a student I only know about Software Engineering and not a lot about DevOps but I feel like I would miss out on experience since I did not have an software engineering internship yet and feel like it would look bad on my resume if I graduated without experience in Software Engineering.

So what do you think?

I am worried that pure DevOps experience and lack of real Software Engineering experience would bite me in the butt in the long run. But then again, idk a lot about DevOps and in my particular city the demand for it seems to be EXPLODING."

But I thought I might post on here because I'm genuinely really unsure how to move forward and would like some words of support or advice.

So this semester I've been able to get 13 interviews with 3 more upcoming next week. I've been rejected from all 11 interviews (one I haven't heard back from). The interviews were 2 onsites, 1 on-campus at my University (technical), 3 2nd round interviews (technical), 4 1st round interviews (technical), and 3 1st round interviews (HR). Waiting to hear back from one of the onsites. The 3 upcoming ones I have are 1 HR phone interview and 2 technical interviews. And 2 Hackerrank tests.

I've additionally done 6 Hackerrank tests (passed most or all the test cases) within the last three weeks. Haven't heard back from any of them.

I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong. I mean looking at the point where I'm getting rejected, it's the technical round that's tripping me up. I just don't know how to get better at them or what I'm really doing wrong because I don't receive any feedback. I've tried doing mock interviews on [pramp.io](https://pramp.io) but the feedback I get are mostly somewhere along the lines of, ""Yeah, you good."" So there isn't much constructive criticism for me to build off of.

Some background on myself:

* Top 100 Uni, CS department is all right.
* Internship at Fortune 100 company
* Leetcode - maybe 20 or 30? Not a lot, I've been focusing on recognizing leetcode patterns and common questions. I started a bit late on this and have been dedicating some time to catch up. 

Has anyone been in similar shoes before and have any advice? Or just pointers/tips in general?

Thanks in advance!

Before proceeding to the question, let me introduce myself:

&amp;#x200B;

* I am second year computer science student studying in best university (4 year university) in one of the CIS state (former USSR); however, this university is not in worldwide rankings and it is pretty decent. I'm 18 years old right now  
 
* I want to work in top tech company or possibly make PhD in good university, so I need background, as well as good university with good GPA. Besides, I want to have opportunities to have internships in those top tech companies, so studying in good European university can be an advantage.  
 
* My GPA is around 2.90 out of 4.00. German universities requires graduates from former USSR to study at least one year in university to be able to study in Germany. If I will enroll in German university, I will be able to have the new GPA, which can be not as low as this. Moreover, German university requires 3 years to study, so I will lose 2 years (one because of university education in my home country, one because of German intensive language courses in Germany).  
 
* I used to learn German till A2 2-3 years ago, so I think I can refresh my past knowledge and learn a little more till B1 until September 2020  
 
* I think about learning more of German in Germany after September 2020 from B1 to C1, as well as look around for opportunities for bachelor (city better for career opportunities, life, university)  
 
* I have a great background in extracurricular activities, as well as in activities in CS, but unfortunately I was never able to study in strong university  
 
* However, I thought of options to transfer out of my university or even start my education from zero in Europe, as it is comparable easy to get admissions to decent universities as far as I know, and just a little hard to get admitted to top uni (like TU Dresden perhaps). So I thought that I can get into pretty strong university and get solid education in Germany, and to have a strong foundation for good master degree.  
 

I have a question to you, is it worth to start to learning German in September 2020, to start for university in April 2021 or October 2021? Or is it better to stay at my own university and apply for master in Germany? I heard bachelor degree matters a lot as it is the foundation.

e3ag31,2,2019-11-29,I don‚Äôt know if I should stay with my major and its starting to make me panic. (LONG POST - TLDR AT BOTTOM),Pikastach,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/e3ag31/i_dont_know_if_i_should_stay_with_my_major_and/,"Apologizes for formatting, Im on mobile.
Im trying to get everything relevant written without making it too jumbled.

TLDR at bottom.

First a bit of context.
Im currently in my first semester of college. Initially while applying I thought I needed all the help I could get to get in so while choosing my major I looked for what would be the most out of the ordinary and settled on petroleum engineering because I figured it would be boring and not many people would pick it. Little did I know the college Im going to is one of the best in the world for petroleum engineering.

Due to extreme luck I somehow made it into the college of my dreams despite my extreme stupidity and lack of credentials. Though now Im having many second thoughts about my declared major.

Ive always had a large interest in the medical field. I find pharmacology, the body, and  psychoactive substances fascinating and I find myself browsing r/supplements r/medizzy and r/nootropics quite often. As a casual drug user I also find myself reading scientific literature about substances and their effects on the body and mind extremely interesting and my friends come to me when they want to know what something is, if they should take it, if its safe, and what potential harm it can cause because Ive grown to learn a decent amount. 

I love the human body and find it so interesting how many things work. I also have extended this learning to apply it towards growing physically, I develop my own exercise plans with mesocycles, diet and muscle hypertrophy. I coach my friends and have made others and myself decent gains through lifting, and I love reading new journals that come out on different topics related to muscle building.

I guess all this is just a lead up for me saying I think the body, its chemistry and the mind are fascinating, from MAOIs to knee anatomy I cant get enough.

I‚Äôve been told by a large amount of people that I should change my major. Everyone says I know and talk too much about it to not seek a profession in the medical field, but I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôve been gifted such a great opportunity to become a P.E. it would be a shame not to take advantage of it especially with the school Im at. Plus if I were to graduate, the payoff would be enormous and Ive already began making connections and have gotten an internship interview with a decent sized company, and Im almost done with my first semester. The pay is the main attractor to P.E. for me, I see the alumni come in and talk to us and I feel like Im looking at a future me, a future with stability and no money worries unlike the first 16 years of my life.

But if I have no passion for it should I even consider it? I feel like its already too late and Ill be too far behind. I didn‚Äôt take AP Biology in high school and Ive already started on the P.E path even taking every physics class my highschool had to offer. On top of that what happens if Im not smart enough and then I cant get back into the engineering school due to grades? I barely made it into this college based off of legacy, how would I even manage? I cant see myself doing it no matter how hard I try. I have As, Bs and Cs in my classes right now and Im trying so hard and college is a huge difference from high school its so cumbersome.

Anxiety is building and I feel as if I don‚Äôt make a decision very very soon Im going to be stuck with that decision wether unhappy or happy my whole life and I don‚Äôt want that. I want to be happy. I want to financial freedom, stability and more. I want success for myself so my family will be proud of me. My siblings are lawyers and CS majors I just want to be seen in the same light as them. Successful.

I cant waste time or my parents money so Im working as hard as I can but what if its not enough in the end?

At this point any advice is highly appreciated. So thank you to anyone who comments on this.

Apologies. This turned into a ramble.

TLDR: I got into a Petrol engineer major at one of the best school for it in the world out of luck. I have passions in the medical field. I am considering switching majors but don‚Äôt know if I should."

e3b9oz,6,2019-11-29,"Reddit, please help me, I'm not quite sure how I get out of retail and into the field I actually went to school for.",hawkfan13,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e3b9oz/reddit_please_help_me_im_not_quite_sure_how_i_get/,"Hi Reddit,

So I am in a bit of a dilemma as far as my career outside of retail goes. I am not sure if this is a post more suited for career guidance, so I apologize mods if this post is misplaced.

This will be a moderately long post so please bear with me as I explain my situation...

Starting 4.5 years ago I started out as a cashier at a moderately well known hunting / sporting goods store as a part time gig to give me a bit of supplementary income while I finished my Associates Degree in graphic design. My original intention for this job was to only stay a max of 6 months until I graduated. However as time passed throughout this job, I made quite a few friends there and I started to enjoy my time there a bit more each time. Fast forward to a couple months before my graduation, I land an unpaid internship with a local start up. This internship was not quite what I had in mind as far as putting my best foot forward to my ultimate career goal (graphic design for professional sports teams) but I felt it would at least guide me towards that direction. I put my best effort into the work I was assigned by my supervisor (icon sets, logos, branding etc.) and my supervisor was pleased with my work from what I gathered during my time there. However I was not offered a position after the duration of the internship. This was not a huge issue to me at the time because I felt that I was not going where I needed to be with them, so I wasn't terribly upset.

Fast forward to graduation. Since I didn't have a job in my desired field yet, I decided to take the max part time hours at the store and spend my other time applying for jobs in my niche field that I have centered my portfolio around. I didn't exactly set the world on fire when applying for jobs, as I'd be applying to 2 a day max. This went on for several months; I'd get a call here and there requesting a phone interview, but at only one point did it escalate past that to a in person interview, to which I received an email back saying they had decided to go another way.

Now we are coming to the point where I have accepted a full time position at the store and have dug myself deeper into retail. At this point I have been at this store for over a year and half and developed good friends at the store who know and trust me to do my job well. I accepted this full time position as a Inventory Control Specialist because it had pretty good hours (7 AM to 3 PM M-F) and a pretty decent pay raise from what I was making as a cashier ($7.60 to $10.25). I really enjoyed my time at this position because I supervised myself and I had great hours. In hindsight I really wish I stayed in this position. Anyways I digress back to my point. As I made more money I spent more money, by buying a car for the first time and making bigger purchases in that sense. This goes on for about another year to year and a half.

Finally fast forward to now. I have been working as a Receiving Manager at the same store I applied as a cashier at. I still do not have a job in my field and it's almost been 4.5 years since I graduated. This job has made me miserable since the day I started it. It came with another decent pay raise, which is ultimately why I accepted it ($10.25 to $13.13) but at this point the pay is not equivalent to the amount of work they are expecting me to do. This jobs duties used to be comprised of unloading trucks, processing any defective returns and answering any billing questions forwarded by accounts payable. These duties were not earth shattering by any means and we're not all that difficult to accomplish on a day by day basis. However what corporate has enacted recently has been the last straw for me. Starting last week, corporate has enacted the policy that all stores are an extension of the distribution center, meaning that any and all online orders placed by customers are susceptible to be sent to stores depending upon the distribution centers quantity on hand for that specific item. Our DC rarely keeps anything on hand meaning all orders are being sent to stores to be fulfilled, and to make the situation worse, they started this a week before today (Black Friday and Cyber Monday). All this is pushed onto one person in each store (receiving manager).

Currently I am over six days behind on orders since I can only work a max of 40 hours, two, they will not pay me over time because our company does not believe in over time unless you're salaried and three, they won't give me any part time help because that has already been made available to me in the stores with other employees. I.E. other managers and part timers. Those managers and part timers do not have proper training to fulfill these orders, so that makes it ultimately just me.

This situation has really propelled me into finding a job in the field that I studied for and getting out of retail, but the lack of calls for interview's nowadays is uninspiring and I am not sure how to proceed since I've pigeonholed myself into such a small niche. I am still trying my best to push and keep my portfolio up to date, but with each and every second of my day constantly working, speaking to customers about why there order has not been shipped is just exhausting.

I've thought about the idea of freelancing on sites like upwork just to get me started and reel in some potential full time gigs, but from everything I hear on r/freelancing, upwork is terrible and I should be focusing on local clientele. That is where I struggle with this decision, because I am not really in a area where graphic design is needed / pursued, so it's just a lot of cold calling and no response emails. Don't get me wrong, I'd love to do freelancing, I'm just not sure how to market myself without any local meetups for the type of work I'm in.

This is not a situation of where I can just quit retail and dive fully into freelancing because I have my car and other bills to pay for, but thankfully I still live with my parents, however would like to eventually take myself off there shoulders sooner rather than later.

Please Reddit, help me get out of retail and finally get a job I went to school for."

I had an epiphany today as to why I'm so goddamn miserable. It's because of this program and my life path. But I'm not sure if this is the right choice. I'm terrified of failure.

I'm 2 weeks away from being done with the semester, and one more semester away from graduating in May. I have a 4.0 GPA. But, I'm miserable. I hate the program, the internship, and I don't want the job when I graduate. 

People in my life want to either see me succeed or completely fail. Failing would meet most of their expectations of me.

I've had a somewhat difficult life. Drug/ alcohol addicted mom, and an alcoholic, emotionally abusive father who passed when I was 14. I was left with my mom who overdosed 6 months after my dad passed. She lived, but lost custody of me. I moved in with my older sister(14 year age difference). I did ok after that. Years of therapy. I struggled with depression, anxiety, and obviously trauma. I did ok in high school, went to community college, then went on to get my bachelor's in psychology. Now I'm working on my masters in counseling. I wanted to use what I went through to help others. The closest people in my life are so proud of me. They constantly tell me how proud they are and how strong I am. These are the people I hate to let down. The people that don't like me hate to see me succeed.  

Anyways, I think I want to drop my program. I am miserable. I have been pushing through but I'm just hating my life and waiting to be happy. I'm honestly not sure what I want to do with my life but I don't want this anymore. Sometimes I think dying might be better than living the future I have paved for myself. 

I have been coping by drinking. I'm seeing the circle of alcohol addiction cycle around and I'm terrified. I'm worried it's going to continue to get worse if I stay on this life path. I've talked to my husband and he seemed overwhelmed with the idea of me dropping (40k in debt for this program) but he was supportive. 

What gives me pause is letting down the people that are proud of me, and proving those that doubted me right. I don't know how I would ever explain myself (yes, i know I don't neeeed to explain myself to anyone but I really do). I also can't help but feel like a moron for wanting to drop out of a program with good employment opportunities.

Right now my husband and I (newlyweds but have been together for 7 years) are living with my mom. We have been for a year. She was doing well and we wanted to get out of our shitty apartment and save for the wedding/house. We paid only about 5k for a small wedding and the rest has gone to the house fund. We only have about 5k saved because my internship for this program is unpaid. My husband works fulltime but one income with bills makes saving go so slow. My mom is severely depressed and just lays on the couch all day watching the news. I need to move out so bad. Being here kills my mental health. I want to drop my program and just get a job.  

I do plan on going to talk to a counselor about this. However. I'm thinking of going in on Monday to meet with the program director and explain that I'm dropping. It's a small program so it will crush her and the cohort. I need advice before I decide whether or not to do this on Monday.

TLDR: I want to drop even though I'm succeeding in the program but I'm miserable. Drinking is bad, and sometimes think I would rather die than live the life I have planned right now. But I'm in 40k debt and terrified of letting loved ones down. Thinking of going in to drop on Monday."

For the past term I've felt quite depressed and angry as I don't like learning the course, nor do I have any particular motivation to learn it. My parents sort of forced me into it, upon which I took it upon myself to make them happy and maybe make myself happy by studying medicine - I decided to apply and take the place thinking it won't be so bad. But I don't like learning it one bit, I have a much greater passion in chemistry and astrophysics and I want to pursue those as a career instead of medicine ( I do not see myself lasting 6 years let alone a whole career in it). Having spoken to imperial support services, they offered the option of interrupting my studies for a year so that I can take time to think about what I really wanna do, and have the option of coming back with not much problems.
However my parents refuse to acknowledge these problems. I tell them I don't want to study medicine, they blame it on me by saying 'why didn't you decide earlier' (when I did but I was threatened with being removed from my own house), and I acknowledged I made the wrong decision, but they say it's better for me to fail out of the year than to take this gap. They also say that the support services are 'trying to divert me', and that they 'don't know what to say to people who ask'. Having nowhere else to go, this lack of support is proving extremely difficult for me to cope with. I really want to interrupt my studies, reapply to other unis and go from there - as well as possibly doing internships, getting a job and tuition for chemistry. How can I make my parents support me?

We had 3 different training sessions and learned about the interface and different report types such as CSV and Extract reports. The company was behind on creating the datablocks needed for us to create the reports so they had to figure something else out. We were then told to shadow the network desktop technicians.

I learned about their ticketing system, helped update laptops from windows 10 1803 to 1909, learned about how they re-image (PXE boot with windows deployment server), learned about deep freeze... We didnt get to answer phone calls, we mainly just tagged along with the NDT's. They were honestly slow some days. I did also learn about how they remote access.

We are doing an end of the semester presentation next week. It's a group internship presentation. This internship felt like a dud tbh, but at least I can put it on my resume. There was a lot of miscommunication between staff and interns...

So they didnt have any ""project"" for us. So I'm just listing things I was exposed to. Is my job description alright? anything you would suggest changing or adding?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: What do you think about these bullet points?

&amp;#x200B;

¬∑ Support and shadow Network Desktop Technicians

¬∑ Create tickets with ticketing software Track-It! to inform and document

¬∑ Update laptops from Windows 10 1803 to 1909 and uninstall phased out antivirus software then install Carbon Black

¬∑ Help re-image and deploy computers using PXE Boot and Windows Deployment Server

¬∑ Use Remote Access Software: Configuration Manager Remote Control, TightVNC, and Remote Desktop

¬∑ Help rejoin Windows 10 PCs to domain, Deep Freeze used to freeze/thaw public PCs.  


Edit:  


first, I never was actually given a  pc to remote into myself. I observed the NDT's and asked a ton of  questions about it. So I get the idea, they put in a IP address and then  their credentials depending on which one they are using.  Not sure if I  can somehow spin that to look good on my resume or if I should just  drop it.

Also, I only was able to  create 2 tickets during the time I was there. They  where both child  tickets since I only did some of the work for the ticket. Becuase of my  experience with Track-it! I'd like to put it on my resume.

I  did help rejoin a couple computers to the domain and understand the  basics of deep freeze, but under a lot of supervision. I personally have  not touch the deep freeze software.

Also I never did an re-imaging myself. Just was shown how to do it.  


trying to figure out how I can summarize my internship experience without lying about ""doing"" something when I just watched or my underselling myself by not listing things that I have learned"
e3flbx,135,2019-11-29,[Rant] You're gonna do great,kkziga,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e3flbx/rant_youre_gonna_do_great/,"(A quick background) I am CS final year undergrad and I am looking for an internship. I had applied to 20  odd companies via cold email but didn't hear back from any of them. I had applied few months ago and by now I nearly had lost hopes that I'll ever get any internship - until today. 

I received a call from one of those applied companies asking for a telephonic interview. We scheduled a time for the same day. I was shit scared before the interview. I spent hours reading and making my domain knowledge strong. I had made all these assumptions in my mind that they'll ask the toughest questions and all I'll say is ""idk or sorry"".

But surprisingly, the interview went very smoothly. The interviewer was very friendly and we had a very good discussion on the projects that I did. He was also impressed by some of my answers. Hoping to get a positive response from them now. And even if I don't get selected, it was a good experience to have. 

 I want to tell everyone that don't let your mind rule over you and be the best version of yourself. You'll go great !"
e3gckb,18,2019-11-29,Do you really need to keep up to date with all the technologies?,nickywan123,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e3gckb/do_you_really_need_to_keep_up_to_date_with_all/,"I am writing this post because I am still confused and probably misinformed as to how someone in an IT industry should be well known of knowledge wise. 

I come from a CS background and would like to know does one need to know every latest framework/language in the market? 

Learning a technology isn‚Äôt easy and it takes time, like lots of time because you need to use that knowledge to apply it to create or build stuff. I understand you can‚Äôt be stagnant and have to keep up to date with new stuff or you will be left out in the job market potentially if you‚Äôre looking for a job in the future.

In order to do that, one must keep picking up the new skills but it also means you won‚Äôt have the working experience for that tech stack unless you get a job that uses the stack but you need working experience as well in that expertise. So how do you break this vicious cycle of getting the job? 

I mean if you stay at the current job for long term then it‚Äôs fine because you‚Äôre working in the same stack. 

Is it necessary to learn new stack in the market and say if you‚Äôre looking for a job related to it, can you get it without learning it and use the job itself as a learning platform ? 

I get it requires tons of time to learn something and most people like even myself don‚Äôt desire because it takes away your time to do other leisure or activities you love. It takes away your time with family, play sports, go out and watch a movie, etc. 

I certainly hope it‚Äôs a stigma because I don‚Äôt wanna spend my entire life staring at the computer or 2/3 of the day because it can be exhausting as well. Is it true you need to spend time outside work to learn stuff and create projects of your own, upload to GitHub, build your portfolio, brag about your skills,etc. to be successful developer? 

Personally from my background, I never intern during my college years. I am already graduated. Been working for a year plus and never had any own projects that I do to put in my resume ( apart from those coursework from college) . Or maybe I‚Äôm just lazy ? 

Like even in most interviews, they likely will question what are your projects you do on your free time. What if I didn‚Äôt do any because I was spending time looking for jobs or maybe practicing leetcode questions? 

I just want to make a decent living as I believe life is more than work itself and don‚Äôt want to sacrifice my own time to further learn something because the technology is always growing and just forfeit my leisure time to do other stuff. Because then I will never have enough time to always do my own activities unless until I retire of course. I work to live not live to work.

e3gh31,734,2019-11-29,Just got fired for not being stressed out enough by a difficult project,GlavorousPineapple,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e3gh31/just_got_fired_for_not_being_stressed_out_enough/,"I worked for the company for 4 months, fresh grad, with decent internship. I asked my CTO for a raise. In the following discussion he told me that even though I finish every task they give me, I am melancholic and not pro-active enough. I told him I don't feel a need to be, since there are already more competent people in my team who seem to manage just fine, and who don't include me in the most of design discussions with a customer. I was also never given any deadline, so I was never really stressed out. CTO's response was that I've surely noticed the difficulty of the project (which I did) and that I should've asked my project manager for more involvement (which I didn't because I always had some work to do).

The next day the CTO fired me, basically for not caring enough, and me asking for a raise is just proof the job doesn't satisfy me. The teammates then personally confirmed to me, that I was doing a good work, even though I seemed uninterested.

My salary was slightly below average for my demographics and area, and I asked for a slightly above average pay. To my best knowledge.

Is this common / valid reason for being fired? Was it really my fault? Should I just pretend my interest in the next job? What are your thoughts?"

I transferred to a four year college and went for B.S but realized school doesn't prepare u for real world job.  So I dropped out to prepare for my portfolio around 2 years ago.

I have grasped the fundamental understanding of the Swift language except maybe generics during those times but still feels like I can't use them fluently.  And I have almost completed 1 app (pedometer) so far.  Still in the process of learning Core Data atm.

Also I have some experience working with computer related environment as an accountant/book keeper for about a year and half(Quickbooks) in a small company if that matters.So my question is..

1. Can I still find internship even though I'm not in school at the moment? And is it worth it vs  job?
2. Should I just apply for jobs( no prior experience) And should I have at least 2 apps before applying for jobs as an iOS developer?
3. Or should I go back to school and get my degree?

I didn't even get a request for additional information from FBU.

I am a sophomore Computer Engineering major that goes to a school that's ranked 300+ for our computer science program. I have a 4.0 GPA with no tech experience and one side project that is just a basic movie database using linked lists. I have a good bit of experience in Java and C++. I am trying to learn Python and get into some web/app development. Since starting in October, I've been constantly revising my resume and updated the ones on previous applications. I know that most companies usually start after the new year but the silence from majority of companies that have openings right now is concerning. Also, I feel pretty dumb for even applying for standard SWE internships, as I barely have deep knowledge of coding.

SN: I've done the challenges for FBU with pretty good results and Twitter Academy (Rejected) with only completing a question and a half in 24 hours. I heard back from one recruiter at Airbnb and their coding challenge completely went over my head.

I'm a software engineering major with approximately 2-3 semesters left. My issues have me nearly never going to class (I know this part is my fault!). I also just feel foggy all of the time.

My case for taking the break:

-Mental health

-Time to pay off some debt

-Time to apply for internships

-Time to get counseling.

-I have ADHD, anxiety, and depression. 

-My GPA has gone from a 3.2 to about a 2.5 in a year

The case against:

-Loan repayment issues

-I am 24, I have been in school for a long time

-I really do love my major

-I've already withdrawn from school twice for mental health issues (though I was not getting the treatment I needed until about 6 weeks ago)

-I dropped out for 2 years from age 19-21 because I hated my old major

-My loan debt is about 30k right now. Not great but honestly not too unmanageable.

I suppose I'm just wondering if a break has been helpful for others in a similar situation, but I'm happy with any advice!

The general consensus is that it has become really difficult to find internships in UNSW with the whole trimester system and reduced summer time frames.

My original concept was ""Oh I could do a intership every summer, or maybe while i'm doing my degree"" but i know that's a scenario that likely wouldn't happen, especially with how people have commented that internships are offered less (again with the trimester thing)

I'm a senior CS major at a non-prestigious state university set to graduate this spring. If it matters, I have a 3.99 GPA and an okay resume (2 okay internships, a club leadership position, group projects, etc.) .

I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, am an eating disorder survivor, and I strongly suspect I also have ADHD and BPD (or at least some pretty severe trauma related issues).

I wouldn't say that college in and of itself has been uniquely difficult for me, but I'm very concerned that the only reason I've managed to succeed in my studies is the forgiving nature of being a student. It doesn't matter if I don't go to class when I can't get out of bed, I don't typically have to wake up early, it doesn't matter if I sit down to do homework and end up getting upset and crying for an hour or wasting hours because I can't focus, it doesn't matter if I don't do any work for a day or days because I'm not feeling well, doesn't matter if I do everything last minute and turn things in right before the deadline, etc. And although I have not (yet) needed to do this, I have the security of knowing that the university ostensibly cares about me and has an infrastructure for helping students like me if I need it. 

My internship this past summer at a small but well-known (non-tech) company didn't go badly exactly, but only because the company's internship program is weak and the expectations placed on me were low. I was very unproductive and unengaged, not because I didn't want to be, but because frankly I felt horrible most days and I found it impossible to focus for such long chunks of time, especially in an office environment where I had no privacy. 

I know none of this will fly when I have to get a full time real job. And I'm terrified. I know I need to get treatment and I intend to do so, but I'm not going to be ""better"" by the time I need to get a job, and I have no idea how long things with that will take. I feel terrified and hopeless about my future because it's so hard for me to imagine myself succeeding and not being miserable in a job environment, or even just not getting fired. 

**I know I have a lot of issues with myself that I need to address - I don't expect the world to cater to me. I just want to maybe get some hope that there could be a place for me in the world of work that's a little less painful/difficult/scary than the rest of it.** 

**So my question is, to people with mental illness who have experience with jobs post-graduation, do you have recommendations for companies or fields that I could work for/go into with a CS degree that are better than others for someone with mental illness?** I realize this is sort of a vague question - what does ""better"" mean? - but I honestly am not really sure what would make it better because I have very little exposure to these things. 

Thanks so much in advance."

e43zi0,11,2019-11-30,Data science to SWE -study strategy?,jbuddy_13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e43zi0/data_science_to_swe_study_strategy/,"Hello all,

I want your advice on getting ready for SWE interviews. 

Background on me: I‚Äôm about to start my last semester of my MS business analytics in Chicago, before entering the workforce. I interned at SAP as a data scientist, where I wrote a text classification algorithm and an LSTM based NER tagger, extracting skills from job descriptions and resumes. 

I‚Äôve taken a series of classes focusing on text mining, data mining, neural networks, reinforcement learning, graphical models, and spark for distributed computing. I‚Äôve gotten way more out of this degree than I expected from an MSBA program.

Where I‚Äôm running into trouble is - business analytics means something different in the industry than in academia. In the industry it means sql queries, excel macros, and basically being a consultant. In DS interviews this always comes up and I have to articulate that I have been exposed to some exciting technologies, and am qualified for the role. Interning with SAP somewhat mitigated this, but not as much as experience at a FAANG org would have helped me, obviously.

In a recent interview, I was told ~ they want CS MS first, stats MS second, and everything else third. In times where a candidate didn‚Äôt have CSMS, they wanted to see equivalent work experience, specifically as an SWE, simply to make sure they‚Äôre not copying/pasting Keras code from medium articles, but actually know how to solve programming problems. So, I‚Äôd like to act on this advice and take an internship as an SWE, to help round out my resume.

Side question - does anyone else without a MSCS have similar experiences? It seems like all the Udemy ‚Äúdata science in 3 months‚Äù courses have made hiring teams extra skeptical of anyone without an MSCS, poisoning the well for the rest of us. It‚Äôs disheartening to the say the least.

TLDR / I have 3 years of python experience, 2 years SQL. I‚Äôm comfortable with calc, stats, and linear algebra. Given my context, what skills should I make mastering top priority? Data structures and algorithms seems like an obvious choice."
e44edv,17,2019-11-30,Am I an Idiot?,ThrowThatAssByke,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e44edv/am_i_an_idiot/,"I am in school for an AAS in computer programming with about 6 months of experience coding. I was just hired at a startup where I have been handed the keys to a 4GB codebase.  I do not believe that I mislead this company about my knowledge and experience, as my resume only stated experience with Java, SQL, PHP, HTML/CSS, but they saw it fit to put me on this project.


So I have began learning ES6, React, Spring/Hibernate, Maven, along side an entire suite of dev tools all at once, while learning the ins and outs of this project.  I was also recently tasked with moving this application from AWS, over to Google Cloud, which frankly I think is an absurd and downright irresponsible task to delegate to an intern. I may be new to the industry, but I'm pretty sure a fairly large amount of experienced professional  web developers have yet to touch DevOps, so I'm perplexed as to why they think it was appropriate to have me handle migrating this project. 

I was provided with **0** documentation, and **every question I ask on slack is ignored**,   so 1 month in to this internship I am still trying to figure out all of the moving parts of the application, all while my Jira board piles up with task.


I work a full time job, have a 2 year old, and a very needy family that are an active hindrance to my school studies, let alone this internship. I am also still finishing up the semester with a few projects and finals due within the next 2 weeks. 


I completely underestimated the amount of work and research needed in order to make significant contributions to the project and am considering dropping out of the internship and using winter break to develop a MERN based application instead. Things may have been different if this company had given me any guidance during the beginning of this internship, but its very clear they need an experienced developer, whether they know it or not, because the obviously don‚Äôt have the time/man power to mentor an intern. I introduced myself and asked a few questions to the senior dev who is over this project (via slack) and never got a response. I question daily why they even bothered hiring an intern if they didn‚Äôt have time to acknowledge my existence outside of shoveling work my way. 


I am clearly unfit for this role, although I know this is invaluable experience to go on my resume, but I have been incredibly stressed trying to balance all of this and I don't know if it's worth seeing this through at this point. I literally do not have any time to be productive and make real contributions. This internship would be 10X more manageable if they were paying me a livable wage, but because they are not, I still have to dedicate 45hrs/week to my real job, so I hardly have any time to dedicate to the project. 

Am I an idiot for considering dropping this internship? I don't want to hate myself 6 months down the line for giving up on this opportunity to finally break into the industry and land my first job. I realize that no amount of Udemy courses and piddly course projects from my community college will be able to replicate this experience so I am very reluctant to give it up. 

Thoughts?"
e44x9q,1227,2019-11-30,Let's not forget how much luck is involved in the job hunt,plasticbills,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e44x9q/lets_not_forget_how_much_luck_is_involved_in_the/,"Trying to get your first internship or job, trying to get an interview, and even passing the interview itself: let us not forget how much luck is involved in that entire process. Even though I can say I worked hard to get to where I am, I would be delusional to think that it was purely due to my own efforts. Sometimes it's just out of your control.

That's not to say it's ALL luck, of course not. You will need a good resume to pass screening and you'll need to be well prepared for the technical interviews, but there are some things that are just out of your control. Maybe a recruiter just so happen to get a text while looking through your resume and passed it over, or maybe your interviewer woke up on the wrong side of the bed and gave a particularly difficult problem.

The only thing we can do is prepare to the best of our abilities and then hope for the best.

Don't be bitter about it; life is not fair. Instead, keep trying your best and you'll be the next one with that success post. Good luck y'all.

EDIT: lot of people bringing this up, so let me reiterate. Not at all am I saying it's ALL luck; you definitely need to work hard. But know that you can only do so much before it is out of your control. You can do EVERYTHING right and still fail. Don't dwell too much on those failures and keep trying your best! Luck favors the prepared!"
