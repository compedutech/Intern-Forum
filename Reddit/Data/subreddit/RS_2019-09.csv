cy3dbe,3,2019-08-31,College student trying to get an IT internship w/ no IT experience or certifications - critique my resume!,xiarnaq,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/cy3dbe/college_student_trying_to_get_an_it_internship_w/,"Hello, I'm currently in my third year of college and I am trying to play catchup with all the other students in IT that have so much to show for when it comes to their experience and knowledge. Although I am very serious and passionate about CIS/IT, I have very little knowledge or practical experience with it right now which limits my chances for an internship. This is because I'm still taking the core classes for the business administration major, so I have not started any CIS classes yet. Although I lack IT background right now, I know I have soft skills and I have been working since I was 16 which my resume will show for. I have already been denied from a few internships and I know that is because of my lack of expertise. I am starting to take the initiative to pick up some programming languages like Python and more, but I am just wondering if there is anything that I can do to better my resume.

My emphasis in CIS is Business Intelligence, so I am mainly applying for internships related to business analysis/intelligence.

Please feel free to criticize my resume and thank you.

Hell were just learning about commands in linux terminals now and Ive learned to make basic uml diagrams and a bit of sql, java and c# but these have all been really simple stuff.

First time poster here, but I’m really not sure what I’m doing wrong. 

I’m currently a student at a state university in New York, I completed my Associates degree in May of 2018 and will be graduating with my Bachelors degree in December of this year. My AAS is in Computer Information Systems in Programming and my BT is in Information Technology, Applications and Web Development. 

I’ve been applying for jobs like crazy, even though I’m a student I’m only on campus Tuesday and Thursday for two classes. I’ve been working as an intern for my schools ITS department from October 2018 to May of 2019 then I got the opportunity to do an internship somewhere else from May of 2019 to August, they were unable to offer me a full time position due to budget (small start up), so I went back to my college ITS department that same week, so I’ve been there since August 5th. 

Besides this work experience listed on my resume, I have two special projects I did with two separate professors and I have a high GPA (&gt; 3.50). I’ve also had a ton of relevant coursework, been on Presidents/Deans list numerous semesters and received a scholarship. I’m also in two honors societies and apart of a cybersecurity club at my college 

Albeit all of this, I’ve applied to so many software developer/engineering jobs and only received two callbacks and one interview, and no job offers. 

What am I doing wrong? 

Thanks,
Tom"
cy4fum,1,2019-08-31,Is $20/session (after insurance) for therapy worth it?,lilyaintaG,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cy4fum/is_20session_after_insurance_for_therapy_worth_it/,"Hey all,

I've struggled with mental health issues for most of my life. I'm not officially diagnosed with anything, but I mainly struggle with anxiety and depression sometimes. My Reddit account is 7 years old, so you can see my depressive high school rants if you look back far enough. I had a pretty stressful last year of undergraduate and I used food/alcohol as a coping mechanism and gained a lot of weight in the process. I lost all of the weight over the summer (yay me!), but I don't want something like that to happen again.

I decided that I would take the necessary steps to improve my mental health and look up therapists in my area. I just started grad school so I figured now would be the best time to do it.

After talking with one of the better providers in my area, they estimated that I would pay about $20/session with my student insurance. The normal cost is about $120/session.

Is this a good price, or should I be looking around for better prices? I don't have a paying job right now (I'm getting a tuition waiver and my rent/groceries is covered by student loans, I have two unpaid internships. I have a few thousand saved up outside of the student loans)

I don't think $20 is a BAD price, but I also don't want to be too careless with my spending since I'm just relying on my student loans and savings. I'd ask my parents for advice, but I don't want them to find out I'm seeking therapy since they're one of the primary reasons I'm seeking therapy.

Thank you in advance to anyone who helps out, I appreciate you all!"

cyall3,341,2019-09-01,Should I throw away a great offer for a more uncertain career path?,tuxwonder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cyall3/should_i_throw_away_a_great_offer_for_a_more/,"Hey all, I'm new and I want to cut straight to the point: I have a great offer to work full-time at Microsoft after my summer internship finished, but I know the work they do (in almost every one of their sectors) is not where I want my career to go. The issue is, the career path I WOULD like seems a bit more competitive and difficult to find work in, and I'd like to get a masters degree for it. To top it off, it took me so long to figure this out that I'm just three days away from having to accept or decline the offer and I have no clue what I'm going to do. I'm panicking a bit.

I'm in my last semester of university right now, and all my previous internships have been just general software engineering jobs at various companies. When I got my offer to return to Microsoft full time, I thought back a bit on whether this is where I wanted to end up, and I finally realized what it was I loved doing all this time. My favorite CS work always include some amount of math, geometry, or the physical world, and that's what all the elective classes and projects I've done have involved. I loved doing robotics, computational geometry, computer vision, motion planning, video game dev, etc., with little interest in pure software engineering.

Microsoft, except for a few very small and highly competitive organizations like Hololens, does not do this work. My summer internship was working in Bing, specifically dealing with distributed systems. It's alright work, but to be terse, it would get boring for me fast. However, I would be able to deal with it for a year or two if it meant I could get a leg up and eventually find myself doing one of the above options.

The issue is that I'm not sure what career path those interests should set me on, or how I'd find my way into those sorts of fields, or if I have the background to help me get into those areas. I'm not considering game dev as a career, I'd like to do any of the other four things I mentioned. I'd really like to get a masters degree related to those things, but it's a bit late to apply to one before my deadline is up. I also don't go to the most prestigious school or have the best GPA at the moment (ISU, 3.6), so it may make it a bit harder to get in.

So my question boils down to: Would it be better to play it safe and accept a position at Microsoft for a while, then go back to school to work on a degree which helps place me in my area of interest, or throw away the offer and try to get accepted into a grad program right now to try to insert myself into a field I don't yet have any work experience in?

Bonus question: What larger companies could I look at that do this sort of work?

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for your super helpful replies, and perspectives I haven't thought of. It's easy to get lost in your own head, but I feel like I have a roadmap in my head laid out that can help me get where I need to go. I'll probably wind up taking the job, spending a year and a half there, making as many connections as I can and continuing to work on my own side projects, then move into a masters program, and figure it out from there. It's still scary not knowing if it's the right choice, but as you've all shown me, I think it'll open more doors for me than I initially thought, through connections with others, possibly working on other teams or for the experimental division, getting helpful experience, and having a little extra cash to make sure I have some support."

I've been now very interested in computer science since I was 14 years old. My Abitur ""Majors"" are math and computer science. My grades are pretty good and I'll graduate in May and I also have some work experience because of internships in Germany and an internship in Ireland. So far so good but my problem is, that all job adverts for people in my position are targeted at university students. I'll enroll next year in winter, but I moved out of my parents house already 3 years ago. I'm still financially relying on them from time to time, but I would prefer to have my own money and I also believe that this extra work experience would help me a lot in the future. I'm allowed to earn 450€ maximum because I am getting Bafög, so I'm not looking to get rich or anything. 

 Do you guys have any ideas on how to even start applying when literally every job ad requires me to be an university student? I looked up if it was legally problematic for the company to hire someone for a student position who isn't currently enrolled and that would apparently be the case.

Thanks!

cybq4n,0,2019-09-01,Is it true most big tech will at least give phone screenings to most applicants?,logicallyzany,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cybq4n/is_it_true_most_big_tech_will_at_least_give_phone/,"I heard that companies like Google will at least give almost all their applicants a phone screening and I was wondering if this is true. The reason being that I am deciding whether I should apply to summer internships now or wait until after I have my Autumn quarter grades (in November). 

I am a career changer with an BS in biochemistry starting my MSCS next week. I have very little programming related things to put on my application. I did test out of 4 core CS courses and have an academic project on my GitHub. 

The most significant thing I have right now I think is an academic internship I started in July. I finished one project which was a text processing tool in python, and just started another doing computer vision in biomedicine.

I’ll continue the internship into the school year so waiting till November will give me more internship experience and I will have my first formal CS coursework (for grades) completed.

But if almost everyone gets at least a phone screening I would apply now because I am confident in my skills."
cydmh6,6,2019-09-01,Undergrad Student Seeking Guidance,Leuie,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/cydmh6/undergrad_student_seeking_guidance/,"Hello!

I'm a student attending Arizona State University starting this Fall, Session B October 16th. For all intents and purposes this will be my return to school after a decade of working in another similar field. My aim is to obtain my 4+1 Undergraduate(Information Technology)/Master of Cyber Security in an accelerated path. I will minor in Spanish as I've always wanted to be bilingual. Thankfully, my schooling is fully funded and provided through an Uber Scholarship. As such, this will allow me to focus on my curriculum and obtain the best possible grades.

A little about me: I'm a 31 year old single/no kids self-taught programmer, I've worked for a few companies and though I loved it - the work wasn't as fulfilling as I'd like it to be. I tried to advance and find opportunities to rise in house but always ran into the ""degree wall."" Company was unwilling to provide avenues for me to progress. This would leave me feeling jaded and looking for avenues outside. On August 14th, 2019 a family member(sister) alerted me of this program through [Uber/ASU](https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/uber-pro/education/) and offered it to me. A blessing. Long story short I jumped up that same day, submitted FAFSA, registered and was accepted. I have tendered my resignation in preparation and am anxious for this new path in life. Was too late to begin in Session A August 22nd however I will begin studies Fall B. 

First meeting with my Academic Advisor is Monday, September 9th, 2019. Dreams do come true. I want to come prepared with information so I can plot out my journey in advance and get a jump before school begins for me.

I struggled deciding where to post this inquiry however I will just cross-post it to the other subreddits and collate data/replies.  
My mid-level goal is to become a Security Architect implementing and designing networks. The moment I am able to, I will take my CISSP having hopefully obtained previous recommending certs. Dream job would be CISO. Yes, I'm shooting for the moon but I need a target to aim for.

Anywho, My question(s) to you all are these: 

* Should I work towards obtaining certificates (A+, Net+, Sec+) while in school? Or focus solely on my studies? In my research I haven't found a concise place on the order of ease/importance which to obtain first through last.  

* How about internships? Should I attempt to secure an internship Freshman year to obtain hands-on knowledge?  

* Are there any websites or communities such as this one that would benefit person(s) like myself?
* What interested you in Cyber-security? Do you foresee the [job growth trend rising](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/information-security-analysts.htm) as it is now? 28% year over year.

Thank you for your time. 

I really appreciate it.

**TLDR:** I'm brand new, wet behind the ears. What would you suggest I learn/work towards to in conjunction with my academic studies? Obtain certificates or follow curriculum? Any communities or websites I should bookmark/join?"
cyfypk,0,2019-09-01,(How) should I negotiate in this situation?,cscqthrowawayaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cyfypk/how_should_i_negotiate_in_this_situation/,"I know the standard advice given here is 'always negotiate', but I'd like thoughts on how to go about it in my situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm finishing up my masters in CS from a top-10 program this semester.  I interned at a reasonably well known tech company (Company A) in the Bay Area, and was made an offer for an SWE2 position. The offer is IMO really good! (base $140k, stocks $170k/4years, signing $10k)

&amp;#x200B;

I loved the stuff I worked on, and really liked the culture. I worked in a technology niche directly related to my research experience, that I'm unlikely to find at other companies. I intend on joining the company, but at the risk of sounding greedy, if I can get those numbers higher, it'll be a welcome bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

I just received an offer from another company (Company B) in the bay area. It's much more in line with what I expected for a new grad (even with a masters, but my only experience is internships) - $110k, 100k/4 years stock, 10k signing). No doubt a good offer, but it's really unlikely to help me budge the needle at Company A. Also, I find it somewhat unlikely that Company B will match A's offer - it's \~40% higher!

&amp;#x200B;

So basically that's where I'm at. I still have about a month to accept A's offer, but I find it really unlikely that I will get an offer close to that value, which will help me in negotiating. I also really do not want to jeopardize my offer at A by negotiating too much - like I said, I do think it's a great fit for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love some advice on this. Is it worth interviewing in the hope that I get an offer close to A's? Or try negotiating using my offer from B? Or just accept A's offer and enjoy the rest of my semester?

Thanks in advance!"

My top choices are UT Austin, University of Illinoius Urbana Champagne, Columbia, Washington, CMU and University of Maryland, although this is not my de-facto list). I am also looking at programs abroad at ICL, UCL and Edinburgh.

I think I have a solid profile overall in that I have good work experience and I believe really good recommendation probabilities (and a connection at one of the above listed schools). Although, I am less confident in some of my more obvious statistics, my GPA and GRE score.

I graduated from a pretty well regarded university (generally, not in computer science) with a 3.5 GPA in Computer Science and Mathematical Economics (more so applied statistics). I have taken courses in Machine Learning and PhD level econometrics. I took the GRE recently, and I got a 164Q, 162V and 5.5 AWA. I am planning on taking it again, trying to get an extra two points in quant.

I have about 2 years of work experience and will have about 2 and a half during application process. I currently work as a Data Scientist for a consulting firm where I have worked a lot with the graphs for representing our client's data. Recently, I have been working on a variety of high level image based problems involving super resolution and pose estimation. Before this job, I had an internship where I did some research in applying classical machine learning to forensics.

My letter of recommendations are from my previous boss who was a former professor and is now the CTO/CEO for forensics research. A full time professor at my college that I worked with on the forensics research project and my manager at my current job who I have worked closely with for about a year on the graph and image problems.

As I am typing this out, it may look clearly like a humble brag but that is not my intent. I believe my research/work experience and my letters of recommendation are very strong. However, I was initially supposed to have a publication for the application process but that slowed down, so I am feeling less sure. On top of my average/slightly below average GPA and GRE score, I am feeling less secure. Do the stronger points of my application make up for the weaker points?

**TL;DR: I have a good application in some regards, but weaker in other regards. Can the stronger parts of my application overcome the weaker parts of my application for top 20 (mostly top 10) Computer Science Programs**

cygm9w,8,2019-09-01,TIFU by trusting my apartment complex to match me with roommates (L).,doggoismyfriend,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cygm9w/tifu_by_trusting_my_apartment_complex_to_match_me/,"I'm a grad student living in a college town. For the past 3 years I've been staying in a 4 bedroom 2 bath apartment where each room has a separate lease. This is my 4th and final year living here. The complex will let you room with anyone you request, but otherwise will match you with people who's interests match your own based on a quiz taken before the lease is signed. As you might surmise, anyone I wished to room with has moved away after graduating undergrad and I am one of the few graduate students who remains (due to cheap rent). I've had my share of both good and bad roommates, but this last one takes the cake.

About 1.5 months ago my complex started doing major renovations. They asked us to move things out of our rooms so they could replace the carpets and windows, repaint, etc. At the same time, I got an unexpected new roommate. See, for the past 2 of my 3 years, I have practically lived alone. Usually one or two people will move in at the beginning of the semester, be bad roommates for a month or so, then drop out and move away. It was not uncommon for the complex to attempt to fill these vacancies mid semester, so I am pretty used to unexpected roommates at this point. This girl seemed relatively nice. Told me she was having issues with the apartment complex squeezing her for money (red flag #1), which I can sympathize with. It's also important to note that on the same day she moved in, all my things were in the living room because my bedroom was being redone.

Everything went off without a hitch, my room was put back together the next day with a nice new deadbolt to secure my door. I felt pretty good. Made good friends with my roommate and her friends who all seemed nice. Then she lets me know the complex is evicting her because she is behind on rent and her roommate accused her of letting her boyfriend live with her against the terms of the lease (red flag #2). She asks me to write her a letter stating that I haven't seen her boyfriend staying around (which is true, I haven't). I write my statement but can't print it because my printer is broken, the office printer is broken, and I currently don't have access to the school printers. Forget to tell her. Leave for an internship I have in a town 2 hours away.

Hear nothing for the time I'm gone. Come home last week. Bedroom door is busted literally off the hinges. All my electronics gone. My N64, Super Nintendo, all the games, all my gameboys, my TV, my broken printer, the stereo my parents got me last Christmas. Call cops, let them know roommate was recently evicted and likely stole all my things. They haven't done anything. Not even interviewed her. Every time I call they have nothing new to tell me, although they did inform me that this girl had a previous police report involving theft from a roommate. Awesome. Front door was fine when I came home. No other doors broken. Whoever did it knew I was gone and knew which room I lived in, as well as had a key to the front door.

I suspect her obviously, or at least one of her friends. Likely decided it was worth the break in since I was gone and she'd already had a preview of the cool stuff in my room from when she moved in. Honestly the worst part is a lot of what she took has little monetary value, only sentimental (some bad pokemon decks I made when I was young, my gameboy color I won in a contest, my dog's favorite chew toy). She also took some of my textbooks for veterinary school, which makes no sense as she won't be able to get much for them and she won't be able to sell them to anyone but vet students (which I hope she's dumb enough to do since they can be identified as mine and will get her caught).

I'm still working things out with insurance but of course that's dragging. Every time I call the police for an update I get the runaround. My apartment complex dodges and won't take responsibility for matching me with someone they knew had a prior police report for theft against them (yes they admitted they knew this). They also told me that she blamed me for reporting her boyfriend (even though it was her last roommate) and also for my dog giving her dog fleas (they got onto her about treating her dog for fleas because they had to bomb her last apartment, she claimed the fleas in our apartment must be coming from my dog). The only good thing to come of all this is my dog and my ferrets were with me at the time, as well as the gaming computer my husband gave me and the things that are most crucial to me finishing school. It's been over a week and I'm still intermittently sad. I know I'll probably never see those things of mine again. I just can't believe I made it to my last year before something like this happened. I used to be so careful about bringing valuable things to this apartment because I was worried about random roommates, guess I learned the lesson the hard way.

TL;DR: trusted my apartment to match me with roommates, got robbed blind. P.S. she also took my laundry basket."

I read some posts saying something like even if you can't solve, showing  interviewers that you are a person that they like to work with is important. I tried to be interactive during the interview but it didn't really help. They just need answers.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm not welcomed by anyone, and it's really discouraging. I sometimes think that doing 4 years of leetcode instead of attending school would have been better option. I also started doubting if this is really the right way for me. Even if it's not right for me, I have no other place to go, and that makes me really lost. I took a month of break and am going to start applying again. I feel I'm loosing my goal,  I don't really know where I'm going, and I don't really know what I'm saying here. What should I do?"

The people, the environment: they restored my passion and mentality for learning. I met a lot who inspired me to go out of my comfort zone and embrace mistakes as stepping stones to growth. I experienced such a welcoming and kind space where they share sentiments, laugh, sympathize, and try their best to help out of problems, and would even take time off their busy schedules for it. Huge names, established individuals, and intelligent people: I always thought that they know what they were doing and barely met difficult situations. 

Right, they are people too.

At first, I, as an outsider and an intern, was overwhelmed, and needed time to get used to the culture. Before I knew it, they all became my mentors, and some became my good friends.

But soon I have to go back to where I came from. And in that reality, one is ridiculed for the thought of asking for help, showing weakness, and even ""focusing on yourself.""

These past months have been the most life-changing chapter of my life that I came to have a better picture of who I am and who I want to be. It got me to admit that I don't always have to ""fake it"" just to make it, that sometimes not knowing the answer is okay, and questions don't always have to be ground-breaking. It re-enforced within me that baby steps, with patience, practice, and perseverance, will turn into leaps.

I know in myself that I shouldn't be discouraged, nor let negativity get to me....

But how long do I have till the fire in me is snuffed out? How long till I decide to take off these rose-colored glasses? How will I manage, being the mess that I am?"
cyl7wk,1,2019-09-02,Management opportunity at a Fortune 50. Having trouble evaluating it.,throwawaytgw36,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cyl7wk/management_opportunity_at_a_fortune_50_having/,"Hi!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a mid-level SWE working in a tech company currently, where tech/eng is a high priority org and full of talented people albeit a bit chaotic from lack of process for most things. From being there a few years now (3y there, going on 8 YOE total), I've taken on a lot of leadership responsibilities such as being a technical lead, mentoring individuals, creating on-boarding plans for interns and full time employees, and so on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I applied to a management position (SDM / EM) at a Fortune 50 company and ended up getting an offer. The biggest thing I'm afraid of, is that I have worked in other large companies where engineering was not necessarily a high priority and got bogged down like crazy from red tape, ineptitude, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do I properly evaluate this company and try to make sure I won't run into this again? I interviewed with directors in my org as well as principal SWEs, and I got good vibes overall. I'd love to know peoples' frameworks on evaluating a new company, especially leaving ""tech"" and going into a more customer facing company that happens to have a fairly strong technical division. I do realize that \_worst\_ case, I stay for a year or two and hop around. I just want to make sure I'm making a good decision. Thanks all!"

I'd like to cut 1-3 schools.

What I'm looking for:

1. strong poli sci program (would also like strong econ, philosophy, and/or enviro sci program(s) as well bc im considering a double major in one of those), including successful alumni working in politics/government, nonprofits, social justice, etc.
2. super welcoming and supportive community. this is extremely important to me. i care a lot about collaboration and students really caring for one another. 
3. lot's of EC opportunities (clubs, community service, etc.) relating to my interests: environmentalism/sustainability/animal rights, queer theory/activism/history, art (painting, sculpting/pottery, sewing/fashion), feminism, political activism, cooking
4. sense of intellectual curiosity and learning for the sake of learning
5. plenty of internships and research opportunities for students outside of STEM
6. high top phd and law program matriculation rates
7. LGBTQ friendly and large LGBTQ population
8. small discussion-style classes with professors who actually care about you understanding the material. 
9. the more open the curriculum, the better. 
10. easy access to vegetarian and vegan food 
11. i looooove tons of campus traditions/superstitions/etc. and school spirit (not so much in a sporty way, but just in everyone being genuinely happy to be there and not wanting to be anywhere else)
12. i prefer a quirky, artsy, edgy, or nerdy feel over preppy, fratty, or jock-y. 
13. would rather be at least somewhat close to a city, and if not, have there be enough stuff going on around campus to never be bored

What I don't want: competition between students, elitism, general toxicity, to go bankrupt, to be super bored/isolated, to need a car to get around, a highschool-ish culture, to feel excluded or have trouble making friends

Now, my list:

* Swarthmore- reach (probably top choice)
* Bryn mawr- target 
* Barnard- reach 
* Reed- high target
* UT Austin (instate)- target (plus Plan 2- reach)
* Wellesley- reach
* Emory- reach
* Georgetown- reach
* Grinnell- reach
* Haverford- reach
* Macalester- target (this is the school I know the least about so far)
* Smith- target
* A&amp;M (instate)- safety (have to keep this one, yes i know it is the exact opposite of everything i want)"

cypqq6,3,2019-09-02,How do you learn a new language/framework ? Currently on Symfony and it's hard to stay motivated,DownloadPow,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cypqq6/how_do_you_learn_a_new_languageframework/,"I'm trying to learn a new framework ( Symfony ). I've been learning Webdev for close to 2 years now ( started on very basic HTML/CSS/PHP 2 years ago, had an internship for 6 months with no development at all, then started a freelance business as a front-end developer, and kind of ""bullshitted"" my way into a company, I've been there for almost a year now and it's going great, I've learnt a lot HTML/CSS, JS, PHP and WordPress, basically went from needing 2 days to make one page in HTML/CSS to being rather confident in these languages ( especially HTML/CSS and WordPress, we program everything by hand with no plugins ). 

I want to have a more marketable profile, so I'm trying to learn Symfony, because I'm really interested in back-end development, and I want a harder challenge than WordPress. The thing is I know the very basics of Symfony ( I'm trying to make a resume that I can edit from an admin panel, so I need to create/edit/remove entries in the DB, display and pass data etc.. basically what Symfony is needed for ), and it's so hard to juggle between the docs, the videos, the stackoverflow posts, googling every single problem. I feel like I haven't really made progress on my website or on my understanding of Symfony these past few weeks ( I'm trying to put at least 2h a week on it ). I can understand the syntax, make simple lines of code, I know how the framework works, but it's hard to go from that newbie state to the intermediate step where you can make complex websites. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you go from being on the first step ( knowing the basics ) to the intermediate level where you're productive enough that you can actually put a language on a resume ?

I will be moving to **Terrassa, Barcelona**  this month and am looking for a job, apprenticeship or paid internship  as my main occupation. It's highly preferable for me to work on-site,  but we can talk about remote.

Currently  working as a freelancer in web development, I do not intend to stop  working as such, considering it my side job if I start working  elsewhere. If this is a problem for you, please tell me.

My rates are between **15€ - 40€ depending on the job**. Lower end is media work, middle is front-end dev, high is back-end dev\*\*.\*\*

**Languages:** German (native), English (C2), French (B2), Spanish (A2).

**Skills as a full-stack developer:**

* HTML,  CSS (SCSS), JS (ReactJS, Vue, Angular, Redux), SQL, Ruby (on Rails),  Wordpress, Python (Django), Java (Android), Jekyll and more.
* Live streaming solutions, static websites.
* I  have worked on very complex projects. Please contact me with what you  need me to work on and I will be able to tell you what I can and can't  do.

**Skills as a video editor / camera operator:**

* Programs: Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop.
* Cameras:  my own camera is a cheap lumix, but I have successfully worked with  Canon EOS R, C200, Sony A7R and REDs. I can confidently work with any  camera, if you own or pay for it.
* Cutting, color correction, syncing of audio, etc. I can essentially work as a videographer on a high level of quality.
* I  know basic lighting, audio recording and sound design. I would prefer  if someone else on set did this, but I can do it if you're on a budget.

This is only an initial posting until I have updated my CV and portfolio to match the jobs I am looking for. **If you are interested, I would appreciate a quick message.**  I can then send you appropriate work examples. I am usually willing to  work on anything and would also sign non-disclosure agreements if  necessary. Just ask."

cyqrel,4,2019-09-02,Should I quit my internship at a startup? Quite confused.,WintryThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cyqrel/should_i_quit_my_internship_at_a_startup_quite/,"Hey everyone. So I'm a 22 y/o full-stack intern at a startup, working on the MERN stack. I joined 2 months back, and my internship is supposed to technically get over in December(6 months internship). It's a team of 15 people, out of which some of them are remote(some, as in, majority of the tech team). So there's only me and one other tech guy in office, who btw, has no experience in web development at all.

Before this internship, I interned at a medium sized company, but it didn't transition to a job, because of my mediocre performance. So, I worked my ass off, took a break of several months and then bagged this current internship.

I was supposed to get a job, but they offered me an internship instead, as I'm currently finishing my final years of Masters in CS, and told me they'd offer me a job after I graduate. All well and good.

First month in, I'm trying to fully understand the domain they're working in, trying to get a hang of the codebase, etc. And the first month is pretty OK. Work hours are flexi, and I got to attend college too, part-time. Eventually I realized that almost the tech team is a clusterfuck. There are three guys working on the backend, and they're all remote. These three dudes are dedicated and sincere as hell. There's one senior handling the DevOps side, and ONLY one other senior who's full-stack and is a team-lead. Btw, both these guys are remote too.

The deadline for delivery of a specific module in the product had been delayed 3 times till now.

Also, my team-lead kept disappearing frequently, which meant that I picked up the crumbs, and had to work insanely harder to make up for the stuff he's half-written. Which, I wouldn't mind(given that I got more responsibilities and more experience) if my CEO didn't breathe down our necks saying that we crossed yet another deadline.

Obviously, my CEO did tell us that he knows it's not our fault, but he still took out his frustration at us, calling us shit programmers. I understood his frustration, and the fact that they were trying to hire someone else to replace my team-lead, but with no success, given that half the applicants couldn't write basic stuff in React. And he said that he'd outsource this to some other company if we weren't able to deliver it ASAP.

My team-lead quit a couple days back, and since then, it's been an even crazier mess. Earlier, I could atleast schedule calls with him and clear my doubts, given the crazy complexity of the web app that I'm obviously not used to.

Luckily, StackOverFlow saved my ass, but I am not finding it fun to work there anymore, like before. I love web development and CS in general, and I don't mind more responsibilities, but handling the entire stack all at once is becoming an extremely difficult task, given that there is zero documentation, and the variable naming convention, as well as the folder structure of the app is a mess.

I'm pretty much confused as to what to do. Would appreciate advice. Thanks."

I'm new to data analysis, but I have taken a Statistics course. Maybe I'm going over my ability with this project, so I'd appreciate honesty.

Without disclosing too much personal information, I have this internship where I am monitoring migratory populations of a certain species. The organization I'm working with has collected over 30 years of data that need to be analyzed. While browsing the data, I noticed there seemed to be a correlation between the sex distribution of this species and how far along in the migratory season it is. Basically, there seems to be a far greater percentage of males in the beginning of the season and a far greater percentage of females later in the season. By the end of the season, the sex ratios seem to even out. 

This phenomenon has been fairly consistent from year to year. However, it doesn't seem to have been mentioned much in scientific literature. I would love to further delve into this apparent phenomenon by trying to see if it is statistically significant.

So how can I combine 30 years of data, and how can I determine if the time of year corresponds to different sex ratios? 

Thanks for any suggestions! I apologize for my lack of knowledge on the subject of data analysis!"

Me and my (then) fiancée viewed an apartment about a month ago. It was in the neighborhood we wanted and the best price we could find. Everything seemed perfect and we signed a lease the next week. Our lease stated we would move in yesterday (Sept. 1), and our old lease ended at the end of August. 

Our wedding date was August 30th so we moved everything into a trailer last weekend and have been staying at our wedding venue before the wedding and until Sunday morning . 

We’ve been itching to settle back into a routine and finally move in to our new house. We picked up the keys from the real estate office Sunday and went to start moving in when we saw the horror show that was our new home. It was absolutely trashed, every surface was filthy, very well hidden during the visits with the real estate agent. Mold on AC units, sinks and countertops. Shit in toilet, rotten smell in fridge, terrible condition. (we sent pictures a list of everything to the real estate agency)

We talked to the intern that was in the office and he talked to the owner and asked us to stay in a hotel for the next 2 nights while they would clean it and that they would reimburse us. So we checked in to a hotel, we’re there now, and they texted to tell us that they’ll go to the apartment and start tomorrow morning. We were reassured that they could have everything move in ready by tuesday night, even with the long list of fixes needed, however it’s looking like it may be a much longer process (especially since they haven’t even been there yet), and we are stuck living out of our car and a hotel until they get on this. 

What should we do? How are we protected in our lease? How do we make sure that this isn’t a bigger issue than dirty last tenants and not anything systemic? How should we be compensated by the real estate company?

(mods, if anything in the post needs fixed let me know, this is my first LA post and i’m a bit overwhelmed right now)."

We’re the Purdue Engineering Student Council, and every year we put on one of the biggest career fairs in the country (you probably already knew that). IR is just around the corner, running from the 9th to 11th of September, so update those resumes and start researching your dream job, because it’s gonna be an absolute banger. Below is a lot of info and hopefully useful resources, so check it all out and let your friends know if they’re looking for some help too!

**Where, when, what?** Industrial Roundtable is a 2 day career fair taking place on September 10th and 11th. It’s geared towards providing internship, co-op, and full-time job opportunities for students in science, technology, engineering, and management majors, and is open to all Purdue students. This year, there will be around 400 companies in attendance, and we usually expect around 12,000 students. Crazy, right? Yep. You can check this [link](https://app.careerfairplus.com/pu_in/fair/2146/employer/198252) for more info on what majors, positions, etc. the companies are looking for, as well as get an idea of which companies you’d like to talk to.

The fair is hosted on Memorial Mall from 9:00AM to 4:00PM for those two days (rain plan is the Co-Rec but we will really really hope that doesn’t happen). The fair will also have a location for you to drop off and pick up your backpack.

Registration, which you can do at this [link](https://industrialroundtable.events.idloom.com/studentreg2019), is required. You can pick up a nametag after registering, at PESC tables on Tuesday-Friday, from 1:30-4:30 at HSEE, or at the fair!

**Seminars - what are those?** You might not know about these, but you should! Seminars take place on Monday the 9th, in the Stewart Center from 11:30 AM to 9:30 PM. Seminars give companies a chance to have smaller, more personal chats with students, tell them about their company, and generally just make more relaxed and extended connections than on the day of the fair.

cytf4a,0,2019-09-02,Taking a gap year before attending a Top 10 CS university. What should I do to help my future?,population-zero,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cytf4a/taking_a_gap_year_before_attending_a_top_10_cs/,"As the title says, I have a year before attending a prestigious university (I've already gotten in and deferred my enrollment by a year), I'm looking for things I could do this year that could potentially add to my resumé when looking for internships in college, or even just prepare me in any way for my college journey. I've been programming for a solid couple of years, so I don't feel like I really need to take any introductory programming courses. 

Some of the things I've been considering:

* HackerRank/Leetcode
* Making personal projects and uploading them on GitHub
* Internships - will an internship before college contribute to my resumé at all? I can easily get an internship at a local company (outside the US) but these are in no way competitive or prestigious. Do these count for anything?
* Algorithms/Data Structures type courses online 
* Math courses - though I'm not quite sure what specific areas I need to study. Calculus? Linear Algebra? Statistics?

&amp;#x200B;

Some feedback on what I could realistically do this year that would help my future somehow would be greatly appreciated."
cyttrc,1,2019-09-02,Moving Across Country - advice for post-graduate career?,StumpedLump,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/cyttrc/moving_across_country_advice_for_postgraduate/,"I just graduated this past May. I had been interning at a small company (\~50 people) since last August and they hired me full time in April. However, I have an intense desire to move. I've done my research, and the combination of cost of living, environment for my thick coated dog, and culture have led me to Oregon, which is across the country from my East Coast city.

I have a lot of reasons to move, but the biggest obstacle is how moving could impact my career. I made a pro's and con's list of what would happen if I move

**Con's**

* I've cemented a pretty good ""reputation"" for myself professionally in my city. Not the best, but I've been interning around the same industry/people for the past 4 years. I know a lot of people, and those people also know my father, who introduced me to the people who gave me my first internship. If I move, I suddenly lose the network I've created.
* I wouldn't move until I've been at my company for a year. It just works out like that with my lease/saving up money. I don't want this to be seen as a slight to my coworkers. It's a small-knit group, so we're all pretty close.
* Since the company is so small and close-knit, I could move up pretty quickly since I have such a personal relationship with my director and CEO. This would be harder in a large company, which I may become employed at if I move.
* My job is pretty flexible - I can work remote on Fridays, and can leave early to work remote most other days.

**Pro's:**

* The network I have made in my city is based off who I was at 19 - and being taken seriously as a young professional woman in her early/mid 20's is harder when most of your professional contacts remember when you were 19 and wore sneakers to the office. I could reinvent myself in a new city.
* At my previous internship, I worked closely with a specific director, who I ended up becoming involved with after we both left the company. He wasn't who I thought he was, and it ended with me having to file a police report against him for sexual assault last year. Everyone I work with knows this man, and I sometimes have to hear them talk about how good of a guy he is. I haven't gone to court yet and refuse to speak to any of my coworkers about what happened. If I move, I won't be able to leave what happened, but I can leave our shared network. 
   * On this note, when/if I do go to court - my reputation with my colleagues could change drastically.
* Since my company is mainly remote, I don't feel as engaged as I could be. I take certification courses, finish my tasks, create new initiatives for myself, but at times I don't feel like I have as much direction as I need as a young professional. This, along with the fact that I'm the youngest in the office with the closest to my age being my own boss who's in her early 30's with a child, makes me feel sort of ""othered"" from my coworkers.

Should I take the plunge, move, and accept whatever career changes may happen? Should I wait it out a couple more years to give myself more experience and hopefully move up the ladder? Do any of you have advice from your own young professional experience?"

I am a front-end developer. I went to college for learning to program (1 level below bachelors) but I consider myself completely self-taught after getting some help in the first half year of my degree and adeciding my own path after that.

I'm a visual person, and I like the idea of being able to easily share things I've made, so front-end web development made the most sense to me and that's most of what I've been doing since. I really enjoy it. I like building increasingly complex web applications the most.

I spent two years of my degree almost full-time at an internship where I barely had to write any papers. I was basically doing the same work as my colleagues for a terrible wage, but it was fine since I was making more money that I would in class and I was gaining a lot of experience as a developer working on real world projects in an actual company.

Right now, I just got my second job as a front-end developer. I would say I'm doing my job fine. I asked one of the more senior front-end developers how I was doing, and he said I was doing great. I then asked him if he could come up with some tips for me to improve, but he couldn't think of anything at the moment. He's a genuine guy and I believe him. I'm not trying to brag here, by the way, I'm just trying to tell you about my situation so you can get a better understanding of where I'm at.

**The actual issue:**

My courses never really included computer science topics. My colleagues, including new hires, mostly have a bachelors or masters degrees, and I always feel insecure when I don't know or understand about advanced topics they're talking about or have familiarity with. Even the inters who are working on their masters degrees. I always ask though, if there's time.

I have a subscription to a front-end course platform, and they have a computer science section, however I'm sure it won't cover a lot of advanced topics in the available 20 hours of video.

Even though I can do my job just fine, I still feel like a fraud and I'd like to brush up on math and computer science to close the knowledge gap between my colleagues and I.

I also feel somewhat scared and insecure about the fact that I'm missing this knowledge that could be crucial to coming up with better solutions or understanding technical decisions made by more senior developers at my job. It makes me feel like a fraud.

**Tl;dr / the actual question**:

How can a front-end developer without much of a CS background, like myself, who is dealing with imposter syndrome brush up on math and computer science so I feel less insecure around my colleagues and be more confident in my programming knowledge?"

This poses an issue since I can complete my degree in just two years. My question is if I should delay graduation to get an internship. I took summer classes this summer to be on track to graduate in May, but I think I might have shot myself in the foot by focusing too hard in finishing the degree.

Would it make sense to delay graduation to get experience? Can I make up for it by focusing in side projects?

cyw5vc,2,2019-09-02,Career change to Big 5 company after being self-employed in the video game industry for years. Is this just out of my league?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/cyw5vc/career_change_to_big_5_company_after_being/,"Hi everyone,

A week ago a recruiter at a Big 5 company reached out to me about a SWE position that requires the (natural) language pair I work with as a translator, game engine and graphics experience, and having shipped titles using said engine.

I am primarily a game translator who has run my own company ever since graduating with a CS degree. I've had some dev experience and have ported several games to Unity, but I've been somewhat unsatisfied with my job situation.

I had a SWE internship while I was in school, but I managed to get a translation project for a game that I really wanted to work on (the project was too hard to pass up), so I figured I would do that for a couple of months and then get an actual SWE job. I started a company to take on the project primarily as a liability shield, and one way or another we got more translation and port projects afterwards, and I ended up sticking it out for several years.

I figured this would be a good opportunity for me to explore moving back to a more stable CS-related career while staying relevant to my current career, and I check off multiple boxes on the job requirements, so I responded, passed the phone screen, and somehow got a phone interview lined up in a couple weeks.

Since I haven't ever had a technical interview after I graduated, I started practising for the interview on Leetcode and reading CTCI. I was able to solve the easier problems, I'm having trouble coming up with even naive brute-force solutions for a lot of the harder ""easy"" problems, let alone medium and hard problems. I'm also frankly not sure where to even begin with CTCI. I'm having serious doubts that I will be able to come up with any solutions for harder DSA and SD questions.

Is it normal for developers current working in the industry to have trouble with these questions, and am I simply too naive to think this is something I can prepare for with just a couple weeks to go? Should I stick it out with the phone interview, knowing that I will most likely just be embarrassing myself during the call? Would it be easier if I went back to school for my masters before looking for a job instead?"

I got an internship in a company. The contract says that I'll be working 12.5 hours per week part time for the next 6 months.

Since this internship is in a different city where I'm actually studying in, i had to take a semester break from  studying in order to peruse it. 

I have ran into a couple of issue and I need some help. 

The first issue is that even though the contract says 12.5 hours (I'm paid for those 12.5 hours only), I'm still expected to work 40 hours a week. 

Second, I think it's by law if an internship is longer than 3 months, I should get paid as a fully time job, right?

That's a vent that basically covers my life and the thoughts I am dealing with every day that got particularly bad in the past three months. For some reason knowing that it's public makes it easier for me to put my thoughts into words than just thinking about it. I lose my train of thought too easily.

I just turned 23. These days, I see almost no reason to live as I feel like my whole life, everyone has been acting as if I am normal when I am really not. It infuriates me and at the same time isolates me because I don't trust anyone I know.  Not my family, nobody would tell me the truth. Or maybe they would but I am scared to hear the truth.

All throughout my childhood and adolescence I was the outcast, the weirdo and there were different stages of coping with it: trying to appease to others, being shy and avoiding social interactions all together in high school where I would spend all day playing MMORPGs. I believed to be quite skilled in music and languages (I speak 3 fluently but none as a native speaker) and thus excused my social difficulty with all the things that I *could* do. At the end of high school I'd convinced myself that I was weird just because I lacked experience with social situations.

Therefore, I started exposing myself to new situations. There was so much I didn't know, be it movies, music, culture, books, politics or just what is going on in my friends' circles. I'd be just sitting with a group of friends and desperately try to follow their conversations.

After a while I managed to give less fucks about what other people thought of me and started asking questions about almost everything I didn't understand. I wanted to catch up and make up for the countless hours I'd wasted on computer games, web surfing and porn. I had hoped I would eventually become someone you could genuinely have a fun time with. I hoped I was about to change my miserable life.

Then I started smoking weed and a whole new rabbit hole opened up. I would become paranoid in social situations when stoned. I became more attentive towards remarks by others. I would feel as if they are mocking me. I started questioning my intelligence. The anxiety would disappear a couple of days after the joint and I would go on with my everyday life.

I smoked three months ago after a year long pause and it hit me in full force. I felt like the guy I was smoking with was entertaining himself with a retard. I am not sure if I am making this up but he might have called me ""slow"" while we were watching some videos. And we were not in some kind of a humorously mocking mood. He would let me watch different videos and I felt like he was observing how I would react. Anyway, that guy seems like a douchebag and his general intelligence somewhat subpar which might explain why he would be so insensitive and treat me like this.

I haven't recovered from this experience. Don't get me wrong, I still manage to show my ignorance to people in order to learn things I don't know. It's just that I became way more self critical and looked for signs of a possible mental disability every day. I became more observant of my behavior and actively worked on it. For example, I noticed that I can't stick to a topic. I would grab onto a random thought that I associate with the current conversation and just digress. I looked at my Facebook chat history back in high school and died inside realizing how oblivious I was: not of subtle hints - I am talking about people giving up on me because I would give pretty stupid and irrelevant answers, resulting in conversations going nowhere.

I've been trying to pay more attention at the body language of others as well as mine. I've spent a full year basically refurbishing the way I speak in my main languages. Now people ask me if I am a native speaker but after a couple of interactions realize that something is wrong and the conversation often dies.

Back to now. No matter how much time I'd spend outdoors, I felt my progress was just not worth all my work and effort. In almost every social situation there would be a reminder of how far behind I was. I recently had a conversation with a nice older couple in a bar. I felt I was doing fairly well, we talked about the life in NYC, music, their youth. But I'd have to admit that it never was really interesting. I was just practicing my social skills. At the end of the evening, the lady gave me her number and encouraged me to message her in case I need *any* kind of help. She told me that I was so sweet and adorable, how she could be my mom and that *I would find an adult taking care of me*. That just ruined my night. Please tell me there is some ambiguity in her statement.

The less shy I became over the years, the more obvious it became to me that the issue wasn't that I was an introvert. I just don't have anything to say. I can comment on a thought shared by my conversation partner but I almost NEVER bring up a new interesting thought myself (unless it is a useless digression).

Also, I don't have an opinion on most things normal people would. I don't know what type of people, places or genre of music I like - either I do or I don't. I am indifferent about most things as if it would cost me too much energy to think about it. 

When I was younger, I liked to disagree with people I knew well about the most petty things just to feel superior and rebellious. I've tried to do the same with more advanced topics like politics but never really felt my arguments were effective. I probably didn't quite comprehend their arguments. Being a devil's advocate (a bad one at that) is not hard. I feel like a robot who is solely capable of picking out keywords from other people's comments and just shoots back a question. I've been told that I have a deadpan face and that my voice sounds sarcastic or bored.

As already said, I am forgetful and constantly mentally exhausted:
- I sleep 9 hours - I am feel the need to sleep more. 
- I sleep 10 hours - I feel like I became tired from sleeping too much. 
- I sleep 6 hours - I make it through the day but I'm definitely not rested

I literally can't consciously point my attention at a task. If it doesn't come up naturally, I just can't solve a problem. If you are familiar with the System 1 and System 2 analogy in psychology (Kahneman), it feels as if I don't have a system 2.

All this being said, I am about to graduate in computer science with quite a good GPA. But it's not because I am particularly good at coding. We code way too little and in contrast to other classmates, I don't code for my own projects. It's because I cram for the exams (thereby sacrificing everything else) and afterwards forget almost everything I learned. The university system here is set up in a way that your whole grade for the course depends on just one final exam. The only graded component that requires creativity is a final 30 page paper. And I have no idea what I want to write about as there is no passion. I know I will somehow handle it but this doesn't solve my overall problem - employers sense that I am just brainlessly following a program. In my last internship I felt like an imposter who slowly has been exposed. I didn't do bad but not particularly good either. Admittedly, the work was actually hard and messy but I noticed my inefficiency at work and how I would get done so little. I actually worked before I started college in a financial services company and did amazing. I got multiple raises and was given a lot of publishing authorizations. But the work in of itself was pretty mundane.

Also, I have 0 success with girls. I appear as a creep. I know that they sense my low self-esteem. Downloading Tinder opened my eyes. I assumed that I might have a weird character but that I am at least quite good looking - I got 3 likes in a month from unattractive girls - with tinder gold boosts. It's become so bad that when I see beautiful women on the street, I just become sad because I know there is no reason she would ever want be together with me.

Funnily enough, I set Tinder to show me to men and I got a hundred likes from guys in two days. Maybe I am gay? I've been trying to figure this out as there are some signs of attraction but then again there is a thing such as homosexual OCD that makes you doubt your sexuality. This is such a bad timing. It is just too overwhelming to think about all these things at once.

My siblings are so much younger than me but they are already surpassing me in social intelligence. I sense that one of them marrying will be a great further blow to my self-esteem. 

So in general, I suspect that I have mild autism, maybe ADD. It is so painful growing up convincing yourself that you are normal but then all of the sudden seeing everything in a different light and realizing that you might have been babysat by your friends and protected by your parents all the time. I don't feel close to the people I call friends at all even though I share quite a lot of my most private thoughts and they are incredibly understanding. 90% of the time, I am the guy who asks to hang out. Speaking of bad memory, I don't remember what their parents do for a living. *If they ever decide to ask me what defines our friendship, I wouldn't be able to give a non-bs answer.* And the friends I've lost over the years? Probably just didn't feel like putting up with my weirdness was worth their time. I know all this feels so self pitying and that there are people out there with objectively way worse problems. But doubting your whole life is quite painful. *During my high school years, I thought quite highly of myself. I considered myself extremely empathetic, rather smart in sciences, fair, good hearted and extremely patient. Now I realize that all these positive qualities are just a result of my mental bottleneck.* I am rather easy to manipulate, better than average in sciences but lacking the passion, unable to stand up for my own interests, selfish and lazy.

I know that the only thing for me to do right now is talk to a psychiatrist but this will take place in more than month. I am currently spending a month in NYC and burning so much cash because I wanted to experience the city that never sleeps. Well, I met many people that possibly made me realize how delusional I've been all my life and that my vague dreams will never come true. I still have to decide if that is money well spent.

Do you guys have similar issues and how did you try to cope with them?"

So I recently began college this fall, but I’ve earned over 40+ hours due to my high school offering dual enrollment and AP classes. I’m about to finish my basics this semester, so I’m already about to be considered a junior in college. My major is Computer Engineering, and I’m already beginning to take courses for my major. However, I have no clue when to start looking into internships. I’ve always heard stories of people getting internships their junior or senior year of college, but I’m only a freshman with little to no knowledge of programming or my major as a whole. Since I’m already classified a junior, and I’m starting to take courses for my major, should I worry about looking into any, or do I wait on it? Any help? Thank you!"

Anyway, do I have any way to break into CS? It comes really easily to me and I have taken most of the CS-focused major classes (just no physics, high level calc, etc). If not short-term, would some type of CS grad school be possible even though I’m not a CS major? What types of roles combine CS and finance?

Any recommendations would be great. My ECs are good and my GPA is great, but I still feel so stuck and am seriously worrying about getting any type of job at all after school. My lack of a finance or CS internship is definitely the biggest mistake of my life at this point. I’d be fine interning if any firms allow that post-grad.

cz044d,1,2019-09-03,Fourth year of undergrad,whatamidoinginschool,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/cz044d/fourth_year_of_undergrad/,"Hi all,

I posted this originally in r/Career_Advice, I hope this won't break any rules copy pasting it onto here but I'm really just looking for some diverse outlooks and ideas from as many people as possible :) (will alter/delete if needed). But to start, I am a long time lurker who has had their own anxieties blossom into full effect as I enter my fourth year of undergrad at one of California's lovely state universities.

As I mentioned, I am entering my fourth year and I am on track to completing my BS in Health Education with a focus in Community Based Public Health. Although this program has proven interesting and has been quite useful in forming my soft skills in communication and public speaking, and harder skills such as crunching public data and writing basic, yet thorough research papers on common public health topics in both the public and non-profit settings (community assessing, problem identifying, grant writing), I have began to realize my lack of passion and interest in the field.

This is my first problem, but I will quickly list some of my other circumstances to give a better idea of where I currently stand career wise. I have years of work experience, from high school jobs at grocery stores, working at local community pools, and my college gigs working at the nearby international airport on a cargo ramp and moving up into a leadership/management with the same company. Living in a very high COL area (the west side of the lovely Bay Area), I am unable to simply quit my job as it has become a significant portion of my household income necessary for the maintenance of our comfortable quality of life. This maintenance of steady employment has crunched my schedule and has prevented me from pursuing an internship and obtaining relevant experience in public health and my major of study.

As I inch closer to graduation and the weeks pass, I find myself yearning to change majors to something more secure and closer to technology. This is my fourth year, and my number of units is starting to grow into the triple digits (with 120 being typical graduation), but I have pondered upon looking into Business admin. with a focus in Information Systems, or Computer Science, and maybe even Mathematics. I have always been a good math student and will have to begin these majors by taking entry level math courses (Calculus 1) before I work my way up into the upper division courses (so as to not fall flat on my face in higher level quantitative courses).

To cut to the chase, as I realize I have began to write a giant wall of text. I have picked a major which I have failed to obtain relevant experience in over the last year or so, and I fear the job outlook is less than stellar. I have a growing curiosity in other highly quantitative majors in my fourth year of undergrad. I am unsure if I should finish my current program and earn my BS then pursue a graduate degree afterwards in one of my fields of interest (seriously leaning towards data science or information systems). Should I finish my Health Education BS with no relevant experience, pursue a graduate degree in a more relevant more promising field, or should I drop my current program, switch majors one more time (extending my undergrad another 2-2/5 years) and complete a BS in a more quantitative, more promising major (job outlook/income wise).

I made this account just to make this post, I hope I didn't break any rules, but I'll toss a tl;dr for good measure.

TL;DR: Poor major choice, lack of hindsight, should I extend undergrad to pursue a ""better"" degree, or finish significant completed program and pursue a graduate degree in ""better"" field.

Also, located in San Francisco, CA if that adds any idea of possible opportunities I can pursue career/education wise.

Thanks lots guys!"

Company A will NOT negotiate any part of the offer. I have already used Company A's offer to negotiate with Company B and C but I might still have a bit more room for negotiation, though I'm comfortable with where the offers are currently at.

However, the salary to COL ratio for Company C is turning my head if I'm being honest. Company A seems to be headed in the right direction but I don't know how I feel about living in the east coast.

cz0ym9,13,2019-09-03,i feel super alone in the process and everything's hitting me at once (kind of a rant i am sorry),alrightandok,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/cz0ym9/i_feel_super_alone_in_the_process_and_everythings/,"tldr: i feel super behind, lost, and alone in the apps process and the stress may be physically killing me (slowly) because of my own dumb mistakes


so i've been aware of apps all summer but i busied myself with work and a class since i thought i had a bit of time. now that the school year has started i feel extremely behind and lost in the process 

a little backstory:

i go to a competitive high school, and a lot of people have similar stats (high ap/sat scores, some of the same aps, high gpas) and only recently am i learning of all the intense programs and experience people are getting through extracurriculars and their parents networking/jobs (LOL) since everyones so focused on stem at school, a lot of students get internships or lab experience through different ways.

having a lot of uber genius friends, and not having parents with any connections nor awareness of extracurriculars or many internships that they were aware of, i felt behind but convinced myself it was ok.

its apps season now, and last year i didnt get ""perfect"" grades so my gpa is lower already than my friends, and my activities (even with same intended major) apparently dont compare. i also havent taken some of the ap's a token student would take to get ahead (advanced physics, any computer science classes ((i really suck huh)), art which im super interested in, psychology which im also interested in). i feel like i was so focused on attaining some standard??? that i didnt let myself do more of what i want. when i first came to high school i learned of the competitive nature of my friends and all their extracurriculars and i threw myself into many new things and harder classes but my dumb ass didnt realize the freedoms i needed to allow myself.

on top of that, ive gotten so little sleep through the past three years that ive started getting grey hairs, i have premature memory loss, i get intense stomach aches (linked to anxiety somehow), intense fatigue, and slight tremors. so essentially i feel terrible physically because of how little rest i allowed myself because i wasted time working hard on things i thought were important, while other people got ahead. several (not extreme but still notable) health issues have arisen with my increasing stress

 i really dont want to flex, nor do i want to sound like im blaming everyone else. please understand. i just feel immense regret for living the way i did and i dont know how else to feel now

flash forward to today:

in my family, my college applications dont get the emphasis my friend's families put on them. (most are only children or have one or few siblings). my own family doesnt expect me to go anywhere far and that im aiming too high if i mention any schools besides a state school. they wont listen to much of what i have to say. my parents are not very involved in the process and only hold expectations for me to go somewhere great, but they wont take me to visit any schools and will not provide me accurate (if any) financial information for tuition calculators so i can narrow down where im applying. my parents are old and my siblings older, so theyve taken major loans to help them with tuition and essentially are financially unsteady (dad works more than one job, they rent out a house) but because my father earns enough, financial aid doesnt seem extremely likely: this is what my mom tells me. before i even told my mom where i was applying, when i asked if she could give me financial info later she told me not to bother as i wouldnt get anything anyway. my father is borderline insane when it comes to financial issues (making my older siblings feel like burdens or useless and saying they owe him somehow because he helped pay tuition), so i can barely talk about college to him. at home, i feel alone

i dont have a college consultant and all my friends at school are extremely competitive; i want to feel on top of things or ahead, and i know it is also on me for not starting essays or applications earlier, but i just feel so unprepared and so alone in this process because it is so difficult to find help and support. everyone in the area is extremely competitive when it comes to college applications and even if my parents arent constantly on my back it would be nice for them to be somewhat involved (or to give me the proper finance info for apps and calculators). i feel like i shouldve just started apps way earlier"

I got a first in my computer science bachelors however I haven’t had a huge amount of luck finding a job I want. I really want to do a graduate scheme (like a sort of paid internship for those who don’t know) but they don’t open until the end of this month/start of October. 

Basically atm I’ve just got a part time job completely unrelated to CS just to pay rent etc. Is ok/normal to just work this job until the schemes open which if I’m lucky to get through one can take 6 months or should I look to get a CS related job to support the time period? My worries is that if I get a grad scheme then I’ll be leaving a job if I was to get one after only 6 months there and it will look bad on my CV. On the flip side if I just wait for the grad schemes but don’t get one I’ll just have nothing and it just seems finding a grad level job is really hard. 

So basically atm I’m asking for advice on what I should do? Is holding out for these grad schemes worth it as it’s what I want to do or should I still be looking for a job?"

Also are there companies that will want a specific language to do the leetcode or do all companies let you do it in any language you want.

Would it be better to start learning data structures and algo in Java or continue in Python if i am gonna start applying in october?

cz4wlm,1,2019-09-03,Contemplating What to do With My Life,FunctionOnFire,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/cz4wlm/contemplating_what_to_do_with_my_life/,"Hey guys, I graduated this spring with a bachelor's in chemistry and another in biology. I have experience in analytical chemistry (mass spectrometry) from internships I have done and am currently on a fellowship in a government lab that ends in a month. I am an author on a couple of papers currently in preparation for publication. My plan was to take a year off of school, work in the meanwhile and apply to grad school this fall/winter so that I am admitted the following year (2020). 

With my position probably ending in a month, I need to find a job in the area until I start attending grad school. The problem is that it has been difficult to find jobs in my area related to analytical chemistry. Most positions are biology related and desire masters or PhD candidates. Not only that but most of these positions seem to pay not as much as I would hope for. 

Given that I am about to apply to grad school, I was re-evaluating my life and contemplating on whether or not I would be happy with pursuing science and research. I came to the conclusion that although I would be generally happy with pursuing science, it seems like it is going to be a grueling journey with not much to show for it at the end besides getting to claim that I am a scientist. I don't like the idea of pursuing a PhD and a post doc in something I only partially enjoy when there are a lot of people doing well with just a bachelor's.

I should emphasize that I am mostly concerned with getting a job that pays well and it doesn't seem as if a job in science is ever going to satisfy that. If I could get a decent paying job right now and not have to go onto complete anymore education that would be nice. I know that programming and computer science related jobs pay well and I already have minor programming and bioinformatics experience. 

I am now trying to decide what the best way to go about pursuing a career in computer science would be. Option 1 is to simply try to find a job with my current qualifications; this does not seem likely because I doubt my ability to land a good paying job in which I have little to no experience in. Option 2 is to get a master's in computer science or programming; this seems like a good option, but I have worries that it is focused around research and will not teach me the foundational knowledge I lack. Option 3 is to reapply to my undergrad university which has an excellent computer science program and to essentially get a bachelor's in CS; my concerns here are that it is going to be lengthy. Option 4 would be to pursue bioinformatics which would probably mean a master's or PhD. Option 5 is to actually get the PhD in analytical chemistry, but find a way to get into the computer science side of things eventually.

I would be glad to hear some opinions and input as to what the best options or approach for me there is, thanks!"
cz548t,5,2019-09-03,Quitting an Internship - Advice?,throwaway951333,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/cz548t/quitting_an_internship_advice/,"Some background- I am a finance and marketing double major at a mid sized state school. I have 3 semesters to graduation and am just starting to take classes specific to my major. I have a 3.9 GPA and am an exec for an marketing on campus organization. I have completed one internship in the past that was not finance related. 

This spring I began searching for summer internships, both marketing in finance. In the meantime, I have been working as a server and bartender. At the end of the summer, I got offered a position as a finance intern, and I accepted as I was excited to finally have an offer. The position is with two companies, a small private equity fund and a consulting firm, who are owned by the same guy and housed in the same office. Other than the founder, there is an assistant and a part time employee. The rest of the work is done by interns, where we get paid a ""stipend"" of $400/month working 25 hours per week. I live in a LCL area, but this amount doesn't even cover my rent &amp; utilities for the month. When I was offered the position, they stated they want me to work at least 2, preferably 3 semesters but I never signed anything committing myself to this time frame.

Personally I feel like this guy is using interns for cheap labor, as we do a majority of the work and just send to him for revision/approval. I was even interviewed by another intern and spoke mostly with him through the hiring process, not an actual employee. This role is supposed to be a finance role, but I have been spending more time in consulting than finance. I honestly have enjoyed more of the consulting work anyways, but feel like this was misleading and I'm not getting the experience I was promised.  We park illegally in a lot that is supposed to be a paid lot. My first day they told me ""we always park there and hope we don't get a ticket. We've only got a few tickets the past few years."" The office has exposed wiring in several areas. I had a bad feeling about this from the first day when they forgot about me in their conference room for over an hour even though there were only 3 people in the office. The other actual employees openly talk about quitting in front of me and I've been there for only a month.

 I have to continue working 15+ hours per week at my restaurant job to be able to afford my monthly expenses, plus the 25 hours per week of my internship, plus taking a full 16 credit hour course load, plus being an exec of an on campus org. Thats 40 hours a week of work, 5 hours of driving, and a full course load. It is two weeks into the semester and I already feel like I'm starting to fall behind. I'm taking 3 online classes so I can have more consecutive hours to work, but I have little time to spend on them. I have maybe 1-2 hours of free time between 7:30am-10pm Mon-Thurs, I work 10am-8pm Fridays, and I work 10am-7pm Sundays. This leaves me Saturday to work on homework and catch up on laundry, etc. I have no time to socialize or go to the gym or to make myself a nice meal during the week. It's too much. I am burning out. This internship is causing me way more stress than any of my other responsibilities. When I am not in the office I still get texts from other interns asking me if I have time to go online and work on things. I have to go straight from the office to class and back again and they don't even give me enough time to make it to my classes on time. If I want to eat lunch, I have to do it at my desk while I work. All for approximately $4/hour before taxes.

Something has to give. And logically it has to be this internship, because I have to keep my job to afford my bills and I'm not quitting school. I just am worried about burning bridges. This guy is a well respected businessman from a well respected family in the area, and although I don't plan to stay in the area after graduation, I want to secure a summer internship before graduation. I also don't plan on working in private equity in the future. I want to work in marketing or corporate finance. But this internship has been miserable from day one. My boyfriend and mom told me to quit on the first day but I wanted to stick it out. My school requires 180 hours for credit and I have 90 hours so far. I plan on sticking it out for the last 4 weeks to get the credit and then talking to the employees and telling them that I have too much on my plate. They always say that they understand school is the most important thing right now, so I'm hoping they understand. 

What is the best way to go about this? Any thoughts/advice???"

cz6dgg,9,2019-09-03,"Is it normal to feel so lonely, isolated, and without a solid friend group, at 22?",blakkjesuss,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/cz6dgg/is_it_normal_to_feel_so_lonely_isolated_and/,"Title says it. I turned 22 in June and graduated from college in May. My first year of college it was so easy to make friend, and I came out of the year with a solid group of friends that I went out with and even lived with my 2nd year. However, there was a rotten apple that was kinda on the outskirts of the group that ruined that group for me, so in my 3rd year I became a loner again and eventually befriended new people. Although I formed many no friendships and strengthened others after not having the comfort of that first group (I even met two peeople that I still consider very close friends during this time), I still miss not having that solid group. It has been my experience that friends come and go. I have home friends that I do stuff with sometimes, but they are in different areas of life with me - I graduated and got a job, they still haven't graduated yet (we all graduated from HS the same year), and one of them had a kid in 2018. Even with them, I still sense that I am on the outskirts of that friend group since they are always doing stuff without me. I feel like I am definitely a second option to most people in my life besides my family and it honestly hurts sometimes.

It crazy, because I starting feeling like this at the end of 2017. I decided to turn this hurt into motivation and went into 2018 focusing on myself and bettering myself. 2018 turned out to be the most amazing year of my life. Spring 2018, I lost 25+ pounds, got into the most amazing shape of my life, starting to become really attractive to women, gained an unshakable confidence, made two new amazing friends at University, and even had the opportunity to intern abroad that Summer, which turned out to be the most amazing experience I had thus far in life. I came back to the states at the end of the Summer thinking life could only go up from here. However, both of those friends were a year ahead of me and graduated Spring 2018. I came back to school in the Fall and found myself being lonely again. I still worked out a lot but it no longer made me feel the way it did before I got into shape. I had friends from past years that I went out with sometimes but they definitely valued their relationships (they had GFs) over our friendships and it showed in the amount of time that they chose to spend with me. At the end of my second to last semester I started feeling anxious and a lack of confidence, along with a SEVERE lack of connection that I still feel to this day (albeit to a lesser degree).

Some things imporved in my final semester but not as dramatically as it did the previous year. I still feel like I have lost a lot of friends and came out of college without a solid friend group. It sucks seeing people you thought you were cool with out having the time of their lives with their first option friends and friend groups. I know the saying that ""friends come and go"" and ""social media is all highlights"" but I really do feel alone in this right now.

And of course I do feel like some of it is in my head. I definitely have friends; when I started to isolate myself, at least 4 people called me the following week and asked me if I was okay and how things were going. I still go out and get invited to things sometimes, and even had friends drive up to where I live just to attend my birthday dinner. I just feel like I don't have a solid group and/or deep connections. I think of myself as a thoughtful and sensitive man, although I can have fun on any given night, and I feel like my college social life was very surface level and people were so wishy washy.

I try to meditate every day and I plan on starting therapy soon. But I just don't know what to expect out of life. In two weeks, I start a job in a new city where I don't really know anyone, and it'll never be like that first year of college where everyone is looking to make new friends. I'm not sure what exactly I'm looking for in the responses, but feel free to share any advice, personal experiences, or general empathy toward my situation. Best!"

From personal observations, &gt; 95% of CS/SWE students here don't know what the hell they're doing. A big chunk of those people think that intro CS 1 &amp; 2 were hard. And they complained. My professor last semester retorted, ""You guys think that it's bad here? Cornell's first semester of CS contains material from both semesters here."" And that's when I realized that I wasn't learning shit. 

This is my 2nd year so I'm finally learning new material, but top CS schools probably move at a faster pace. Does the school you come from really not matter at all? I've seen many people from other subs commenting on how useless interns from RIT are. I have a feeling that RIT isn't perceived very well in silicon valley. Google, and a few other companies, used to come to our career fairs but not anymore.

My current overall GPA is a 3.97/4 and I'm thinking about transferring to Cornell, UMich, and UCLA. I know that GPA isn't everything and the chance of me getting into a top CS school is still slim to none. What other schools should I consider?"

A little bit about me: I'm 25, living in Europe (this is probably relevant but if you can only comment from  
a US point of view that would also help) and have the equivalent of a BSEE. I'm currently employed as a  
software engineer, not really out of necessity but because I was very interested in software during the  
later parts of my degree (computer vision, machine learning etc.) so that's were I had the most experience  
and thus job opportunities.

After a lot of introspection I currently feel like software might not be for me after all and that I would  
be happier pursuing a career in analog/RF design. Now my problem is this:  
While I still have most EE fundamentals down, to be employable in that field I would need at least a masters  
degree. Quitting my job and going back to school is obviously a very bad decision financially but I don't  
really care about money that much so that's not an issue. Still, working in software for a couple more  
years and saving up enough cash to get me through a two year degree would help immensely. I'm also  
thinking that it would be beneficial to self study material I'm interested in and work on projects before  
starting a degree so that I will be better prepared and really know what areas I should focus on. This  
is especially the case since I don't have the decade long hobbyist experience (ham radio etc.) that many  
EE students seem to have so I feel like I need to catch up before enrolling in graduate school. At the  
same time I'm worried that any delay in getting a masters will decrease my job outlook in any non-  
software field due to (potentially) ageism and raised eyebrows at my sudden career shift.  


So essentially I want to know:  


* Will starting a masters focusing on hardware design in a couple of years as opposed to right away hurt  
my career opportunities (discounting lost time)?  

* Given fundamental undergrad knowledge and some (but not loads) of practical analog experience, is a two  
year masters degree plus ideally a 6-12 months internship even enough to make me employable in  
analog/RF or do I need significantly more experience than that?"

That being said, my salary after the promotion is $60k (this is in the Cincinnati, Ohio area), and I feel like this is a bit low, so I'm planning on job hunting. But I have a couple of questions related to salaries.

1. I've heard wildly different numbers for what someone in Cincinnati and with my amount of experience should make. How much does a software developer with two years experience in Cincinnati typically make? What's the most reliable source to find the appropriate market rate? 

2. How aggressive should I be with salary negotiations?

It'll be sad to say goodbye to the people I work with as they've all been extremely supportive and encouraging, but it's definitely time to grow in my career and see what opportunities are out there."

(And how you can join the program next Summer!),Inge14,gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/cz8hbg/my_summer_spaceflight_fellowship_experience/," 

TL:DR at the bottom!

Hey all! This past Summer I had the opportunity to take part in the Matthew Isakowitz Fellowship Program (MIFP) as part of the Fellow Class of 2019. As the application period for the Class of 2020 approaches in the next week or two, I thought I'd write down some of the highlights of my experience while also sharing application information with my fellow Yellow Jackets. If anything in this post piques your interest, please come to the [information session](https://ae.gatech.edu/event/info-session-brooke-owens-and-matthew-isakowitz-fellowship) on both the MIFP and the analogous Brooke Owens Fellowship Program on Friday 9/20 from 4-6pm in Guggenheim 442!

The Matt Fellowship is designed to inspire and grow the next generation of young men and women to be the future innovators, entrepreneurs, and leaders of the commercial space industry. As part of the program, fellows are matched with one of the host companies (SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, OneWeb) for a Summer internship, matched with executive mentor, and attend a 3-day summit in LA. The four main components of the MIFP are Internship, Mentorship, The Summit, and Networking. Through these four components, fellows are able to gain hand-on experience in the commercial space industry while becoming **extremely** well connected to major industry players.

**Internship:**

As part of the Fellowship I was placed in a paid internship with OneWeb Satellites in Cape Canaveral Florida. OWS is the 50/50 joint venture between Airbus and OneWeb with the primary goal of the company to manufacture, assemble and test OneWeb's telecommunication satellites. I got to work out of OWS' brand new Florida production facility that has the ability to produce 2 fully tested satellites every **8 hours** at approximately **2%** the cost of a traditional manufacturer. My work saw me working in a joint product evolution / business development role and allowed me to travel across the country to work with various hardware vendors and attend SmallSat in Logan, UT. I found the work extremely gratifying and got to learn from coworkers who are experts at their craft. Additionally, working within a stones-throw of the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex had its perks too. Getting to work at the Cape during the Summer of Apollo 11's 50th anniversary really brought things into perspective when watching various rocket launches and touring the different launch pads. (Watching the first night launch of the Falcon Heavy was such a treat!) Thankfully, OWS has allowed me to continue my work remotely part-time this Fall to support a few contracts so if you have any questions feel free to reach out!

**Mentorship:**

During last Spring I was matched with John Gedmark, CEO of Astranis as my executive mentor. John has provided me with a lot of vital guidance as I finish up my last semester here at Tech and is still in contact with me even after my Summer at OWS. His work to provide high-bandwidth satellite internet to Alaska complimented my work quite well and he was able to give me an intelligent perspective as to where he thinks the commercial space industry will grow in the years to come.

**Summit:**

During the last week of July, I had the pleasure of attending the MIFP Summit in LA. The summit gave me the opportunity to meet and fraternize with the other 24 fellows while touring various commercial space companies and playing some intense space trivia on the bus rides. I'll be honest, I was very nervous to meet the other fellows. The only information I had learned about them was from their LinkedIn pages, papers they had published or presentations they had given. The summit tore down all of these walls and within 72 hours I had gained 24 fast-friends who were all space-geeks like me. Over the course of the summit I had the opportunity to meet two of my idols; Elon Musk and Buzz Aldrin.... IN THE SAME DAY. In between two of our company tours (Virgin Orbit and Boeing), it was announced as a surprise that we would be taking a detour to SpaceX's Hawthorne headquarters to sit down with Elon for \~30min and ask him any questions we had about life, liberty and the pursuit of Mars colonization. He was a bit taller than I imagined and the best way I can describe the way he talked is if an overclocked CPU could be a human brain, it would be Elon Musk. He jumped from point to point in his answers and you could tell he was doing tons of 'back of the envelope' calculations for each thing he said. Here are some of my favorite quotes from our chat:

""Getting a PhD is like eating glass and staring into the abyss.""

""If you have enough patience to get a PhD, you probably have too much patience.""

That evening it was also announced as a surprise that the Buzz Aldrin would be attending the summit reception dinner as the guest of honor. As if meeting Elon wasn't enough, getting to meet Buzz and shake his hand just a few days after the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 sent me over the moon! (pun intended) Buzz was curt, no nonsense and straight to the point. We asked about the events that led to him becoming the second man on the Moon his response was very on character: ""Being in the right place at the right time... and a whole lot of bullshit!"" During the rest of the evening I met executives from almost all of the host companies as well as other prominent figures in the industry. I got to learn more about what they were up to currently as well as the steps they took out of school to get to where they are today. The summit finished with a closing ceremony and a wonderful opportunity to meet and mingle with fellows from the class of 2018. By the end of the night current and past fellows were playing cornhole and singing bad karaoke around a bonfire. What a weekend.

**Networking:**

The final component of the fellowship is networking and there certainly was no lack of this element. Being a part of the MIFP provides you with an **insane** network in the commercial space industry. I think that 2018 Matt fellow Sydney Dolan put it best. When asked about the networking benefits of the MIFP, she said ""It's probably how Peter Parker feels."" Joining this family is truly akin to gaining super powers. To give an example of the type of networking that I experienced during the program I only have to list the 4 non-fellow guests seated at my table during the summit reception dinner:

Peter Diamandis: Founder of the X-Prize

George Whitesides: CEO of Virgin Galactic

John Gedmark: CEO of Astranis

Tim Ellis: CEO of Relativity Space

Many of the Matt Fellows have gotten their first jobs out of college from the connections they made during the program. The MIFP gives you the power to seek out almost any team within any of the host companies and have a direct line to hiring managers and recruiters. All you need to do is ask and the community is almost always able to get you in contact with your desired party. IT'S CRAZY.

**How Can You Take Part?:**

As stated earlier, the application for the Matt Fellowship Class of 2020 will be opening in the next week or two. The requirements to apply are as follows:

* At the time of application, is a **college junior, college senior, or graduate student** who intends to pursue a **full-time career in the commercial spaceflight industry**. 
   * *Commercial space* is broadly defined as activities in entrepreneurship, intrapreneurship, and innovation that will enable new or dramatically improved products or services that do not depend solely on government cost-plus contracting to prove viable. In its most aspiring terms, commercial space promises to alter the space industry through new business models that will open up the space frontier.
* Has either earned an **engineering degree** or is working towards one at the time the Fellowship begins. 
* Has a diversity in experience and academic interests such as in engineering, science, management, business, and other related fields that can be related to commercial space. 
* Is a **U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident** (green card holder) due to export control regulations at the host companies. 

Program website:  [https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/](https://www.matthewisakowitzfellowship.org/) 

Luckily for you, the Matt Fellows (and Brookies) will be hosting an info session to go over the MIFP and BOFP and application process for each program in more detail in a couple weeks. We can provide more insight on the type of applicants the programs take and what we found helpful during our application process. If you have any questions feel free to reach out and I hope to see a bunch of you on 9/20!

AD ASTRA AND GO JACKETS!!

**TL:DR: Super cool spaceflight fellowship opening applications soon. Come to Guggenheim 442 at 4pm on 9/20 to learn more!**"

&amp;#x200B;

Im a 27 years old guy who's willing to change his profession and go into programing. I pick it because I am spending alot of my free time on the computer so I guess that would fit me the best. I am currently a kitchen chef but cannot take this anymore and lost the sparkle. Anyhow Im ready to go to 2 months courses of  Java in a month. How do you feel about such courses? I don't think that you can learn alot in 2 months although the only thing that makes me to trust it is that they send you to internship (its code academy). Meanwhile I want to start learning something online but I don't know which platform to choose ( Skillshare, Linda etc), which would have the best/most lessons.

OK, I am a full time student and I work in an internship part time.  We currently live in low income housing, we have since last August.  Both during my initial certification and our re-certification that was a month and a half ago, I provided my landlord with my school financial information, they even faxed over their own form to have my school fill out, which they did both times, I checked.  Problem is, now the apartment complex is saying that we owe over $2500 in back rent because of my school loans, clearly it is their mistake. They are also saying that our rent is doubling and they are setting up what we owe in back rent as a payment plan. So now our rent is effectively tripled. Can they do this?  We just had our re-certification and I have the paper that the property manager signed that said what our rent was.  We have been up front and 100% honest about our income.  Do I have any legal recourse here.  I live in Indiana btw.  Someone, please help."

czatwc,1,2019-09-03,Should I take this apprenticeship in data science?,Xanimede,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/czatwc/should_i_take_this_apprenticeship_in_data_science/,"This is a bit uni related, but mainly industry focused. 

I will be starting uni in a couple of days, studying [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/utaicsc.htm) at the University of Edinburgh. Standard 4 year course with no placements. It's up to the student to look for internships.

We were notified of an opportunity of an apprenticeship in [data science](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/19-20/dpt/utbscdatsc1f.htm), it is still a 4 year bachelor's degree, the difference is that:

- Each summer you have to do an internship

- In your 3rd and 4th years, the 1st semester will be spent at the uni, and the 2nd semester (then the following summer) will be spent at the company. This totals into your grade.

I have done my interview with [Royal London](https://www.royallondon.com/), a mutual insurance company. It has a good score on [glassdoor (4.1)](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Royal-London-Reviews-E12432.htm). People at the interview were very nice, it is a relaxed casual atmosphere.

The pros:

* A guaranteed internship after your 1st and 2nd years is really good, it's not easy to get one at these times. It means I won't have to look for jobs or work something non-CS related.

* Graduating with 2 years of work under your belt is very tempting.

* The company seems like a really good place to work at.

The cons:

* I am not really interested in insurance, I don't think I'll want to continue doing it after graduation. I am worried that after I graduate, tech companies might reject me as my experience is in the financial sector.

* Royal London is a mid tier company. Again, I am worried I will pigeonhole myself before my career has really started. I can't opt-out of the contract, so if I find a BigN job offer in my 3rd year, I won't be able to take it.

* This apprenticeship is new. No one has graduated it, so it's not 100% confirmed that you can do postgraduate after it.


Thoughts? It seems like it's such a huge decision to make at such an early stage."
czc9xp,1,2019-09-03,Career change at 22,Goobster12,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/czc9xp/career_change_at_22/,"I'm (22 M) just at a crossroads right now. I have been studying IT for the last 2 years, and was strongly considered CyberSecurity for the future. However I got my first internship where I have been mostly working like a service desk technician. (It wasn't meant to be that way, but we got behind, so they used me for it, but I'm being paid so I don't mind) It does interest me, but only moderately. There are some parts that are cool, and some that just seem terrible. I see some people around me too who just seem unhappy with the IT sector, like they are stuck in 9-5s that they hate, and I don't want that to be me. However CyberSecurity of course is in massive demand, and pays really well.

I have found a second calling however, I am interested in being a personal trainer. I love excercise, even though I'm not shredded or anything, and I really enjoy helping people meet their goals. I'm just good at it. I can motivate people to workout, and make them feel accomplished, and it's a very wholesome and fulfilling thing to experience. However I also know that the personal trainer market is kinda tough right now. There are a lot of people who want to be personal trainers, and the jobs simply don't pay well unless you manage to go independent and develop a good clientell, which intimidates me, as CyberSecurity has such a high demand, and good gauranteed pay behind it in contrast.

Luckily I have been BLESSED with the opportunity to go to school tuition-free, so I have been doing that, and am about to get an AS in IT (In addition to the AA I had). However before I go forward with IT to get a BA in cybersecurity (And potentially a masters someday), I am thinking about taking some time to work as a personal trainer. I don't have any debts to pay off right now, and I have some money saved up as well. I also won't be getting my AS until the end of spring semester when I am 23 due to some administration problems on the school's end, but during that last sememster, I will only have one class. I can use the time between then and now to obtain most of the certificates I would need to work as a PT, and finish spring semester off with both PT certs, and an IT degree. My current plan is just to work as a PT for a while and see how I like it. Maybe I find that I love it, and I grow rapidly, and end up making plenty of money. Maybe I don't and end up defaulting back to IT. The only thing that scares me is the time.

I just feel like at 22 I should have my career picked out. It makes me feel like I am behind everyone because I still don't know what I want. I have always envied people who have a clear goal in mind, and not knowing what I want to do with the rest of my life is scaring the hell out of me. I want something with good pay and job security, but I also want something that I truly find rewarding and enjoyable. But I'm also scared of wasting more years of my life in the wrong career field, and not moving forward as quickly. The whole thing is just scaring me, and I would appreciate your guys' advice."

I graduated in January with my ISE my degree with a low GPA and it was a very rocky road. I've always felt incredibly out of place in engineering school and in my current situation I really don’t know who to turn to for advice:

I worked 2 internships over the summers and in both of these I didn't get a return offer because I guess I didn’t do a good job/fit in. I would be cooped up in my cubicle doing the tasks I was assigned and that was it... I would try to ask questions, but it felt like I would just be constrained to these (what felt like) meaningless tasks where I wasn't able to go to interesting meetings where I would truly gain valuable experience. Maybe I didn't properly ever break the ice with my managers, and this was the result of that.

After working those internships, trying to interact with managers and even my senior design group, I’ve been seriously questioning my abilities as an IE/engineer. I realized I never really say or had those engineering moments that sort of affirm to others like 'ok this guy has it, he belongs here.' I been hoping this has something to do with anxiety but now I’m not so sure it does. I like the concepts of associated with IE and they interest me, but I struggled to get B’s, sometimes C’s. I feel like if I truly belonged, this wouldn't be the case. But then again, I've heard how little grades matter in the real world.

The bottom line is, all these feelings have left me very lost and trepidatious about applying/jumping into a typical starting IE role. I don’t see how that job will be any different from my internship experiences and I’m trying to see if there’s anything I can do now so they are far from it.

It would really mean a lot if anyone had advice for me in terms of what roles they think I should look into or anything I can do (or self-learn/gain a background) in this gray area between working that I could benefit from that would be great. I do have a six sigma green belt from 2 years ago but I’ve always had trouble in utilizing/applying the concepts. It feels like I just have this degree without knowing much of anything or having experience so if there’s anything I can do right now to feel more confident in my ability to do the work that would be amazing. I am just feeling very lost

Thanks for reading this and feel more than free to even PM me cause I could use any guidance you can offer!"

 This is gonna be a very long post, but the title has been going on since May, but the whole story has been going on for the past three years. I also do not know if this is the correct subreddit to post this on, so apologies in advance. Currently, my dad makes about minimum wage working at a factory and potentially has a gambling problem/addiction. My mom (46F) is a stay at home mom (which does not make sense anymore considering I am an adult), and I am currently going for my master's degree without a job, and the reason why I do not have a job is my parents want me to have as much fun as I can before I have to go start working where I will not have as much fun as I am right now. That is nice and all, but if you read the title, this is a serious problem, and my parents will not let me find a job. If you are wondering how I got all this money without a job, my grandpa gave me a fat check for college and I did had an internship that I got paid for.

   
 This all started three years ago, where something similar happened where my dad would borrow money from me from May-August 2016 to pay for rent. At May, my mom was fine with the idea of my dad borrowing money from me since I thought and she thought this would be a one time thing. The reason he asked me was he lost his part time job working at a restaurant since it closed while working at the factory. I let him borrow whatever amount of money he needed to pay for rent. In June-August, however, this is when things really went downhill. My dad would ask me to borrow some amount of money that added up to $2880. In those three months, I had to keep it a secret from my mom, but eventually, my mom kept asking me if I am letting my dad borrow money. I got an emotional breakdown when I let him borrow the money in August since I realized he was not going to pay me back, and I confessed to my mom that I let my dad borrow all this money, and he has not paid me back. At this point, my mom was yelling and screaming at my dad for borrowing money from me and not paying it back while I watched as I cried in tears. My mom told me at this point to never let my dad borrow money from me ever again. At this point, my mom and dad were living together like they were stangers that hated eachother, and they would and still very rarely talk to eachother. I am also certain at this point that I have depression since I am the one that caused this to happen and I knew there was no way to fix this.

   
 This entire paragraph I have to keep a secret from my mom due to what happened three years ago. Recently, back in May, after I graduated with my bachelor's, my dad has been starting to ask me to borrow $500 so he can pay rent. Knowing what happened three years ago, I had an emotional breakdown, initially refusing at first. However, he showed proof of his bank account where he had a negative balance in his account, and he said that he would write a check for me and said I can use it if I do not pay him back by the time, I can use the check to deposit into my account, which is usually 2 weeks. I saw that he had been writing checks to my mom to buy groceries. I agree to this, and he does pay me back. In June, he asked for the same thing, and things went well there if you can even call it that. At this point, I noticed that he stopped showing me proof of his bank account and his negative balance. In July, however, I noticed that my dad got some court papers, which I do not know what it was for, but I believe this is when the lease on our apartment was about to expire, and I assume my dad did not have the money to pay the lease. He comes and asks me to borrow me $1500 to help pay all that out. I agree again, and while he does take a while to pay all that back, he does pay me back in full of $1500. I forgot how much exactly he borrowed from me in August, but same thing happened. I let him borrow the money, kept my mom in the dark, he gave me a check that is equal to how much he borrowed from me, and he would pay me back. 

   
 This leads to today, where I have the biggest issue. This past weekend, my dad asked me to borrow another $1000 for rent, which is fine since he has been paying me back for the past several months. However, today, my dad asks me to borrow yet another $1000, and he told me he failed to find people to borrow money from. So far, I have not agreed to this since I have problems with this. First up, he is borrowing $2000 from me. How does he need $2000 from me to pay for rent if he has a minimum wage job? I can only assume to this is gambling, but the thing is, if I do not help him pay rent, there is a risk of us being evicted. This would not be such a big deal if my parents would let me find a job and help out pay rent since I would not mind, but asking your son that does not have a job to borrow money does not sound right to me, especially since my parents are the ones not allowing me to find a job. 

   
 The big question is, what should I do? Do I tell my mom about this? Do I help my dad pay rent that is somehow $2000 this month? If there are any questions or contradictions you guys have, I will try to answer them and clear any of them up.

   
 TLDR: Dad asked money to pay for rent 3 years ago from me, he did not pay back, I confessed to my mom about this, and now mom and dad hate eachother. Dad does the same this from May to today, and the rent money keeps increasing this time for some reason. Kept mom about the dark since she told me to not let my dad borrow from me again, and I am afraid on what is going to happen if I tell my mom about this and my dad wants to borrow $2000 rent money this month despite having a job. Need help in deciding on what to do."
czcu1k,3,2019-09-03,Regret my decision about an Engineering Co-op.,Eyeball13,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/czcu1k/regret_my_decision_about_an_engineering_coop/,"I recently turned down a co-op opportunity and I’m fearing that I made the wrong decision. The position involved working closely with Process Engineers and the automation of certain tasks for a flooring manufacturer. 

For some background, I am currently in my second semester working towards a degree in Mechatronics Engineering. This is my second bachelors degree, and I anticipate finishing my current program in roughly 2 years. I’ve worked 3 years in manufacturing for a department of defense contractor. I recently lost my job due to having cut back hours for school leading to some turmoil between myself and the owner.

Prior to the interview for the co-op I was not familiar with the concept (position was listed as an internship). After learning that accepting the position meant I would be unable to take classes the upcoming semester, I thought it would be in my best interest to keep moving forward with school. The idea of taking 2/3 of the next 3 semesters off to work full-time was counter intuitive to me, having come from working full-time for the past 5 years. And with 2 years left in my degree, I felt that there was little potential for it to turn into a full-time job.

My first week into classes I had a professor bring up co-op positions and he spoke extremely highly of such opportunities. I immediately felt extremely dumb for my decision. 

Had I accepted the co-op, today would’ve been my first day. When I declined the position, the company mentioned that they hope I keep them in mind for future opportunities. Do you think it’s too late for me to reach back out to the company? Or is it best to keep moving forward and seek opportunities aligned closer to the end of my degree? 

Any advice or insight would be extremely appreciated!"

I had been unable to find a developer job in the Portland area for 4 months, having applied to nearly everything I was qualified for and a few things I definitely wasn’t qualified for. Most of your replies were encouraging and helpful. Ben Brewster even reached out and offered many great suggestions.

I attended the career showcase, talked to a few fellow graduates, and corresponded with a few local hiring managers. After a few weeks, I landed an interview and later a job with a local software company 10 minutes from my house. 

I’m not going to dump a bunch of bullet points with advice you’ve already heard. The one thing I changed was extremely obvious, and something you might lack upon graduation. 

I really focused on providing proof that I could do what I claimed to be able to do. 

Before you reply “duh,” remember that some people don’t have this and will struggle. 

My degree wasn’t proof. My assignments weren’t great proof. My financial obligations kept me from quitting my job to take an internship, so I didn’t have that for proof. My projects were sometimes proof, but weren’t always good enough or relevant.

In my case, my personal website and a portfolio of really playing up my past professional (really minor) web dev work, as well as some of the side projects I had been working on, were what got me the job. 

If you’re in the same boat, take screenshots of your projects running, clean up your code from old assignments, and add a few features or build a nice UI for them after your done. If you haven’t graduated yet, pick a capstone project you can see piquing the interest of the companies you want to work for.

Your non-Ivy League degree will not be enough on its own. Your GPA won’t convince anyone. 10+ years ago this might have been the case, but there are tons of graduates of colleges and boot camps now fighting for the same few opportunities.

czecxg,0,2019-09-03,Self teaching to become Internship ready,Cjivory,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/czecxg/self_teaching_to_become_internship_ready/," 

Hi everyone,

I normally don't post much on here but I really needed to get some feedback on a plan I want to really do.

So I am a junior in College majoring in Information technology but I want to become a software engineer and I want to get a software engineering internship for the summer of 2020 so I have decided that I am going to self teach myself over this fall semester the following topics: html,css,javascript and data structures and algorithms. I am taking a java class for this semester so I will not need to self teach myself that.

I plan to study,practice and make a couple projects/websites each month for each language. Here is my plan that I have so far:

September: Learn html and CSS and then make at least 2 websites with it so that it will help me to get enough working knowledge to where I am internship ready.

October: Learn javascript and make at least 2 websites with that so I'll have enough working knowledge for an internship. And possibly learn data structures and algorithms.

November: Make a big website or 2 that involves a front end and back end for each and use this as a project to put on my portfolio and showcase what I know and my current ability to get things done.

December: Make a web app and possibly another project to use all the knowledge I have previously outlined before and then add that to my portfolio as well.

Then for the Winter semester I will dedicate January to learning more about data structures and algorithms so that I truly understand them and then for February and March I will do a couple more big projects so that I will have at least 3 or 4 big projects to present on my portfolio. Or I might refine my previous projects instead. I will also be practicing to get ready for the interviews for these internships and look up best practices and things of that nature.

I'll be dedicating 2 hours minimum everyday, at least for all of this and more on the weekends.

That's basically what I am thinking I can do for this semester to become ready for a software engineering internship for the summer of 2020 and to also become ready for my colleges spring career fair which is usually in April. Based on all of your collective knowledge, journeys and experiences do you all think what I have outlined could give me the result I need which is being a good and competitive candidate for software engineering internships? And how well do you think this will prepare me?

Now I am not ignorant and naive enough to believe I will be a master at any of these web/programming languages within this short time frame I know it takes longer than one month to master any of them so keep in mind I am only trying to teach myself the basics and get enough working knowledge to where I am good enough to make a few projects(to help me get to an intern level) that will also teach me a lot in the project making process as well and these projects will showcase my ability to follow through and see things through to completion. So please do not get triggered by me saying I am only spending one month to learn something because trust me I already know it takes a lot more than that and I know even when I get an internship and a job in this field I will continue to learn each and every day. 

So just to clarify this plan is only so that I can get myself to a good enough level where I can have projects on my portfolio and be good enough to compete with the rest of the interns that are applying for these positions. If anyone has a different idea or plan of how I can get internship ready by the time I need ( January 2020) I am open and welcome to other ideas and thank you in advance for your ideas.

TL;DR: I have come up with a plan to self teach myself so that I can get a working knowledge of the following languages and CS fundamentals: html,css and javascript, data structures and algorithms all by the end of January 2020( I am taking a OOP class this semester for school so I won't have to self teach that). I am doing this so that I will become good enough to apply to software engineering internships in my colleges spring career fair which is in April. Do you think this is a good plan and will make me a good and competitive candidate for software engineering internships?

I hope to hear what all of your thoughts on this are and I hope you are all having a great day!"

I've started reaching out to recruiters for next summer in hopes for an internship but not a single one has replied to me. I mean not a single one. Can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong or should I just not be reaching out to recruiters? Here's the email format I've been using -

Hi (first name)!

My name is (my name) and I'm currently a sophomore at (my school) majoring in Computer Science. I'm reaching out to you because I'm interested in software engineering internship opportunities at (your company).

I attached my resume to this email - if there are any relevant opportunties at (your company) I would be happy to talk more with you!

Thanks!

Is there anything wrong with my email format? Or is the recruiter response rate normally just low?"

I just started an internship in an office and I have been given quite a tedious task. I’ve been given a data set of 956 numbers and I’ve had to sort through it to find all the duplicates within the set. I’ve been able to find all the duplicates and strikethrough all the unique values but I need to be able to highlight all the duplicates in the different colors so it can be easy to find each value’ duplicate in the list. 

So for example all 29s in the list need to be in one color and all 57567s in another. I don’t know how many duplicates there are in the list but there are quite a few. 

I’ve tried conditional formatting but that’s taking ages and I’m having a difficult time finding different colors for all the duplicates. I tried a VBA code but it seemed to mess up some of the highlights by highlighting two unidentical numbers in the same color.

I would be very grateful if one of you could help me with this as it would help me really impress the partner who gave me this task! Thank you!"

I’m trying to determine how much I need to make in these cities to maintain the same quality of life I have now. I currently make ~140 TC as a senior software engineer with 2 years of internships and 1 year of professional experience.

I’ve made 2 calculations. The first takes into account net pay after taxes and spending adjusted for each city from www.theearthawaits.com to get the total leftover amount. I then find the pre-tax amount needed for each city to match the leftover amount.

In the 2nd calculation, I take into account pre and post tax retirement contributions and calculate the pre-tax amount for each city to match the leftover amount maintaining the same retirement savings rate.

The first calculation seems to give me the amount I need to maintain the same quality of life right now, but this would lead to a reduced savings rate in higher COL cities.

The second calculation would give me the same quality of life now, and maintain the same savings rate, but in a higher COL city this same savings rate would net a significantly higher dollar amount saved which would grow even more with compounding interest.

So it seems the pay I’d need to make the move would be somewhere between these 2 numbers. Can anyone please comment on my thought process and provide some insight/advice?

Last May, I began an internship at a startup company. I excelled, largely due to my self-taught background; I've been programming long before university. The company actually agreed to a part-time arrangement when the school year began and my internship ended, and I signed on as a part-time employee. I'm making good money part-time, with a commitment of 30 hours per week. I just recently received options from the company, and everyone has agreed that I am doing great, I'll remain with the company, and being part-time is okay. We looked into part-time school and full-time work, but with the lack of financial aid and almost $2,000 a credit hour make that doubly expensive. This is feasible, but the reason I'm making this post is because school is starting to become less feasible. I'm already in the hole $25,000 in loans, $15,000 private.

With financial aid, I'm currently paying $400 per month for tuition (after both grants and loans). I live off-campus (financial aid does not apply to on-campus living, since I am local to the area - this is the cheapest option) and commute to/from campus and work, about 30 minutes including finding a parking spot and walking to the appropriate building. My income from work is going to count for next year's financial aid, so I'm expecting to receive next to nothing, and despite being entirely self-sufficient my parent's income also is taken into account.

In the situation that the startup fails (which it almost certainly won't, we're doing great), say with two years of industry experience as a full-stack engineer, could I make it without a degree? Better question - should I? What kind of potential salary hit does that generally entail?

I've only really spoken to my boss and my girlfriend about this - I'd like some opinions from the outside looking in.

Any insight is appreciated - thank you!"

I'm currently a college senior applying for New Grad jobs. I go to a good school, have had three internships, have personal projects, and love CS. Seems like I got it all figured out.

But in the past 2-3 years, I have applied to a massive amount of companies (500+ at this point I think), but every single time I get a glimmer of hope in terms of getting the job, I become super invested, and become super interested in the company, and the company's mission. Every rejection after an onsite hurts way too much for the number of times that I have done this. This post comes after getting rejected from a company for an on-site I thought I nailed, but still didn't get it.

How do I care less? I still want to care about CS, I still love what I'm learning, but the stress from the outcomes has been affecting me as a person outside of on-sites and I am sick of it.

Thanks again"

How long is the usual time to start being comfortable with the tech stack?


I'm going to rant a bit.
I had no idea of what I was getting into with this company. I have interned for other big N and this was not the case, but I dont know if it was because the bar is lower for interns. I am studying on top of that because I dont feel like I can keep going with this. Will there be a red flag on my resume if I switch companies after 6 months or less than 1 year?

I graduated last year with a degree in CS from a 4 year college. Good gpa. Several internships. Several specialized skills in Machine Learning tech. After graduation I worked for a year as a Software Engineer before the company laid off 70% of their staff due to lack of sales.
I started looking for jobs and three weeks later got offered what seemed like a reasonable offer. 3-month internship to full employee offer with a big healthcare company. Not great pay, but their employee development tracks seemed promising as did the diversity and culture of the team.

I started a job this week. I have sat on a couch in the corner for 3 days. My laptop was just ordered. No desk has been assigned. I have spoken to someone on my team for 5 minutes and other than that have had no contact with my team, havent even been able to speak to my supervisor,  doesn't respond to emails, constantly told he is in meetings. 

I have several other interviews which companies are attempting to schedule with me in the next 2 weeks that I havent had time to tell I had a job yet. With 4 solid interviews in the next week and another 2-3 to be scheduled, most being at least double the pay, I'm ready to drop this position ASAP as the lack of communication to a new hire is miserable and seems to run through the whole company. 

Do I need to give 2 weeks notice given that i started this week? Or can I just communicate that I do not think it is a good fit and continue interviewing?

Thanks

TL;DR Started at company this week. No communication and havent even met my team. Is it ok to hand in immediate resignation?"

I guess you can't have it all, but it seems to me that there are no free, open source, lightweight, modular, self contained tools that are actually straightforward to use. For some reason I absolutely hate the idea of having proprietary SDK's for every scilicon vendor or for every framework/HAL (Arduino IDE, MBed studio, and ST's whole ""cube"" thing). I've worked with large, open source projects targeted towards ARM uC's that use CMake and GCC and I love that such codebases are not a (insert IDE here) project, but just... code (and a cmaklists file or whatever). The problem is that it seems like setting up something like that from scratch is just plain difficult even for a bare-metal project- let alone HAL's, ROTS's etc. 

So is this how it goes? Are the only two options to either (a) to learn cmake, linker scripts, cross-compiling and all that from the ground up or (b) to just give in and use the proprietary tools?

Now I'm amazing at hands on experience except not for networking, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm in the right field or not, I love working with computers and fixing them.

I have a Bachelor of Science (major Biology and minor Chemistry.) I graduated back in 2017, thinking I wanted to go for medicine, but I was wrong (debt, time commitment, etc.) I tried programming using FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. It didn't work out too well since I could not stay on a schedule to teach myself. I was convinced to go another route, but it wasn't feasible. I believe that Computer Science fits what I look for in a future more than any of my other choices. Plus, it's quite broad. 

I am thinking about going back to school to get a second Bachelor's so I can do my best there while possibly gaining internships to get experience. When I learned on FreeCodeCamp, it was difficult for me to build my own projects so I figured with an internship, it'll be easier to get my foot in the door.

I frequently watch videos output by some of the faces of the tech category on YouTube including LinusTechTips, Austin Evans, etc.. However, I am only a casual gamer (once or twice a week) and still play on my base model Xbox One just for ease of use.

Here is my dilemma that maybe some of you may be able to provide some input, I am in my last year of college for a degree in Business Administration - Marketing, and plan on applying to multiple internships through some local college programs that apparently have a great turnout rate. At the same time I am working in Sales for an Internet Service Provider in my area, but the hours are becoming stringent and becoming less flexible with my days of school, but that is a whole separate issue. So I have an awkward amount of time between now and when I might hear back for some of my internship programs. I have decided that I would like to commit myself to my photography and video-graphy in the meantime rather than stick with my office job. I don't expect to rake in as much income as I do currently but enough pocket-money to cover my day to day expenses (I have well over enough saved up to cover my largest expenses like groceries, car payment, insurance, and mild bills thanks to my parents for currently being rent-free until I graduate). Aside from the financials, I am tired of editing on my consumer-level Hp Envy laptop, with frequent crashes in Adobe applications, and poor rendering times despite its astonishing display. This may be where you guys may or may not be able to provide some input.

Now that you know my purpose and need out of a PC machine, I am wondering if there is any large sales (black friday etc) or expected technological revolutions in the world of GPU's and CPU's that may determine whether I push the ""add to cart"" button now or perhaps wait until a price drop in the future. I am quite frugal, or cheap as some may call it, but even it means saving an extra $100, I am patient. Despite my desire for savings, I do not plan on cheaping out on PC hardware and currently have a projected budget of $750 (USD).

Any advice would be appreciated!

Budget and country of origin: 
$500-800 (ideally on the lower end, my funding is fairly low, but I can spend more if I can get something that will last). I’ll be buying in the United States likely online.

2 in 1 form factor, good battery life, or best specifications for the money? 
I’d definitely like the best specifications for the money. I’ll also be traveling to hopefully go on internship soon and so something with decent battery life would be helpful.

How important is weight and thinness to you? 
I carry my laptop back and forth between campus daily, and my old Sager was made of bricks, so something lighter would be ideal (but I’ll sacrifice weight for function if needed).

Which OS do you require? 
Windows.

Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run: 
I don’t play games on my pc, but I do often run analytical software (Mplus, R, SPSS) and I would like something that can run those processes while still being usable for other small tasks (editing word docs, etc.). My old machine needed dedicated time for stats and it would be nice to be able to do some minor multitasking.

If you’re gaming do you have certain games you want to play? 
N/A

Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch screen, finger print reader, optical drive, or good input devices (keyboard/touch pad):
I do a fair amount of data entry, so a sturdy keyboard with a number pad would be helpful. Also something that can last me a few years and not be outdated (have had my last machine for four years and it’s been great right till the end). I also would lean more towards getting a computer from a more established brand, as finding parts to repair my saeger over the years has been difficult).


Any finishing thoughts that are necessary and beneficial to discussion:
Would prefer something that doesn’t come with a lot of bloatware."

Mostly because I dont feel fullfilled socially.

Let me start by giving you a bit of backstory about myself.
I am a 21 year old german guy. I never really got a chance to go to uni. Ive been working since I was 16 years old. And its starting to pay off financially. 

I am an consultant in IT / Banking now and will be getting my diploma to attend Uni next year. Ive had a job I loved last year but the company almost went bankrupt and let us all go. At the same time I broke up with my girlfriend. 

These were though times but atleast job wise things got better quickly as I got the consulting offer quickly. Its a decent job that pays very well. I feel like some of my coworkers admire me a bit because I am that young and stuff (Most of my coworkers are 35+). 

But I am not happy. The job is not the challenge I hoped it to be. Its pretty boring in fact and full of bullshit tasks (I know that is kinda what consulting is).

Besides that I dont feel like I am fulfilled socially. I have a few good friends and we hang out pretty often. But I dont meet new people as much as I would like to. Especially since Ive been single for one and a half year now. I feel like a weirdo because a 21 year old should not be single for that long (I know this is bullshit but its the way I feel). My friends dont understand my situation. They think all is well since I am the only one that moved out and earns money.

The past few weeks ive been thinking about saving as much money as I can and quitting my job next year to attend uni fulltime. We have something called ""Werksstudent"" in germany which is basically a paid internship for 20 hours a week. Due to my experience I would not have difficultys getting a job. This would enable me to keep my flat.
Also Uni would help me meet new people my age. I really want to have a bit of student life.

Sounds all good right? The thing is I will still be burning a lot of money through my bachelors. I would be able to finish it if I work on the side but its still a risk.
I also dont know if I am overestimating the Uni experience. I am scared of being forever alone if I dont put myself out there and think that is a big part of my decision. I dont trust my friends enough to introduce me to people and there is no one and you dont fuck the company (not that there is anything to fuck).

I feel like I am missing something. Because the thought of studying fulltime and challenging myself while having more of an active social life just seems to good to be true right now.

What do you think? Should I take the risk or keep on working, hoping things get better?"

#My situation:

I work for a Fortune 500 company that sells EDA software. I work as a marketing engineer, which is mostly a product support position (learn about the software, create revenue by generating leads (reach out to customers)). So it’s mostly phone calls, some very surface level marketing projects, and learning the software tools so you eventually get promoted to engineering sales/application engineering/product specialist type roles.

I don’t care about the software. I don’t like learning about the tools. Not a fan of the industry. I don't really relate to my coworkers. This is very reminescent of my mediocre engineering experience in college and I’m already *dying to get out.* I can take a paycut, I just can't waste my time with work that doesn't even remotely click with me anymore. My brain doesn't work this way and it's evident from me not relating to my coworkers that I'm not where I need to be.

---

#My options:


1. It seems like an easy out might be getting into some kind of marketing. I can milk my title, but I haven’t really done much actual marketing. If I go this route, I’d need to work for a company/industry that I can really get behind. Either something altruistic, or at least semi-interesting. I don't know exactly what industry I want to be in, but I know that I have to be able to get behind it. I think for me, the underlying purpose of the work is probably more important than the work itself. I don’t know how much I’d enjoy a marketing position. But I know with certainly that I don’t want to be in an engineering position. While it doesn't look great to switch jobs before a year, I don't see a problem because I would just switch into another entry level job

2. I can stay with this job for another 7 months so I reach a full year of employment, save up money. By April, see if I can get marketing work on the side or have my employer give me more projects so that I can have more to talk about during interviews. Much of this job is a waste because it’s catered towards this niche EDA industry that I have no intentions of working in for long. So I wouldn't use a lot of the industry insights that I'd be gaining from this job.

3. Pursue another field either before or by the time I reach my full year with this silly job.


*More about 3.* 

So, I’m open to career suggestions. I don’t think I should jump into any additional schooling because I am definitely not committed enough to a specific path to do that. I'd be willing to take a massive paycut, get paid at least around $45k, work 40 hours or less, and get an entry-level job that gives me some solid transferable skills. I also have ADHD-pi so it’d be nice if I had a job where I did different things every day. I don't need to love my job, I just can't hate it. I am not my career. I just need something that works more with my life and it'd be a big plus if it was meaningful work. When I say meaningful, I mean more directly beneficial towards society. My company is just one EDA company, all of them redundently compete with one another, and speeding up the manufacturing of computer hardware is more of a neutral (or unknown) effect on society. In my mind, speeding up tech is more ethically ambiguous than working for an affordable housing nonprofit. Not to judge anyone that does work in tech :)


As you can see from my profile/bio below, I am all across the board. I'm mostly looking for practical suggestions that are relevant to my sitatuation, i.e. *how could I leverage this computer engineering degree despite the fact that I dread technical work, are there any paths that I may not have considered, etc.*


It's ultimately up to me when it comes to pursuing a distinct career path. But, if you see my interests, get a read on my personality and you think you may know of a field that would be compatible, feel free to suggest anything!

Thank you for reading :)

Edit: While I do have experience with hard skills like programming, hardware engineering, I should clarify that I am certainly not proficient in those things. The most tangible skills I got out of my computer engineering degree are analytical problem solving skills and the ability to learn. It's been less than a year since I graduated and I've already forgotten most of the programming languages that I once knew. The ability to program is still there, but very little actual knowledge."
d05ejl,13,2019-09-05,"Are there any ""alternative schools/education"" in India?",MiltonWatterson,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d05ejl/are_there_any_alternative_schoolseducation_in/,"I'm an American of Indian origin. I was born, grew up, and went to public school in the U.S. I had issues with some of the schools. I often felt my time was being wasted, and I ended up teaching myself everything - the value-added of 9 out of 10 of my teachers was close to zero. At one point, I unsuccessfully attempted to persuade my parents to allow me to drop out of high school, get a GED (equivalent of 12th exam), and learn a trade (e.g. carpentry/plumbing).

Nevertheless, I've done pretty well for myself. In the American education system, you get second (and third and fourth) chances. There's opportunities in a variety of fields. Access to opportunities is not determined by centralized examination systems, which, in my view, seem to create a race-to-the-bottom. There is rigidity in some aspects of American education, but if you're independent, and can think out of the box, you can find ways to get around the rigidity.

The Indian education system seems like the Cold War. Instead of the USSR and US wasting resources on nuclear weapons, proxy wars, and oversized defense budgets, you have millions of students wasting their youth studying for mentally draining exams through which they learn little which improves their future productivity. Their mental health suffers immensely, and they often have stunted social development. Creative, independent-thinking kids get natural curiosity stamped out of them by parents and society which punishes deviation from *the single path* to a good life.

I see the suffering and hopelessness second-hand in some of my cousins in India, and I wonder what my life would have been like if I was born in India. There were crossroads in my parents' lives where they were considering moving back to India, so I could easily have been raised or even born in India. There are things I prefer about India to the U.S., but knowing my personality, I think I would have been made miserable by the Indian education system.

Something I've begun to think about is whether there are any potential alternative tracks for Indian students who have support from their parents in pursuing those alternative tracks. In particular, since the market for many goods and services is global, a well-trained but *poorly certified* Indian student should be capable with high probability of achieving a significant income through a freelancing career, or by starting his/her own business. So, if you could convince some group of parents to agree, there should be scope for secondary schooling which looks something like this:

- Classes whose material is determined by what is useful for students for developing an independent career
- Explicit teaching of *soft skills* which (I think) are largely ignored by standard Indian education: e.g. communication ability, interviewing, networking, creating a website, writing effective proposals on freelancing platforms
- Teaching of basics like mathematics, reading, writing, history, etc., but with partial or complete ignorance of teaching to the standardized 10th/12th exams, and a great emphasis on developing critical thinking skills.
- Partnership with firms and small businesses to create apprenticeship-type positions, and communication with the firms to understand their needs so that students are well-prepared for those internships
- Teaching of financial prudence, saving, investing, etc.
- Teaching of the laws, regulations, and practicalities of the Indian business environment

This type of model would work for some kinds of potential professions, but not all professions. You could be a programmer, statistician, graphic designer, or a garments exporter, but you couldn't join a profession which requires certification: doctor, chartered accountant, engineer. However, it seems reasonable to me that you could take an average to decent student at the age of 13, remove all the wasted time/resources in education, and in 5-7 years, created a fully capable freelancer/entrepreneur making decent money.

**Questions**

- Are there any such schools/initiatives/forms of education already out there in India similar to what I described?
- Have you met parents (or are you a parent) who strike you as being potentially amenable to such a system?
- What flaws/concerns would you have with the viability of such a system?"

Decided research is not my thing and ditched plans to do a PhD. I plan to take the A+ exams in a couple months. Then study for network+. Afterwards considering linux+, CCNA, or AWS. And I’ve also been learning python and plan to complete a couple practice projects. 

As a potential MS student who is open to different IT career paths, would you guys recommend starting at a help desk full time or going for a path specific internship (network engineer internship, sys admin internship, ect.)? I also need to pay my bills, rent, and function as an adult. I am open to networking, cloud, sys admin, and data analytics. But I’m open to other fields as well. They all interest me.

I feel like a help desk, despite being a 20-30% paycut would most likely be full time with benefits which is great. And I wouldn’t have to move temporarily to another state and worry about that. Plus I’m in an area with a solid market. The con is I would have to take a larger risk of being stuck at help desk in the long term and I may be in a stressful environment. Also it may be daunting to do several jumps over many years from help desk up to where I may want to be, and time is running out for me. 

An internship during MS would be more field specific and more likely to get me more directly where I want to be. Saves time and reduces uncertainty. But a lot of internships are part time, seasonal, or both. And a lot of them are out of state. I have very few people left in my life or really any money to move. 

Or I was thinking I can try to pull a gutsy move and work fulltime at a help desk for a year, quit for a summer internship, then yolo it until I finish the MS. And literally not give a shit. Because I feel like even though I don’t have much to lose, I have so little I’m strongly attached to what little I have left.

Or should I just play it safe, stay at my job, head towards my mostly guaranteed promotion to $50-55k/yr, and just finish an MS, then figure out my path from there when I have more money saved up and be in a financially better position to bounce around? Maybe by then I’ll lose everyone and everything in my life and I’ll be emboldened to take massive risks."

I seem to be in a situation. Will try to keep it short. For reference, I'm a 21 y.o guy.

I haven't visited my home country in 6/7 years (while the rest of my family has gone last year). There is a wedding coming up for my cousin. The eldest son of one of my uncles is getting married so its kinda a big deal for us.

Thing is, wedding is in December. I got an internship that has a high chance of giving me a job offer by then (December). I can only take 4 days off and id need way more than 4 days for the wedding. On top of that tickets get expensive for that time of the year so it wouldn't be worth if I went for less than 4 days.

My parents *really* want me to go. They said ""you can find jobs once you're back.""

What should I do? I need to decide in the next week or 2 since tickets will get more and more expensive"

Terrible idea?",closet_tomboy,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d08c44/ive_been_unemployed_for_three_years_now_ive_been/,"I'm a self-taught developer who was hired at a very small local agency back in 2015.  It was a risky move for my boss, given I didn't have a portfolio or previous work history, but I proved myself worthy pretty quickly and went from being paid basically nothing to a proper salary in only a few months.  

Unfortunately, and partly because of that salary increase, the company went belly up just 11 months later and I was laid off.  Now, I saved up every penny I earned from that place because I knew it was quite possible the company would go under, so my nest egg has kept me going since I was laid off.  At first I did some job-hunting, but quickly lost hope because of the lack of jobs in the area and the fact that I seemed to fail getting past the HR firewall.  So, I mostly gave up. 

Fast forward to now, the money is mostly gone and I'm back to looking for full time work with more urgency. 

Today I was offered an unpaid internship at a local company who ""is looking to test someone for possible full time employment in the future.""    I'm honestly considering it given it might buff up my resume and possibly  land me a job, but it's all speculative, and it could very possible be a waste of time and energy that I can't afford right now.  

It is for a small e-commerce site on shopify.  

I'm considering two options, so please tell me what you think:
1) I offer to do contract work for them at an appropriate hourly rate rather than take an internship

or

2) I offer to take the internship unpaid with the condition that I be hired or released within a month after start based on performance

Or, should I just back out and keep looking elsewhere and build my portfolio?

EDIT:  I put ""unemployed"" in quotes becuase I have been making money on the side doing smaller projects and NDA-covered stuff, so my portfolio is still very sparse, and I think most employers aren't even willing to give me a chance because of the appearance of my resume"

Now that I'm home, I'm starting a new job as a developer, I have been a little rusty, I'm not very good at memorizing language syntax. I do well enough during interviews but when it's the long game I usually go back and forth on google to refresh my memory if it's been a while. 

I'd describe my programming style as persistent, what I mean by that is I have a mentality to get a problem done and then focus on the clean-up of the code. Most times I'll start by writing spaghetti code to drive my project and then I'll lean back on my programming principles. The reason I say this is because there are so many things to consider everytime you write a functioning piece of code, such as, complexity ( space and time ), succintness of code, commenting, portability, testing, structure, abstraction, modularization, OOP, edge cases ( big pain point for me sometimes you dont know all the edge cases and even the technical lead might not know all of them, how do people think of every case possible ), debugging ( another pain point some debugging things are specific to frameworks and languages and have no documentation online on how to fix them, specifically errors that are not very descriptive about where the error started, I can fix these but I've noticed it takes me more time, how do I speed up) , languages, frameworks, exception handling, concurrency, async, etc. 

So what I do is I try to focus on the pathway from beginning to end in pieces just to validate that I can do the task and then once I've created that code, I then check off all these other criteria. I know this is not ideal and I need to improve my ways. Is there some sort of mentality shift that I require to start thinking like a regular programmer.

From my time so far in the industry, problems havent required elaborate graphing, tree, or other algorithms. It's mostly been hash maps, arrays, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. Also, I'm more on the cloud side of things, developing Platforms as a service (PAAS), been working with linux, unix, python, javascript, java, elixir. 

So I am starting work and I want to know how to set myself up for success. I am having flashbacks of my internship, mind you I did well during my internship, was one of the top interns. Yet I was always stressed felt overworked and I felt like I was doing more work than I needed to. Another top intern was just breezing through things, he would push his ideas around and argue about what the correct way of doing things was. He often had deeper insights and spent less time developing. How do I reach this level?

Essentially how do I cut my development time and be more efficient, I would like to use my additional time for other things. Also I dont want my work life to creep into my free time. 

Also how do programmers stay current with all the version changes, and the updates to new software and all the new software releases and new features and the best ones for industry purposes."

This seems a bit unsafe to be, how would I know that the other domain hasn't been compromised and won't send me resources with malware on it? Is there a way to make it safer, or should I just disable it?

I've finally started compiling a list of colleges I should apply to. As a result, I have started to look at my stats more critically and because of that, I've started to feel that I shouldn't even consider applying to Ivy League universities.

I want to major either in Neuroscience or Environmental Science. I haven't decided yet. Anyway, here are my stats:

Academic Stats:

ACT: 35 (35/34/36/35) + 9 in Writing

IELTS: 109 (the problem is I had a 26 in one of the sections and that might not fair awfully well for me)

SAT Subject Tests: 790 in Chemistry, 780 in Bio M, 800 in Maths II

Class XII, CBSE: 96.7% (10/~350) 

Class XI: 78.7% (this is a big concern for me but the good thing is that I came third in my class and that's mentioned by the counselor)

Class X: 9.8 CGPA

Class IX: 9.2 CGPA

Extracurricular activities:

• Sadly no sports. This may be a problem for me. Although I was fairly good at soccer,and I even tried out for my school when I was in Grade 9, I didn't get selected. From Class X onwards, an exostosis (basically a bony outgrowth) in my knee made it really difficult for me to participate in sports since it would start paining really badly if I ran for more than a minute.

• I participated in a big STEM competition and my team ended up winning the national award. I also mentored two team the following year.

• I got a national silver medal in an international olympiad for Chemistry.

• I was a part of my school's editorial team.

• I was also a School prefect for two years.

• I recently interned in a think-tank this year and I published a research paper about fossil fuels.

• I have been shadowing in a hospital recurringly for the last two years (not sure how this will help me considering I don't want to go into pre-med).

• I'm going to do an internship in a biomedical research lab in October.

• I've gone to some pretty amazing lectures and exhibitions in the STEM field but I wasn't really in a leading role in any of them so I'm not sure if it matters.

Community service:

• i have a three-year long community service project that relates to senior citizens and how we can assist them. This project spans 8 cities and 25 people. I have a blog and a website too and we have helped in organising medical camps, eye-checkups, tech-literacy seminars etc. for senior citizens.

• I have been lucky enough to organise a few plantation drives in 3 cities. I have also documented my whole process in a blog.

• This is a very minor one but I've been involved in organising cultural functions and events in multiple cities and schools.

Other admission stuff:

• Recommendations: I have a counselor recommendation, two teacher recommendations and I've also emailed my research supervisor requesting her to write me a recommendation too.
The teacher and counselor recommendation are pretty by the number but I'm thankful that there isn't anything that might be construed as negative in them. I had a pretty good rapport with all the teachers in my school and that shows in my recommendations.

• Essays: I'm still working on them as of now. I have drafted seven different essays and I'm just making sure that everything is fine with them and I'm refining them every opportunity I get.

• Aid: My parents and relatives have assured me that if I get into a good school, they'll take care of the fee no matter how high it is. I'm planning to apply for aid in some universities but not all but I'm not even sure if that's even possible.

Right now, the most 'prestigious' university I'm thinking of applying to in the US is UC Berkeley because I'm not sure if I have the stats to aim higher."

I'm not the best person to talk to about job searching but what's been easy for me is to always have a job-even if it's a part time retail job or low level hourly job somewhere to have something to about to on my resume.

Everyone wants a career job right from the gate and while some people do get a good paying job right out of college, a lot of people don't.

Apply to metro areas other than your home town. You'll eventually exhaust the list of companies in your hometown if all you do is apply there.

Make recruiters your friends. Invite them to coffee or lunch, talk about them and their company and in return they'll get to know about you and your skills and maybe invite you for an interview (I've had this happen once).

If you can't find a full time job in your field the best thing you can do is find a full time job not in your field in an hourly capacity-retail, low level office jobs, etc just to get you by and work on projects in your field to show that you're serious about it (and have some money coming in as well, this also doesn't hurt).

There are jobs out there, a lot of people don't want to suck up their pride to get one if they have a degree but have to work a low level job to get them where they want to go. Also many companies do internships as well for recent grads but you just have to find the right firm and BE WILLING TO MOVE.

My cousin was looking for a job for the longest time in California and had to move to Chicago where he eventually found work in two months after looking in CA for about five or six.

TL;DR-Hopefully some helpful tips about how to go about looking for a job. Employers want to hire people who are in action rather than not in action.

Edit: Also tailor your resume to meet the needs of that employer and cover letter rather than talking about yourself. In an interview sell yourself on how you can benefit them."

d0jdkq,1,2019-09-06,Finish Certificate Program and Learn Programming /Web Mapping on My own or Drop Out and Still do the Latter?,OG_Milk,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/d0jdkq/finish_certificate_program_and_learn_programming/,"Hi All,

I have two classes left to complete a graduate certificate program in geospatial science. Thing is, the courses are expensive and the program is more focused on geographic information science and theory and I've since become much more interested in geospatial programming and web development. This interest got started during the summer when I took an internship position with my state government and they let me pretty much do whatever was interesting to me. I figured since my program had no real programming courses (outside of database stuff) I would take the opportunity to learn it on my own and went through a free online course that Penn State Offered while I worked on various projects at the internship. This then lead to me picking up R to do a different project and before I knew it I had spent the entire summer coding and I liked it a lot. Classes have now started again and I can't focus, I find it boring and wish I was spending my time going through the rest of Penn States free online courses on Geospatial Programming and Web Development (the entire program is posted online for free) . I can still do the course in my spare time, but between school and work I find it hard to get around to. If I drop out now I can get my money back for these two courses and focus on what I really want to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The only upside I can think of for finishing the program is maybe finding a slightly better paying job and look more professional if I finish up the certificate program (also I'll save face with family and friends, though that's not really a huge concern of mine). 

What do you think? Should I finish these last two classes, or save some money and focus more on what I want to do?"

I'm currently a Junior in university majoring in Computer Science and am planning to apply for Summer 2020 internships somewhat soon. This past summer I spent the majority of my time working on a couple projects that I plan to present on my resume, but the trade-off is that I didn't set aside much time for interview prep. I did take a variety of CS courses already, including Data Structures &amp; Algorithms, but still didn't do much side prep. (CTCI, LeetCode, readings, etc..).

With that being said, does it still make sense to apply sooner than later for these internships? I personally believe that I should just sent out the applications, prep. as much as I can in the next few weeks, and hope for the best, but I still wanted to get some opinions.

I noticed I have an easier time keeping a job if I go to therapy at the same time. Here is a breakdown of my tenure at jobs from 2008 through 2017 (before my father's death)-

Amusement park job - 3.5 years (I liked this one a lot but a family member convinced me to quit. I made various people pretty damn mad here though, but I got along with others very well. I was able to speak my mind here freely which I haven't been able to do at other jobs).

Seasonal cashier job - 1 month (I got the feeling my manager didn't like me on day one and at the end of the month he said I wasn't a culture fit).

Fast food job - 1 week (Half me getting fired and half me quitting).

Cashier job - 1.5 years (This one was pretty good, my co-workers were mad at me for leaving).

Shift manager job - 8 months (I just wasn't good at the job, but I tried really hard).

An internship while I was at the 1.5 year long cashier job - This one was fine, but I basically got told my work was sub-par.

Another internship just doing random administrative tasks for a few months - This one was fine, she didn't want me to leave, but I didn't do much.

A help desk job for 2 months as a contractor - This one was great. I worked there for a month and then they called me back to do another month. I basically got on well with everyone. This was where I went to college.

An analyst job for 2 years as a contractor (I did therapy during this time as well) - This one was okay. I worked with some rude people but overall the job was fine and paid well. I did get very sick working here though, several health problems emerged.

A help desk job for 4 months as a contractor - Neither me or my co-workers knew what they were doing so I think they just kept the popular people. I was fired four days after my dad died.

After he died, things got shitty.

I moved to Austin and took another help desk job. I got abused a good deal. Verbally harassed, made fun of for what I brought to lunch to eat or what I ate for breakfast, made fun of for how I smelled (starting at that help desk job I developed a bad odor, which I think is under control now). made fun of for how I walked, had my lunch tampered with and drugs mixed in (if I'm being honest, based on my fast heartbeat and issues after eating one day). I didn't feel safe here. My high anxiety while working probably made my odor worse. On top of that, it appeared that my car was getting vandalized while at work and so I had harassed the police department on the phone multiple times because they weren't doing anything about it. I'm talking key scratches all the way around the perimeter of my car among other damages. My life was also threatened while working here and several other shitty things happened such as a coworker playing beheading videos in the bathroom and other shit I am not even going to get into.

Other jobs -

Working data entry at a bank - More harassment and verbal bullying toward me and a girl who became friends there. Fired only 2 weeks after the job started and I was good at this. All you had to do was data entry and balance. The middle aged women here couldn't stand me.

The last one was working as a dispatcher for 4 months. This one was fine, but this 18 year old wanted me out so I extrapolated my experience from Austin and was just didn't want to experience that again and left.

While I was in Austin, I'm pretty sure I made the cops hate me. When I was accused of a crime I didn't commit, I got sent to jail until a relative of mine was able to post bail and while I was there I was sent to the floor where people who have been to jail before go and I hadn't ever been there. On top of that, I have photos of conversations with people who I can't prove are linked to the cops there, who said they were glad I went to jail. The guy who sent me to jail was jealous that I cheated on him, basically. I got into a relationship with a guy from another country because I was desperate.  I was dating around a lot there but I let a few good potential partners fall through my fingers so I settled on him and it was the wrong decision.

I have to go back to Austin in a week to see a doctor down there. And I'm job searching, again, story of my life.

When I think about that city (Austin) I have a lot of negative memories. I lived on the north side which is basically the country side for all intensive purposes.  If you want the real experience, you need to live on the south side. People were really keen about flaunting their intelligence in your face for no reason.  When I moved into my apartment, the woman who lived right beside me was getting evicted and was hounding the people who lived across from her for letting her kids be so loud, play on the stairwell and curse all the time, and lo and behold, someone from that household threw some breakable shit at my door in the middle of the night.

I try to reconcile these experiences sometimes to try and figure out why my experience here was so shitty in some very serious aspects.  On the other hand, I did have some great dates and some good short situation-ships.  I wouldn't call any of what I experienced a true relationship. But yeah, I met some really cool people. And if my decisions had been slightly different, I could have really snagged someone up for a good relationship. I got to party, something I don't do in Dallas, and I generally felt more free.  Partying was fun, drinking was fun, going out was fun, dancing was fun. That part of it was enjoyable and fun but the lows were so damn low. 

I have been applying for so many jobs and even ones I am for sure, without a shadow of a doubt good for will not come through for me and it doesn't make sense. I've had better luck after taking a class on getting employment but the search is still sucking and not bearing much fruit. The felon that my mom is dating just makes me sick. He can't get a job anywhere, so he sells metal and mows lawns and does random house mechanic-type work for people. There is honestly so many things wrong with him, I cannot even start. But the living situation with him and her gets worse by the day to the point where I'm trying to figure out how little I need from a job to live on my own.

Oh yeah, something else about Austin. I got death threats through dating apps as well, which doesn't happen in Dallas either, and they were scary, like all the threats I got were actually scary, they aren't like they are here where it's manageable to me.  People in Dallas are nicer, but I also have no life here.

Anyway, I haven't applied to any jobs in Austin. And I thought since I'm going to be there in a week anyway, why not apply for some jobs in north Austin? The thought almost turns my stomach a little bit but I honestly don't know what to do.  Living out there is so expensive, I don't think I would be able to forward even going out to eat this time around.  I would probably just do the free stuff which kinda makes me sad but I'm just kinda desperate.

If I do have to move back out there, I guess the changes I would make would be the following: I wouldn't call the cops ever, for anything. I already have a therapist, so that's different. And I probably wouldn't let anyone move in with me like I did last time. I just really do need advice. 

I have applied for jobs in other states but the require me go and interview which I cannot even afford. I'm also kinda scared that someone I angered (for good reason or no good reason) in Austin will try and get revenge on me somehow. I really did no one wrong, the worst they could be mad at me for is saying something mean or not wanting to be with them."

d0lgez,6,2019-09-06,Where exactly do I stand on the learning staircase? What do I do next?,parth2480,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/d0lgez/where_exactly_do_i_stand_on_the_learning/,"Hey r/learnpython,

I have been exposed to python for about 2 years now but I'm not sure how much I actually know in regards to getting a job as a developer.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr I know a lot of things at a very basic level but how do I take my knowledge to a level which is acceptable in industry.

&amp;#x200B;

I got taught python when I started university so that we could have more professional graphs for our lab reports. We got taught the basics like loops, conditionals, slicing, functions, scipy for data analysis and matplotlib for graphs then it was object-oriented programming for an assignment.

I applied to about 20 summer internships for software engineering mainly but got rejected by all of them. Just before summer began I applied to a company as a last-ditch effort where it was mainly cleaning data but it still used python and I got it (they didn't have any other applicants).

I've been working part-time for the last 2 and a half months and I did some web scraping with beautiful soup. Then it turned out that the company names we needed from the scraping would need to be extracted from google searches and so I read some blogs and copied their code on natural language processing to help me. Now I'm automating some Tableau workbooks which has xml manipulation. Through all of this, I learned a lot but it was still just me using for loops and pandas.

I've built a basic website for a friends ebay business to learn django but it was never deployed (it just linked the product to the relevant ebay page) since it didn't compare to professional level websites you see normally. I'm doing a data science course on Coursera ( [https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) ) but it doesn't really explain much and just tells you to use this function because it does what you want. I still understand it since I've coded for this long and the data analysis makes sense because I'm studying Physics.

Sure my CV can now say NLP, machine learning, Tableau, SQL, data analysis but my knowledge is shallow. Heck, I didn't know what a dictionary was a year and a half after learning python.

So what can I do to cement my foundations and expand what I know? What will help me get a job when I graduate next year? I want to either end up in data science or software engineering but I'm leaning more towards software engineering."
d0llx8,1,2019-09-06,Advice on ways to make my life work and jobs?,Idontknowhowtobeanon,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d0llx8/advice_on_ways_to_make_my_life_work_and_jobs/,"Ok, so there's a bit of explanation to this.

1. I am a recent grad from a reputable school with a B.S.M.E.
2. I am trying to move to Dallas to live with my fiancee and currently living in another city/state with my parents
3. I had a so-so GPA (2.9/4) and have gotten zero response on job applications for the past 10-12 months, despite having an internship and using recruiters and job boards and references and friends of friends etc.
4. Student loan dept comes due in Nov.
5. I feel extremely guilty for not having a job, I can't afford to get my own place right now, and I'm somewhat crowded by my parents and older brother currently
6. I want to save money, pay off debt, and get myself financially stable ASAP (pro-staying+working with parents)

I have the following options:

1. Stay with my parents until next August at which point my fiancee should get a raise and I can move in with her to continue my job search in Dallas. (assuming I still haven't found something near her
   1. This likely involves trying to work in HVAC (not what I want to do or get trapped in) for a company which formerly employed me as a laborer but might take me as an assistant engineer.
   2. HVAC has a reputation for being difficult to transfer out of after working as an engineer, so I'm worried about essentially unusable experience and facing the same issue as I have now when I do want to move.
2. Move to Indiana and pursue employment with the company that I had my internship with in manufacturing
   1. I don't know how long this would last.
3. Move to Dallas now and take a job doing whatever I can and largely burden my fiancee
4. Significantly broaden my search and possibly find work away from everyone I know and love but gain money and some personal freedom (from parents).
5. Things y'all can suggest?

What would you do in my situation? What did you do in your own, similar situation?"
d0lzze,3,2019-09-06,TIFU by locking my keys in my car,onlyhereforfoodporn,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/d0lzze/tifu_by_locking_my_keys_in_my_car/,"On my phone, forgive the format. This did happen today. Luckily 6 hours later, I can now laugh about it.

So I am a busy grad student with four part-time jobs. I teach yoga and barre at a yoga studio, I am a TA for a class, I have an internship at my university, and I work at a cidery 1-2x a month. So this morning I taught barre at 10am and I had my internship at noon. I changed into my work clothes at the studio and I was in a rush so I didn't think to take my keys and phone out of my purse when I was loading everything into my car (I had my backpack in there since Fridays are slow and I can usually do some homework at my internship, bag with change of clothes, and purse). I put my purse and bag of clothes in the backseat. I have a supposed smart key which is supposed to keep me from doing dumbass stuff like locking myself out. My car is supposed to sense when the key is in the car and when it is not (also, don't buy a Ford).
I hear an unlocking sound (it wasn't) and shut the backseat door. Without grabbing my keys or phone. I try to open the driver's door and realize I fucking locked myself out. At this point, I have to remind myself that I'm in a safe location, I'm close to the bus line if I need to bus to work, and I'm at my studio where someone could also give me a ride 1.5 miles down the road to work. But at the same time I am freaking out because I have quite literally nothing. My phone is in my car. My wallet is in my car. My laptop and books are in the car. AND MY KEYS ARE LOCKED IN THERE.
So I walk back into the studio and try to laugh with my friends and the other teachers there about this situation. Luckily everyone has had a similar situation, offers to drive me to work. One of the teachers suggests that I call the dealership and see if they can unlock the door.
Well, I call the dealership (they've been dicks to be so many times since I bought the car) and they suggest towing it to the dealership, tell me it's $200 to tow and then “they’ll quote me” how much to break in. Well that’s not going to work. I took out 8k in loans for this semester, I previously worked in a public service job between undergrad where I was paid a stipend and starting my master’s. I live two miles from the yoga studio and I have my spare key at home but my house keys are on my car key ring and locked in the car. I call my partner and see if he can get the car key and help me out. 

This would seem easy but he works at a military base in a phone free area. I have his cell memorized but not his extension at work. I try calling the base...lol automated message and no prompts to get into the director. I leave him a message and tell him to call the studio landline when he can. 

I call my supervisor and explain what happened. Luckily she’s super chill and so are my coworkers. One of the teachers from my studio gives me a ride to the office and I’m only 10ish minutes late. But our university requires duo authentication so I legit can’t get on my email, class websites, or anything. So I wander around the building, bother coworkers, and read our marketing pamphlets. 

Around 2:30 I get a hold of my partner. He gets the spare key from our apartment and takes the bus to the studio and picks up my car. BUT THERE IS A HOME FOOTBALL GAME AND TRAFFIC SUCKS. Lolol

At 3:30 he gets to my building and gives me my stuff. I’ve never been so relieved to have my backpack and purse. My shift ends at 4. At least I was productive for half an hour. 

TL;DR I put my purse in the backseat with my dirty workout clothes bag and didn't take my keys out of my purse before shutting the door and then trying to open the driver side door. Yay automatic locks and smartkeys that aren't smart."

My name is Ryan Schnepfe, a senior computer game design student at George Mason University. A part of my graduation requirement is to have an internship. For the last few years I have actively been looking for one, but between years old listings on google’s classifieds and a lot of general “design” internships, it’s getting hard to look for them. 

Is there a central place like GrackleHQ where industry internship opportunities are catalogued?

How much do they teach you and what are you fully expected to understand before coming? Also if and when do they drug test? Any information or advice would be greatly appreciated thank you."

d0n3cu,1,2019-09-06,Fresh out of college and can't find a job,KevineCove,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d0n3cu/fresh_out_of_college_and_cant_find_a_job/,"I graduated this past May and have been looking for a job ever since. I've gone to numerous places to ask for advice, and have gotten lots of conflicting advice and general rudeness (this is a big reason I'm posting here, rather than some sub specifically for career advice.)

A bit about me - I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science from University of Michigan. I finished with a GPA of 3.3, which some people seem to say is good and others seem to say is bad enough to warrant me pulling it from my resume entirely. I never had an internship while at University, which is probably hurting me a lot. All of my professional experience comes from working as a massage therapist, which offers virtually no transferable skills (although most people tell me not to list soft skills on a resume anyway.)

The only projects in my field that I've done not related to coursework have been games, although I'm not looking for game development positions so I think this makes my resume unappealing to most employers. Most of my earlier projects are also in Flash, which means it's impossible for me to assemble an online portfolio if someone were to look at my work.

As far as actual abilities, I consider myself an average programmer. U-M gave me an abysmal quality of education, and between that and my own abilities, I can do okay when coding for an interview, but I won't stand out among other applicants.

Some of the places I've gone for help so far:

* University Career Services: I was able to get someone to help polish up my resume, but the person that helped me had no experience in my field, so while things like formatting and wording might be good, I have no idea how it looks to someone that's hiring in the industry.
* Various online resume drops: People are mostly telling me to push things back and forth, to include or exclude extracurricular activities, to change the order of this or that. I've improved my resume a lot but at this point it seems like I'm splitting hairs.
* Handshake/LinkedIn/Glassdoor: I've applied to most positions through these sites, and I've run into some common problems on here. A lot of employers are asking for expertise in technologies I don't have. Even sorting for entry level positions, most results say they require 3/5/8+ years of experience.

So far the only calls back I've gotten have been for people in IT, offering jobs like help desk, tech support, quality assurance, etc. - nothing that utilizes my skill set or will help my professional development. And of the calls I've gotten, I've yet to actually get an offer after an interview. Most people I talk to have told me that unless my job involves programming, it's not likely to make me an appealing candidate for future positions, so it looks like landing those jobs wouldn't even be that great to begin with.

My sister tells me that my credentials are mostly unimportant, and that I need to network with people and get others to recommend me. The problem is that I have very few connections to people in the field. I was in a game development club, but didn't like the people in it and had very little contact with them. The same is largely true for my classmates. Of those that I am in contact with, none are in my area.

I've had a few people tell me that I just need to self-study, learn new languages and frameworks, and put them up on my GitHub. This seems tenuous at best. Depending on the scope of the project, I might be looking at a gigantic time investment to put on a page that employers might not even be looking at, or whose specifics might only interest a minority of employers.

This is all extremely discouraging as MOST people have been telling me things like there's a good job market right now,, I come from a good school and have a good GPA, I'm in an area where tech jobs are in demand, etc. It feels like everything around me is telling me that there's something wrong or unappealing about me as an employee, and that I'm just not wanted."

I've been working some random part time jobs but no internships. 

I realized recently that I'm not interested in my future and don't particularly feel like aiming for much. I'd actually be really damn happy with a random minimum wage job as long as I get to enjoy my hobbies outside of work and hang out with friends and family. I still plan on finishing college to not let down my dad so the obvious answer here would be to just shut up and aim for a good job afterwards but I really don't think I want to.

Am I just being an ungrateful, lazy child that should suck it up? Should I just do whatever makes myself happy? Is there some kind of fulfillment I'm gonna block myself from if I don't aim higher for a higher difficulty? Isn't it fine living without that fulfillment as long as I can enjoy my everyday, boring life in my own way?"

I’m finally getting involved in research this semester (late to the party, I know) and I can wait a year or two until my work is published and include it in an application to a better MS program. I can also pay down my student loans. I also, you know, have an offer *in hand* and who knows if I can get another one in a year.


**Reasons to stay:**

My advisor...advised me to stay and finish my MS because while Case isn’t particularly highly ranked, the difference between us and a better school is much more pronounced in the PhD program than the MS program, in his opinion. Also, he recommended minimizing the number of context switches I engage in, i.e. going into industry, going back to school, going back to industry in the span of 3-4 years. Also, the job opportunities I really want are probably only available if I have at least an MS.

What should I do?"

d0q0qu,1,2019-09-06,Soon to be grad seeking advice,AlpacaOnMars,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/d0q0qu/soon_to_be_grad_seeking_advice/,"Hey guys,

I'm trying to start preparing for applying to full-time jobs, and I can't really decide if I want to go more down the embedded or pure software path. I live in Seattle, so software is more prevalent here (and higher paying). However, there are still a decent amount of well-paying embedded software jobs as well. Plus I’m pretty sure embedded/FPGA has a lot more job security and you don’t have to learn a new JavaScript framework every 2 seconds.

In school, I really enjoyed my FPGA/Embedded courses. I also really liked my Data Structures and Algorithms class, and my favorite programming language is Java. The projects I made in my embedded systems course (a Bluetooth controlled RC car), have been way cooler than the CS courses. Favorite HDL is SystemVerilog. Which is more enjoyable in the real world? Making devices like heartbeat monitors, electric toothbrushes, sound more exciting than making stuff for AWS. But it pays less than software jobs here at the Big 4. I'm also scared that if I enter software, I can't go back to being a EE.

My past internships have nothing to do with either. I didn't find my love for coding until recently. I had one internship doing analog circuit design with Altium (hated it), and another doing MATLAB/Simulink development for a major commercial aircraft manufacturer.

I might also consider adding in FPGA work to the mix. Can any EEs who were debating between software and embedded/FPGA give me any advice?"
d0qz6h,88,2019-09-06,Mid career advice for an ML generalist?,maxmoo,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/,"I’ve been working as a data scientist / ml engineer for around 6 years now (post math PhD) and I’m a bit stuck as to where to go next.

Brief summary of my experience:

* 6 months internship data scientist at a startup
* 4 years data analyst/data scientist at a mid size tech company
* 1 year machine learning team lead at a startup
* 1 year backend engineer at a recently acquired and now large tech company which I’m trying to get out of

Problem is, my experience is a bit scattered and my career goals are to maximise my salary before the tech bubble bursts lol.

* my engineering experience is only “level 4” by big tech standards due to lack of large scale cross-team projects, (which is hard on my ego due to the fact that I’m quite a bit older thanks to grad school)
* I don’t have enough leadership experience for most manager jobs (and I’m not sure I want to be a pure manager)
* I can’t get a senior DS job since I seem to always fumble stats questions, maybe due to never studying it formally ... I know I can work things out as I need them, but I don’t know what the “right” answers are in interviews. 

My favourite job by far was at the startup which was a great mix of management, DS and engineering, so part of me just wants to try and find another good startup. But I also want to invest wisely in my career.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to take some stats courses and/or stick it out in big tech backend engineering to “level up”? Or do I have enough experience already to make it as a generalist in a startup or consulting?"
d0sut2,2,2019-09-07,"Need suggestions for improving the profile, planning to apply next year, Computer Science Masters",pranaypranaypranay,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/d0sut2/need_suggestions_for_improving_the_profile/,"Hi, 

Recently I made a decision to go abroad for masters. During my undergrad, I never thought about higher education and focused solely on getting a well-paid job. 

Hence, I never gave enough time and efforts to build a good research profile. But, now as I am planning to apply for Fall 2021, I am going through the regret phase. 
Is there any way I can build a good profile in this 1 year of buffer time? 


Some info about me:


**Aim:**

From India, Looking for masters in computer science in the US with specialization in Data Science/ ML or AI 


**Past:**

(1) Have a bachelors in electrical engineering (2018 Graduate) from one of the top 5 engineering colleges in India (Pretty sure college does not matter for masters)

(2) CGPA - 7.9/10 :(

(3) No publications or research experience. 

(4) Grades in the computer science courses taken in Undergrad is not great (6.5/10). Even failed a course in CS (was busy with the final project and job preparation)

(5) 2 month R&amp;D Internship at MNC - ML project

(6) college final project, Related to data optimization 


**Current:**

1) IT professional working at a well paying MNC. 1 year of experience. The work is not great, but the pay is. 
Since the workload is less, I can take out enough time to study data science on my own and compete in hackathons.



I do have a decent self-acquired knowledge of Data Science. Recently I have been participating in data science hackathons and getting good ranks.
But I don't think this will be in any way sufficient for convincing the master's programs of my eligibility. 

Since I have about 1 year of time before I start applying to colleges, What do you suggest can be done to improve my profile at this point? 



**Choices:**

1) Compete in hackathons and build a decent Kaggle profile

2) Contribute to an open-source project 

3) Apply for a part-time research assistant/ Internship profile at one of the top 10 universities in India (university in the same city so easier to work with professors ?). (long shot - publish a paper or at least a get a good LOR)

Personally, I have been thinking about (3) a lot. But do professors hand out (unpaid) internships to motivated working professionals? 

Thanks for going through the long post."

I’m an Indian female in the Midwest region (MI). My school is in a small white community. It doesn’t have the most resources and overall doesn’t have to most overachieving students. There are not a lot of opportunities for us to do crazy things like some other people (at least till now). Please keep that in mind when you’re reading my profile. Sorry for being so long. 

Here are my stats and activities

-35 ACT

-5 on APUSH, Lang, Psych and 4 on Bio 

-720 on both Math 2 and Bio M (retaking in Oct)

-Weighted 4.1 GPA (all As Junior year, one B Sophomore year and two Bs freshman year) 

-I have only taken the most rigorous classes at my school (all honors and AP and also online classes)

-I have college credits from summer college (got an A in the class)

—CoPresident of Philosophy club, VP of Model UN (local awards), President and founder of our Asian American Students Club, Mock Trial (1st place at regionals), Science Olympiad (placed 4th at regionals and moved on), leadership board of our diversity club (we created multiple projects with the support of the school to make our school more inclusive and accepting after some racial incidents), rowing (varsity coxswain-talking to most school I’m applying to for recruitment), Varsity color guard (but quit this year), The school newspaper (one of the best in the state) I have won multiple state and school journalism awards and scholarships. Working at a tutoring center for the past year and will do it for the rest of senior year. Volunteer at the VA hospital and am a lab assistant in a brain lab there.

-Past summer: Did an internship at Michigan Tech on a scholarship with sustainability and energy conservation (in the social sciences department). I also did a natural resources camp there on a scholarship. I did a 3 week program at Cornell and got college credit and a letter of rec. I went to a journalism workshop on a scholarship and was on the honors staff there.

-This year classes: AP Gov and AP Microecon (online), AP  Chem, AP Calc BC, Organic Chem, Engineering independent study (my partner and I are building a GPS tracker for bags at the moment), Honors Physics, AP Euro, newspaper (it’s a class as well), a medicine class. 

-Awards: multiple journalism scholarships and awards, mock Trial first place, rowing awards, science Olympiad fourth place, Michigan tech internship and camp scholarships, national french exam honorable mention, French honors award (region wide), NHS for honors (doesn’t really matter but thought I’d add it in). 

Letters of rec: are going to be really good got one from my AP Bio and Science Olympiad teacher and she really knows and loves me. Got one from my AP Lang teacher, and we are really good friends. Got one from a professor from my college course at Cornell.

Essays: My common app essay sounds exactly like me. It has a lot of voice, my personality, and growth. It also talks about English not being my first language and moving to the country when I was 9 and growing up around no Indians for a long time. But it’s not a sob story. It has funny bits and shows me growing as a person this past year. 

I’m going to be applying as an either Anthropology or Sociology or International Relations Major. Also, I am thinking of applying to ILR for Cornell. 

I’m applying ED to Cornell, EA to University of Michigan, RD to Brown and Amherst. These are the schools I’m most worried about. I know Cornell is an Ivy so it’s kind of a gamble but I’m just soooooo nervous. It’s my dream to go there! I have other match, reach, and safety schools, but it would be great if you could match me for any of these (especially Cornell). Thank you all!!!"
d0w2vk,2,2019-09-07,Moved back to old job,ComputerSezNo,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/d0w2vk/moved_back_to_old_job/,"So any advice from the helpful people on here. Sorry for the wall of text - but here goes (tl:dr at bottom);

Currently 25, started an IT internship as a technician in the education sector when I was 23 and was there for 18 months soaking up all I was taught as I had no prior IT experience and enjoyed working alongside my more senior co-workers. Commute was also perfect (10-15 mins one way in the car) and also the working hours were perfect.

My contract finished with that organisation and after I was told there was no permament position, I moved into an internal IT support position at the beginning of 2019 at a company slightly further away and although I was on more money, my commute also doubled in time - negating the bump in money to some effect. Was there for around 7 months and learning all sorts of things as it was a small department (2 support, 2 engineers) and a network manager/IT manager (who was a knob) for around 500 users approx. spread out in different locations. I was learning a lot but the place had massive office politics (as does every place tbh) but the workload was crazy - to the extent where everything was constantly being delegated and there were at times unreasonable expectations were put on our team - And that was only 3 months into the position. Despite that I enjoyed working with my co-workers and we just got on with things.

However a position opened back up at my old place (permanent position as a technician) with the same money that I was currently on and added responsibilities and looking through rose tinted glasses - I applied, got through to interview and got offered the position which I accepted. Handed in my notice and told them I was leaving which they didn't really kick up a fuss about. Now I was excited to be going back to my old place as its a much shorter commute and gives me a lot more free time and I have also been there for a month now. Since its education theres always budget constraints and not getting to play with the latest and greatest - which I did get to do at the other position to some extent. So I fear I will start to stagnate.

Now the question is - how long should I stay at this position before moving on?

TL:DR - did internship at 23 which was my first IT position which i enjoyed. Contract wasnt renewed so i moved into a private sector internal IT job - which had a ton of office politics and crazy workload. Was there for 7 months before a position opened up at old place and I got offered it - so went back."

It’s quite an expensive school but I have a scholarship that helps me save money. Money is a huge issue for many hopeful students who are trying to pursue an education. 

Let’s go back into my timeline, shall we? 

In high school, I had a 2.5 but I got into a public university. My parents were tight on money so I decided to go to CC. It’s close to my house, like a 5 min drive. I also had friends who were going too. My first year was rough, I failed a few classes. It was cause I was naive, I didn’t balance my schedule. I had friends who went to 4 year schools and invited me over to party. I feel into a deep depression (I don’t need sympathy). I decided to change my habits and study my ass off to achieve my Associates. I left CC with a 2.9 gpa and receive my associates. I did this by sacrificing my summer and taking classes to finish on time. 

I got into a Private 4 year University and decided to major in Sport Administration due to my passion in Soccer. I took a semester off to save more money and have a mental break. It was necessary because I really wanted to think about my goals in life. I wanted to be a scout but my path took me to somewhere greater. I got an internship with the New York Red Bull in event and operations (completely different than scouting lol). I learned so much about the professional job environment and made so many connections. They took a shot at me because of my passion, not really what was on paper. The point of an internship is to learn about the job environment, plus your supervisors and leaders get to learn about you. 

I was then offered a match day position and been with the operations department for about a year. I wanted more though, I wanted to continue to grow as professional. My advisor at Uni suggested to me that I apply for Madison Square Garden. It took me 3 months to achieve my internship there. One key value I learn is to be patient. I have such a tough time being anxious and worried about my future (it’s normal, I know I’m not the only one). My biggest take from this was, have a sense of communication. I asked questions that were critical thinking and showed my passion for the internship. But DONT BE ANNOYING. I try my best to be patient, I didn’t want to keep emailing every other day. Once a week is fine. 

I then went through 3 interviews and was offered a Front of House Operations Student Associate Internship. I was ecstatic, knowing my past, I was so proud of what I accomplished over the past 2 years. MSG saw that I worked hard over the last year. I volunteered with the NY Giants, NYC marathon, and ICC Championship. Volunteering looks so good on a resume, it shows how you’re willing to work for free for your passion. I showed to the interviewer my recommendations from my volunteering  and Red Bull internship (Use them as a leverage during an interview, it looks good! I promise!). 

I saved so much money and I got to think about what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. I’m leaving with a 3.7 GPA at my University due to my new study habits and time management.  My goal is to run events, this is fueled by my passion of sports and concerts. My first event at MSG will be Tyler, the creator (An artist I looked up to so much) looking at his past, he achieved so much for a kid that was once a shit head (just  like myself lol). Tyler showed the world that he can be taken seriously because of his craft and love for creating. I look up to him as a role model, because of his inspiration, it made me chase my dreams. My first Tyler show was back in 2015 during The Cherry Bomb era. Now, I’ll be working at his concert at the Worlds Famous Arena (plus more events and sports). 

My advise for you is, find your passion. And find people who have the same passion as you. I worked even harder when the people around are trying to chase the same dream. If you’re sad, depress, or just not having that pure energy. Meditate, yeah meditate. Clear your head, breathing exercises  helped me so much. DO YOUR RESEARCH. Look online, go on LinkedIn, Google, Forums, ANYTHING. Learn from others and see what you can do. I love feeling motivated by others. Learn about a professional on how they got from point A to point B, don’t just network for the job sake. 

Best of luck to anyone finding an internship, it can be hard. I got denied from Barclays Center, Prudential Center, and MetLife Stadium. Don’t let that know you down if you didn’t get in to your hopeful internship, get back up. Use your resources like a university career center by practicing interview skills and touching up resumes.

Best:)"

is the process similar for software engineers? would i get math/stat based q's in jane street similar to the quant/trader or more code based questions?

also what level leetcode would i expect and on what mainly? would hard leetcode come up for an ""intern""?

I'm sure this sounds like a dumb question but hear me out: 

There is an internship that I have a lot of relevant experince for, I have quite a few projects that relate me back to the position, and even have taken a tech elective that is beneficial for the role I will be applying for. The down side is, I have a sub 3 GPA, I was the first to go to University in my family, and had to pay for quite a bit of it, this required me to get two jobs to pay for my first 3yrs, now that I have a part time job that is relevant to my degree, it pays quite a bit more. Thus I was able to cut back on the hours I needed to make ends meet, and my grades have increased, yet still I'm under a 3.0. I managed to get one of the Senior tooling engineers as my referral. In matter of fact , I'm actually going to go meet with him soon to go talk about the position. Though my GPA isn't above their threshold, with all things consider do I still have a shot at an interview at the very least? 


TL.DR: I have a sub 3.0 GPA, but managed to befriend one of the Senior engineers in the company whom said he'd personally be my referral, what's the likelihood I can get at least an interview?"

d11m31,62,2019-09-07,Internship Rant,highlypaid,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d11m31/internship_rant/,"So I feel like I made a mistake by taking a low-paid internship, and I'm kind of ashamed to be posting this. My time at the company I interned at ended today and it actually didn't feel like much of an internship. In fact, I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer science and the only reason I took it was because I didn't have a job. I was there for about 4 months. I feel like a dumbass for having stuck around that long, but I'm grateful it paid at least something so I could cover rent and food while I searched for a real job.

My team consisted of myself, a devops guy, and four overseas developers who weren't the best at english and who were quite rude at times. I had a mentor for two weeks who was also pretty rude but he ended up being fired and so I was left basically without a mentor. I felt like day after day I was wading through a poorly thought-out software product. Requirements were often unclear, and I was given tickets from day one without actually being walked through how the system works at a high level.

On my first day, I asked to see the database schema so I could better understand the application and how all the tables interacted with one another. They volleyed me from one person to another for several weeks, and ultimately no one had a schema to show me. It took two weeks to get my development environment set up properly to run their code on my machine, because most of the time no one wanted to take the time and help, or I would be made to feel stupid because I couldn't figure it out.

I felt like an idiot for two months, but around that two-month mark I started to realize that I was almost being set up for failure. Sure, a few of the overseas devs were good at coding, but they expected me to hop on tickets/projects without any guidance on how the system works. The instructions were often so vague for some tickets, that it sometimes took me weeks to get one done. I would have to wade through thousands of lines of code with very little assistance and then I'd have to figure out how to implement new things based on that code. When I told them I needed help, they would say that I should be able to figure it out myself, because that's what it means to be a developer, and sometimes they'd help me, grudgingly.

On the day I was let go, the VP of engineering told me that maybe when I look for another job I should not ask for so much money (I asked for over 75k), and maybe I should look for a junior developer role. I told him I have a bachelor's in CS and I feel like my programming ability is good but it took me a long time to learn the system. Then he said 'What is CS?' The 'VP of Engineering' asked me what is CS. I was shocked.

I said 'Computer Science,' somewhat dumbfounded. At this point, all my suspicions of organizational incompetence were confirmed. The Vice President of Product Engineering didn't even f\*\*\*ing know what 'CS' is, and the funny thing is he has a degree in it, since he has a 'computer science' degree on his CV.

He said that most programming jobs don't require computer science, it's more logic puzzles and putting things together. At this point I just shook my head and agreed, you can't argue with dumb.

I'm never taking a \*\*\*\*ing internship again unless it's at a top tech company."

Any advice is appreciated.",cestuneabeille,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/d11os4/chance_me_mostly_just_looking_for_advice_on_how/,"**Demographics:** Female, Asian (Chinese), from Canada. My parents immigrated from China, but I was born in Canada. I have a single mom, if that's a hook. My school is not well-known for being an academic school, but I have the most advanced course load possible for my sdchool. 

**Intended Major(s):** Some kind of engineering

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** SAT: 1570 (RW 770, M 800), SAT Bio: 790, planning to take SAT Math 2 and Physics this October. 

**UW/W GPA:** UW GPA: 4.0 / W GPA: 4.75

**Coursework:** AP Math, Physics, Chem, Bio, English (everything offered at my school). Because of the way my school organizes classes, the only AP exam I've taken is Bio, for which I got a 5.

**Awards:**

Waterloo Math Competition - Great Distinction (placed highest in my school)

School Awards - Advocate Award (for my work in the school newspaper)

**Why I Need Advice:** 

I feel like my application is really weak because it's not at all related to my intended major. My school doesn't offer a lot of STEM related activities, which is what I'm most passionate about, so I've made do with what existed and tried to make the best of it. Basically, I was really nerdy with STEM stuff in junior high, and my parents wanted me to become a well-rounded person, so I chose to go to a french immersion high school that is actually mostly known for sports. Since it wasn't really an academic school, there aren't any academic clubs, since student interest would be so low. 

I was always decent at writing and I was really good at drawing, so I joined the school newspaper, and tried to be involved in the community in the best way I could. 

**Extracurriculars:** Nothing special I think, so I'm going to list all of them. It will be long. 

Cover artist and writer for school paper - I draw the covers for each issue of the paper and write articles. I'm gonna probably get a co-editor position this year. 

Writing for community newspaper - I worked with a retired teacher/writer on a series of articles about buildings in the community, for a total of around 7 months. 

Writing for youth blog - I wrote for a blog called Youth Are Awesome in Gr. 11. I published 2 articles a month. I quit this year because I wanted to focus on my school paper. 

Environment Club - I am founding an environment club with a friend at school this year, hope to raise awareness of climate issues and implement more environmentally friendly practices at our school.

Participated in diversity/leadership program - It was a program with a week-long camp where we met all the other participants, and worked on/discussed leadership, social issues, and how we can tackle them. We had a post-camp project, where my group organized an event to raise awareness of Indigenous issues in Canada. 

Volunteering - I volunteered with a youth volunteer program for 3 ish years, and I racked up around 300 hours. I was recognized as Volunteer of the Month this one time (it's a pretty big program, so I would say this is significant)

Badminton - I am on my school team. Placed 2nd in Divisionals in Grade 10.

Piano - I played up to Grade 10 for RCM

\*I don't have any solid STEM related EC's because there is a real lack of them around me, but here is the best I manage.

On the side, I kind of tutor people around me for free, mostly for STEM related subjects (although I did teach music theory once). I ask that they don't pay me, but I do try to be as professional as a paid tutor would be.

I also do some random projects at home, ie. I make tools and stuff for myself and sometimes if I'm doing something online I'll make macros for myself. Its kind of just a hobby though.

The closest I have to a STEM related EC is that I was part of a Europe-exchange group that would complete a research project about water to present at the 2020 Water Is Life conference. That ended up being scrapped because the other members were more interested in the travel and exchange than the project. I think I was the only one there for the project. Basically, the teachers are trying to make it happen again this year, but it's not confirmed. I'm gonna be trying to make it happen as well, and I'll join if it does go through. 

Also, I'll be starting and running an environment club this year with my friend like I mentioned above, if that counts. 

Basically, I have tried to get some STEM related EC's, but they've all fallen through, ie. the research project. I've also applied for research internships, STEM related jobs, but because they're so competitive/had bad timing, none of those worked out either. 

**Essays:** I expect them to be decent, especially since I'm close with the English staff at my school. I'll have to make sure to figure out some way to say that my passion is for math and engineering, even though I have a lack of STEM EC's. 

I also struggled with some mental health issues in Gr. 11, which did stall me at school and in the community, but I have overcome that. Not sure if it's good to mention that. 

**LOR:** My teachers generally like me and know I work really hard, so this should be OK, But I'll make sure to talk to them. 

**Really, I'm just looking for advice on how I could apply to a school with what I have. Anything is appreciated. Thanks.** 

I know I want to be an engineer (ideally would be in EE), but I don't think I'll be able to get in with my profile. I'd probably apply for another major, then switch.

Edit: I also self learned material for all the SATs excluding Bio because my school didn't let me organize my year like I wanted. Not sure if that helps to mention."

First time poster here. I'm really just clueless on where else to turn.

d12rrk,1,2019-09-07,Can you think of ways to break into the industry with only a CS minor? (I found out how much I enjoy programming too late to major in CS),lostwafflecat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d12rrk/can_you_think_of_ways_to_break_into_the_industry/,"So, I discovered I enjoy programming very late into college. I'm a psychology major, but I'll still be able to finish with a CS minor. I do not have the money to extend my education to pursue a double major.

I have a very good GPA (3.9), and have gotten entirely A's in CS classes so far (this is at the main campus of a major state university).

I spend a fair amount of time coding outside of class, and also do a lot of research into what it's like in actual CS careers. During labs for classes I'm usually able to help people around me with their questions about as well as the TA's for the courses can.

One of the main things I've ran into trouble with is trying to find an internship. Most places require you to be pursuing a CS major in order to become an intern.

I basically only have two classes left for my psychology B.S. (but I need more credits to meet the base credit requirement, so I won't graduate until after next fall), but adding CS as a second major would add two full years because of the requirements that I would need to fulfill and the timing of the terms some of the required courses are offered during.

So I basically have two questions:

- Can you think of a way that I could get a CS-related internship (preferably for software engineering or mobile development)?

- What can I do that would help me gain experience in the field and also help me become more hireable when I graduate despite not having a CS or related degree?"

My circumstances are quite unique and highly identifiable so apologies I will have muddled up/hidden more identifiable characteristics of my situation.

I study a niche highly theoretical CS-based degree in a top university, non-US. It was a small major and as someone not from the area I wasn’t warned about how badly designed this major was. I found out later that the degree has a VERY VERY high dropout rate, and that one year no one graduated with honors and in some years /everyone/ who was in the major drops out. I was admitted without the right subject requirement and so additional to these difficulties I had to teach myself Maths.

My GPA is very very low but not without reason as you can see. At college I had been introduced to various deans who have been keeping track of the issue, apologising for not intervening earlier.

I have interned at somewhere big, somewhere you probably wouldn’t expect a low GPA student to intern and did well. I hate bragging but I worked on a project that the rest of my team had trouble trying to solve and did it independently and in very quickly and even improved on it while I was there.

Normally at this work place, their policy is to offer you a second internship or grad job before your internship ends if you do well. But I was in a business group with a hiring freeze.

I found out that the hiring freeze literally lifted a week after I left. They’re even hiring more interns - but now they’re asking for transcripts and GPA when with me they never bothered.

I’m scared that they will ask me what my GPA is when I call my manager at an agreed time a few months down the road and refuse to hire me even though they need to by policy. He has said that he will re-hire me if the hiring freeze is removed. My GPA being low is not even the fault of my own, and is quite common of the major.

Will I be rejected on re-hiring? What do I say if they ask for GPA? I know that this workplace hired someone without a college degree, but in other sites their interns are expected to have a decent GPA"
d136r8,2,2019-09-07,I started from CC and I’m about to start my 2nd Internship at MSG,shakka-suede,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d136r8/i_started_from_cc_and_im_about_to_start_my_2nd/,"I’m entering my last semester of University at a Private 4 year. It’s quite an expensive school but I have a scholarship that helps me save money. Money is a huge issue for many hopeful students who are trying to pursue an education. 

Let’s go back into my timeline, shall we? 

In high school, I had a 2.5 but I got into a public university. My parents were tight on money at the time so I decided to go to CC. It’s close to my house, like a 5 min drive. I also had friends who were going too. My first year was rough, I failed a few classes. It was because I was naive, I didn’t balance my schedule. I had friends who went to 4 year schools and invited me over to party. I feel into a deep depression (I don’t need sympathy). I decided to change my habits and study my ass off to achieve my Associates. I left CC with a 2.9 gpa and receive my associates. I did this by sacrificing my summer and taking classes to finish on time. 

I got into a Private 4 year University and decided to major in Sport Administration due to my passion in Soccer. I took a semester off to save more money and have a mental break. It was necessary because I really wanted to think about my goals in life. I wanted to be a scout but my path took me to somewhere greater. I got an internship with the New York Red Bull in event and operations (completely different than scouting lol). I learned so much about the professional job environment and made so many connections. They took a shot at me because of my passion, not really what was on paper. The point of an internship is to learn about the job environment, plus your supervisors and leaders get to learn about you. 

I was then offered a match day position and been with the operations department for about a year. I wanted more though, I wanted to continue to grow as professional. My advisor at Uni suggested to me that I apply for Madison Square Garden. It took me 3 months to achieve my internship there. One key value I learn is to be patient. I have such a tough time being anxious and worried about my future (it’s normal, I know I’m not the only one). My biggest take from this was, have a sense of communication. I asked questions that were critical thinking and showed my passion for the internship. But DONT BE ANNOYING. I try my best to be patient, I didn’t want to keep emailing every other day. Once a week is fine. 

I then went through 3 interviews and was offered a Front of House Operations Student Associate Internship. I was ecstatic, knowing my past, I was so proud of what I accomplished over the past 2 years. MSG saw that I worked hard over the last year. I volunteered with the NY Giants, NYC marathon, and ICC Championship. Volunteering looks so good on a resume, it shows how you’re willing to work for free for your passion. I showed to the interviewer my recommendations from my volunteering and Red Bull internship (Use them as a leverage during an interview, it looks good! I promise!). 

I saved so much money and I got to think about what I really wanted to do for the rest of my life. I’m leaving with a 3.7 GPA at my University due to my new study habits and time management skills.  My goal is to run events, this is fueled by my passion of sports and concerts. My first event at MSG will be Tyler, The Creator (An artist I looked up to so much) looking at his past, he achieved so much for a kid that was once a shit head (just like myself lol). Tyler showed the world that he can be taken seriously because of his craft and love for creating. I look up to him as a role model, because of his inspiration, it made me chase my dreams. My first Tyler show was back in 2015 during The Cherry Bomb era. Now, I’ll be working at his concert at the Worlds Famous Arena (plus more events and sports). 

My advice for you is, find your passion. And find people who have the same passion as you. I worked even harder when the people around me are trying to chase the same dream. If you’re sad, depressed, or just not having that pure energy. Meditate, yeah meditate. Clear your head, breathing exercises helped me so much. DO YOUR RESEARCH. Look online, go on LinkedIn, Google, Forums, ANYTHING. Learn from others and see what you can do. I love feeling motivated by others. Learn about a professional on how they got from point A to point B, don’t just network for the job sake. 

Best of luck to anyone finding an internship, it can be hard. I got denied from Barclays Center, Prudential Center, and MetLife Stadium. Don’t let that slow you down if you didn’t get into your hopeful internship, get back up. Use your resources like a university career center by practicing interview skills and touching up resumes.

I'm in the middle of a crossroads right now. I just passed a hackerrank pre-screening exam for Western Digital and got invited to a two-day hiring event this thursday and friday. This all happened so quickly as a recruiter from WD reached out to me barely last week. If I attend the event I would have to take a day off from school and PTO from work for friday. Currently, I intern at a big defense company and I am pretty sure they will give me an offer to return after I graduate. However, nothing is set in stone but the pay is fairly good based on the offers that other interns received and great benefits. Also, I start working on my project this week and I would hate to miss work on Friday as I only work (M/W/F) if I didn't feel it was extremely worth it. If I received an offer from WD, I don't even know if I would take it over the company I work for now. The coding languages that I am somewhat with that will be tested are C/C++ and the closest experience I have with that is Arduino IDE or Assembly so I would need to spend time learning the syntax in the next few days. Anyways, what do you guys think? Should I suck it up and take school/work off and learn C and attend the hiring event? Some friends have advised me to go because I have nothing to lose and some believe that WD is a step down from my current employer and I shouldn't waste my time. Please let me know what you think, thanks everyone! I have until Monday to respond to the invite."

I was a mechanical engineering major before I switched to CS and I was involved in a fluid mechanics lab.

I just completed an internship denoising images which is probably the most relevant but even then it was in the context of atmospheric sciences. I am also attending a conference for this project.

How can I use these unrelated research experiences when applying to grad school for CS? Is it even worth bringing up?"

What now?,sluttypenguins97,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d184pq/senior_in_college_decided_against_software_job_at/,"Senior in college here. I am graduating a semester late because I transferred schools, but right now I'm desperately searching for internships to get some experience before I graduate next December. 

So, I started off at a community college and transferred to a top 5 public university as a junior last year. Unfortunately because of the way the community college transfer program is structured in my state, I pretty much had to know what degree I wanted to pursue from day one if I wanted to stay on track to graduate. I didn't really get the opportunity to explore majors like a lot of my friends did. 

Since I obviously had no idea what I wanted to do as a freshman, I ended up defaulting to Computer Science. I figured it was an okay choice considering was interested in programming and had a website back in middle/high school. 

However I always sort of knew it was probably a stretch for me, and as I reach higher level classes, it's pretty clear I'm out of my element. At this point it's too late to change my major -- I can't take much more of college and I'm not about to put extra financial strain on my family. I've decided the best course of action is to finish out my degree and then try to find a job outside of the field. 

Can anyone else in my situation suggest non-computer science jobs that would be attainable with my degree? 
So far I've been thinking maybe sales roles but idk what else"

I am an under graduate and in the following month i am going to get my Bachelor degree in CS studies, with thesis in Machine Learning. I have been working in the field of Machine Learning for 1 and a half years, but just with projects from my Faculty and along the way I took the Andrew NG course. Have tried to read Bishop's book for ML, but have trouble understanding the more complex concepts. I have knowledge of Calculus and Linear Algebra, i took the courses in my Faculty. Right now I am reading a practical book for Machine Learning, just playing with all the libraries in Python. My purpose is not to treat ML as a Black Box.

Just a note here before i continue. I am living in a developing country in Europe, its a safe place to live in and there is a bright future, BUT if only the government stop stealing money from the people. There are a lot of IT companies, and Machine Learning and Data Science careers are just catching up, so getting a job in this field is not impossible just challenging due to the high demand.

Recently I started an ""internship"" at a small Software Development company (max 6 workers), to do a Machine Learning feature for their software in development. The project is more of a research and i am using a public data set. I am my own mentor, and have just books and google to ask for help. The owner of the company gave me an offer to stay in the company and start an even bigger research project, on which first i said no, due to the fact i consider myself a beginner, but he put me on stand by. After a while he contacted a Data Scientist from another company  with \~1 year work experience and a degree in Business Informatics, to do the job. Now he is suggesting me to join the ""experienced Data Scientist"" to conduct the research.

My dilemma is a bit complex. Should i have a good mentor in a company where i want to start working full time, a person to ask for guidance. To be fair i am living by the quote of Jack Ma: “Give yourself a promise: 'I will stay there **for three years**.'"". I want to invest my time in my first company to gain knowledge. I feel that under the mentor ship of this guy (haven't met him in person to judge his experience) i won't develop very well. I can either, stay in the company and start reading books about ML algorithms to understand them and work on the project. Or to apply companies where I THINK there are real data scientists with real degree related to the field of Machine Learning and Data Science?. OR MAYBE i am just blind by the fact that I really need a mentor in this path, maybe i should just depend on the books and google. Also my other concern is the company where i am right now. I don't see a constant stream of finances, the software is based on subscription model, but it's not launched yet and they still run on finances from investment funds.

I know that KNOWLEDGE is not an overnight job, but don't want to mess up learning that knowledge in the first place.

What is your take on this?"

I'm currently enrolled in BEng Software Engineering program and I'm one semester away from graduating.

I've had quite a few applied and practical courses (plus 6 months internship)  during my degree. Throughout the courses I've found that I really enjoy functional programming and the ideas behind it. I plan to get a MSc in CS with focus on formal methods and program verification afterwards.

Since I've had my fair share of applied courses, this last semester I've decided to take two very theoretical MSc courses together with my beng thesis, to prepare myself better for the MSc.

It's courses in logic programming and data structures and algorithms 2. These courses absolutely terrify me.

There's a ton of mandatory assignment's in both classes that you have to pass in order to be able to attend the final exam. We've gotten the first assignments and I find them extremely difficult despite studying the concepts for days. They're soon due and I am far from done.

I see this as a learning opportunity. The classes are very high quality and I feel like I'll learn a lot, but damn right now it's very difficult and I am absolutely terrified of failing either course. 

I have a friend (two different people) in both courses that I'll be able to ask for help, but not much other than that.

I guess my best options are to study a lot (even though sometimes I've studied for 8 hours with no improvement, sigh) and just hope for the best. I just really have to pass, else I'll have to extend my graduation with 6 months.

Anyone ever been in the same situation? I feel very lost at this moment..."

The area I really want to get into is computer security, particularly in an soc style environment such as a security analyst or something similar as that’s the area I think I find the most interesting,but the problem is, is applying and getting work placement in this area realistic ? 

Would I be severely limited in what I could do and learn on the placement ? As I doubt an intern would be allowed do much if any real security work as mistakes could be potentially a lot more damaging than in other areas and would it be more worthwhile to get experience in a different area with transferable skills that I’d be able to do a lot more while on placement ?

Because if this, I’m obtaining my CS degree completely online from a lesser known state school miles and miles away from me. I can’t get an internship outside of my job because I already work full time and if I left the company, they’d stop paying for my school. 

I’m a junior now with a 3.9 GPA but am really worried about not being able to do an internship to gain experience. Right now, I work with a ton of engineers of all kind (I work at a theme park and help test the new attractions coming in the future) but my job is entry level, as I’m a ride operator and I really only act as an aid to the engineers because of the temporary assignment I’m on. Technically, it could be considered experience because I work side by side with the software engineers and gain a lot of information on how the ride systems work from them but I don’t know how well that’s going to translate to a resumé next year when I graduate since it’s just an entry level job. I have at least worked my way up to a managerial position, which is good for leadership qualities but I really need more relevant computer science experience that I can’t get until after I graduate. 

Things I’m doing:
I’m taking the Computer and Network Security IoT senior level class which will give me a semester long project to add to my resumé.  Next year, I’ll have my senior project for my CS degree so at least I’ll technically have 2 senior level projects under my belt. I don’t know if it’ll help, but the opportunity was given to me so I decided to go for it. 

Any other tips to build my resumé? Or should I just keep up the good GPA and hope for the best? I really would love a good internship, but finically it’s just not possible to leave my job for several months and lose my tuition, but I really don’t want this degree to go to waste.

The guy talked about how his company has an internship that’s rated number 1 and if you write down your name, email, and phone number, you get more information. Btw my younger brother told me that the Professor allowed this (Probably didn’t know any better). 

My brother put down his information and the next Sunday he gets a call from the guy saying that he’s a great fit and he would like to meet with him the following Monday. Once my brother told me about this I could smell it’s a pyramid scheme. I told my brother to call the guy back and find out more information. The guy said he works for a company called College Works. Once I google searched the company it was clear it was a scam. If you want to find out more information on what they do here’s a good article pointing out how shady of a company they are:

Apparently, this company recruits college students by going to lectures and getting students information."

I'm trying to get myself into the habit of writing something non-school or work documentation related on a daily basis.  I can't say I'll have something new every day, but encouragement, suggestions for edits, or other criticism is welcomed and desired.  Thanks for reading, I hope you all enjoy!  This is the first part of a larger story that I've been rolling around in my head for a while and I hope it ends up encouraging me to write more.  The prologue is written in the first person as though the following story is about the speaker.  I have to find a way to make it connect better, but it gives a background into the world that I am building this story off of so I felt it better to include it here.  This is all a WIP\*\*

**Prologue**

 For as long as mankind had dreamed of what lies among the stars, man has been motivated and frightened by the possibility that it is alone in the vastness of the universe.  How strange it was that the search for life continued to yield no clues to the existence of life more than one hundred fifty years after man first left the solar system?  My Great Grandfather used to tell me stories of a time before FTL travel, and before man had spread across our local quadrant of the galaxy.  These stories, passed on from his Great Grandfather and so on, point to a time when mankind had an inferiority complex about their place in the galaxy as a whole. 

How strange then would my ancestors have found it when it was not a little green man, or a bulbous eyed grey skinned telepathic monster from the skies that first appeared to man from beyond our own cradle?  No, it would not be the demons of our past stories that threatened us from beyond the stars.   We ourselves were the greatest threat to our own survival in space, not philosophically or metaphorically, but physically.

It wasn’t long after we started scouring the stars and the many habitable planets we had found near Earth that humans started to wonder if life existed outside our own planet at all.  Imagine decades of searching planet after planet and finding nothing but dust.  Sure we found some “life” outside our cradle, but this life was all single celled that had failed to make the evolutionary leap to multi-cellular life.  It took almost fifty years before we found signs of intelligent life.  

The first time explorers from Earth discovered advanced life was completely by chance.  A mining ship had decided to scout out a system near a small yellow dwarf star a mere twenty light years removed from Earth.  All of our scientists theorized that nothing could live on a planet in this region due to the simple fact that there were only 3 celestial bodies in orbit around the star we now call Beta Eridian, all of which were gas giants.  The crew of the mining ship had hoped to find deposits of iridium which we used to make our fuel for our FTL ships, what they found was ruins of what appeared to be a civilization very similar to our own.

Archaeologists, historians and anthropologists were beyond ecstatic to find that the ruins contained furniture and devices that pointed towards a bipedal humanoid culture.  What struck our scientists as most confusing however was not contained in the ruins of the civilization, as there were no bodies or even remains to speak of.  No what really frightened our scientists was the discovery of a facility that appeared to have been built to observe the civilization during it’s evolution.  

This realization that there was a nameless, faceless species so advanced that they were actually guiding the evolution of a species like humanity created deep divides in our society.  Militarists used this discovery to begin the process of creating huge space-faring fleets of the most menacing, dangerous ships imaginable.  Our long history of an almost institutional paranoia served to create a focus unknown of in our history.  We had not met a single species outside of our own, and yet we were prepared to go to war if necessary to defend our very existence.

Years turned to decades before we found another installation like the first.  Before long, we were finding them everywhere, always connected to some rocky planetoid where the ruins of a long dead civilization remained behind to provide mute witness to the horrors of the universe.  The single most horrifying discovery mankind had yet to make came less than twenty five years after that first fateful discovery when the Earth Defense Force detected a spike in the electromagnetic spectrum near Ganymede.  It was with horror that we discovered our own civilization was being watched as well. 

There was one stark difference with this discovery however.  At every other installation, nothing was left behind except the ruined shells of what appeared to be computing equipment, and other monitoring tools.  The station at Ganymede was different.  This station had been cloaked, but still active.  The first defense forces to arrive at the station found all systems operating inside the station, despite it appearing to be deserted.  

It took our best exolinguists and cryptographers to crack the codes on the machines in “The Observatory” as we had begun to refer to it.  What we discovered, shook us to the very core.  The beings that had constructed this great observation post were very similar to humans.  They were bipedal, with two arms that ended in hands with ten total fingers.  They were intelligent, violent, and motivated.  They were also something else entirely.  Ancient.  As near as we could tell, our observers were already advanced for tens of millions of years before we even began to paint on cave walls. 

Where had these pre-humans gone?  Why had we not seen or heard of them before?  Could it be that these advanced beings were the basis for our various deities?  Without more data, we would never find out.  

We also found technology strewn about the ruins that were left behind.  Weapons of immense power, computers more advanced than we could dream of, faster sub-light drives than we had dreamed of, and FTL drives that could literally fold space in on itself to allow unbelievably fast travel.  We had hit the jackpot, to use an old gambling phrase.

Throughout our explorations, we still had not found signs of advanced life in our quadrant.  This began to shape our expansion.  We became bolder and our officers stopped training for a first contact scenario.  Soon we had spread to dozens of colony worlds which we began terraforming to our own needs.

The Terran Star Empire was founded in the year 2482 after humanity had expanded across enough star systems to feed our fleets with materials and men.  We built huge shipyards around stars distant to our home to create larger and more powerful ships.  Where we once looked for life, we created it.  

I was a child when the Empire was founded.  I can still remember the soaring refrains and fanfares of the day.  As long as I could remember, I had wanted to explore the galaxy, and spread mankind to the stars.  I sat around the holotube with my parents as the Emperor and his Senate gave their speeches about the drive that man possessed to explore and conquer.  

When I was thirteen, I convinced my father to send me to the Imperial Military College on Cardin V.  This college had been the family school and it was not a surprise when I went to him and asked to be inducted into the family profession.  He had been a starship captain, and I wanted nothing less.  

Throughout my education, I was trained in warfare and tactics, mathematics and science, and everything else that a true captain would need.  I trained hard, I wanted to be the best, and eventually graduated the head of my class, though that is a story for another time.  

I was barely out of my teens when I received my first assignment aboard a cruiser.  Students from the IMC were granted what was essentially an internship after graduation.  My first commander saw the potential in me and kept training me to think on my feet, often even having me take command of the bridge during the third watch when things were quiet.  

To be given a command as early as I received my first command was almost unheard of.  I had even managed to best my father in this category, being granted command of my first battle cruiser at the age of 29, a full three years ahead of him.

The Martell was beautiful.  It is difficult to explain what it is like to be a plank owner, to borrow a term from our pre-flight history.  She was brand new from the shipyards around Beta Eridian.  She measured a full kilometer from the very leading edge of her prow to the powerful fusial thrust engines at her stern.  She was armed with an array of projectile and energy weapons.  Humanity had long ago decided that any space-faring vessel needed three things at minimum to be a part of the TSE Navy.  All ships were capable of carrying a point defense system for eliminating close in threats, intermediate range Rail Cannons which were designed to accelerate tungsten carbide rods the size of a small vehicle to near light speed, and my personal favorite weapon, long range missiles for engaging targets at extreme ranges.  

Ships in the TSE Navy ranged in size from blastboats, which were crewed by as few as three men, all the way up to the gargantuan Super Dreadnoughts which were a true terror to behold, carrying thousands of crew, tens of thousands of troops, full wings of Star fighters and support ships, two garrisons worth of supplies and combat support vehicles, and the most powerful weapons in the fleet, the Phase Modulated Pulse Canons or PMPC’s which were capable of destroying large asteroids and even some small moons.

The Martell, as a battle-cruiser, fell into the gap between battleships and cruisers.  They were fast, stealthy, and powerful, and awarded to some of the fleet’s rising stars.  One of the greatest things about being the first commander of a new ship off the assembly line is the opportunity to name the ship (within reason of course.)  I chose to name my battle-cruiser the Martell after one of my favorite historical figures, Charles Martell.  Roughly translated from the Frankish language of antiquity, Martell means “The Hammer,” which was a fitting name for a ship that could get into a combat situation, unload an unbelievable amount of pain onto a target, and keep on trucking.  

As glorious as it sounds, life was mostly routine on the Martell.  For all our bluster, mankind had never needed to use it’s massive fleets in anything more aggressive than pirate hunting and insurrection control.  I had been assigned to patrol an outer route near what was the current border of the Empire.  We had never really expanded beyond this point, but we still patrolled our borders in case something happened.  

It was there that everything changed.  I was there the day they came home.  I was there at the death of the Terran Star Empire, the day mankind came to know the true purpose of our existence.  Now, at the far reaches of the galaxy, the Terran Remnant is surrounded by enemies new and old.  It has fallen to me, as the senior remaining commander in the fleet to protect and defend what remains of humanity.  

But no story can start in the middle, and this is no different.  To understand where we are today, you need to know how we got here.

 **Ch. 1 - In the Beginning...**

As the Martell drifted through the Zeta Planetia system, at the edge of the Terran Star Empire, Sully couldn’t help but smile.  The subtle thrumm of the deck plates and the quiet chatter of the watch crew was a great comfort.  After all, he’d worked quite hard to get his first command, and he’d worked equally hard to make it one of distinction.  As a rising star in the Terran navy, Captain James “Sully” Sullivan was uncommonly intelligent, driven, and most important, daring.  It took a fair amount of guts to command a battlecruiser like the TSES Martell, and Sully had proven himself worthy of his command.  

Sully had always loved the stars, and dreamt of walking among them like a giant.  As a child he would spend hours staring up at the sky outside his home, even when he was supposed to be in bed getting ready for another day at school.  Now, as an adult, he felt like the giant he’d always dreamed of being.  Here, drifting among the stars, in charge of a billion credit arsenal and the six hundred men and women under his command, Sully felt like a demigod.

“Sir, you were saying?” asked Commander Susan Jansen, his second in command.

“What?  Oh yes, I’m sorry, sometimes I lose myself in thought,” replied Sully, slightly annoyed at himself for daydreaming.  “Have we completed our patrol of the sector?”

“Almost sir, though there is an odd sensor malfunction that we are trying to pin down right now.  Lieutenatn Davis is leading the technical crew in looking into it,” the commander replied.

“We just had our sensor system overhauled at Beta Eridian during our 5 year maintenance overhaul.  Have Davis go over things with a fine toothed comb.  I know we have been thorough with our patrol, but we can’t afford to be lax,” the captain replied.  “I’ll be in my quarters Commander, the deck is yours.”

“Yes Sir!” replied Susan while snapping a crisp salute.  This Captain might be young, but he rewarded hard work and loyalty, and she eagerly learned from his every move in the hope that one day she would be in his position.

As Captain Sullivan was departing the bridge however, something nagged at the back of his mind.  Something was off, but he wasn’t quite sure what it was.

Back in his quarters, James could relax.  He walked to his desk and pulled out a tumbler and a bottle of his favorite whiskey, a 12 year old single malt that was smooth, buttery, and just economical enough that he didn’t feel like he was overindulging if he had a belt or two.

The cork let out a satisfying pop as he pulled it free and poured himself a double while he sat down at the desk and began to dictate his daily log.

“Log, March 24, Captain Sullivan.”  

“We finished our initial sweep of the Zeta Planetia system today.  As expected, things are quiet.  The crew seems in good spirits and I am half tempted to drill them due to how quiet it has been lately.  They’ve been working hard, but I want them to be at their best.  Perhaps some more pirate drills to sharpen their reflexes and skills,” Sully said, pausing to take a sip and let the warmth from the liquor trail fire from his mouth to his stomach.

“Of particular note, the ship is running quite smoothly despite being in drydock for the last 4 months.  The only complaint we have had to this point is a faulty sensor suite, however Lieutenant Davis is investigating and I anticipate he will have a solution for us soon,” Sully continued.  “The crew is otherwise in good spirits, and I could not be more proud to be their commanding officer.”

“Of a personal note, I need to remember to reach out to my mother.  These long tours do tend to cause me to be less present in her life, and while my sister is undoubtedly keeping mom well cared for, I hate being so far from home now that dad is gone.”

Looking down at the glass, Sully noticed that it was empty, and he decided that one last pour would be good to unwind with before he got ready for bed.  As the whiskey began to pour from the bottle though, a bone jarring jolt shook the Martell and suddenly the grav generators stopped functioning.

The liquid coalesced into a brown sphere and began floating around the cabin as he locked his boot down on the deck plate and engaged the mag heel.  “Report!” Sully bellowed at his com unit.

“Sir you need to get up here.  We just had something arrive in system, something I’ve never seen before!” replied his XO, sounding terrified.  “Damage control teams are trying to restore the grav plating, but they’re battling cascading failures throughout our systems.  It’s as if we’ve been hit by an extremely powerful EMP.”

It didn’t make any sense to James.  Nothing in the TSE Navy had the capability of crippling a battlecruiser just by arriving nearby.  This was unprecedented.  After all, the Terran Star Empire was, by all accounts, alone in the galaxy.  Humanity had never stumbled across anything more than ruins of prior galactic civilizations.  The only other potential answer was that the Martell had been sabotaged during it’s time in dry dock.  There were plenty of pirate and rogue factions that would love to get their hands on a battlecruiser, so sabotage seemed most likely.

James sprinted from his quarters, his mag boots clicking on the deck.  Despite mankind’s discoveries and advancement of the technology found in their explorations, they hadn’t come up with a better way to deal with a sudden loss of gravity than the old fashioned mag boots.  The change in gravity did cause Sully’s stomach to rile a bit, and he had to fight the urge to vomit or pass out.

Alarm klaxons blared as Sully rounded the corner and entered the command deck.  What he saw baffled him at first.  His crew was standing and staring blankly at the projector screen.  His crew was never dumbfounded when facing a threat, and this should have been his first clue that something horrible was wrong.

Before he could start yelling out orders however, the ship shook violently again, as if a giant hand had struck the Martell and sent it skidding out of control.  One of the deck officers was sprawled at Sully’s feet and as he helped him stand, he found the officer trembling and still staring at the screen.  It was only then that Sully saw why his crew was dumfounded.

Dominating the screen before him was an immense ship hovering barely a dozen kilometers away from the Martell’s prow.  It appeared bulbous in form, but also somehow familiar.  None of this made sense though as this definitely did not bear a resemblance to anything in the fleet.  

The ship was designed much like ships in the Terran Star Empire's navy, but this seemed otherworldly.  Small flights of what appeared to be ancillary support ships flitted about the outer edges of the ship, as though a swarm of flies surrounding a great beast.  The surface itself seemed to almost slither, with the skin appearing to shift and change actively.

“Davis, get me a line on whatever that thing is!” shouted Sully.  “I need to know what we’re working with.  Commander Jansen, I want you to get with the damage control teams and start assessing what we need to do to get our gravity generator back online.  Report to me when completed!  Everyone else, man your stations and prepare to defend the ship if this thing is hostile!”  

The only way to approach a situation like this was from a place of calm and order, and the only way to achieve that was to get things under control.  Fortunately for Sully, the crew of the Martell was a well oiled machine.  A chorus of “AYE CAPTAIN!” rang out and things started to calm down a bit.  

The crew began to hurry to accomplish their tasks.  Sully could hear Lieutenant Davis marshaling his communications and sensor teams to determine what was going on.  None of this was making sense, so hopefully he’d have some good news soon.

While chaos ensued around him, Sully disappeared back into his thoughts.  Staring at this colossal vessel in front of his ship, something still nagged at the back of his mind.  It’s as if he knew what this thing was, despite never having seen it before.   It looked incredibly familiar.  

“Sir this thing is trying to access our databases!” shouted Davis, pulling Sully back to the moment.  “It’s as if it knows our encryption codes and language!”

It didn’t quite click for Sully however that this was all interlinked with the discovery that mankind had made all those years ago.  All of the Terran Star Empire’s equipment and technology was based on the technology that was found in that lone facility on Ganymede so long ago, along with the facilities that were found on each of the dead worlds in the area.  

Still pondering the predicament before his crew and indeed humanity, all of these clues came together in a flash.  It was almost as if a lightning strike had occurred in Sully’s mind, energizing and connecting everything together all at once.  But before he could shout what he wanted to shout, there was a deafening screech emitted from the speakers in the bridge.

As the crew covered their ears in an attempt to prevent the pain that was being inflicted upon them, a booming voice in a broken form of language came across the speakers.

“We.  Are.  The Mana’rai.  You.  Are.  Humans!”  The voice shouted.  “Submit!”

None of this made sense to the Captain however.  As far as he knew and had studied, humanity was alone in the galaxy.  How could this be happening?

“Submit!” the voice shouted again.  

In that instant, the display crackled to life and the image shifted from the view of this vessel before them and resolved into a face, one which both terrified and confused Sully.  

Another giant invisible hand slapped the Martell, much harder this time.  Sully was thrown off the deck plating and crashed into a bulkhead.  As darkness engulfed his sight, he kept hearing one word repeated over and over.  “Submit!”"

20 years old from the USA here. Spent my first year out of high school working and the second traveling. I used to be the captain of the school robotics team so I do have a bit of experience with coding (albeit I've forgotten 90% of what I knew)

I recently started an online CS bachelor's through Western Governors University that is completely accredited. I chose this program because it will allow me to travel and work while I do my studies.

Whenever I meet someone who works as a software dev or engineer, they all say that entry level work is pretty saturated, so it is important to get a niche. My question is what niches are in demand now? I know python is a newer language that is here to stay, but would proficiency in a language like python or Ruby on rails be good to have? My program is heavy in theory and has a few Java classes, so I would like to dedicate time over the next couple of years studying something more ""useful"" for my career 

Also there is obviously a need for an internship before entering the workforce. My program takes on a different structure and let's me go on my own pace, so I'm looking at one year before I would be equivalent to a rising junior. Even though my program is accredited, I feel like recruiters will see me as some sort of ITT tech type student and not give me serious consideration. Does anyone here have any advice for finding an internship coming from an unorthodox path? 

Appreciate any input or advice

Thanks"

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_Context

A bit of context 

I'm a computer science graduate and i've ended up in a MS in bioinformatics last year. 

I've cleared the first year with difficulties (no knowledge whatsoever about traditionnal sciences)

&amp;#x200B;

So now i'm in the last year of this MS. 

I mostly remember the statistics/biostatistics/ML classes 

But i don't feel like i know anything about biology. I just remember phylogeny trees, mutation and also a bit about the flu virus. 

This is underlined by the teacher supervising my last school project who told me that i should have known more about biology by the time i was doing his project. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_Issue

In summary I feel insecure about my Biology knowledge and because it is a core part of Bioinformatics

Because of that I don't know how i can sell myself for a bioinformatics internship that have to take place in a few months.  

Would you know of any general skills that are sought after for bioinformatics/biostatistics positions while not requiring too much biological knowledge ?"

The vast majority of internship postings require that you currently be enrolled in a computer science degree program. If you graduate from your undergrad you are no longer eligible for these, and all the postings you are eligible for require internship experience.

So. Just don't finish your degree until you have some experience because it only makes things more difficult for you to get anything.

I'm currently a computer science major and cognitive science minor at a big state school (~#30 ranked CS program). I'm enjoying school and the academic environment a lot, so attending grad school is the ideal outcome after graduation at the end of this year. I also love (and I've been told I'm pretty good at) teaching, so graduate teaching assistantships sound right up my alley. I wanted to apply to programs in computer science/cognitive science, but I'm not sure how competitive of an applicant I am for PhD programs, and I'd appreciate it if someone could help me decide whether it's worth the investment given my experience, which is as follows:

- Really good GPA. I like to think being a quick learner and a disciplined worker have helped me succeed so far academically. I'm also very focused on whatever I'm doing; I prioritize fairly well and don't get distracted easily.
- 90th percentile on the Standard GRE in all categories.
- Soft (?) skills: I have extensive experience working with people, technical communication, conflict management, administration, constructive feedback, etc. I'm also pretty good at time and stress management, so I've always had heavy course loads + other commitments throughout my time at college.
- I enjoy reading a lot (I don't know how relevant this is to you, but I've heard this is important if you want to succeed in grad school)
- Have had an internship working with software, but not very pertinent to my intended field of study.
- Limited research experience: I've only started working with a professor this semester, and grad applications are due in December, so I will have at best a couple months of research experience by the deadline.
- Haven't yet taken many advanced classes because I came in to college with no credits and had to fulfill all the requirements before getting into advanced classes.
- Can't guarantee amazing LoRs. I haven't worked with/under professors closely until this semester, but I do have a couple in mind who could vouch for my academic ability, and hopefully the one I'm working with this semester can provide more detail.
- Above Average (?) SoP: I'm a good writer (and very open to criticism), but I'm not sure what content I can fill it with because I don't yet have a burning research question I want to pursue, or much technical experience to convince anyone that I'd be a good contributor of ideas to their lab. I can talk about how I've made productive use of my time at college to develop myself into the person that I am now, but I'm not sure how that compares to an SoP describing oodles of technical expertise.

I think it's obvious that I'm not cut out for some of the top programs, so those aren't what I'm aiming for. I had in mind colleges whose CS programs are in the #40 - #15 range, and I would probably apply to 10.

I was looking into PhD programs largely because of funding and assistantships. I've read that there are fewer prospects for these in MS programs, and I'd rather not rack up debt for another two years, and I don't think I qualify for in-state tuition anywhere (lol)

I know that I will be applying to grad schools no matter what. But am I wasting my time by applying to PhD programs? I know that you aren't admissions officers, so I'm more so asking advice on whether I should be applying to MS programs instead. I am ready to face a lot of rejections also, but if I have a decent chance of getting into at least a few of my choices, I would like to try my hand at them. I'm also counting a little bit on colleges considering me for admission into their MS program if I'm rejected from their PhD program, but I'm not sure which colleges actually do this.

Please let me know what you think! If you've made it through this entire post, thank you for your time! I hope I've provided enough detail for you to give a reasonable answer, but if not, I'd gladly provide more."

Still cannot eat proper meals. Always over the place and get overwhelmed. I’ll either have bursts of energy where I’ll walk 12 miles and next day cannot leave my bed. I fucking hate how I’m wasting my 20’s looking like a piece of shit. I go to work come home and lay in bed. I have no friends no aspirations like I used to and just want to die."
d1k04y,0,2019-09-08,Choosing between medior software engineer in big company or well paid Senior in obscure one? Please share similar situations you had.,throwaway_stuff22,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d1k04y/choosing_between_medior_software_engineer_in_big/,"Hello everyone, the next few days I will have to make a decision that might affect my career in some significant way. (Or its just me overthinking as always...).

I have almost 5 years Software development experience. Been in 6 different companies, never more than 2 years but the changes was always for better. Note that I'm living in a country with lower salaries than in the developed countries. Currently I'm in a big company for a year and a half as Contractor Software engineer and they said that the contract would be terminated so I started looking for jobs. 

I managed to get an incredible offer in a developed country for a senior position, latest tech and practices, a salary higher than normal and other perks. So it can be good for my career. But this company is a bit obscure and the products they sell are not healthy. I rather not say what it is but not illegal or obscene stuff though. It wouldn't make me proud to say that I work for a company that sells this stuff but the idea of moving to a senior position, working with latest tech, have more freedom and responsibilities to do things and earning an absurd amount of money is very tempting.
And I also have family reasons to move to this other country. So I verbally accepted the offer.

Now I was about to sign the contract when in my current company they told me that they had a position for me in a different team. And I could move to a FTE position too. I was a bit pissed because for more than a month no one gave me any hope of staying and now that I've accepted an offer, all of a sudden they have a position for me.
This position is even better than the one that I'm now. Latest tech, important services with millions of requests per day and this company has a lot of prestige.
Also another point that makes me think to continue in my current company is that I've never stayed in the same company for more that 1 year and a half and I believed that this time I would make it to 2 years or more. Basically all the interviews I had, the question why I never stayed in a company for long was there. And I don't feel good about this although all the other companies that I've worked with were failed startups or internships during college.

I know that whatever I choose, it will be okay but I don't know how to decide on this one.
So I'm not looking for someone to tell me what to do but it would be good to hear some similar stories where you had to make a difficult decision between two offers and what happened after (if you regret your decision or not).

TL;DR: I can't decide which offer to take. Between medior position in big company with prestige and very well paid Senior position in obscure company, what would you choose and why?"

Freshman year was ok. Didn’t do mind blowing things but was pretty much happy with what I was doing. 

Got an internship for the summer at a local company with great culture, learned more than I ever had here, was treated to a perfect 9 to 5 and had a lot of free time. 

Now that I’m back, I think I’m doing better than I did before in terms of my positions in clubs, my research, my classes, and more, but just feel empty and disconnected a lot of times  - like I have to spend pretty much all of it doing hw or prep for the weekly assignments and quizzes. I am not depressed, but just stressed. I feel like I’m just going through the motions here and want advice regarding how to be happier at tech. Thanks."

d1l06q,510,2019-09-08,My siblings are better than me,fainting--goat,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d1l06q/my_siblings_are_better_than_me/," Let me start by saying that my parents murdered someone.  They’ve murdered at least one person every year, on my birthday.  They always made a big deal out of my birthday.  It’s a special day, they’d say, and it was the one day a year I could get anything I wanted.  Did I want to have a big sleepover party with all my friends?  Done.  Take twenty people to a movie?  Sure.  Go horseback riding?  Of course.  When I was in middle school I thought it was because they felt sorry for me, because I’m the dumb, weak, and perpetually sick child.  Now that I’m in highschool, having just celebrated my 18th birthday, I know better.

It’s guilt.

I found out because I wasn’t sleeping the night before my birthday.  I’d gotten yet another college rejection letter and it was starting to look like I wouldn’t be going to college *at all*.  How could I, when I struggled just to get C’s?  Meanwhile, my younger brother was taking a heavy load of AP classes as a sophomore and pulling a 4.8 GPA.  My sister was in her final year of middle school and had opted into highschool classes to get a head start.  She walked over to my school every day in the afternoon and I felt embarrassed seeing her in the hallway, knowing she was acing classes in 8th grade that I’d barely survived in 10th.  

I wasn’t even applying to prestigious schools.  I was applying to something-state-university out in the middle of nowhere with a student population of 12 people.

So after the latest rejection I spent the night crying to myself.  I’d hoped that I’d wear myself out and fall asleep that way, but every time I stopped crying long enough to think I’d drift off, I’d think about how my brother had just gotten an *internship* at a tech company as a *highschooler* and here I was thinking I’d just wind up at a trade school learning to cut people’s hair or something and I’d start crying again.

My parents told me it didn’t matter what I grew up to be, so long as I was a good person and was happy.  And I guess that’s true; I could be happy without being a doctor or a lawyer.  However, when your siblings are so *talented* it’s hard to not feel like a failure.

It’s not just academics, either.  I’m a lot frailer than them.  I get sick all the time.  I’ve missed so much school that my parents had to work out an arrangement with the school district so I could do classwork at home while I was recuperating from my slew of illnesses.  I even get sick with things a normal person shouldn’t get.  Did you know the MMR vaccine is only 78% effective for preventing mumps?  Guess how I know this.  I feel a little lucky in that the vaccine *at least* makes the symptoms less severe, because as it was I couldn’t eat anything that wasn’t through a straw for three days.  I can’t imagine what it would have been like at full-strength.

My brother used to make fun of me, saying I was the practice-run for mom and dad.  That they screwed me up so they could get the other kids right.  Mom and dad put a stop to that *real* fast when they found out.  My brother had to do all my chores for me for a month.  That was many years ago.  He feels bad about it now.

At least I’m not bullied about being so much less than my siblings.  The school takes its cues from my brother because he’s on the football team and he’s handsome and talented and he’s really nice to me, so everyone else is too.  And my sister is shaping up to be a track prodigy and she’s nice as well.  So I’ve got that going for me, at least.  It’s still embarrassing.  I’m the eldest and yet I feel like my younger siblings are looking out for me, not vice versa.

All this was running through my head on the eve of my birthday and that’s why I was still awake when midnight rolled around.  I watched the clock, counting the minutes, until the clock turned over to 12:12.  

“Happy birthday,” I whispered to myself.  I was born twelve minutes after midnight.

And no sooner had I said this than I heard what sounded like a scream.

I sat up in bed, heart pounding.  It’d been muffled, but it’d been *close* \- like it was in the house.  Sound carried through the vents and sometimes conversations from the basement could make it all the way up to the second floor.  I remained perfectly still, listening intently, and from the wall where the vent sat I could hear more noise.  Voices.  My father.  He sounded angry.

I got out of bed and went to the stairs.  I made my way down them, carefully, placing my weight near the wall so they wouldn’t creak.  I continued through the house until I reached the top of the basement stairs.  The door was slightly ajar and I edged it further open.  A sliver of light spilled out into the kitchen where I crouched.  I heard the muted voices of my parents and another sound, a wet, tearing sort of noise.

I was trembling in fear, but I told myself - it’s my *parents*.  I didn’t need to be afraid.  Maybe they were up because they were getting something ready for my birthday.  I could go down there and if it ruined some sort of surprise, well, I could tell them I was upset because of the college rejection letter and they’d understand and maybe I could just… stay up and talk with my mom and dad and maybe that would make me feel better.

I moved slowly, one step at a time.  The basement was open and about halfway down the stairs the wall from the floor above vanished.  I stopped just short of this point and leaned forwards, steadying myself with the railing, so that I could peer underneath the ceiling without being visible myself.  Half of the basement had been cleared of everything and plastic covered the walls and floors.  A man lay on his back in the middle of it, arms wrenched behind, his body swimming in a pool of his own blood.  His eyes were wide-open, staring at the ceiling.  And his chest… was cut open.

My brother was in AP biology.  He said they’d dissected fetal pigs and he described it to me over dinner to gross me out.  He said they’d peeled back the skin and muscle first, then cut the ribs from the sternum and broke them back to expose the organs for removal.  He’d thrown the heart at another classmate when the teacher wasn’t looking.

That’s what the man reminded me of.  Except there was so much *blood*.  I covered my mouth and nose with my hand, trying to take shallow breaths so I didn’t have to smell it.  I felt like I was going to vomit.

My parents stood off to the side, arguing in low voices.  My mother was wiping blood off her arms with a rag.  It was smeared up to her elbows.  Dad was cross that the man had managed to scream.  Mom hadn’t tied the gag tight enough, he was saying.  Did she use a square knot like he’d told her, just like he told her *every* year?  My dad gets a little particular about small things like this.  It’s an annoying quirk that we all just tolerate.

There was someone else with them, someone I didn’t recognize.  A man stood beside the dead man, licking blood off his fingers.  He was tall, thin, and well dressed in tight jeans and an untucked charcoal button-down that looked expensive.  

“Well, that was delicious,” the strange man sighed contentedly.  “Until next year, then?”

He moved to the basement sink to finish washing the blood off his hands.  My parents began untacking the plastic from the walls, rolling it inwards so that none of the blood escaped.  I needed to *leave*, I realized, before someone came upstairs.  I used the cover of the tap running to creep back to my room unheard.

My parents had *murdered* someone.  I paced the length of my bedroom, cellphone in hand, wondering what I should do.  Should I flee the house?  Call the police?  Do nothing?  My breath came in short, panicked gasps and in my agitation I didn’t notice my bedroom door edge open until the man was in the room.

I turned and he lunged.  One hand grabbed me by the back of my neck, holding me in place, his other went over my mouth.  I made small, muffled noises of panic and grabbed at his wrists, but I’d always been weak and it was like trying to budge a tree.

“Sh sh shhh,” he quickly whispered in an undertone.  “Don’t cry out.  I knew you were listening at the top of the stairs.  Your parents won’t like that you saw.  Here.  Come with me.  Let’s go for a walk.”

He steered me to the hallway.  I think my mind sort of shut down at that point.  I could smell blood on him and there was another sickly scent, like sulfur and sandalwood, and it made me want to gag.  He walked quickly and I was surprised that the stairs did not creak as we descended, even though he was hurrying, and the front door was similarly silent.

He released me once we were out of eye-shot of the house.  His pace slowed so that I could keep up and he walked calmly down the sidewalk, hands in his pockets, and I walked beside him.  It seemed I wasn’t actually being abducted, so…

“I’m sure you have a lot of questions,” he said calmly.  “I’ll explain, so that you don’t feel compelled to do something dumb in search of answers.  Let me first answer the most important question, the one you won’t think to ask but have been asking yourself for your entire life.  It’s not your fault that you’re the least of your siblings.  It’s because you’re their sacrificial lamb.”

“I - what?”

“We made a bargain,” he continued.  “They give me a human heart every year to devour.  I don’t care whose.  In exchange, all of your potential and ability is given to your siblings and you get all their weaknesses and defects.  Sacrifice the one for the good of the others.”

I laughed weakly.  This was absurd.  He paused, pivoting smoothly to face me, serene and collected, his hands still in his pockets.  There was a thin smile on his face and his eyes seemed to draw me in.  I couldn’t look away.

And I saw something.  I can barely describe it - like I was falling and there was darkness and a roaring in my ears like wind or fire and I felt something there with me, something vast and malicious and ancient.  He turned his head and broke eye contact and then I was back on the sidewalk and I was gasping with sobs.  My face was wet with tears and my body felt cold with fear.

“Oh no, don’t cry,” he sighed.  He fished in his back pocket for a handkerchief and handed it to me.  “I can’t handle crying.  I just wanted you to understand what I am.”

“And what are you?” I sniveled.

He began walking again.  I followed, my steps shaky and I stumbled on a crack in the pavement.

“I’m the devil.”

I stopped cold.

“*The* devil?” I whispered.  I was willing to believe anything at this point.

His lips thinned and he stared off into the distance, contemplating his words.

“Not quite,” he said slowly.  “There *is* a devil like the one you’re thinking of, but at the same time it’s *also* a role that can be filled by others like myself.  You can think of me as the devil, but a little less powerful and a little less evil.”

“So are you… human?”

He laughed.

“Goodness, no.  What a wretched situation that would be.  I’m not human and I reside in hell when I’m not walking the earth.”

We walked a little longer and I contemplated the implications of this arrangement.  I didn’t like what I came up with.

“What happens to me?” I asked softly, as we reached the end of the block.  “Do I go to hell someday?”

He laughed softly and turned us around, heading slowly back towards my house.

“No.  You are your own person.  You will suffer for your parent’s choices, but you aren’t responsible for them.”

“Do I have to kill people someday?”

“No.  You don’t have to do anything.  Your parents uphold the bargain.  When they die, I get their souls, and that secures the agreement for the rest of your lives.  They know this.  But what parent wouldn’t sacrifice everything to ensure their children grow up well?  And certainly, not *all* their children are going to be successful, but two out of three isn’t bad.”

“And if they don’t give you a heart?” I asked, trying to ignore the sly condescension in his voice.

“Things go back to the way they’re supposed to be.  You become average.  You might be able to get into a community college someday.  But your siblings?  Well, track doesn’t pan out for your sister.  Your brother does merely *okay* at football tryouts next year and gets demoted to sitting on the bench.  They’ll get into the state university but they won’t get the scholarships they’re expecting and they graduate with as much debt as everyone else instead of debt-free.  It slows down their ability to get married and buy a house and the fact that their jobs are merely average doesn’t help any either.  Instead of the promising futures they’re currently set on, they get average lives.  Is that what you want?  Would that feel like revenge for all these years of being *inadequate*?”

He had stopped walking and turned to look at me, his dark eyes fixed on mine.  It was like he was staring into my thoughts, how I was thinking that all it would take was one phonecall to the police on the eve of my birthday and my parents would go to jail for attempted murder and the bargain would be broken.  

He hadn’t taken me for a walk to explain what was wrong with me out of pity.  He’d done it because he was the devil and he was here to tempt me, to dangle in front of me what I’d always wanted - to be like my siblings - in the hopes that I would destroy everyone I loved.  

*Is it* destruction, though?  Isn’t it just restoring the world back to the way it *should* be?  Why did *I* have to sacrifice everything?

I put my hands over my ears and walked away from him.  I don’t know if he tried to follow me, but I called back to him that I was done here, that I’d see myself home and I never wanted to see him again.  

Just before I reached home I cut into a neighbor’s yard and watched the house from behind the bushes along the fence.  The kitchen lights were on inside and after a few minutes they went out.  The garage door opened and the minivan backed out, my father driving, my mother in the passenger seat.  The body would be in the back, wrapped in so much plastic, to be disposed of in whatever way they’d made work for the past 18 years or however long this bargain had been going on.  I waited until the car was gone and then I quietly entered the house.  I went down into the basement and stared at the area they’d cleared out.  A strong smell of bleach hung in the air, blotting out the tang of fresh blood.  There was no indication that someone had died down here.  I went back to my room and lay awake in bed until morning.

It was difficult to pretend to be excited for my birthday the next day.  I told my parents that I was still upset about the college rejection letter and my mom hugged me and said it was okay, that no matter what I was going to be just fine.  I didn’t need to go to a prestigious college.  I didn’t need to go to *any* college if I didn’t want to.  I shrugged off her hug.  I didn’t want her touching me.  All I could think about was how she had blood all the way to her elbows.  Was she the one that cut open that man’s chest and pulled his heart out?

I’m so confused.  I don’t know what to do.  My parents are *killing* people and surely that alone means I need to call the police on them, but what kind of person sends their own parents to jail?  Would my siblings thank me?  Would they hate me?  And if they knew what that yearly sacrifice was doing… would they hate me even more for taking away everything they’re good at and ruining their futures?

Their success is bought with blood.  Would they want it, if they knew the cost?  The life of a stranger, every year, and the sacrifice of their older sister?  Their slow, stupid, and sick sister that they pity?

I could lose my whole family.  Or I could stay silent, give them everything they want, and damn myself in the process.

I have a year to decide what to do."

Summary: 

\- Silicon Valley Employer

\- State: CA

&amp;#x200B;

* I am Sikh by religion. (Don't wear Turban though - Brown and have trimmed beard). 
* Some guys at the work (Mostly Facilities) thought I am Afghan or Muslim and started making derogatory comments and hostile behavior against me. Started slamming doors at me and started swearing or cursing at me. 
* I ignored them since they were not in my team and it was not directly affecting my work though it did affected me mentally and made me more reserved, quiet and shy at work. (Stopped going to parties at work and socializing ). Just kept to myself and my work. 
* This happened for almost two years, During these two years they also made a complaint to HR saying I threatened one of the guys when nothing like ever happened.  HR did their investigation and didn't found anything either. 
* This made them even more enraged and they started instigating more and more people from other departments by clamming the he is ""Muslim"". 
* Many people in other departments (Marketing and Finance)  started eyeballing me , Started yelling at me, started slamming doors at a me and some even started swearing and cursing. 
* Then these couple of guys from my Team (whom I directly work with) also started yelling and cursing at me. They turned hostile to me and even stopped talking to me for the work related matters and will act very hostile, rude and disrespectful when I tried to talk to them. (I had to talk to them since they are part of my Team and there input is necessary to get my work done).
* Since, now this is directly affecting my work - I talked to my manger about this who contacted the HR. 
* Lot of high level management was involved in this so I knew HR will not do any thing and hence I contacted only my manager instead of contacting HR directly.
* Manager said he has to first talk to HR and only then he will see what else he can do. 
* As expected HR concluded her investigation within two weeks without even getting the proper input form me claiming nothing happened. 
* They stopped as soon as complained filed to HR and started again as soon as the HR investigation was over. This means that HR did alerted them about the complaint even though this supposed to be kept confidential. This is also documented with my manager and he also agreed the she leaked the complaint to the perpetrators. 
* After this, I started getting letters from HR regarding my performance and why I would not be promoted. Before this I never had any performance issue  and In-fact was promoted once in last two years as well as got extra bonus on top of the 100% bonus for my performance.
* Moreover, I also got letter from HR claiming that I am harassing the witnesses and they will treat it as misconduct even though I just talked to couple of witnesses only once. 
* I talked to my Manger about this but appeared helpless ( Probably Under pressure from Higher Management) - and  said ""I don't know how legal is this"". 
* I know higher management was involved in getting rid of me after my complaint and my manager wanted to stand by me against this injustice. I did overheard VP of my department talking to CEO (Immediately when I filed the complaint) about removing me and another VP celebrating and showing me eyes once she came to know I am about to be fired (one day before my firing). 
* I think my manager finally gave in to pressure to safe guard his job and I was ultimately fired by saying that I am not a good fit for the job. (They removed the performance issue and misconduct language from the final letter since I asked for the proof of performance issue). 
* Also, One first time I talked to my Manager about this said he knew about them calling me Muslim and  filing fake complaints about me but he didn't knew it was that swear and they were yelling at me.
* I contacted several lawyers but they are not willing to take it up on contingency basis. They said it very hard to prove these kind of cases unless discrimination was done directly by my superior.  
* I contacted EEOC and they did agreed with me that I do have valid case but not for discrimination but retaliation. I have not filed the formal complaint with EEOC as yet. 

Main concerns:

* This is a very big loss for me. I literally put day and night in this company since this still in the startup mode and there is just lot of work and new releases. I have even worked during the Christmas Holidays. I put my health and social life on the back burner to get some the projects to realization. 
*  It takes lot of hard work and time to build relationships and reputation in the industry and now  my job status in the background check comes as being terminated. Which will cause lot of harm in my future career and job prospects. 
*  I didn't had any issues with any one at the company - even in this high pressure environment I always kept my cool even when some other employees were frustrated, burned out belligerent because of the high pressure work environment. 
* I am just paying the price of my skin color or religious discrimination. This is obviously really painful and  traumatic. I lost almost everything I so diligently built in last two and a half years. It is very depressive, nightmarish and unpleasant. 
* I am trying to move on but it is very difficult and I am not able concentrate in my new job. Which actually pays half then what I made before and is all way across the country in east coast. 

So what are my options here: 

* What is the best way to go about this since professional lawyers are not willing to pick this case?
* Is there some other organisation I can take help from who can help me with organizing and filing the case? Since lawyers are not willing to take it up? 
* Should I file the complaint with EEOC or Should I try to negotiate directly with employer to see if they are willing to mediate instead of going to court? 
* Is going to court necessary? 
* Can I ask to reinstate me? EEOC said it's possible but lawyers said not possible. The guy I talked to at EEOC was an intern so I don't know if he is really that much expert in the CA employment law.
* The EEOC guy said that I have really strong case and I must file the complaint then why the experienced lawyers are not willing to take it up? 
* Is it advisable to go with EEOC or I must find a lawyer?  
* Is it advisable to spend around $10000 on this if no lawyer is willing to take it on contingency basis? 
* Can I ask the company to remove the termination language from my record until this issue is resolved. 
* Any kind help and suggestion will be greatly appreciated.  

*I can provide more details if required.*"

I graduated Computer Engineering in April 2018 so over a year ago and I've been working in an unrelated field  for a year outside the USA in a niche field that is not related to software dev or tech at all. After year of saving I have decided to start my career and go back to my home (USA) and work there. 

I have that found that it is difficult to get a job without experience which is disheartening. I only have a 4 months Software Engineering Internship I did in 2017. I am pretty much applying from the PHILIPPINES to jobs all around the USA. I am a US citizen.

At the moment, I shifted my plans to working at ACCENTURE here in PHILIPPINES for a year to build my resume as a software engineer and then try my luck again.

Can anyone please give their input on this? Would it be better to go home now and keep applying. Do I even have the chance of getting a job in the USA at the moment? Please help.

d1lnio,0,2019-09-08,My situation,kermit54,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d1lnio/my_situation/,"I'm going to give a bit of backstory:

&amp;#x200B;

I was born into a family where both my parents were in business and did very well. Despite being only 5 foot tall and the only female in her office (besides clerks) my mom managed to get all the way into management in her company. My dad has (and continues to be) extremely successful in business, he currently works as a vice president of a mid-sized company.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom's dad (my grandpa) also was very successful in business despite coming from humble beginnings. Him and my parents always pushed business for the field to go into when I was growing up. When I was little I used to tell my mom I wanted to be a fashion designer (late elementary school until middle school), my mom's answer was always ""good lucky making money."" The same thing with when I was considering being a hairstylist when younger, my grandpa and family basically told me that's not a good job and I should go into ""something I'm interested in."" I always found this odd considering that's what I was interested with at the time. I now have no interest into going into either of these fields (not because of my parents, just more life experiences made me realize that's not where my interests lied plus I was terrible at  the skills required for fashion design and hairstyling).

&amp;#x200B;

My junior year of high school I really enjoyed my English teacher and her class and my parents actually encouraged I possibly go to college for that. They thought I'd be a good teacher. This was always interesting to me as my mom has spoken about how a teacher isn't a super sustainable position. This whole thing was very out of character for them and a bit confusing.

My senior year of high school I didn't like my English classes at all (I took multiple) and figured it was simply that one class and teacher I loved. People suddenly started telling me I should model. I did a few ""photoshoots"" with friends and realized I actually really enjoyed it and was good at it. So that's definately where I'd say my love lied. I tried to get signed to an agency my senior and freshman year of college but no luck. It's hard to say how ""close"" I was to getting signed. I'd say probably further than the average person but not super close at any time.

I didn't know what I really wanted to major in going into colelge. I settled on fashion merchandising and marketing. Realized my freshman year my love didn't lie there so I dropped out and decided I'd finish my associates at a community college. That same summer I had an interview for a modeling agency I was ""scouted"" for on Instagram, sadly after the interview I wasn't signed.

&amp;#x200B;

This is where things start to get messy (and my life falls apart)...

&amp;#x200B;

The agent thought apparently I was awkward in the interview. This hit hard as I knew from simple observation (and studying my favorite show, Survivor) that awkardness was the worst quality to have. I even remember explicitly thinking before the interview, it's okay if I don't get signed, it's a great experience and as long as I don't come off as awkward it's been a success. Well, so that was very disappointing!!!

&amp;#x200B;

I have Aspergers (diagnosed at 8 years old) and that's definately one of the defining qualities of it. To make matters worst this is suddenly when shows like ""Atypical"" and ""The Good Doctor"" came out. Real flattering to be labeled as atypical, thanks guys :( :( :(. So I finished my associates in general business at my community college. My dad got a new job in my hometown (he had been working in Colorado the past two years) so it was time to move back. My social awkwardness was still very much an issue for me. I settled on marketing as a major for college (seemed like the most versatile business degree and I knew I didn't want to do accounting as I hadn't had success in the organization part in previous classes).

&amp;#x200B;

That summer I applied for many marketing (some non-marketing internships), I literally just kept applying, I lost count. Surprisingly I had few call-backs. So I decided to go for an hourly job, again, very few responses. Upon reviewing my applications I noticed EVERY place that asked if I had a disability (they included Aspergers as one) I got no call-back for yet most of the (admittedly few) that didn't ask that question I got call-backs for. So at this point I realize the likely issue and I'm pretty much just done. I had a very small internship before my junior year of door-to-door sales (wouldn't really call it an internship, that's a generous title).

&amp;#x200B;

In addition, my social awkwardness isn't getting any better. I honestly keep trying, I've gone gluten free, I got that door-to-door sales internship. I totally failed at it sadly, I was practically the lowest seller and my comments from my trainer were always along the lines of ""you're not connecting with people"" (thanks Aspergers/awkwardness). In general, I'm much more noticing my Aspergers traits. Like there's sometimes a group of people and my mom or dad, etc. will easily join their convo. despite not knowing them at all. Yet I just can't do that, I always come off like I'm intruding.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents I guess you could say see me in ""rose colored"" glasses. They see nothing wrong with me. They claim that rejection letters happen to everybody. They weren't that great socially when they started, they became it. I always think (and tell them), ""if I was the same amount of awkward as you, why was I diagnosed with Aspergers???????""

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like they're underestimating the struggle. In addition, I met with an Aspergers specialist to get further help and she said ""you know, you may have to go to ten more interviews than the average person before you do well enough to get the job."" Because that's SUPER practical!!! That's basically saying you'll take four years of interviewing until you get a job. Even if that was an exagerration, still nothing about this is practical.

My mom wants me to go to see a psychologist at my college but given that past one I don't have much hope, plus I don't even know what to tell them anymore. I got the gluten-free idea from another Aspergers specialist and that also hasn't had a huge impact (other than losing around 10 lbs. on my already thin body).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of trying modeling again since that seemed to be the area I had the most success with (this is PURE speculation though). But I'm also worried I'll be slapped with the label of ""he's so desperate to be a model he'll just keep trying and not look for a real job."" I've been looking for jobs like crazy though.

&amp;#x200B;

And to top it all off, I do like people. My parents always say, why not go into sales, you love people! They seem to forget I did and failed. And pretty much any job has dealing with people.

&amp;#x200B;

My siblings both have done very well, my brother in economics (so not in business) and my sister in accounting. I'm not going to lie, I do come from a wealthy family. My mom always tells me that the money isn't going to last forever and they won't take care of me forever, I need to get a job. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO!!!!!!!  She's always so sympathetic when I don't get the job and then the next day reminds me I need to get a job at some point. It's my senior year of college so I don't even know what they're attitude will be next year when I'm not even in college.

&amp;#x200B;

Honestly I'm tired of life. If Aspergers allowed assisted suicide I'd definately take it. I've openly asked my mom why it isn't allowed. Idk exactly what advice I'm looking for but any help is appreciated! Thanks for reading, truly!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also a guy, if that matters"

I am a senior at a small rural school without a lot of EC options and no AP classes. Ranked 1 out of 78

**GPA:** 4.0 UW

**SAT**: 1440 (730 RW) (710 M) , Looking to hit a 1500 in October but I am trying to be realistic with my current score.

My SATIIs are super bad. I am planning to submit them to only the required schools,

&amp;#x200B;

**ECs:**

Student Body VP - Always have been active in leadership with class VP role. I  will get to plan school activities and staff appreciation week. But I usually take a leadership position in school activities because it is something I genuinely enjoy doing.

Robotics - FTC robotics for the last 5 years, was an original member (like the first year) of the team in the 8th grade and continued to my senior year. State qualifying last year.

Rocketry - Participated in a high power rocketry class at my school for 4 years. Formed a competition rocketry club last year and was president of it. I am going to do the same next year. Mentored younger rocketry students and did tons of outreach events at local schools. Got to give a presentation at Oregon State about the rocket that I designed in front of their rocketry class which was the lit (the rocket failed tho). Attempting to earn my Junior L1 Certification which is the highest level of certification that a person under 18 can receive in a week. I am hoping that this will be a good hook with me being a girl and also from a sucky rural high school. Rocketry has been the only reason that I didn't transfer.

NHS - Been in since sophomore year, secretary last year but am I trying to be president this year. I am likely to get the position and would get to plan the blood drive which I am pumped about.

Engineering/Manufacturing Summer Internship - Over the summer worked 24 hr/wk at a rapid manufacturing business that specialized in Multi Jet Fusion 3D printing, as well as other manufacturing processes. Got to do a lot of clerical stuff but also got to run simulations on designs to test integrity which was super cool. Created new inventory system and did a lot of data management. Designed a simple way to preform a cantilever stress test for the material that the MJF printed. Honestly it was an eye opening experience. Also was mentored and grew close with a girl that worked there which was awesome.

Future Medical Proffesionals Club - I started a club junior year for students that were interested in joining the healthcare industry. We went on a field trip, talked about local scholarships. I personally lead a food/fund drive that raised enough for 300+ meals for our local food bank. I don't think that I will do this again this year because I don't really have the time to manage it.

XC/Track - Been varsity for 4 years (small school haha) I haven't had a leadership position but we don't really do that

Mock trial - Since Sophmore year. Won MVP award like 5 times (awarded once per trial), team won state. Joined on the forming year so I have got to help the team grown.

Kids Camp  - I have worked for my town's summer program that leads kids camps. Got to teach basic CAD and programming. Did a general science one too, as well as a pool supervision one. Only 3 weeks out of the summer and low hours

**Course load:**

Small schools mean no AP or IB classes. I have a whole lot of credits because I am trying to learn as much as possible. I have taken all the math (up to calculus), writing, and science classes at my school and have gotten college credit when possible. This year I am looking to take a class at a community college to keep challenging myself.

&amp;#x200B;

**LOR**:

STEM/Engineering/Math Teacher - will be great, he has been teaching me since I was a 7th grader. He supervises a lot of the stuff that I do and is great with recs 8/10

Humanities Teacher - I don't really have a great option. It will probably be fine 5/10

Additional - Mentor at internship - will be very good, she has a lot of respect for me and tells me that she would invest money in me because she thinks I will be successful. 7/10

&amp;#x200B;

**Essay:**

Writing an essay about how I like to put myself in environments where I feel like I don't belong because I enjoy learning for the sake of learning. I am a pretty strong essay writer 8/10

&amp;#x200B;

Awards:

My weakness. Generic Mock trial awards, athlete scholar awards, nothing noteworthy

Major: 

Applying as biomed engineering primarily

&amp;#x200B;

Right now the colleges on my list are:

Reach - Brown, Wash U, CWRU, John Hopkins, Northwestern, MIT, Georgia Tech, Stanford, Rice, U of Mich, Cornell (I know I need to narrow down) Calpoly, Vanderbilt

Match - Virignia Tech, U of T Austin, Willamette University (From the area and great scholarship)

Saftey - Oregon State University, University of Oregon

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for mid size colleges that are not completely rural and surrounded by corn fields. I want them to be close to a city at least. I do not want a fragmented campus. Anywhere on the coast is a plus. I don't really care about weather but prefer overcast to excessive heat. Greek life shouldn't be the only way to be social, but I don't want a dead school either. I want to go somewhere with a love for learning. Please help me refine my list - Thanks in advance!!!"

&amp;#x200B;

1. the course i'm doing gives me many opportunities to work with foreign firms and embassy stationed in singapore (as interns and as permanent staff). and my multi-lingual skills put me at an advantage to try working overseas as well.
2. i've been doing sciences since secondary school all the way to JC and i have a big passion for biology or anything clinical (but my results hindered me from science courses even for private unis)

so i've been charting out for possible ways i can pursue what i love and what is the reality. yes, to do what i love and to love what i do is the most ideal but in such a time and economic climate where employment is just so competitive, it'll be a luxury to be able to do the above. these are some plans that i've made after some research.

&amp;#x200B;

1. stick in private uni for a year, re-do a-levels next year and if i do sufficiently well for a science course in  a local uni, i drop out of private uni.
2. stay in private uni for 3 years, graduate, go out to work and pay existing bank 'debts' and eventually do science as a graduate student.
3. drop out now and look for schools overseas that can accept my results into their science courses.

i haven't met enough seniors to ask if local universities accept such big jumps from a social science to a life-science stream/ engineering/ medicine etc. stream and also especially if we come from private universities (i believe that the hierachy of universities still exist). i am also rather curious if duke-nus would consider private university students of another major hehe

what do you think is the best choice? have a nice day everyone and i thank all of you in advance for your opinions \^\^"

The team lead who interviewed me described the job tasks similar to what I read on here: data collection, organize, analyse and create reports for test and simulation data generated during product development. 

The odd thing is, there's no mention of the usual thing I see for data analysis like R, Python, Tableau or even SQL. The team lead, who I think is in charge of managing the data and whom I'll be working directly under, does his works with MATLAB and Excel. This makes me unsure of what my workflow would be, since the situation is a bit different from the usual data analyst's role I've read on the web. Is this common for R&amp;D lab teams to operate this way? Would I still be able to pickup and apply Python/R and SQL for my job?"

Using a throwaway account as my main already has a lot of identifying information and is known by my irl friends. 

I recently graduated from a Top 20 University in the UK with a first in Computer Science. I have a 2 month internship as a intern developer as well as two commercial projects on my CV. I've been interviewing at a few different companies and was offered a role at a company last Friday. They essentially build products for other companies. They're currently offering a salary of £36,000 and shares in the company, alongside other benefits such as private healthcare, a technology budget and unlimited training courses. For context, in the UK average graduate salary is around £30k and private healthcare isn't offered by every company.

Since this is my first job offer, I was wondering whether I should negotiate over salary and share options. Its a fantastic company to work for, from talking to people who work there and online reviews from Glassdoor. 

However, I did read in CTCI that you should always negotiate and try to get something extra. I was wondering what a good salary I should try negotiate for. I am considering asking for £40,000, but I'm not sure whether that's too much of a increase from the already quite good salary they're offering. Additionally, if there is something I'm missing here and should ask for instead, would love to hear about that too.

Please let me know any thoughts on the offer and how I would go forward with negotiating if I did decide to ask for more money."

I am also not that in a rush to get hired, as I still need to figure out my moving and have money set aside. I expect it will take a while anyway, so I will try to focus on some side-projects and leetcode questions. That being said, here are some questions:

1. Is it doable to get a job doing this from the beginning, or should I brush up on my C#, get a job doing that, as I already have some experience, and attempt to do data engineering/data science side projects and keep applying to related jobs?

But I'm worried I don't have enough experience to be considered for an interview or even succeed if I do get a technical interview. The main reassurance I have is that I read quite often that in college the goal is to get the degree and learn how to learn, and once you get to the industry they should teach more of what you need to.

I was offered a position for a paid internship, which I am very excited about. 

My fear is that I would have to leave my current job and benefits. My main concern is health insurance. I have a chronic illness and was recently diagnosed with another. In order to manage my symptoms I have to take medication daily, and check in with my doctor every 3 months or so. 

I feel as if I am taking a bit of a gamble with this position. I interviewed in person with a higher up in the company that mentioned they could definitely see a path opening up for me to be hired before graduation as long as I do well. And the internship is for a couple months, with a potential job offer at the end depending on performance. HR also mentioned they have a good intern to hire program. But I’m concerned because I’ve always learned not to trust verbal promises. 

The internship is paid but it’s part time. And barely covers my rent, so I have to dig into my savings for the next few months. I don’t have enough in savings to cover $300 a month in private health insurance costs a month though. Will an internship help me get hired in the future? And is it the only way to move forward? Or perhaps if you were in my shoes what would you do?

Location: United States

While I was in university, I tried applying for a few internships here and there but never got any callbacks. I ended up getting a resume review from my university's Career Center and it didn't seem to help much. Fast forward to my senior year, I started applying to new grad jobs (around 50). I had 2 responses which are described below:

1. Coding test (focus on OOP) and video of self responding to interview question into rejection after several months
2. Coding test into phone interview into on-site interview into rejection

And then I graduated in May 2017 without a job lined up.

(throughout the entire following time, I learn new stuff/contribute to open source/do freelance work/work non cs related job)

I applied for approximately 150 new grad jobs between that time and January 2018 and got a combination of no responses and rejections. This is the first time I came on this sub and asked for advice, where everyone told me to share my resume and I did so on the resume sharing thread. A lot of the advice actually contradicted what I was told by the Career Center like don't have a personal statement and layout stuff so that probably helped. I also did try following up after my application like a lot of threads say but I usually was ignored or, once, I was flat out told there was no response because the company was not interested in me.

After that, I applied for another large batch of jobs (around another 150) and also tried signing up for those recruiting services where they'll put an application in for you if you're skilled enough. I got a few responses but nothing came of those. The recruiting service said we could try again in a few months and none of the jobs I manually applied to gave any positive responses. I'll summarize the responses with each company below:

1. (for recruiting service) Coding test into video interview into accepted
2. Phone interview with someone, going to onsite interview, but position was filled before I could even get interviewed
3. Phone interview then rejected
4. I was researching a company that was suggested to me by the recruiting service, found programming puzzle on page which was just decode hex/base64 stuff and send to email, after which I got a coding test, then a phone interview, then ghosted. The application the recruiting company sent for me got rejected, too so I actually got further via that manual email than via the recruiting company.

So yeah, nothing good then. After this, I decided to take a break from applying for a couple months. When the few months passed, I started applying to more jobs now new grad and entry level (around another 150). Again, nothing and also nothing from the recruiting service. At this point I decided to just stop applying for around a year. A funny thing is that at this time I ended up getting a rejection from a company I applied to before I graduated.

Fast forward that year and I came back into the resume sharing thread for some more advice where I got help with specifically wording the bullet points so everything sounded extremely elaborate even though it's just actual simple stuff. I start applying to jobs again only entry level (another 100), and I actually got some responses which I'll detail below again:

1. Video interview into ghost
2. Phone interview into ghost (I was told during the call there would be no response if not interested)
3. Response into me declining because they only did on-site interviews halfway across the country
4. Presentation on company into phone interview into rejection
5. Coding test into Skype interview into rejection
6. Phone interview into video interview into non-coding test into on-site interview into offer

And then I accepted the offer and have been working at this place since. The compensation is a lot lower compared to the US average for entry level (&lt;50k), but I just really wanted to get my first job and after working here for a month I can honestly say I enjoy it.

I revised my resume 4 times, applied to around 600 jobs, and wrote around 12 cover letters (they were repurposed per application) over the past 2-3 years and it finally landed me a job. Thank you to everyone that helped me!"
d1uzys,107,2019-09-09,What I did to take advantage of IR,BungholeSauce,Purdue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Purdue/comments/d1uzys/what_i_did_to_take_advantage_of_ir/,"I just recently graduated in May and I am now working a full time position that I secured from IR2018. I had attended IR the previous 3 years and had only received two interviews, one of which turned into an internship. This last go around, I changed how I approached IR and I got 27 interviews (counting followups) solely from the job fair, so I am going to tell you guys what helped me. 

* Don’t be nervous. 
    * Most people will be nervous when they speak to the recruiters. Weak voice, shaky legs, etc. This will only hurt you. Given I have no experienced how recruiting is for the employer, it is really more lax than you would think. An employer can mostly tell if you can do the job or not from your resume, so the purpose of these interviews and introductions are to see if you’re a good fit with the workplace environment. Being cool, easygoing, but still technical and confident will make you stand out to the recruiters after having surely many painfully awkward encounters. 

* Take control of the conversation. 
    * A mistake that I’ve noticed is that people prepare and study typical interview questions and just stand in front of the recruiter, bracing and ready to answer any question they might have. We’ll consider this a defensive strategy. Essentially you make the recruiter have to figure out who you are, which they might not do a good job in, instead of you taking control of that. A strong opening, which I’ll cover later, as well as managing the direction of the conversation will not only be a relief to the recruiter, but also allow you to showcase yourself the way you want to be. 

* “I’m good how about you” (boring)
    * Every encounter starts the same. “How are you?” A recruiter goes through this with every single person that stands in line. Same education, similar backgrounds— the applicants tend to blend together. Having a prepared, quick, and colorful answer to this mundane question was one of the most important changes I’ve made. Instead of saying “I’m good,” I’d say “you know, it’s much too hot out to be wearing a suit but I’m excited for this opportunity to network and you have to stand out here all day so I appreciate you taking the time to come out to this job fair. How’s it been going?” This throws the recruiter out of routine and forces them to actually think about a question instead of just rehearsing lines. This works to show who you are and energize the conversation. 

* Internships: less what you’ve done and more what you’ve learned
    * In all honesty, I barely talked about my previous intern projects. I’d mention them briefly to show the scope of my work, my involvement, and the technical skills I must have had in order to complete it, but I’d quickly moved to what I learned. For example, I worked at a distribution facility for a fortune 40 company. Instead of getting in the weeds about the specific optimization work I did, I’d mention that at first, it was a challenge to learn what was going on. I’d say that I learned it was imperative for me to gather as much information as I can before attacking a problem, often saying “Abe Lincoln is accredited to saying ‘if I had 5 hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first 4 sharpening my axe,’ and that is kind of the way I approach problems.” I’d talk about what I struggled with and how I overcame it. This is what the recruiters look for— not what you’ve done, but how you’ll be able to manage what you will do. 

* edit: Be cute
    * throw some personality when you answer questions. For example, I interviewed a CPG company that makes many cleaning products amongst other things. When asked what my favorite product was, I answered: “X, because as you know I’m a college student, and I’ve used X for a long time. X has cleaned everything that 3 _college dudes_ have conjured up, so I know it’s legit,” and that made them almost instantly reach for the interview signup sheet. Another example is when I was asked by a cereal manufacturer as to what my favorite cereal was and I said: “let me tell you, the cereal game is peaking right now. I’m aware of all the mashups that cereals are doing right now like Girl Scout cookie and sour patch kids cereals... I ask you, is it even possible to have a favorite?” These sorta non-answers go a long way to making the recruiter (who is often just a few years out from where you are right now) liking you and giving you a shot with an interview. 

Formatting may be weak because I’m on my phone. I’m open to answering any questions y’all may have. Good luck!"

I finished a summer internship last month in the United States have since returned to school to graduate in 8 months.

I profited a little over $20k and it's currently sitting in my American chequing account (I'm using a credit union called SFCU). I've moved back to Canada where I'm down to about ~2k in my Canadian chequing account (I'm using a bank called CIBC). For what it's worth, my cost of living for the next 8 months has also been taken care of, so I don't really need to be using this ~20k for anything right now. Though I do expect to be using it to pay of my student loans when I graduate.

Now, with the background out of the way, here's where I'd appreciate your advice:

My current plan is to bring the money back into my Canadian account (plan on using TransferWise and not just doing an international wire, as I've found the rates are much much better). With my Canadian bank I plan on opening a saving account that rewards 1% interest.

Now to me the 1% interest seems sort of lame (don't think that even covers inflation?). I was wondering if it'd be worth it to place the money somewhere else. However I'm worried that me needing the money in 8 months will make any sort of investment options pretty non-existent.

Any advice for my situation here? Thanks in advance."

I just passed three months (moving onto four months) at this new job where I do desktop support. However, I get hit up by recruiters on Linkedin all the time and I was offered an interview at an MSP doing 2nd level support completely remotely, like from home. The responsibilities and benefits (e.g. vacation) looks like they would be better, and I already have a year and a half of first level MSP experience anyway. Before that, I had 2 years and 8 months of experience doing basic tech support for an ISP.    


I have raised my salary extensively by switching positions but I am worried what a four month stint would look like on my resume IF this position seems interesting and I go for it. It would be the only short-term stint I've had recently where I've been at a position less than a year, not including my internships many years back. Of course I intend to interview to the best of my ability and would be asking all the appropriate questions and probably more, as I am already secure in a job anyway. I know that MSP's aren't popular around here and while I've had my grievances with them in the past, the variety of work and challenge can be interesting. If it turns out to be a good company/position, I might seriously consider it.

Hey /r/csMajors,

Today I am announcing the first public launch of [**Cutback.io**](https://cutback.io), a site that will automatically apply to jobs for you.

2 years ago I first experienced the pain of applying to internships. I applied to over 150 CompSci internships manually and hated every minute of it. Since then I've been working on a project that makes the process easier, simpler, and faster. Today, it's ready to be checked out!

Cutback is completely free to use, and how it works can be summarized in 3 steps:

1. Save your info on Cutback (name, resume, education, etc.)

2. Search our always-updated database of jobs (tech internship focused!)

3. Apply and watch as we used your saved information to auto-fill your application

----

That's the core of Cutback, but there's much more to it, too. Cutback is on a mission to simplify the job application process, so we do other things like:

* Cutback Draft: A Draft on Cutback is a way to make your application process more pleasant by providing a familiar interface for every job you apply to.

* Upload variations of your resume and quickly choose which one you want to use for a given application.

* Advanced search: search by coding skills, companies, location, etc.

*  Absolutely NO ""external applications."" All of the jobs on Cutback can be applied to on Cutback.

* Unlike other job boards, Cutback aims to get rid of ""dead links."" Other job boards will also waste your time by linking to jobs that are closed. We aren't 100% there yet, but almost all the jobs you see on Cutback are still open thanks to our robust monitoring.

* And much more!

This is the first time I have shared this project with anyone outside of our previous private beta. There might be a few bugs here and there as this is our first public launch, but it really does work. The site is **100% free** to use and I really think you will love it. As of writing this, there are thousands of real internships available right now! If you're skeptical of how it works, apply to a job and then click the ""Review"" button. It will show you a live image of your job application.

I hope someone here is as excited about this as I am. I am really eager to hear your feedback and what you think of Cutback :-) It's literally been years in the making.

Some background: graduated may 2017 with a bachelor’s in finance. I worked throughout college and only had 1 internship which was in PWM. I’m currently working in financial operations which I’m over. I’m looking to break into an FP&amp;A role. My dilemma is I don’t have anything I can relate to the role, which is making it hard to land any interviews. I somehow landed an interview a few months back and made it to the final round but they ultimately chose someone with more experience which is understandable.

I’m learning the essentials in excel right now, which I’ll add to my resume once I get the hang of them. I’m also thinking of doing the wallstreetprep basic course to show my interest and willingness to learn. It’ll also fill up some of the empty space on resume. Good idea or is it a waste of time and money?

I just wanted to know how I can maximize my chances of getting into it Tesla and what questions they tend to ask. I already plan to do some extra research on Tesla prior to the interview so I can be a little more prepared. Also, my GPA is kinda questionable (around a 2.7-2.8ish), is that going to affect my chances of getting in? I didn't put my GPA down on my resume but more emphasized the projects that I've done on the side besides from school projects .

Down here, I just wanted to express my concerns 
in regards If I possibly get an offer from tesla:

- I'm aware that more than likely you'll be working 50+ hours a week, but is that even possible during classes or do they ask you to take a semester off? I looked at my current schedule right now in school and theres no way to even fit that many hours.
- in regards to work-social life balance, would that even be possible because being social is usually what helps to keep me sane. How did you previous interns fare?
- what is the compensation like?
-if I had other options, would you suggest I prioritize those opportunities over the Tesla one?

I understand the point of an internship is to be able to get practical experience in your field but I'm also trying to weigh my options with consideration of my sanity. My university is also having an engineers expo so I'll be able to explore other opportunities.

Thank you for any answers in advance."
d1z9z2,0,2019-09-09,Is work life balance something I can expect at a high tier job?,Sneet1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d1z9z2/is_work_life_balance_something_i_can_expect_at_a/,"Long story short, I got graced with frankly a pretty good job right out of college.

Large company with a huge tech presence (but not big N), not a prime location but because of that TC for cost of living is very high (almost touching 6 figures before stock and benefits in a place where I can pay $500 for rent). Stack is contemporary and good experience, generous WFH, etc. etc. Of course there are some issues, but it's not genuinely awful.

However, I was hired as a Software Engineer, but we do a lot of devops. I wouldn't say it's fully a devops job, I do a lot of development driving new features/migrations. However, I'm also expected to do support and deployments. That makes it interesting when it is during normal business hours, but...

So I'm a few months in and realizing this is the 15th time I'm going to bring my laptop with me to plans outside, to go and do some small deployment and verify something. I've actually gone on two dates recently where I had to veer us off to a cafe with wifi so I could check on something after being pinged on slack.

I would say I probably only do 50 hours of work a week, but it seems I need to be available almost always. The thing is, most of the other engineers in the office and the managers work like this too. I'm the only one at my technical level , out of school, at my office. I guess for the others who go home and have kids that's okay. But honestly, I am pretty social, I play in bands, I travel, I do things like that. Tech is just a means to an end so I can afford to get a Masters in what I'm actually passionate about, so I tend to go home and study/work on those skills too.

Is this normal? I know I signed my soul for at least a year (plus the TC is too good relative to my other offers) if I want to maintain a nice resume. During recruiting I didn't have the internship experience to get offers after a few onsites for a top company job. But if I did start searching hard, say and landed a job in SI or Bloomberg or something, can I expect 9-5s?  Is it normal to have to be available basically always?"

Freshman year I applied for 47 positions coupled with my high school achievements, recently joined clubs, typical few years of spanish, and a cover letter. After a few rejected applications, I sought out my Six Sigma Certification. More and more rejections started to feed in. Spring semester, loaded with weed-out courses, I self-taught Python and SQL. Companies that forgot to send out rejections, finally started to send them out. I hung around my summer-job for the fourth year in a row, at least I was a shift supervisor. Alongside regular open-to-close clock-ins, I took courses in Physics and CS, while attending weekly tutorials for Excel and Tableau. 

Round 2, Let’s go. Fall semester came around, Engineering and Business Career Fairs, but this time 94 applications. A few companies gave me a shot, even made it to the second and final round for a few companies all the way till January. I left the United States for 4.5 months to study in Madrid, Spain and travel to 37 cities across 14 countries, forming indescribable stories, phenomenal friends, and discovering life-altering changes to myself. Sprinkled throughout the semester, I found myself video-chatting with a few companies, yet still receiving the well-known, “Thank you for your interest in…”. Mid-April I went through a four round video-interview populated with HR reps, Project Managers, C-Levels, yet again, I got beat out by a stronger candidate. In the final round of this interview, I was told I my passion was apparent, but my GPA was .05 lower than, “what we would’ve liked to see”, and to cap it off, “maybe engineering isn’t the path for you”, I was told a story about myself by someone who didn’t even know me, yet I pondered if they were right. For years I’ve installed this mentality; Someone’s opinion of you does not have to become your reality. And it didn’t. Your reality is what you set it out to be. 

I continued to hunt down internships and nearing the beginning of June, I did it. I was the candidate they wanted. My resume, my values, and even my GPA is what they wanted. More importantly, it’s what I wanted. For two years, nearly 150 applications later, I achieved a major goal. My investments in certifications, classes, clubs, experiences, studying abroad, finally came together. Those who landed an internship out of the gate in the fall, congratulations, but to those who didn’t, yet worked endlessly for one, know this... Everything happens for a reason. 
Just run it back, continue to invest in your education, your involvements, and yourself. It’s a new recruiting class starting this fall for thousands of companies, and hopefully you’ll see the deviated response beginning with, “Congratulations…”

Sorry for the length. Hope this helps at least one person"

Please forgive any spelling/grammar/formatting errors....i'm just dumb.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the early 2000's I worked for a DIAL-UP/DSL ISP in Hawaii.  As a new intern, an unpaid one, I got to answer the phones and provide some tech support.  The company had a script and basic troubleshooting steps that needed to be done before handing off to an experienced Tech.  This call came in on my 3rd day there.   

Cast FL = Fustrated Lady, CW=CoWorker, Me=dumdum

Me: Thank you for calling \*ISP\*, this is \*dumdum\*, how can I help you

FL: Hi, I have been trying to connect to the internet and I cant get on.  Is there some problem you guys are having?

Me:  Sorry to hear that Ma'am, I'll help you out the best that I can.  If you can please hold on while i check the system?

After reviewing the system screens, I see that there are no issues with the servers or the modem bank.  Ask CW to check and confirms there is no issues on our side.

Me: Sorry for the wait Ma'am, I just checked the systems and had the administrator check as well and we don't see any issues.  Can i please have your account number and I'll check on your account status.

FL: Its 55555555.  Can you please hurry this up?  I need to check my emails.....

Me: Sure thing Ma'am, Ok I see that you have a Dial-up connection at 56K speeds, and.......

At this point I hear a clicking sound, like someone is picking up and hanging up a phone on the line.  

Me: Ma'am is there someone at your home trying to use the phone?  

FL: No I live alone.

Clicking continues.

Me: Ok Ma'am, we are going to do some quick troubleshooting steps so I can get an idea of what could be causing the issue.

Clicking continues.

FL: I've been trying this whole time to connect and it wont go through, something has to be wrong on your end!!!

\*\*LIGHTBULB! DING DING DING!!!!!  I finally figured out the problem...

Me: OK Ma'am, just need to clarify something.  You have been trying to connect to the internet on your dial-up service while on the phone?  

FL: Yes, I already said that!!

Me: Do you by any chance have a 2nd phone line connected to your modem?  In other words do you pay the telco for 2 phone numbers?

FL: No I only have one....why does it matter?????

Me: Ma'am dial-up service works through your phone line, you can only use one function at a time.  If you are on your phone then you cant use the internet, vise-versa you cant use the phone while on the internet.  Could you please do me a favor and hang up and try again.  

FL: NO!  YOU ARE JUST TRYING TO GET ME OFF THE PHONE SO YOU DONT HAVE TO FIX IT!!!!

Me: No Ma'am, I'll be here for the next few hours and will be taking calls.  I need you to do this so i can test your connection.  I assure you I'll answer if you try again and cant get on.

FL: YOU BETTER!!!

She hangs up and I check the system monitor, sure enough, I see her account pop up on our ""modem farm.""  I watch for a few minutes and see here up and running.  I then see her account drop off and the phone rings again.

Me: Thank you for calling \*ISP\*, this is \*dumdum\*, how can I help you

FL: It works now, but when i picked up the phone i  hear an awful noise.  

As I face-palm myself, CW is laughing and fell out of his chair.

Me: Ma'am thats the sound of the modems talking to each other.  My advise is not to pick up the phone when you are on the internet and all will be good.  Now is there anything else I can help you with?  

FL: No \*click\*"

I don’t know where else to tell my story.

My younger sibling, who is my best friend (they are one of the few people I can be around for long periods of time) has left for college. I barely get to talk to them anymore because they are busy with their studies and college life. I don’t resent them for going to college; in fact I’m happy for them for making the transition and doing so well. I’m just depressed because my only real friend in the world is gone, and I feel so alone. As they meet new people at university, I’m afraid they’ll move farther and farther away from me, and I’ll barely get to be around them anymore. I haven’t really made other friendships as strong as the one with my sibling; all my other “friends” are really just acquaintances who all leave eventually. I have had so many of them leave, as well as so many family members and others in my life die during my lifetime that I don’t feel anything anymore when someone leaves. I have a very empty feeling of loneliness now that my sibling is gone, if that makes any sense. I just don’t feel anything.

I’m also recently unemployed. I graduated from university this year, and I started an internship at a really good company in a field I really want to work in, but I didn’t get hired at the end of it. The job was perfect because it was in my city, the benefits were really good, and it was directly related to my degree. I also knew a few people I graduated with who worked there as well. However, what I didn’t know before I started working there was that most of the people in my department are Mormons. I live in a conservative area of a blue state, and for whatever reason, the department of my office likes to recruit from BYU. It seemed like most of them were very cold to me during my time there. Everyone else from the other departments were really nice, and I got along well with them. No matter how friendly I was, not matter what I did, the Mormons wouldn’t give me the time of day. I would say hello and they would basically ignore me. No one else was like this. I have no solid proof, but I suspect it’s because they thought I was gay. I don’t like some of the Mormon beliefs, but I can work with people different than me; I have before with no issues. The person in charge of the entire department from the office was a Mormon, and I suspect the only reason they hired me was to give the appearance of recruiting from other schools, when they wanted a Mormon in the position the entire time. I would try so hard at my internship, but I felt like an annoyance every time I asked for help, and I felt they were frustrated with me I I didn’t do something quickly enough for their liking. I feel like my entire career up to this point has been a big lie, and I’m now second-guessing my entire career trajectory.

Yesterday I went to my cousin’s birthday party with my parents and my other sibling (the one who did not leave my city to go to university). We ate dinner on the back patio at a few tables. I sat at one table, and my cousin, my other sibling, and my cousin’s friends quickly began to populate another table away from me. They did so even though it was a small table, and there was no one else sitting at my table. It was like none of them wanted to sit with me. They were all talking, laughing and joking about their lives, their jobs and their plans, and I’m single, unemployed and have nothing going for me anymore. I went and sat with my parents so I didn’t look like an antisocial loser. I’m used to people not wanting to be around me, but that hurt. My other sibling doesn’t like me, and I honestly wish they went off to college instead. I haven’t rate anything since the party, which was 24 hours ago, and I don’t feel like eating anything now. I lose my appetite when I’m depressed, and I’m honestly not worried about it because I need to lose weight anyway. I forced myself to throw up some of my dinner last night to give me a head start. 

My days now consist of sitting around at home, sleeping most of the day and night, and building Lego sculptures and listening to YouTube narrations to help me relax. I have no more confidence to look for a new job, and even if I do, it’s going to be in a field I don’t want to work in. I’m stuck with my narcissistic, loud-mouthed Hank Hill father, my anxious, paranoid mother, and a sibling who barely acknowledges my existence. I hate my life and have dreams about running away and starting over somewhere with a new identity. I will probably never be in a relationship with anyone; I will probably be alone the rest of my life. 

If you read this far, thanks."

After high school I went to a community college for 2 years and studied accounting and computer science, did pretty well in those two years and got out with a 3.0 gpa. I never actually graduated from there because I withdrew from some classes and didn't have enough credits. I decided instead of doing another semester of classes and getting my associates there I would transfer to a 4 year college and so I did. Probably the worst mistake of my life. 

The first semester I bombed religion class and my excel class and my gpa dropped to like a 2.4. I thought okay this is gonna be harder than community college so I tried working harder next semester. I failed history and got a D in business analytics while withdrawing from cost accounting class. My gpa is now a 1.7. I was so fucking mad because I'm already behind from all my friends and now I'm even more behind. I don't think any internship would take someone with a 1.7 gpa and accounting is just too hard now and I can't understand it. The accounting classes I took at the 2 year college I got an A and a B so I thought I would be good for accounting. But here I am and I don't know if I can continue this accounting degree even though I'm already so deep into it. I think about changing my major every day but if I do that it's like I wasted 4 years of my life and 4 years of a LOT of money. I don't have any family to go to for help because my dad hates me and my mom passed away 5 years ago and she was the only one who could've helped me with this.

Sometimes I am full of energy, sometimes I am just sleepy all day long. It makes me frustrated and anxious about my future, because even though I am very ambitious, I can't get motivated. I don't know what to do.

Things that are important for me:

* My romantic relationship. I am very happy with my fiancé of 5 years, he is my best friend and I can't say a bad word about him. We would love to get married move in together, but it would be impossible if we had to live on a single income. We are both students. He works. I don't. That leads to...
* Work. I was offered a great job, which got me super hyped up. The offer was revoked for no apparent reason, shortly before the supposed date of contract. I couldn't find a new offer due to the circumstances and I am still unemployed. I have been told that my previous experience and credentials should land me a good job, but it seems that I will have to settle for a low-level position, possibly an unpaid internship. It makes me worried, because I would like to have a job connected to...
* My studies. My grades are good and in general I have little to worry about. On the other hand, I don't know what to do with my career. I study in a very competitive field, but unlike many others, I am not super passionate about it. I become easily interested in whatever I am currently studying, but it is not my hobby. These studies (prestigious, good uni, held in high regard) were a logical choice I could make with little to no effort, not a dream come true. My professors consider me talented, but I don't have a good plan. I was wondering if I should try to graduate early, start another major, go study abroad... I have no idea. That leads to...
* Ambition. I would love to major in different fields, to study abroad... but at the same time I am not sure if it is worth the time and effort, given my lack of good life plan. Furthermore, I am unhappy with an idea of a LDR, and my fiancé would likely stay in the country given his current career path.
* My family. I love them, they are fun, loving and very friendly, but my mum is a bit of a helicopter parent and is not always mentally stable (I think she is bipolar, but has never been diagnosed). They are disappointed with my studies, because they have finished the same studies and they are unhappy with their choices. I think they are biased and don't take many factors into consideration (they made a lot of mistakes I hope not to make). My grandparents are sweet, but sickly and elderly – they are yet another reason I am unsure about the option to go abroad, I would hate to miss the few years or months they have left.
* Projects. I like to do volunteer work and I am involved in many projects. They started overwhelming me, though. Most of my tasks are creative (design and creative writing) and I can't really do them when I am feeling blue. I postpone them, waiting for a miracle, I invent silly excuses and other more pleasant tasks... I am disgusted by myself, frankly. I could man up and do that, for cheesecake's sake, but I choose to be lazy. That's why I am constantly stressed and I cannot truly rest. All the things I had to do were in the back of my head throughout my summer holidays, and I think I didn't rest much. I can't abandon the projects completely, some of them can be extremely beneficial for my career and they did bring me joy. I still enjoy doing these things, I simply detest the fact that I have to do them and that I am late. 

I have a feeling that if I got a lot of money out from nowhere, I would come back to my old self. I would be passionate about everything, I would practice sport much more regularly, I would do a lot of things I can't do now, because I don't find the time. And frankly speaking, I waste my time. I can do nothing but play games and browse Internet or read books all day long. Problems with procrastination are not new for me. They started when I realised that I didn't have to work much in order to get satisfying results. Unfortunately, my behaviour is totally irresponsible at times and I regret it very much – I promise myself that for the next competition, exam, conference I will be much better prepared, but I still wait for the final call to start doing things. I was granted a 'golden child' status early on, but now I see how my underperforming colleagues outperform me in many ways. Good for them, but... I'm worried about my future. It seems that not everything will be as easy for me as predicted.

I don't have any type of addiction apart from procrastination. I am not sad, I don't want to harm myself.I am just angry at myself and completely lost. When I have nothing to do, all anxiety is gone and I am very productive. I have tried establishing routines, with some success. Pomodoro helps me a lot, but hey, I have to turn it on.... and sometimes I can't bring myself to do it. Some days I am really proud of myself, some days I am utterly ashamed. This feeling of physical fatigue is overwhelming, but at the same time I don't see any stamina loss while doing sports. I feel I am wasting my achievements. I need to find a solution. I would greatly prefer self help, but I haven't been a big fan of motivational images / podcasts so far. Please help me...

It's as the title suggests. I'm set to graduate in December with a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and don't feel happy at all with the experience its given me and the internships I've gotten. I feel as if Comp Sci is more what I'm interested and didn't pursue it earlier because I was not as focused during the first 2 and a half years of my college experience as I should have been but that's a different story. Anyways, I have a semi-adequate math background in terms of completing calculus and have a pretty decent (3.0+) GPA. What would you guys suggest for someone in my shoes? I know graduate school is technically an option but I'm at a heavy disadvantage without the undergrad degree but feel as if it's silly to graduate undergrad and go back for another undergrad degree immediately."
d29g64,434,2019-09-10,The Ultimate Guide to Applying to Engineering Grad School,MissBrightside13,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/d29g64/the_ultimate_guide_to_applying_to_engineering/,"Hello all – it’s getting to that time of year when seniors are starting to think about getting a job after graduation, or continuing on with grad school. A year ago, I knew I wanted to get my PhD, but I had no idea where to start, and the school I went to for undergrad didn’t have great resources. I ended up doing a lot of research, googling, and talking to everyone I could to figure out the best way to get through the process successfully. I didn’t go to a good undergrad school and didn’t have experience in a research lab at school, but I was accepted with full funding to 5/5 mechanical engineering PhD programs that I applied to (4 of which were Top 10 programs). More info on me, including my stats, are at the bottom of this post. I put together this guide to hopefully help anyone who is thinking about applying to grad school for engineering. I’ll go over choosing a degree, the GRE, choosing schools to apply to, preparing your application, and getting funded. When I get to the GRE section, I do mention some stuff that is only relevant for applying to super-competitive schools, but other than that, this should be applicable to anyone. I will be happy to answer any questions in the comments!

**Part One: Choosing a Degree**

There are four common graduate degrees that an engineer will pursue, and they are described below. Because I am keeping this guide focused on advanced engineering degree, I won't be going into more detail on MBAs, and the advice in the rest of this post is not necessarily relevant for anyone interested in pursuing an MBA.

* Master of Science (MS): An MS degree requires completion of classes as well as a thesis. It is often the step between a Bachelor degree and a PhD. It takes around 2 years to complete and although some people self-fund their degree, it is often subsidized by an employer, fellowship, graduate assistantship, or teaching assistantship. An engineer with an MS is qualified to do more heavy work in design or production rather than “day-to-day” engineering tasks. It is also a common path to going into project management.
* Master of Engineering (MEng): The MEng is sometimes referred to as a non-thesis MS. It consists of only courses and no thesis program, although sometimes an internship or capstone project similar to the one completed in undergrad may be required. It is typically slightly shorter than an MS degree, depending on the courseload taken each semester. These degrees are very often self-funded, although it is possible to have it subsidized by an employer or a teaching assistantship. An engineer with an MEng may become an engineering supervisor or senior engineer.
* Doctor of Philosophy (PhD): A PhD requires students to take coursework and develop original research leading to a dissertation defense. It can often take anywhere from 4 – 6 years, depending on whether you have your MS already. Possible career paths include being a professor, researcher in industry or in a national lab, or working at a startup. An engineering student should *never* self-fund a PhD. Instead, they should be able to get tuition + a living stipend paid for by a graduate assistantship, teaching assistantship, fellowship, or a combination of those.
* Master of Business Administration (MBA): An MBA is a coursework-based degree that allows you to gain soft skills (teamwork, leadership, ethics, communication) that you don’t learn in engineering school. There is a strong emphasis on strategic decision-making. Applicants will typically have 3-5 years of full-time work experience before beginning their MBA. Some possible career paths include going into management, changing careers entirely, or starting your own business. They are often self-funded or subsidized by an employer.

Should you wait a few years after undergrad to go to grad school?

* Pros: Getting more experience can make a degree more meaningful because you’ll understand the practical applications of it. You also might be able to get your employer to pay for your degree
* Cons: The longer you wait, the more you’ll forget from classes, which will put you at a disadvantage against younger members of the cohort. As you may have noticed from your internships…it’s hard to go back to school once you’re used to making money and not doing homework!

**Part Two: Preparing for the GRE**

The GRE (Graduate Record Examination) is administered by the ETS (Educational Testing Service). It reminded me a lot of the SAT. The testing fee is $205 and the test is 3 hours and 45 minutes long. It can be taken once every 3 weeks, up to 5 times in one year. There are three different sections, described below:

* Analytical Writing is graded on a scale from 0 to 6.0 in half-point increments. The essays are scored by a computerized program and a trained human, then the scores are averaged together. All of the possible prompts are published online by the ETS. There are two essays: Analyze an Issue, in which you take a perspective on a given issue and support it, and Analyze an Argument, in which you discuss the logical soundness of an author’s argument in a piece of writing. Use complex sentences and vocabulary (this is what the computer scorer looks for!). Some writing tips:
   * Don’t start every sentence in the same way
   * Before beginning to write, spend 5 minutes brainstorming – write down as many bullet points as possible
   * Use a thesis statement to explicitly announce your main points
   * Start a new paragraph every time you shift to new ideas
   * Always write about the counterarguments
* Verbal Reasoning (Reading) is graded on a scale from 130 to 170 in one-point increments. There are three different types of questions: reading comprehension, text completion, and sentence equivalence. The second and third types are easily recognizable as vocab questions.
   * Become familiar with the connotation of words, not just the dictionary definition
   * With a “fill-in-the-blank” question, read the sentence first without looking at the answer and try to fill in the word that you think belongs. Then, look at the answer choices and try to find a synonym
   * Download the Magoosh Vocabulary Builder app – it has 1,000 words on it that very commonly appear on the GRE
* Quantitative Reasoning (Math) is graded on a scale from 130 to 170 in one-point increments. None of the material that appears is from beyond a high school-level. The basic topics it covers are Arithmetic, Algebra, Geometry, and Data Analysis.
   * Remember that figures are not necessarily drawn to scale
   * Plug in different quantities (positive, negative, fractions) to test the validity of a comparison
   * If there is only one right answer to a multiple choice question, plug them all in if you get desperate
   * The on-screen calculator takes a bit of getting used to, so be sure to practice ahead of time!

How to Study for the GRE: I am a fan of Magoosh – they have a free vocabulary app that helps you learn the 1000 most common GRE vocab words. They also have a paid online study service around $100/month; you tell them when you want to take the test and it creates daily assignments to help you prepare. Other popular companies for prep are Manhattan Prep (they have a very extensive set of books) and Kaplan (lots of practice tests!). There are also 2 free practice tests on the ETS website. These are very important and I recommend paying for more ($40/each) if you don’t get other practice tests through your other study method. It uses the same software as the actual test, so it’s perfect for getting used to the calculator and how the test will look.

Competitive Scores: I went into the GRE aiming for a score that would be competitive at a Top 10 school. For engineering, you should have a strong quant score, but you need to show that you have decent written communication skills as well. For analytical writing, many schools require a 3.0 at a minimum, but you shoot for at least a 4.0 to be competitive. Verbal is also not super important for engineering students. Some schools will post a minimum required score, but above 155 is a reasonable goal. The quantitative section is by far the most important; for a top school, you want to be in the 90th percentile, which is typically around a 165. The average score for Stanford engineering is 4.5AW/161V/167Q.

Sending Scores: On the day you take the test, you can send your scores to up to 4 schools for free. Afterwards, it costs $27 per institution to send your GRE scores there. Also, check the box that gives them permission to share your info with other institutions. You’ll get some spam email from liberal arts schools that you have no interest in, but you’ll also get tons of application fee waivers emailed to you.

**Part Three: Choosing Schools to Apply to**

Ideally, you should have at least four schools picked out before you take the GRE so you can save money on sending scores. When I chose my schools, the factors that I considered, in order from most to least important, were ranking, location, cost of living, and research opportunities. Looking back, I should have done research opportunities, ranking, location, and then cost of living, but you should decide what's important to you. I’ll go through all of them below:

* Ranking: Higher-ranked schools will almost always be better funded and have more resources available to grad students, but they are also be more competitive. Graduate school prestige matters more than undergrad prestige, but it’s not everything. I recommend using U.S.News to see the top 10 for your field, but you have to pay to see more. I used [https://](https://www.university-list.net/)[www.university-list.net](https://www.university-list.net/) to find the rankings for mechanical engineering PhD programs. The data is all from 2015 and appears to be stolen off of U.S.News. The current ranking for the top 10 grad schools across all engineering fields, according to U.S.News, is 1 - MIT, 2 - Stanford, 3 - UC Berkeley, 4 - Carnegie Mellon, 5 - CalTech, 6 - UMich, 7 - Georgia Tech, 8 - Purdue, 9 - USC, and 10 - University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign).
* Location: Ask yourself if you’d rather live in a big city or a small college town. This might not matter to you, which is good too! Climate is very important – do you hate being hot or cold? Also, consider job opportunities in that city and try to picture yourself settling down there. Keep in mind that some locations may make a wonderful vacation, but you might not enjoy living there for many years (I’m talking about you, Florida). Don’t visit any schools on your own dime, unless you happen to live nearby.
* Cost of Living: Look at the average cost of an apartment near the campus that you’re looking at. Will the typical stipend at this school be enough to cover your portion of rent? In a big city, you will almost definitely need to have roommates.
* Research Opportunities: Go to the department’s website and look at the professor’s CVs and websites. Are they doing projects that are relevant to your interests and background? You can reach out to PIs (Principal Investigators) as early as the summer to discuss their work and ask them questions. I can provide a sample of one of my “reaching out” emails if wanted. If nothing else, sending this email will at least get them to recognize your name in the application pile! If things go well, you could get an interview with them.

**Part Four: Your Application**

Schools are looking for experience and skills (highlighted in your Statement of Purpose), letters of recommendation, a research interest match, and a solid GPA/GRE (least important of all the factors). Having external funding (discussed later) will put your name at the top of the list because they won’t have to pay for you to be there.

* Application Fees: In my experience, they ranged from $35 - $125. If you don’t get a fee waiver emailed to you after the GRE, there’s no harm in emailing the admissions office and asking if they give fee waivers. Also, applying to some fellowships, such as GEM, will automatically give you a fee waiver at some schools.
* Transcript: Most schools won’t request your official transcript (expensive) unless you enroll, so buy one PDF version of your transcript from your undergrad school and upload it to all of the applications so you only have to pay for it once.
* When to Apply: Every school has a different application deadline, but it seemed like most range from Dec 1 to mid-January. If you’re applying for Masters rather than PhD, the deadline is typically, but not always, later. Check to see if there is an earlier deadline for people who want to be considered for funding. Aim to submit your app AT LEAST one day before it’s due in case of computer issues or anything else that could come up.
* Letters of Recommendation: You need at least 1 academic reference. Ideally, this is a professor that you’ve interacted with a lot outside of class. Most schools accept between 3 and 5 reference letters. Give your LoR writers plenty of notice beforehand – bring it up within a few weeks of getting back to class in the fall. Always send a thank-you note and gift to your writers once the application season is over!
* Statement of Purpose: When you were applying to undergrad schools, you probably wrote a Personal Statement, but this is different. For grad schools, you write a Statement of Purpose, which should answer these questions: What do you want to study? Why do you want to study it? What experience do you have in this field? What do you plan to do with your degree? Why is this program a good fit? You should be tailoring your SoP to each program you apply to. I followed a formula with mine that worked very well: I started talking about my specialized area of interest and the skills/experience I have related to it. Then I discussed my future goals, and ended with a paragraph tailored to each program about why I was interested in that specific department at that specific institution.
   * Get as many people as possible to proofread your application: advisors, professors, your LoR writers, even other students.
   * Things to Avoid: Pretty much anything that happened before undergrad, clichés (ex: from a very young age, I knew I was destined to be an engineer…”), anything overly negative, passive voice, casual writing including contractions, and using acronyms without defining them beforehand
   * Your Experiences: My application was a bit unique because I didn’t have academic research experience. My undergrad school had a mandatory co-op program and I couldn’t financially afford to take a &gt;50% pay cut to do research instead of co-op. Instead, I used my co-op to explore the world of R&amp;D, focusing as much as I could on the “R” part of R&amp;D. I got heavily involved in doing testing and experiments for my company, and managed a long-term testing project that was extremely similar to a research project a grad student would be working on in a lab. I discussed that project in my SoP, and interviewers/admissions panels were impressed that I was able to operate with that level of independence.
* Hearing Back: Some schools have rolling admissions and some will not start reviewing applications until after the deadline has passed. Some schools will admit you without a visit, while some will invite you to visit and interview with professors to find someone to give you funding before they accept you. You have until April 15th to accept an offer with funding attached. After that, you can change your mind, but it requires a written release from the school that you originally committed to, and that will pretty much burn bridges with that school.
* Visit Weekends: Schools will often pay for your flights and hotels to come visit them if they admit you or are considering admitting you. Prepare as you would for any interview, wear business casual, do your research ahead of time, and bring some resumes just in case. Going into your visit, know what you want to do and how it relates to the professor that you’re interviewing with. You should look at these interviews as a two-way street: they’re seeing if they want to accept you and give you funding, while you’re trying to decide if you would want to go to school and research there for the next few years. Some important questions for you to ask are:
   * How many grad students do you currently have? How many have you had in the past?
   * Where did your past students end up? Industry or academia?
   * Is your research mostly theoretical, computational, or experimental?
   * How often do you meet with your students?
   * Do you have a requirement for how many papers a student must publish before they finish their degree?
   * What background or skills do you look for in a potential grad student?

**Part Five: Getting Funding**

Funding Amount: Ideally, you should be able to get funding that covers the entire tuition cost (whether it’s in-state or out-of-state) as well as a living stipend. Living stipends are typically a monthly or bi-weekly payment, just like you’d get from a job. If you are lucky enough to get external funding, then sometimes that can partially stack on top of funding from a school!

The main funding sources for a grad student are departmental fellowships, external fellowships, research assistantships (RA), and teaching assistantships (TA).

* External Fellowships: An external fellowship is funding that comes from external organizations. Applications are due very early, usually October or so, and can be available to both undergrad seniors and grad students. These are great to have because your advisor doesn’t have to spend as much money on you (if any at all)! Some fellowships require you to “pay back” the money they give you by working for them for a certain number of years after graduation, so make sure you understand what you’re getting yourself into. Some popular (and very generous) fellowships include the NSF, GEM, SMART, and NDSEG fellowships. Smaller organizations (SWE, ASME, Tau Beta Pi) may offer smaller fellowships, which will be less competitive to apply for.
   * If you’re a senior in undergrad, I encourage you to throw together an application for NSF. It will get you 3 years of funding with a generous stipend, and if you don’t get it as an undergrad, you’re still able to apply as a grad student. I didn’t think I would get it, but I spent a weekend putting the application together and ended up getting it, which is probably the best return on investment I’ve ever made (and it’s free to apply). For this fellowship, NSF chooses to fund you as a person, not the research projects you propose. From my experience, the most important part of your application is your “broader impact” – how you give back to the community and will use your skills to better the world. I am very involved outside of classes and had a lot to write about this topic, which I think brought my application to the top, despite my weaker research proposal.
* RA and TA: RA- and TA-ships are funding packages from a specific professor or the department of a school. These can often come with requirements such as maintaining a certain GPA or being enrolled in a certain number of credit hours. RA requires you to spend a certain amount of time working in the professor’s lab, while TA requires you to TA, grade papers, sometimes even lecture for undergrad or lower-level grad courses. Of these, RA is preferable because you will most likely need to be working in the lab for your thesis anyway, so you might as well get paid for it. On the other hand, if you’re interested in going into teaching with a PhD, TAing could be a great way to get your feet wet.
* Departmental Fellowships: Some schools offer departmental fellowships, which is funding that comes from the department rather than a specific professor. They are similar to external fellowships but may come with additional requirements, such as a GPA you must maintain.

**Part Six: Logistics and Conclusion**

After going through the application cycle and observing others’ experiences, here is what I feel is the best timeline for applying to grad school for a fall start date:

* Late spring: start studying for the GRE
* Mid-summer: start looking at schools to apply to
* Late summer: take the GRE for the first time
* Beginning of fall semester: ask LoR writers to write for you
* October-ish: submit fellowship applications
* Early December – onward: submit grad school applications
* Rolling: hear back from schools
* February – March: visit schools, interview with professors
* April 15: accept or decline offers

And here’s what actually ended up happening for me (experiences may vary):

* Early summer: started studying for the GRE
* 2 weeks before GRE: started looking at schools to apply to
* Mid-summer: took the GRE for the first and only time
* Beginning of fall semester: asked LoR writers to write for me
* October: submitted NSF fellowship application 2 hours before the due date (don’t do this)
* Early December – onward: submitted each grad school application a few days before it was due (do this!)
* January: admitted to University of Florida and Carnegie Mellon with funding; admitted to Georgia Tech without funding
* February: admitted with funding to UMich; visited UF and Purdue
* March: received funding from GaTech, admitted to Purdue with funding; visited GaTech, CMU, and UMich
* April 13th: accepted GaTech offer, declined others

Total Cost: All together, I spent money on a used GRE study book ($20), taking the GRE one time ($205), sending two GRE scores (2 x $27), one unofficial transcript PDF ($8), and five application fees (approx. 5 x $75) for a total of $662. Five schools appears to be on the low end compared to other students, and I also did not spend money on GRE studying besides one used book from the bookstore, so I would be prepared to spend much more than that. I had all expenses paid for on my visits, including hotels, meals, and flights/mileage reimbursement if I drove! I had a classmate who was invited to a visit weekend that he had to pay for himself. I personally would not have attended a visit if they weren't willing to pay for me.

As promised, my stats! I graduated a year early from my undergrad program with a 3.85 GPA. My GRE was 5.0AW/167V/166Q. I had a total of two full years of co-op and internship experience at reasonably well-known companies, most of which was R&amp;D, as I mentioned before. I did a super difficult but really cool senior capstone project (my advisor said it was on the level of a master’s thesis project) that related to my research interests for grad school. I spent two years as the VP of a professional organization, was the professional development chair of my engineering fraternity, and dabbled in a few other clubs. One thing that was super important for a lot of my applications was my extracurriculars – I was a volunteer coach for a FIRST robotics team teaching high schoolers how to CAD, participated in outreach events, and did an independent study project on what is causing the gender imbalance in engineering. Some other cool stuff happened senior year, but it came too late to be on my applications, so it isn’t relevant to this post. My NSF Fellowship was actually awarded shortly before the April 15th deadline, so it didn’t impact admissions decisions in any way.

If you read this far, thank you! I hope you found this guide helpful. Everyone’s experience during the grad school application process is different, so don’t take anything I’ve said as the absolute truth. I did consult a lot of my classmates who were also going through the process in order to try to make this as objective as possible. Please let me know if you have any questions, I’d be happy to answer them."

I want to have the best chances of getting one but i'm not entirely sure what employers are looking for. I don't really have much work experience (I did some during GCSE/College but it was either irrelevant or leaning more towards IT rather than CS) and i've not done any internships or things like that either. I do code in my free time but i'm still pretty much a beginner at it and haven't made any amazing things, so all i've really got is my grade from first year. Are these the kinds of things that employers may be looking for or are my chances for getting a placement pretty low?

Appreciate any advice.

Thanks! :)"
d2btru,1,2019-09-10,"can someone give me advice on what carrer options i have, with no real work experiences and being unemployed for 8 years?",BrettonF,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d2btru/can_someone_give_me_advice_on_what_carrer_options/," 

My needs:

I need help on my options of starting a career. I dont have time for college, but i wouldnt mind working fulltime and studying part time for a certification. Im not looking to earn tons of money, but would like to see what my options are of starting a career, and not ""just a job"" I know i have to start below bottom. Before i apply to work at walmart or macdonalds, i would like to see what options i have.

My story:

I am 28 years old. I have no mention-able skills, no real work experience, and no college degree or certifications. After high school, I tried college twice, and failed miserably. I was young, immature, and frankly, not too bright. with each failed class/semester, I became more and more depressed, developed severe anxiety, and eventually ended up hiding in my own room scared to even be seen. This continued for 7-8 years. For the past year, I have been building my confidence, going to the gym. I would like to start a new life, filled with confidence, and hopefully start a career.

My work experience:

I have no work experience after 2011 or so. Before that, i've worked many jobs during summer/seasonal jobs, and between classes, although none too long, but that wasn't due to me leaving, they were temp/seasonal jobs for students to begin with. I did well in all of them. Exceedingly well i would say. But since then, no work experience at all. that being said, here is the list:

During the last 2 years of highschool, I worked in the tech department at my highschool, troubleshooting and fixing computer problems in the school.

During summers, I had a paid intern position at the district tech office doing roughly the same thing, and followed mentors to all the school campuses in the district, troubleshooting, upgrading computers, software, etc.

During my first attempt at college, I worked as a delivery driver for a small private company delivering cooked/prepared food good to residential homes. This is the only job I left voluntarily due to conflict of time issues. I worked here a total of 3 months, and Every day from 6am until 3pm, 7 days a week, but i loved the job. I started a new semester and got a new schedule for classes, and when I brought this up with my manager, we knew it wouldn't work out.

I've worked for a very large city as a recreational attendant for a local lake, taking care of the boats, and docs. I was powerboat certified as well as CPR certified. I helped customers get into boats, instructed them about safety, and if needed, taught them how to operate each boat. I also made the rounds on the powerboat across the lake to ensure everyone was safe, as well as pulling people out of the water when they fell in.

I have also worked for workmarket, as a private contractor doing odd tech jobs, installing computers, backing up information, transferring files, setting up equipment, etc.

Please keep in mind this was all before 2011. It has been 8 years since I've had a job. I'm not proud, but I obviously need to start over, and I need help."

I took Calc 2 around 2 years ago, followed that with Calc 3 and Diff EQ. Then I had a nasty car accident and I had to move and so I missed Summer and Fall of 2018. My last two classes before Uni are Physics 1 w/ Calc and Physics 2 w/ Calc. I took Physics 1 in the spring and got the highest grade in my class. I took an internship this summer, and now I'm in Physics 2 for the Fall. 

Calc 2 kicked my ass, and I've forgotten most of the integral patterns and trig substitutions. We're doing field charges right now, and I'm having flashbacks. Are there certain things that I should refresh on while going through? Any tips?

Comp is similar between both, only difference being Deloitte will pay for my tuition ($120k)

Amazon is in Seattle, Deloitte is in DC (my hometown - wouldn't need to pay rent). Ideally, would like Amazon in HQ2 in 2 years but don't know the feasibility if entire career spent in Tech Consulting besides my summer internship at Amazon (received return offer).

Long term career goals are to be in tech, either CTO of org or my own start-up. Amazon obviously gets me relevant work experience and experience I want, however having a hard time justifying the decision to leave money on the table to move cross-country. Don't know if I can get school paid for and then rejoin in 2 years in similar capacity at HQ2.

I'm a workaholic, really enjoy working hard and progressing through my career, work/life balance is not a priority at this stage of my career. Found the work at Amazon to be gratifying and in my limited exposure meshed well with the culture.

What are your recommendations? Take Amazon now, and give up the money ($200k) or do my 2 years at Deloitte and try for Amazon again? What do you think is the likelihood of getting Amazon again?"

I am a first-year student at an Ivy League school (left intentionally vague) who is looking to get a job in CS after college. I have a few questions about this:

\- I have the option to either take ""Intro to C++"" or ""Algorithms and Data Structures"". The latter class is significantly harder, and will likely bring my GPA down. 

**Is this worth it?** Will having an ""Intro to X"" class on my transcript make employers think less of my application? Or should I focus on my GPA and take the Intro Class. 

\- I already have significant experience with JavaScript, HTML, and Python. I started my own (fairly involved) website that made $20,000, I made an app that was featured on the app store (as part of a larger article that mentioned many other apps, mind you), and have done some pretty interesting internships.

*However,* I don't have a lot of experience with low level languages (C++/Java/ect.) -- I'm really more of a front end person. 

Given this context, **should I even major in computer science?** I feel like I could get a reasonably well paying job right now if I wanted to just based on my experience. Many of my friends have told me it's foolish to major in computer science, and that instead I should major in economics, political science, or something else because CS employers won't care either way and I'm going to be wasting my time here. Is this true?

Thanks a ton!"

I've a bachelors degree in electronics engineering from University of Seville (Spain). I'm looking forward to starting a career in the embedded industry in the Netherlands.

I'm living in Spain at the moment but I want to move to the Netherlands. Why there? Because I've been there before, have family and a couple of friends there and I love the lifestyle and the work culture of the Netherlands. If a have to move somewhere in the EU, this looks like the best option for me, also it looks like it's has a fairly good demand for embedded engineers.

I've been working in building automation (KNX) and HVAC control until I left. Sadly, I don't have any work experience in the embedded field, and since a have to cover my expenses there (housing, transport, medical insurance, etc.) I can't really accept an internship. I've some savings, but they will not last very long without a proper salary.

I've formal education in control systems, analog interfacing and signal conditioning, digital signal processing, C programming and real time operating systems.

I like working (playing) with microcontrollers. I like to pick a device family (most recently the STM32 family, but also played with PICs 16f and 18f, SiLabs 80C51 family and AVRs), buy some hardware, read their application notes and try to understand and replicate most of the provided examples.

&gt; Yes I bought an Arduino 2009 but only as a cheap alternative to the STK500, I swear.

I also learned by myself, Python, C++, GUI programming  with Qt5 and Linux development and administration.

I'm so excited about geting real world experience, and learning about how to build real world applications. This whole thing has fascinated me since I was a child (a really weird one).

I've fairly good English communication skills, but since I'm not planning this as a temporary stance, I'm willing to learn Dutch.

I'm looking for in the Eindhoven area. 

Any advice, resume/application (begging) letter tips, will be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance."

Haven’t fulfilled any expectations from my family/friends for as long as I can remember. Academics have always been doing the minimum amount of homework to pass so I could maximize video game time(now it’s smoke weed and play video games). Every year since like 2nd grade I’ve gotten grounded/yelled at because of bad grades. Literally every year until I found ways to hide grades and avoid conversation about school at all costs. That didn’t work for long and ended up making the consequences worse after building up lies for 6-12 months when final grades were checked by parents.

I’m not sure what to feel anymore, I just lie so much to friends and family to avoid them and/or find a way to smoke weed and play video games. Living this lifestyle still managed to barely pass me through high school and obviously is not viable for full time college students. I’m talking like 3-4 hours a WEEK doing homework and mostly because there is a due date scheduled. Obviously that time needs to be triple or more for a student to be even close to passing classes in college. I try to go into every semester with a good mindset or whatever but I just am so tired of the same mental beat down of slowly failing classes and then lying to everyone I speak to.

I know stuff is supposed to get better like people say and I finally landed an internship in IT this past summer. It has been fun but I’m back in classes and only working 1-2 days a week while taking 3 classes. I know some people have 10x more filled schedule aka working full time and full schedule and still make it work. I’m just not built like that, I know I’m mentally weak and my will power is laughable. My only way out is a degree and I have spent 4 years now completing two years of college credit. I wanted to get an adderall prescription because I tried it twice when I was desperate to study and it worked like magic. It worked so good I got scared to get more because I know my addictive personality. Despite me trying to smoke weed every day and play on my PC, I somehow ruled adderall was the line. Sorry for all the ranting if you have read this far. Not sure what any of this is supposed to lead to, if u ever felt similar or have some advice on breaking out of this please let me know my chest feels heavy and I just am so sick of losing willpower to myself"

Hello!

I am a sophomore in college and considering pursuing a career in human resources. Originally I thought that a double major in Business Administration and Communications would be a smart route, but then I learned my college offers a psychology degree specifically catered towards human resources.  I still feel that a degree in BA/COMM would look better on a resume and keep my doors open, whereas a degree in PSYC would severely limit those aforementioned doors. Also the ""HR Emphasis"" is really just a fancy way of saying that it is the same general PSYC courses with an HR Elective tacked on in senior year, and a Business Law course thrown in.

Any advice on this?

She was surprised to hear that so she resent my application with a notice saying I was alright with the commute. 
I still haven’t heard anything but it got me to thinking. Is living an hour away putting me at a disadvantage for job searching? Should I just borrow a friends address who lives closer so they’ll consider me? Should I resend all my applications but with a closer address? I could buy a PO Box in that town so it looks like I live there. Any ideas?

It’s a [web app](www.techinternship.io) for helping students find and apply to summer 2020 tech internships. It has a database of hundreds of open internships with links directly to them.
It also has a lot of data like location and compensation (some of it is user generated and will grow as more people hopefully use it).

I’m not making any money off of this and will always keep it free for students to use. I want to help ease the grueling and stressful process of applying to tons of internships which I’ve been through many times myself. 

I hope you all enjoy it, and I hope it saves everybody a lot of time in applying to internships!

If you have any questions or feedback or notice any bugs please do comment or message me."
d2lt2i,1,2019-09-11,"I'm already doing college, but I don't know how I will qualify against incoming 2020 Freshman",FlashTuttles,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d2lt2i/im_already_doing_college_but_i_dont_know_how_i/,"Technically, I am done with high school, but the school holds my diploma until May of 2020, meaning I would have to apply as a Freshman with early college (the college was all paid for, I'll be graduating with an Associate's of Sciences, it's a community college). I plan on going into Computer Engineering, minoring in Computer Sciences. If possible, I would love for it to be a double-major, but I know that Computer Engineering already incorporates Computer Science.

Schools I plan on applying towards (in order of preference)

1. University of Notre Dame
2. Umich Ann-Arbor (maybe flint, but not likely)
3. Michigan State University
4. Kettering University
5. Purdue university
6. Michigan Tech University

I feel like this is a solid list, with Purdue and Michigan Tech being my main-backups if I don't get into the top 4 schools, but I believe that I can. Also, I do live in Michigan, so I know that Purdue will be much more since it is public and out-of state, but I heard it was good for engineering.

Bottom part may seem like a ""Chance Me"", but I honestly just want opinions on what I can do to ""spice"" up my life or if there is something that I should consider and have planned. Sorry if it does seem like it, I'm just pretty confused on how I am doing or what not. You know- people around me make me seem like I'm the brightest person ever but then I go on reddit and find out that I'm just an average person.. which is really scary.

**Stats of my entire life-being existing on this earth for 17-18 years**

\-Internship of 50 hours with an IT company, hopefully getting another with a different one this year.

\-SAT 1160 after a year still- going to try it a few more times but it is looking very grim

1160 \[600 560\] - May 2019

1150 \[580,570\] - Dec 2018

1160 \[590,570\] - April 2018

\-ACT 26 | 26 English, 25 Math, 27 Reading, 25 Science, 08 writing | retaking again, and actually feeling proud, I was able to surpass other courses by having a 25 on the math for my CommunityCollege

\- AP Language (3), Dropped out of AP Calc (to regular calc senior year, but I did try taking it)

Early College - Started taking College classes at a community campus Junior year (4), then going more, (6 senior year), until my 13th year (this year), where I am full time and paid for (69 credits by the end of winter 2020)

Fall Semester - Physics 1, Calculus 1 (able to place in because of my ACT Math score somehow), Chemistry 1, and history

Winter/Spring Semester - Physics 2, Calculus 2, Chemistry 2 / Biology 1, and Intro to Japanese Culture (Humanities and Social Sciences credits for pre-req)

Recommendation letters!

I don't have a strong list of people, just my academic adviser for the program of early college and my High School teacher / swim coach. I want to have a recommendation letter from a professor with my college, but I don't know how to go about for one.

**Less important stuff**

\-ADD, minor depression + some minor attempts of suicide (I'm alright though, but I think it was heavily influenced by anxiety)

\- Father passed away during freshman year (during middle of divorce), living on Social Security income because of it

Parents were both from Southern Vietnam (Kind-of important since my brother and I were the first born ones here, they got their bachelors so I assume I am not 1st generation)

\- I am trying to learn a bunch of languages, Japanese, Vietnamese I know kind-of well, French, ASL, and Spanish are languages I am trying to diversify myself  in and study (but I haven't necessarily)

\- Varsity Swim for high school - Team captain Senior Year, Going to be an assistant coach this year.

\- Chess - it was something that I have always had an interest in, it's really not that important but I really think it is a passion of mine if I ever get the time to do so.. Like Coding, which is not often (I know C++ and a bit of Python)

\- NHS - I did mainly have heavy influence over the tutoring program, but no one ever helped out besides me, and those who just wanted hours. I worked during school lunches (I was supposed to be at college but I had time), and after school sometimes.

\-Working part-time at a fast food restaurant (Coffee, customer experience, was working full time in the summer of this year, started senior year)

\- Parish Volunteering when possible such as fish fries / festival for a long time

\- Hoping to do some environmental clean-up projects, but I have participated in one (and won a scholarship also along with that) and want to do more

\- Going to start dedicating mornings to work at a food shelter I recently found out about or whatnot

(when I get my college settled out because I just scored uber low on an exam and I really need to pass this semester)

This is something that I am confused about, also. At the college, there are multiple opportunities to earn some free ""credits"" with classes or things that are free to sign up for or whatnot. Some of them are just college-ready things, and others are cultural experiences or what not. Attend the session and fill out a paper explaining that you have the knowledge or whatnot, and you get some credits. After completing XYZ amount of courses, they'll give you an award. I know that it isn't much of an achievement like most universities want you to have, but I feel that it is something that I should add, even if it is obtainable by everyone else.

Along with this, I did get a bunch of high school scholarships that are offered in my school (athlete award, Write an essay about XYZ and have high standings, etc. \[I ended up getting 6/6 that I applied for\]) Should I go ahead and write those down as awards too? Or are they too minuscule to count as something?

Anyways, I am really sorry if this is a blab of useless stuff, but I really am looking forward to discussion on what I should do or if there is something that I need to change. I feel that I'm on a solid path, but I am really afraid if classes won't transfer / I don't get scholarships due to being in a weird stance of not entirely an incoming freshman, but still am.  If I have content- revealing information, I will try and blur out and remove, but I think I got most of the stuff. We all are human though (I need to figure out essays also haha), thanks again.

d2ltl9,6,2019-09-11,Advice on using pandas and similar tools for analyzing tables,202171202,learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/d2ltl9/advice_on_using_pandas_and_similar_tools_for/,"I have very limited experience of working with big tables. I'm currently applying for an internship and first application test is to analyze a .csv file with 500.000 rows and I chose pandas for doing that (though I don't think which tool I use really matters for the question I'm asking).

I was wondering: which table manipulations would be inappropriate for a table of this size?

For example, I was thinking about adding a few extra columns that store result of comparing several others (i.e. column C at a certain row contains True if column B is bigger than A, False otherwise) for convenience of use. But operations like this take a significant amount of time (may be I'm exaggerating but I'm not used to waiting for ~10-20 seconds for an operation to finish). And that got me wondering if that is poor taste and where else I might be doing wrong. Which simple rules should I follow so as not to seem completely oblivious?

Thanks."
d2macp,3,2019-09-11,What steps must be taken if someone is stuck at wrong company working for bad employer?,aakhri_paasta,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d2macp/what_steps_must_be_taken_if_someone_is_stuck_at/,"please-please read the whole post to understand my situation.

Nobody has financial dependence on me, but soon will. I am currently without any new offer (but can get with in 2-3 weeks) and I want to resign from my job and complete my notice period (2 months max, depends on the state of projects) and quit. Reason being remaining unemployed for few week or a month or two is much-much less painfull and distressing as compared to working for my current employer.

I am working as a software engineer since last year (10 months) for a service based startup, you can say a virtual technical manager kind of service (i.e. just a fancy name,  virtual CTO).

Both founders(absolute imposters) don't even stand any where near me when it comes to skills required to handle projects and technical skills.

 I had a year gap before joining (personal loss, justifiable) and before that I was in and out of same company (a product based company, 7 years old, running in startup mode, an exception they made to reinstate an employee who quited abruptly, reason being they had confidence in my calibre which they saw in my first tenure), for 3-4 months each tenure.

Yes, I agree a made bad choices and decisions. I was in urgent need not because of money but to get back in to the industry after that trauma and year gap, thats why I joined hands with current employer, who turned out to be douche(both founders). 

Now I am 28 yrs old and I decided to stay for a period of atleast a year but things are going miserable day by day.

I worked for them free for 4 months then took just a meager expense for next 3 months to cover my commute and other stuff. They gone crazy when I requested them to start my salary which they promised I will start to get 3 months after joining, and told them that I have to leave if no salary. I agreed upon a reduced salary from what they promised and that too without a formal offer-letter.

And when after a month I demanded to give me the offer letter they started to show signs of discomfort, like asked them to give one of their kidneys, somehow I got it.

Now the situation is worse I am not receiving salary on time and they deduct amount from it every time, last time I got it almost after whole month passed and 32% less, haven't received salary for this month yet.

I like to work in a focused way thats why I prefer to work from home instead of an incubation center or co-working zone. But this employer of mine is making that an excuse to deduct from my salary and indirectly blaming me like all projects are going down because of me. 

They do not  consider me working 10-14 hours on most days even on sundays, on unpaid leaves and  from home, working on 5th project since last year, coordinating with free lancers,  remote part-time employees and interns. All this is taking a toll on my emotional and physical well-being. And because of this I don't get any chance to study/prepare for interviews, fix meeting with prospective employer, etc.

 Although they are aware of fact that I am the main guy and if I leave, that will break their back nice enough such that that can lead to halt all the development work for considerable time.

Every day I curse myself for working for this employer, self doubt, misery, feeling myself incapable etc are the thoughts that cross my mind whole day."

This is not a typical post, i can assure you.",Agent_of_kallus-ness,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d2majr/really_need_some_help_and_suggestions_regarding/,"I've tried my best to keep this post as short as i can and while giving as much info as needed my context. Still it's a bit of a long read

&amp;#x200B;

22yo male, graduated this year. Had arrears so could not get a job before. Now i'm not getting any job.

B.Tech EEE from SRM Chennai. Been applying for jobs for the past 3 months. Sitting in Jaiselmer. Dad's posted there. 

Parents are getting divorced. Mom is leaving. Dad is devastated. We have a dog, 8yo male lab. Mom used to take care of him while i was in college. Dad never really took an initiative to feed or bathe or clean or take him to the doctor ever. He loves him still. (idk how that works.) I won't abandon my dog. My dad's job means he can't give him any time. Money is obviously a little tight now. 

\--Backstory--

My dog is my emotional bedrock. Helped me climb out of suicidal issues and helps me with my emotional and social issues as well. My  childhood was not exactly nice, i've come to that realization. I've had my fair share of trauma.  My parents weren't exactly nice. My dog as his own issues. Doesn't  know how to act  with other animals and always gets into fights with other dogs.He prefers human company( to a limited extent). We are both loners. He will already have to deal with the loss of his ""mother"", i can't let him be affected more.  My dog can stay alone for 4-5 hrs but obviously he gets real lonely and bored. Sometimes he cries and wails n his sleep too. He's getting old now, so he has health issues too.

\--Back to reality--

Any job or idea about how i can earn enough money to take care of him properly without leaving him alone in the house for extended periods of time.

 I don't wanna give him away in any case whatsoever. Family help is out of the question. I can ask my friends but i'm afraid i will be a burden on them. I mean without a job, i will be and i need to care of him. India is not a very dog friendly country. You call can all me an asshole for thinking about my dog and not my parents but idc. They are adults and can handle themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my resume-[https://imgur.com/a/wp6AF07](https://imgur.com/a/wp6AF07)

This might sound typical but i have good knowledge of my college subjects such as control systems and transmission systems  despite not having the marks to show for it. ( Not that it really matters!) And i'm really good at coding and finding logic solutions (kinda like the questions you see in [codingame.com](https://codingame.com)) but unfortunately for me it's  mostly in C and C++. My internships gave me experience in those languages only ( and QA in a small production facility- basically cataloging parts and instruments and helping with assembly). I am also good with computers- can fix 'em, am knowledgeable about its inner workings. My English is excellent. I am also good with linux- used it as my daily driver untill a few months back. 

Idk what else to say or add.

So, uhh if you have read this far.....any thoughts as to what i can do regarding jobs and any tips regarding my dog will also be greatly appreciated.

Thankyou for listening. Have a nice day :)"
d2n4ak,0,2019-09-11,Is there a self study path similar to a job ready bootcamp?,kimagical,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/d2n4ak/is_there_a_self_study_path_similar_to_a_job_ready/,"So far I've almost finished the Python book AutomateTheBoringStuff which I've found quite nice so far and then I'm planning to do all the Python courses in EDX such as Harvard's CS50 and beyond which should take me a good while. On the other hand I see these programming boot camps with great reviews that claim to make you job ready in just 12 weeks going for 12 hours a day.

I'm really worried about wasting my time away learning things that aren't relevant to getting a job, for example so far I've had a tendency to get off track from the book trying to understand certain errors. I can't imagine being job ready in 12 weeks by online self studying even 12 hours a day at this haphazard, awkward pace. 

So could someone give me a rough outline of a 12 week 12 hour per day self study path to a programming job or even internship, similar to a bootcamp?

If this is impossible to do at home or there just aren't the resources, should I just save up the money to do one of these bootcamps? I'm willing to work for it.

Thanks so much in advance."

I'm in my fourth semester in Computer Science and now I'm taking some subjects that are more ""theoretical"" like networks, operating systems etc - which I already know. Still, although I love everything about technology and have been messing with computers since I was a child (yeah, my father worked with that in the military and we were used to build computers with the spare parts they usually had left for him; we even made a notebook - with a computer keyboard and mouse - and called it ""Frank"") but I'm not as ""updated"" as most of my colleagues who knows the channels and the places about trending stuff etc. I don't even know which segment I should follow. And I could use some help on that.

Obviously, I've had two or three subjects on programming in the last three semesters and I made it out on them, but I can't recall everything that I've learned. I mean, I only did that in order to pass, because I didn't know what college was about at all. In other words, programming is my weak spot; but it is because I've not explored it at all.

Still, I have a goal... I mean, I'm brazilian and I want to improve in order to work out of my country (if I can; if I cannot, I'm fine if I still can make money to go out any time I want) and make good money with that, at least to give a good life to my family and travel quite a lot as I dream to do. Yeah, I'm shooting at every possible angle in order to fulfill my desire and pursue my dream, even by asking you guys for some advices.

Also, in parallel, I went back to studying programming from scratch, to get it right this time and see if I really have the knack and the likes for it. Which language would you guys recommend me, by the way, and the best way to learn?

Thank God, I've been blessed and I'm doing some internship which is something basic, like doing maintenance on computers, taking care of the company's database and finances as well, and I'm grinding a good money for someone who is an intern. More than any of my colleagues. So, life is good in that aspect, but I do have some concerns on my future and I'm planning to do things right.

I don't know if this helps but I love games.

Cheers!

So based on what I've been reading, the average IT salary is about 70K. Juniors tend to start in the 40-50K range, Seniors get around 80K.

Is this what everyone else is seeing in their offices?

I'm asking because one of my Juniors came in at 50K and considered it to be peanuts. He left for another company for around 75K.  
Another one of my Juniors was telling me that his GF is getting paid about 60K for an internship.  
However when I interview, as a senior, companies are offering me 75K.

So I'm wondering what everyone is seeing as an average salary in Canada or more specifically Canada."

School: i was a science student I was not aware of the competition in real life therefore was not enough serious about the competitive exams &amp; never got a good score in any of them. After some depression &amp; suffering i got into a private college mostly due to my father's money. 

College: Yes I got serious after the setback and studied the course hard. But the only mistake that i did was the thought that skills matters more than marks. I got average marks in my graduation but had good coding skills &amp; technical knowledge. But after getting rejected from most of the companies from even getting shortlisted due to my average marks, i got more depressed but never lost hope. Note: My skills were not at the level of genius so that i can achieve great things.

After Graduation: Could not find a job even when most of my college friends with no technical knowledge with technical degree got placed. I was the only one left, so while applying &amp; giving interviews i started expanding my father's business. After 6 months of interviews &amp; business exposure, i got selected in a MNC with good package but my interests diverted to management side after that. 

During 1st JOB: Just after few weeks i found out that the profile i got into has no future at all. So i decided to pursue for MBA from top college. I started preparing for entrance exams rigorously. After preparing &amp; attempting while doing job for 3 years, i could not get into a good college. My mistake was to ignore average colleges for the same. 

PRESENT 2nd Job: After scoring low &amp; getting rejected from all top management institutions, i tried applying to abroad. To do so i moved to Mumbai. With no hope from anywhere, my brother gave me an option to work in TV industry, which came as a surprise. He helped me get some opportunity for the same. And after few months of internship, i landed into a job, again with the help of him. But the problem is i could not change my mindset from technical background to media background. I am not happy &amp; interested in what i do. Whenever, i hear or see someone or something from technical background, i get excited. My parents are happy that i landed in a good industry &amp; should pursue the same. I feel trapped all the time &amp; still searches for management courses. I never come home happily from job. Everyone is thinks i don't have a stable mind to work at same place &amp; i can't decide what i want to do. Now i really don't what to do with my life."

My dilemma is this, If I graduate in my current situation I know it's gonna be extremely tough to get a job that pays decent. Might end up with bottom of the barrel job that pays min wage or slightly above min wage. Or I delay graduation by half/full year and get another internship that more aligns with what I am pursuing I will have a better chance at finding a decent job out of college. I heard a lot of grads with lack of internships spend many months unemployed after graduating and I won't want to be in this situation, rent and food's expensive out here."

I have a startup and we launched just over a month ago. Things are going great, but we need more people and have limited capital right now. We have a few things in the pipeline, but realistically those will take 2-3 months to come to fruition.

Our main staffing needs right now are:

1. Programmers with frontend experience in Angular, or backend experience in Scala.
2. Business Development - someone who can help us plan and execute our content strategy.
3. Math Geeks - We are a basketball stats &amp; analytics platform, so we are always looking for basketball minds with specific interest in stats/analytics.

Does anyone have experience with hiring quality interns? We would be able to offer a monthly stipend (nothing crazy, but $800-$1000) and the ability to work remotely.

Some of our early business highlights include:

1. We were accepted into a distinguished Canadian business incubator.
2. Accepted in a startup accelerator that will help us with our sales
3. Lots of initial interest from teams at the Jr. High, High School, and University levels.

I feel confident that we are going to turn this into a REAL business, but obviously we aren't there yet. We've moved out of the idea phase, but until we get reoccurring revenue I won't give us that distinction.

Ideally I want people involved that we can turn into full-time paid employees within 3-4 months. If anyone has any recommended avenues for us to accomplish this I would love to hear from you. Thanks!

2. I'd like to have experience, possibly from internships. 

I know that I can learn it on my own; however, I tried that without much success because I am more geared towards a classroom structure, where there are deadlines to meet, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Should I apply for a BS in CS or a MS in CS? I need to retake Physics because I completed the non-Calculus based.

If I apply for MS in CS, how should I approach the situation with prerequisites? Should I try to take the prerequisites at a CC if it's available? If it's not, should I register for a BS in CS route, complete the prerequisites and then apply for a MS in CS? 

I e-mailed an advisor there, and she said,"" ...if you are admitted for a second bachelor's degree here you will not be allowed to change your major.""

&amp;#x200B;

Any help or advice would be wonderful. Thanks!"

I studied for 7 weeks before I took this test. This is what I did:

1. Completely read GCGA book (took me 4 weeks, I read pretty slow lol). Scores on my test here: (72) 
2. Watched all of professor messer videos (took me 1 week).
3. Bought Jason Dion's tests and took them. scores were (70,77,62,70,70,70). After every test I would look at my weak points and I would watch professor Messer's videos until I completely understood those objectives(took me 2 weeks).

I also used the GCGA app and mostly used it when I was at work or when I had extra free time at any place I was. I recommend it for the flashcards and the acronyms it comes with.   

I studied about 2-5 hours a day and I did not study on some weekends. Overall I studied about 120-140 hours. I passed with a 752. Also, I thought I was going to fail at the end of my test. The test is very hard, study hard.

The day before the test make sure you sleep a lot, and have a really nice breakfast or lunch on test day. Also, go over all the acronyms on the GCGA book before you headout to pass your test!

PM if you have any questions, I'll gladly answer them to an extend of course. Thank you all who contribute to r/CompTIA, I learned what to study and passed because of this subreddit."

The team liked me enough to offer part-time during my last year at college and transition into a full-time position. I had planned to accept the offer, especially since my manager emphasized that the part-time involved a lot of effort on their part to fully train me so that I can easily start sensitive work when I start full-time.   


A lot of my peers got a larger base salary from similar-rank companies that aren't true tech companies, 80-90K with 10K sign-on bonuses and higher yearly performance bonus max, compared to my 75K base with a 2.5K sign-on bonus.  (and the sign-on bonus was after trying to negotiate the base, \*sigh\*)

The problem was always getting the interview but I recently landed an internship (almost 2 months ago) at a small MSP (~4-5 techs and almost 50 MSP accounts.) I am fortunate and thankful for the opportunity and the position quickly turned to part time which led me to just ditch my main career and finally go for IT even though it was only PT (originally I was only working Saturdays by myself doing remote work at the shop until the owner wanted me during the week).  I applied like crazy to any entry level IT job I could find because I was quitting my main FT job and knew I couldn’t live off a PT entry level role. I landed another interview recently.  The company is a lot bigger and more organized than my first one.  They offered me the position and now I’m stuck on what to do.  Switch and be FT right away for a few bucks more an hr with benefits and PTO while being a Tier 1 HelpDesk.  Or stay at the small MSP where I will be doing all sorts of tasks throughout the day on top of helpdesk.  It’s a more chaotic and less oiled machine and offers no benefits currently. I can only hope the owner lives up to his promise of making me FT as soon as I’m up to speed.  I trust him but I feel like the hours will fluctuate a lot depending on need, which I get. I feel bad because I just started and feel like a bad person for considering ditching the team so fast. But I’m wondering if having a more corporate style IT job that deals with bigger clients and is ISO certified with good procedures in place would be the best route to starting my career?  I feel like I’d get more knowledge of Exchange and Active directory as I’ll probably just be doing that type of stuff at first.  Any guidance is appreciated."

I (think I) am a sophomore in college, and I'm working towards a Bachelors in CS... I've found myself in a spot where my parents are pushing me to find an internship in the field...but I'm almost certain I do NOT have the ability to even participate yet...

So I was studying at a community college with a special program that allows me to take an AAS degree there, and then spend a year at a university to receive a BAS.

The Associates I was led to was a mere ""Application and Tech support"" degree.  Most of my effort was spent learning basic structures and C++. I completed the college's Advanced C++ class teaching more advanced algorithms and data structures, and earned some certificate... But I have little clue how to write my own app.

I have an Associates... but it doesn't feel worth anything yet.

TL;DR I can write code... but I do not feel prepared to write an app. I think I could do it... but how do I know I have enough to be of use at an internship?

I'm taking my first CS class and am learning how to use python (I'm a complete noob). I really like the idea of using information to generate plots and predicting the behavior of a given system by knowing some crucial things about it. I find it completely beautiful how we can use equations to model behavior and extract valuable and useful information. I love how numbers reveal the truth about the world with little grey area for philosophical debate. I know that not everything is black and white but numbers and data allow us to make predictions with a high degree of certainty and I really like the sound of that. 

I always thought that I wanted to be a theoretical physicist and maybe someday I will be but I increasingly feel that being a data scientist would be best for me. I am currently tutoring physics and working on a research project with one of my physics professors and I am hoping to gain valuable skills from these endeavors for my resume but I know that I also need to do internships and things of that nature to make my case and make myself marketable because ultimately everything is about the bottom line and profits.

I'm not entirely sure if this meats all the tifu rules, but I'm new to this and don't know how things work here. This is my first post. So I deal with it tomorrow if it doesn't.

Hello Reddit! Listen, a few days ago (I think it was a Friday), I REEEeeealy fucked up... Big time. Like, really-really big time. Seriously. Ok, so, just the day before I had stayed out late, about an hour and a half or so (for personal reasons) and got grounded for two weeks. My mom was furious at me. I had a cool head through her tantrum, which lasted until she went to sleep. And yes, I say tantrum. That night I decided to stay up late and planned some things out, along with writing/editing an SCP article. It was right before a weekend and the next day I didn't have school, so I didn't really care. Big mistake. The next day went pretty smoothly. Nothing really notable had happened, although I was more upset by being grounded for the next two weeks. But as the day wore on, I got very tired, my mother purposely picked fights with me that day because she was still mad about me staying out late. I was fed up. Not just because of that, though obviously, but because the day at its very end just kept getting worse, along with my luck. I think the universe just hates me or something. I found that at the end, me, my sister, and my mother all went out for some f'reals at Kwick-star (it's like a malted ice-cream, but from a gas station and overpriced on every day but Fridays). At this point, I had a migraine from my mother yelling-- mixed with the lack of sleep-- that could crack open an egg. (I have problems with sleep). They told me to go into a Kwick-star to go make the f'reals. My sister was supposed to get the rest of the groceries and pay for it. Easy enough, right? I had done this a million times before.. But Nope! I frantically made 4 f'reals in a row. My sister got the groceries quickly but didn't want to stand there, even for a minute and a half. A goddamned minute or two. So she told me to take all the items and pay for them. But she knew I don't use cards and with the few times I have, I paid with a completely different card with a different pin. I argued with her because I couldn't carry everything, and because of the card, but eventually gave in. My biggest mistake of the year. So I asked her for the pin number which was 55555 (not a real pin btw don't try) and I moved around the room faster than sound, than lightning, faster than a rushed intern working for a movie producer, trying to remember that M wanted wanted Irish cream on the top j(but no whip cream), but that S wanted Irish cream with lots'a whip cream. I was rushed for time, mainly just because I'm hypercritical of things and super ADD, there wasn't actually anything urgent, but I felt like there was. So I waited in a long line and had to set down the groceries every once in a while because the frozen bacon in my hand started to hurt a F###### lot in line. When I got to the front of the line there was this 'semi-rude' cashier (I think she was just new) who instead of just charging me for 4 f'reals, clumsily took out all four of them one by one to scan them. This never happens because the staff know they all cost the same and that the line was very long. But this lady didn't think it was long enough to get a second person on deck and that it was of the utmost importance to scan each one individually. I scanned the card, only to be told that I used an invalid pin number. So, I said that I would be back because I needed to go outside for a minute. Migraine in my head, frozen hand from bacon, nearly dead asleep while standing, and fuming out the nostrils, I stomped back outside and demanded the pin. The pin that my sister had blatantly lied to me about. It was to the other card that I normally use. I didn't know what credit was, I wasn't ready to find out any time soon, that's why I had even came out. So it's wouldn't be credit. That, and the fact I couldn't think straight. So she then tells me that it's actually 12345 (also fake pin btw), I come in, but barely step inside. That line I had told you about. Yeah, that lady had apparently walked off to personally attend to a customer , leaving this poor overworked-looking guy off to the corner. Let me set the scene here. One cashier. Me, wanting to buy a couple F$#&amp;!@$ ice-creams already sitting at the counter. And a line of 20-25 people stretched around a food display almost reaching around to the entrance doors. It takes an excruciating 10-ish minutes to go through the line for the second time and pay for my damned belongings. There was a lady right behind me with a crying baby only furthering my headache. It didn't sound like a baby though, it sounded like that annoying ringing you hear in your ears after a bomb goes off. I wait in this line until almost the very end. There were two people at the cashier, the guy I saw earlier had gone, replaced by the lady from earlier and a woman who I saw mouth from about the middle of the line humorously say into her microphone ""Help me!"". The guy I usually see at the cash register (The Manager) opens the third line. I've had a lot of shit that whole day, but especially at the gas-station... How could it get worse? Don't worry, I'm getting to that. That. same. goddamned. lady... That same lady, only just then realized I was there in line!! Lucky me!!! You see... I was the third person from the front of the line. I had waited there for so long, I would've been there anyway in a couple of seconds. But noooo... this lady stops this black family of five the moment they get to the front to let me check out. She let me wait the whole time for this. It looked like something straight out of the 1930's... I felt ashamed. Now... at the front of the line again, thoroughly embarrassed, looking like a racist, tired with a migraine and blazing anger at my sister, I swipe the card (Ok, here comes the fuck-up you've read this long-rant waiting for. you'll know it when it comes. I promise that.) I swipe the card, only for it to tell me that it doesn't work. My mom and sister had told me that it had a broken chip or something, so I'd need to swipe it 2 or 3 times to get it it to work. I stood there like an idiot swiping the card again and again and again like the moron I am. I blamed my sister for everything because she didn't want to wait a \[insert lengthy expletive here. be creative.\] minute and a half not sitting on her \[same expletive here\]-ass. Thinking back to it now, I know the cashier was just doing her job and was probably new, but still. Every situation was attended in the worst way possible. I'm slightly afraid of showing my face back at the station after the line-jumping thing, but I'm going to. The lady behind the register ask me if I could hand it to her to try and get it to work, so I had it to her and she says sweetly-""Pin number?""Me: ""Huh"" (I wasn't paying attention)""I need the pin""Me, for the absolute nit-wit that I know myself to be, desperately wanting to leave half-yelled the pin to her. Like a foot away. In front of dozens of strangers in a store, practically in a spotlight (the front) told her the number to access the card... I knew I fucked-up immediately... Even she was surprised She then said something I couldn't hear and can't remember; all I remember is her asking if i wanted it on credit... I just said yes and flew out the door. Everything was for nothing. I remember mumbling something on my way out but I don't remember. I still haven't forgiven my sister for what she did to, past-me, now. I remember blowing up at them in the car, falling asleep, waking up in the car and saying something I don't remember before falling asleep and waking up at 1:00. Oh you though it ended there? NOOooo... Now my sleeping habits are even more out-of-whack than usual. Now I wake up around one or don't fall asleep at all. So far. What have I learned from this? Well, I've learned two things.1# I am not ever going into Kwick-star to get my family anything from now on. They can go get it themselves if they want it so damned bad.2# Your bad day can ruin a week, or at least certainly half of one.

TL;DR I fucked up by staying up at night and yelling my debit card's pin number in front of a large crowd of random people."

d38g8b,676,2019-09-12,Leaving the most toxic company I've worked for after 6 months+ worth of non-stop job search,youngster180,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d38g8b/leaving_the_most_toxic_company_ive_worked_for/,"r/jobs has been a source of motivation for me. And this is my way to giveback to the community, now that I have successfully escaped my role in a failing startup company.

This is my story: a young university graduate who was working at the most toxic startup company — manipulative, micromanage, outright LIE to employees and customers about our products and company growth, frequent firings just because they did not agree with the management's decisions. 

I managed to stay in the company for 1 year + because of two reasons:

1. I simply cannot afford to quit without a job. I need to pay student loans, rent, etc. No savings whatsoever because of the low pay. You see, it's simply a viscious cycle.
2. I keep failing my interviews. Yes, this is another big factor. My CV has gotten me at least 10+ interviews throughout the 6 months of job searching. And those 10+ interviews are with big, big corporates and pre-screened (phone, online assessments), and I managed to bomb them during the face-to-face interviews. And anyone who has a job and looking for a job knows how DIFFICULT it is just to make time for the interviews. Schedule them before/after work. Go during lunchtime. Fake sick leave. Use annual leave. The process is simply exhausting and you can only use the same excuse for so many times before looking suspicious. 

I have been searching since Feb 2019 and I can tell you that, I have been putting 90% of my time from Feb - Aug 2019 in job searching. That includes after work hours, weekends. I sarificed my sleeping time, socializing time to refine my CV, study online assessment tests, interview tips, preparing for interviews... And by the mark of early August, I've got nothing. Absolutely NOTHING. I was so stressed and depressed at the time because

1. I have been doing well academically all my life, excelling in internships, doing community work, only to get myself stuck in a terrible company that is badly managed. I just feel my 20s is WASTED and my life is OVER because of my career situation. It definitely does not help that I am am ambitious person and my peers have already climbing up the corporate ladders all these while.
2. I feel worthless after getting all these rejection emails. They're 100% demoralizing, especially rejections after face-to-face interviews. It's almost like being rejected just because they've seen me in person and HATE me enough that they do not want to see me ever again. 

Yeap, that was the mental state of mine at the time. Everything was so dark and I simply cannot see the end of the tunnel. The job sucks to its core and I have bills to pay and I was just so tired trying to survive.

And this situation changed completely in the month of August. I was invited to a first-round interview in one of the biggest players in the industry that I was super interested in. Heck, I was hesitated to apply for that role in the first place because I was intimidated by the job descriptions and requirements but I applied anyway at the time. Thinking to myself that I have nothing to lose, I started preparing for the interview. Company profile, industry news and trends, the implications, how can my profile fit into the role, and questions that I'd like to know more. The first-round interview went exceptionally well. It really felt like the manager and I really think alike and synced very well. I quickly followed up with a thank you email and he replied to me, saying that ""I was very impressed by the effort and passion you exhibited during the interview"". I was invited for a second-round interview after 2 weeks, long story short, I've gotten the job that I could've never in my life dreamt of and I am starting the job very soon with a work trip to Europe scheduled. 

So moral of the story? Never give up. AND TRUST ME I know this is an ""easier said than done"" kind of thing because I totally get that. You just CANNOT see the end of it while you ARE IN IT. It's totally understandable and I've been there. But keep in mind, you only have the chance to get out IF you do not give up. Do not give up and try to see how your current actions can be improved, by asking friends for opinions etc. 

I truly hope my story can at least give one person here a reason not to give up and have faith in oneself to have the kind of career that you truly deserve."

I had zero experience and zero personal project. I got my first internship earlier this year and it got extended twice. Now I have been here for half a year and still a part time intern. I think I did well and my reviews were good. My manager mentioned it turning into a job a couple months ago but now it just got extended for the 3rd time. At this point I doubt it will ever turn into a full time job. 



During my time there first half I almost didn't touch their product and just got assigned some personal projects such as build a crud api, learn linux commands etc. I pretty much got paid to study. For the last few weeks I was given some non urgent real tickets and have learned a lot but some of the knowledge is about the company's business so i doubt it's transferrable if I work somewhere else. I also do their system check every morning -again it just company specific knowledge that's barely transferred imo. 



Is it time to move on? Should I start looking for junior roles instead of another internship? I am new at this and would like some perspective. Why do companies do long internships like this?"

Which FH and cities I need to avoid? If there is such thing in Germany

There is good cities with a lot of girls? I saw that Aachen has a ratio of 4 guys for one girl, something like that

d3dlo2,3,2019-09-12,(Vent) Job search after graduation makes me feel like a failure,SimpleDude996,jobsearch,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobsearch/comments/d3dlo2/vent_job_search_after_graduation_makes_me_feel/,"So, today, I received the news that the cabinet I applied for, which I really, really wanted to get in, unfortunately rejected me.

So, for context, I am a translation graduate and I've been applying for months after graduating, but had been told to not expect much until September since Summer was a quiet season in the field. Fine. Fair enough.

I moved out after I graduated since I hated the city I studied in (plus, even the cheapest rent was 3x the amount it costs me now). While studying, I would go on for weeks not getting out of my room, not seeing anybody (had no friends in the area since I didn't get along with the people there much) and generally just doing my own things (homework, projects, etc.). If I wanted to, I could have applied for a job in that area and gotten in fairly easily, but I despised the city so much I didn't want to spend anymore time in it than I had to. So, because of the lease, I had to wait until July to move out. During that time, I tried applying anyway, specifying that I wouldn't be able to start until early July, but I didn't get any answer from anyone. I did a placement test for a cabinet for which a friend worked, but I barely failed it (only 10% of people get in the first time, so I wasn't too surprised, but still disappointed. They did ask me to try again next year, however).

Fast forward to July and I'm in my new city. I can finally see friends I hadn't seen in a while, I finally enjoy the place and I can finally stop paying a ridiculous price for my rent. Great. I started sending applications again, but there were no offers anywhere. None. So instead I found every potential employer in the area and sent them my CV + presentation letter in advance. To pay rent, I had to find an unrelated job, so I started working in retail. I hate the job, to be fair, but it pays rent, so I told myself I'd stay there until I found something.

It was pretty hard on the ego since I felt like a failure for working there, having a degree and all (and being an excellent student at that), but my friends told me it wasn't my fault and that I'd have more chance in the Fall. After a month, I asked to work 4 days instead of 5 so I could keep a day to schedule appointments and interviews.

Now, in August, I resent all my applications to potential employers (still no offers available) and a week away from September, I received a reply from one of them (the one I was hoping to get in the most). They scheduled me for a test (which I passed) and then for an interview the following week. I went to the interview yesterday and I received the news today that they are gonna pass on me (but would be interessed in me applying again once I acquire ""more experience"").

That was kind of a slap in the face. Today, I have been searching all over for job offers, but I can't find anything in the field. All of it is either in Montreal or the city I left since it made me miserable. I don't want to relocate to either place and lose all the progress I made here. Moving out of that city made me feel so much better about myself and the idea of needing to choose between living here and having my dream job makes me want to cry (I actually did, in fact). 

I feel like a failure for not having found anything yet. I have basically no experience since I didn't have the time to work during semesters and I kept getting fucked over during the Summers (being promised a job, being scheduled a few times and then never put on schedule again; or, not getting a job because someone had more experience/was more available all Summer than I). The job I'm doing right now is the one I stayed at the longest my whole life (1 month and a half). It's that pathetic. Even my mandatory internship was a pathetic mess. I had to take an unpaid internship, which was basically a part-time job on top of my studies, where I didn't get any feedback and worked entirely online. What kind of experience is this? 

I have been seeing someone from a job agency and she's been telling me I'm doing what I need to succeed, but I feel like I'm making no progress. What should I do? Should I change my temporary job so I feel better in the mean time? Should I apply for unpaid translation projects just so I can keep getting experience? Should I try to find clients myself? Should I just get a good night's sleep, calm down and then figure it out tomorrow? I'm at a loss here...

TLDR; Feel like a failure after getting rejected by dream job after passing the test and doing the interview and having existencial crisis about not having experience and not having been able to keep a job in the past."
d3eb6t,1003,2019-09-12,Summary of my job hunt as a recent CS grad,Young_Galileo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d3eb6t/summary_of_my_job_hunt_as_a_recent_cs_grad/,"I graduated in April 2019, then took time for myself to travel and spend time with family and friends. I started my hunt in June and the whole process took just over 3 months ([Chart Summary](https://imgur.com/giGYAzR)).  

#The Numbers
I tracked my time spent into three categories.  


| Prepping | Interviewing | Applying | Total | Average per day |
|----------|--------------|----------|-------|-----------------|
|77hr 35min|  43hr 55min  |10hr 40min| 132 hr 10min| 1hr 10min |

I applied to **79 jobs** out of which I got a response (phone screen or coding challenge) from **13 companies**, eventually getting to **4 onsites**.

#Lessons and Learnings
I graduated from a top CS school with 24 months of internship experience (6 x 4 months). Most of my classmates went back to a previous employer for full-time. However, I struggled a lot with imposter syndrome throughout university and so, I wanted to prove to myself once and for all that I am worth the hype and can get a great job.
####Desensitize rejections/fear of failure
Despite having 6 internships I would still get extremely nervous and have lots of interview anxiety. The first handful of companies that interviewed me - I did not do well. Blanking out, stuttering, sweaty palms, the whole sha-bang!#. But after I racked up about 8 rejections, I was able to be more relaxed and perform better - 3 of my 4 onsites came in the last 4 week stretch.
####Revisit the questions
After every technical interview, jot down the questions asked and revisit them later. Even if you got the solution in the interview try getting a different solution.
####Don't Leetcode with tunnel vision
Leet code is great because it resembles a lot of what an interview is - SOLVE THIS QUESTION! But there is still the whole communication part of the interview, where you have to explain what you are going to do and explain your final solution. So instead of just blasting through problem after problem, take time to make notes/organize the problems you solve.
####Stay Balanced
If you have an interview the next day you don't gotta spend the whole day before prepping. Do some prep but still go to the gym, link up with friends, play video games. It really helps to let your mind forget about the job hunt for a while.

#The Result
Midsize company in Bay Area with ~50 engineers and ~250 total employees.  
Salary of 130k with 4k stock and 5k relocation.  
Joining as ""Software Engineer"" on the ""Data Engineering"" team."
d3ehwv,1,2019-09-12,Legal career question: policy job vs. firm gig? Follow your passions vs. just take the money.,LawyerThong,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d3ehwv/legal_career_question_policy_job_vs_firm_gig/,"I'm a 2L at HLS, and my two options for my 2L summer job (that usually plays a significant role in what you do post-graduation) come down to either working at a really cool policy job in DC, or going to a firm to do IP work.

On the one hand, the policy job would be really cool, and would probably align better with a long-career that I am super happy with. On the other hand, landing a summer policy internship is very different than a full-time job post-graduation, and the pay isn't that great to boot. As a first-gen college student, the thought of making less than my parents, not being able to afford a car, home, etc., isn't too pleasing. Not to mention pursuing passions outside of work would be much harder without funds.

For the firm route, I have an engineering background, and so IP is right up that alley. The work would hopefully be somewhat enjoyable, although lawyers are notoriously unhappy in biglaw. The pay would let me afford a standard of living I am comfortable with, indulge my hobbies, give to charity, etc., although I probably wouldn't have as much time outside of work. Still, long-term, I can't imagine myself being but so passionate about the work.

I'm very fortunate to even have the choices I do, and so I can't really complain, but it feels like I'll regret no matter which choice I make. Passions are fleeting, and there is no guarantee that I'll still be excited to do the DC work years from now, even if I get a full-time job. On the other hand, just giving up and taking the money seems like sacrificing long-term happiness for a short-term payoff."
d3eqah,1,2019-09-12,Path to becoming a graphics developer?,curmudgeono,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d3eqah/path_to_becoming_a_graphics_developer/,"I'm in my last semester, and will be graduating with a BA in computer science this winter. I have 2 summers of internships doing react development under my belt, but after my last internship, I don't think I want to go into web development. Not knocking the field, it just isn't for me. I am however very interested in graphics, but I have a much stronger background in web development, and frankly don't know the path to becoming a graphics developer/ what jobs are out there. All I've heard is that game devs are often treated horribly. I love writing parallel software, really enjoyed my graphics elective, and also love using 3D software to create art &amp; VFX in my spare time. Does anyone have any career suggestions for me/ any insight into what it's like being a graphics dev?

TLDR: What careers are there in graphics development, and what are they like? Any suggestions for an aspiring graphics developer?"
d3fy5j,5,2019-09-12,Can anyone help me find a good Liberal Arts school for CS transfer? (currently sophomore),TheThirdNightingale,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d3fy5j/can_anyone_help_me_find_a_good_liberal_arts/,"I'm a sophomore at the University of South Carolina Honors college, 3.92ish GPA, 1530 SAT. I'm comfortable at UofSC, but I don't like the people really, and I figure it wouldn't be a big deal to transfer to a smaller liberal arts school if possible (which may be wrong). 

I've had one very small IT internship and a virtual internship with the Dept of State, although the project failed lol. A UX/UI company has asked me to standby for an internship next semester, but I don't know if that's a ""you'll probably be hired"" or not. I'm not sure how relevant this is but I'm also concertmaster in the strings orchestra at UofSC

My more concrete hopes are to get a position in a top tech company, and I also like the idea of some high up government job but have no clue how to get there. After undergrad, I'd like to go to the best European masters program I can get in to (I'm also an EU citizen) 

I found that Pomona College in CA is a good option, and I'm wondering if there are any specific recommendations for other schools that anyone knows of? Pomona is definitely extremely selective and expensive and probably not realistic.

I applied last year for transfer to Cornell, which I will probably do again this year. But Cornell is a lot larger than I'm looking for anyway"

I will be taking Data Structures next semester, but will not take Algorithms until I am a Junior(currently a sophomore). I have a decent GPA at a highly ranked school.

I am really worried I will not be able to get an internship next summer and I really want one. I figured some things I could do to help my resume would be to try and get involved in research but I am really inexperienced in practically everything but MATLAB. I did not land an internship this past summer.

Do you guys have any advice? Should I put Data Structures on my resume even though I haven't taken it?

I was thinking I wait until I can get more experience on my resume before applying to anything. I really don't care about the quality of the company, as long as I can get a software engineering internship that gives me experience for potentially applying to bigger companies the summer after that. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I was also wondering if I should apply to Data internships. I know I want to do software engineering as a profession, but I figured if I couldn't get a software internship, data would bethe next best thing."
d3gsj5,3,2019-09-12,Has anyone ever been denied a job because they pursued computer engineering over electrical engineering?,kel_chapo,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/d3gsj5/has_anyone_ever_been_denied_a_job_because_they/,"I’m working as a co-op (essentially an intern) for Marathon. I was extended the offer when I was in still in EE. I accepted the offer during the semester of school and decided to switch to computer engineering after talking with my advisor. My advisor assured me that since EE and CompE are so similar at my university, that it would not hurt my future job opportunities. She didn’t even feel the need to inform my employer.

Yet, three weeks into my job my HR contact calls me in for a meeting and cuts my pay by $8.51 an hour because of my change in major... Also, she says I cannot continue working in this department in the future. I tried to explain that EE and CompE are very similar, but nothing has changed. She says I cannot be considered for full-time in the EE position, and the only way to work for the company with a CompE major is to work in IT, which does not interest me.

I really didn’t think switching majors would hurt my chances, but now I’m beginning to reevaluate my decision. Has something similar happened to anyone else or does this seem like a special case?"
d3gtxy,3,2019-09-12,"Her peer is acting like her manager, but he is not. Help me give her good advice?",diguldingo,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/d3gtxy/her_peer_is_acting_like_her_manager_but_he_is_not/,"
First things first, this company is small and does not have a dedicated HR person. It is associated with a larger organization that does have HR, but we have little to no contact with them.. All things like pay, PTO, etc go though an automated system. We do have hr-adjacent employees involved with hiring and onboarding, but that is all they do. We're located in the US.

I know ""Julie"" from work, we both are engineers, she started a while after me and is newer to the industry than me, and I've been trying to help her do well professionally. Teach her the ropes and all. Up till she was hired, I was the only woman in a team of 20 and I've had to work though some difficult stuff. And if I can help make things easier for women who enter the field, after me, I sure want to. Along with work stuff, we've also become pretty good friends.

She came to me with something she was having trouble with at work. During her internship with our company last year, her manager was ""John"" and her peer mentor was ""Dan"". She didn't tell anyone at the time, but Dan wasn't too good of a mentor. He actively discouraged her from going to other people for help or guidance, it seemed like he had a bit of an ego and wanted to be the only one guiding her work. He also talked down to her a lot. (Side note, none of this surprises me, I have worked with Dan as an equal, and even then he has an abrasive and domineering personality. In my experience, he is a poor communicator, and does not understand what the team is doing as a whole, while the rest of us communicate a lot more closely, and ask questions about what we don't understand)

Fast forward to this year, she's been hired full time. John as her direct manager. She's no longer mentored by Dan, they're on the same level in the company. 

This was about the time we started becoming friends, I didn't know her well when she was an intern because she really kept to herself then. This year, she told me about her trouble with Dan, and said that even now, he's being a pain. He seems to be telling her what to do, on parts of the project that she is in charge of. He went over her head, and over her manager John's head, to talk to the top boss at the office about the timeline of her work. And he is still being domineering about the work she is doing, even though it is her work and not his. He has his own totally separate tasks.

Julie went to our manager John about her role in the company, asking him to clarify if she was supposed to be managed by him or Dan. And he said in no uncertain terms that he was her direct manager, and she and Dan were peers.

But even after that, Dan is still acting like he is still her superior, trying to manage her time and her work. Sometimes his instructions conflict with John. And she wanted advice from me about how to resolve things. 

I want to tell her to go to John and tell him ""Dan has done XYZ relating to my work, those all seem like management tasks. And as he is not my manager, you are, could you please clarify his role on the project with him, so there is no further confusion? I understand he may be in the habit of managing my work, as he did when I was an intern, but now it is difficult having two people giving me conflicting guidance on XYZ topics.""

But... I know I have a bit of an overly direct bordering on confrontational way of addressing things. And I don't want to give Julie bad advice just because I'm annoyed on her behalf. Can I have some input on whether my advice is good, or if there is a better way to resolve things?

TLDR - I need a second opinion on the advice I want to give my friend from work"

d3hv5p,1,2019-09-12,Should I (22F) accept the job offer that means moving back in with my parents?,alwaysokayy,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d3hv5p/should_i_22f_accept_the_job_offer_that_means/,"As some background, I graduated college in December 2018 with a bachelors in marketing and had a full-time paid internship from January - May in the same major city where I went to school. In June,  I started a different job in the same city that is essentially an internship for the first 6 months, and then full-time after that. 

During this entire time, I have been facing a lot of anxiety about what I want in my future career, whether I even want to stay in business and marketing, etc. I also have been struggling somewhat to live in the major city while making an intern-level salary while paying my student loans, as well as facing loneliness and depression following college graduation and a major breakup. 

A few hours ago, I received a job offer for a job back in my hometown, a small city in the Midwest. It pays slightly more than what I’d be making even past the internship stage of my current job, and obviously financially it would be great since I wouldn’t be paying rent and would put my entire paycheck towards my loans.

However, I’m worried about moving back to my small hometown after living in a major east coast city for the past four years. Even though I’d be better off financially, would I put stunting my career growth? For context, both my current job/internship and the job offered are at marketing agencies. 

TL;DR: I’m struggling financially and emotionally in a major east-coast city and have a full time offer in my hometown in the Midwest, but am worried about long-term effects."

I've gotten a ton of helpful advice from this sub and it's community over the years. I remember posting here as a stressed out sophomore in college, and now I have a German BA and am teaching in Spain!

I lived in Germany while doing my degree, and it was great. I am starting to plan for the next step, and have been looking at DAAD scholarships to help with a masters degree in Germany.

I am hoping to get your opinion on a few things:

* when it comes to employment in Germany, i know that the humanities are a challenge-- especially as a US citizen. there is a masters in Linguistic and Literary Computing, which seems like a very applied use of linguistics and technology. any insight into how a masters program like this is received?

* DAAD scholarships. There is one for working with the Ministry of Education and Research, sounds super cool, but I am not quite sure what it entails. it doesn't specify if it is a practicum for a masters or what, any insight about it?

*The BAföG training assistance provides state funding for pupils and students at vocational and general educational schools, colleges, academies and institutions of higher education, including the compulsory internships related to training and education. The assistance is likewise extended to public and private (if equivalent) establishments for education. Training via corresponding distance learning courses is eligible for funding, as well. The training assistance may also be granted for a training period abroad. Foreigners and German citizens are eligible for the training assistance. The exact requirements for qualification depend on the candidate's legal status, such as citizenship in other EU countries, settlement permit or the recognition of a refugee status. The training assistance is intended to contribute to the cost of living and education. To this end, the BAföG Act provides qualifying lump-sum rates, which vary according to the type of training.*


tldr: open to a lot of different things, marketing, business, linguistics, want to do a masters in Germany if I can get a scholarship. looking for ideas about what type of masters to pursue for a potential career in Germany. speak Spanish English German Portuguese."

Good morning!

Like the title states, instead of complaining about not being able to find a entry level job, not being able to land a job at the top 4, or how recruiters a scourge in this industry I wan to ask some questions instead. I don’t have a CS degree. (Sue me, my parents are worthless to the point that I count even claim fafsa to go to school) and I have lost several opportunities even after nailing an in person interview because “we only hire people with bachelors degrees.” For some background, I’m trying to transition from an IT/ Jr devops role into front end because I’ve been dealing with servers to some capacity for almost 10 years and I’m tired of it. I don’t think lying on my resume is going to do me any good but im starting to reach a point of desperation here. I want to know if I'm doing something wrong or targeting the wrong jobs when applying.

   
 

* ”proficient” : what does this actually mean for a jr level position form a skill level perspective? I can write js with documentation open and I can use jquery. Is that good enough? Its not going to be glamorous code by any means and Sr devs will probably scratch their head trying to figure out why I'm doing things certain ways but the code itself works. 
* In terms of ""experience"" I've been using bash scripting to automate and keep legacy environments afloat for the past 3 years. Would this count as programing experience ? I’ve only been doing front end work for about 3 months. I was supposed to transition to a jr front end developer position after migrating all of the legacy environments to new maintainable ones. Unfortunately my prior employer decided that now that all ""the web server stuff"" was automated they didn't really need another jr dev and unceremoniously fired me. 
* I want to eventually work as a react.js dev. When a job posing lists ""hands on experience"" or ""familiarity"" is following a tutorial on making a react to-do list count as hands on experience ?
* I've had recruiters hang up on me when I tell them that I don't contribute to FOSS projects. Why are companies so obsessed with every single one of their devs being the obsessive ""eat, sleep, code"" type? I obviously like programming and find it interesting, if not I would not be seeking a job in said field. I do however have other interests and hobbies and don't necessarily want to sit in front of a computer during every single waking hour of the day. The reason I no longer want to work in IT support in any capacity is because in most places the IT guys are looked at as ""the computer monkeys"" It's a thankless job with zero work life balance. Is there an effective way around the""why don't you contribute to foss"" question?
* ""knowledge of tools like"": what is this even supposed to mean? Yea I'm aware that github and sass exist? Is that what is being implied here? I really wish people were more descriptive in their job posts but that's a completely different post on its own. 
* This one is not really a question but more of a issue or disconnect I've also faced. I have what I would describe as some level of ""advanced"" or best practice programming knowledge/habits. For example I can easily work withing a unix environment, I make code design docs before writing actually coding anything and write pseudo code before coding as well. Things like that seem to really excite Sr devs in interviews but I never get a followup call for another interviews or job offers.
* Internships puzzle me, most if not all of the internships that I've seen are only aimed at college students having them work for free, or the few paid ones expect you to basically be a experienced front end dev that is willing to take a crappy wage. I get that internships are supposed to be a learning thing so why are they asking me for 2+ years of experience in anything? 

That's a brief summary of some things I've encountered while trying to land a job.  As always any advice is appreciated."

I noticed that this is a pretty common topic on reddit so I wanted to share my experience with this company. I’m sure that everyone is familiar with most of the details that I’m about to share so I’m just interested to talking to others about it and share the stories from it. 

Starting out: I was looking for my internship during my last year of college. I received a few offers, but somehow thought that this one was the best for me. The others I guess didn’t relate to what I wanted to do in the future as much. I met them at a college fair and they got my information and went ahead and told me the first project: to speak with ten people to get their thoughts on the job and to get their information. I was to bring this to the first interview. At first I didn’t think it was so bad. It was only getting people’s opinions on it. Later on I realized that they probably just wanted people to call on, even if you don’t accept the position. I brought this list to the interview and spoke with them. After about 10 minutes they offered me the internship. I told them I had to think through it. The next week I accepted it. They told me I had another project then. I had to find at least 100 people to call on when I start. They encouraged many people to be family memebers and friends (as long as they had a good job). I felt really scummy writing down my family and friends names down. The next part was the first training. The day after Christmas no less. They mentioned at the training how it shouldn’t be a problem to the interns because if they cared enough they’d skip out on their holiday plans. There wasn’t much to be learned there. They mostly spoke about all of the good things that can happen from this internship. Free suits, bonuses, promotions. They made it sound so easy. It’s like everything they say to you is a lie and they’re not even good salesmen. 

Finally the internship actually started. I was kind of excited and wanted to make the best of it. I tried to not call on family members at first, I didn’t want to be that type of person. After not having much success brining people in for meetings I decided to. A few agreed but most thought I was crazy for trying to do so. Many interns and employees lie about their production numbers in fear of being ridiculed by their mentors or possibly even fired. I was scared for sure that I would miss numbers and get fired, so I did all I could to make calls and art meetings. Because of the fear, it makes you give in to calling on family. It also makes you be more pushy and do whatever you can to make a sale.

Looking back at this job, or internship, it makes me so grateful for the job that I have now. I think that’s probably what it does to a lot of people feel. There were about ten interns when I started and I believe only one is still there currently. I feel really sorry for him. I got out as soon as the internship was over. Even though I didn’t hit the numbers to be promoted to full time, they wanted me to do another semester as an intern.  Recently I was called by my mentor that I had while I was there. I didn’t answer because I knew why he was calling, I was right. He left me a voice mail saying how he knew that I would have graduated now and probably have a job so he knows there is probably a need for insurance now. I thought it was crazy how they would call on previous interns to try to get them to become clients. Another advisor there tried to keep asking me for one of my family members phone number after I left. He sent at least 5 texts asking me for it. 

I’d love to hear other people’s experiences at NWM. I’ve already seen many crazy ones. I know that I have more stories too. Let me know what you guys experienced with this place!"

This all started because I was raped at the beginning of my second semester of freshman year in college. It has really ruined my life. Before it happened, I was a really good student. Graduated at the top of my class in high school. I was looking forward to doing research in college and having internships. I was supposed to be graduating this spring but now I will have to be here for at least another year. It took everything away from me. I went through a really horrible legal process and he ended up being acquitted. Now I have PTSD and depression. I can’t focus on schoolwork because I have this horrible anxiety at all times. I feel like there’s an electric current in my spine all the time. Nothing doctors give me helps it. So now I’m really behind in school and doing really poorly. I have disability accommodations to get more time on assignments but my professor isn’t as helpful this semester. I worry what will happen when I graduate and get a job. They don’t give extensions in the real world. My boyfriend left me because he couldn’t handle me being suicidal all the time. I don’t blame him but I feel like everyone is probably getting tired of dealing with me. Almost every other woman I talk to has had something like this happen to them, but it didn’t derail their life. Obviously it hurt them but they aren’t constantly withdrawing from classes every semester and just wasting away in bed. I feel bad for not getting better because everything else in my life is perfect except for this one bad thing that happened. I have a family that completely supports me and friends who love me and I know most people have it way worse, so I don’t know why I can’t handle this one bad thing. I’m in such a deep hole and it seems like nothing ever pulls me out of it for longer than a month or two. I just really want out. I’ve tried different therapies, so many medications, even tried psychedelic drugs to help. Nothing fixes it. I just don’t see it getting any better and I’m so tired of struggling so hard to accomplish nothing. I know that I shouldn’t kill myself because it will hurt my family but I can’t keep living in all this pain just to keep other people happy."

I am currently in my last semester of community college as a computer science major. I have already been admitted to my transfer institution for the Spring 2020 semester.

I understand that right now is the best time to start applying for internships for Summer 2020. I have a mediocre resume written up that reflects that I am currently in community college pursuing an associates degree. Unfortunately, I have heard that it is generally very difficult for community college students to obtain internships.

My question is: would it be an intelligent idea to add to my resume that I have been admitted to a university to finish my bachelors degree?

Thanks!"

I applied to a network administrator job thinking that my professional experience would be too limited for them to want to interview me, but it was worth a shot... and after a few more steps, I have an interview scheduled for Monday.

So here is the situation. The position calls for a lot of familiarity with Linux, virtual and physical networking, virtualization, backup procedures, and of course routing, switching, and other aspects of enterprise networking. They seem open to experience coming from training, schooling, and past experience that didn't necessarily come from a job.

I have an A+ and Network+, working on Security+ and MCSA (almost done).

In volunteer positions and on my own time, I have worked with Linux almost exclusively for the last 12 years and configured cloud services, gotten a firm handle on TCP/IP, set up managed wireless access points, connected servers across state lines, configured VoIP during my recent internship, learned Cisco routing and switching to the point where I'm comfortable doing it, learned to automate repetitive tasks with Bash, Perl, and Python, learned KVM and VMWare to a point where they don't surprise me and I can set up VMs very quickly, and can plan network configurations whether virtual or physical.

In other words, it's not starting from zero, but there are sure to be things I don't know. This seems like a position that is possible to get, but I have to **really** sell it.

Talking about past relevant experience is going to be necessary, along with showing that I'm committed to learning more and always being able to do the work. They need to see that I really want this and I can be made to fit the role, even if I'm not strong in every single area right this second.

I'm open to any suggestions or wisdom for this interview."

&amp;#x200B;

I am writing to gauge my competitiveness for different doctoral programs in mechanical engineering, as I'll be beginning my applications soon. I have a preliminary list of schools to apply to, but I don't know for sure if I am competitive for these schools. Currently, I am a senior Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering student at SUNY Buffalo.

&amp;#x200B;

Below, I've listed my relevant attributes.

**INVOLVEMENT, INTERNSHIPS, LEADERSHIP, RESEARCH**

*Positions*

* Engineering Student Leader for freshman seminar: I have worked in this role since my second year where I help to guide students through the engineering modeling process in a fall and spring course sequence. This process includes teaching students how to fully define an engineering problem, training them in the development of metrics of comparison and decision matrices, coaching them through the development of quantitative and physical models to measure system performance, and demonstrating the importance of conceptual models and sensitivity analyses to the modeling process. Each course also entails engineering recommendations, where I help to guide student research and proposals to ensure they provide sensible multi-criteria recommendations.
* Turbomachinery Design Engineering Intern: In this role, I worked in the realm of machine design which primarily included rotordynamic analysis of machine components. My two major projects were the development of a dynamic loading cycle counting algorithm, including different rainflow counting methods, which was used in a program to predict fatigue failure of rotating machine components. The second major project was the completion and verification of a tool that analyses loading data of rotating components in conjunction with geometric and material properties to estimate the number of cycles before that component is expect to fail in fatigue. This internship helped to reinforce my desire to pursue further education and research in solid mechanics. I've worked in this role during the Summer 2019 season and will be re-hired part-time during the fall semester soon.

*Involvement*

* President (former Secretary) of Student Chapter of American Society of Mechanical Engineers: I am currently the President of the ASME student chapter at my school, where I oversee the operations of the entire club. My role includes managing the battlebot and solar boat project, ensuring our club meets all requirements set forth by the student government, and ensuring we provide ample opportunities for students to stay engaged. I ultimately am also responsible for club funding which includes fundraising approximately $1,200 over the academic year (2019-2020) and securing any additional funds that may be required to execute our projects through grant applications. I was previously the secretary of the student chapter of ASME where I was in charge of engaging and updating students through email, website updates, and advertising.

*Coursework*

* I am currently enrolled in a graduate level course on finite element structural analysis to expose me to higher education, especially because I am interested in FEA theory as a research topic.

*Research*

* No research to date, considering attempting to perform research with a professor on finite element methods, but may not be possible due to other commitments.

**ACADEMIC PROFILE (SUNY Buffalo)**

* GPA: 3.623 / 4.000
* GRE: 155V/161Q/6.0A
* Dean's List (&gt; 14 credit hours, 3.6+ in all courses): SPR 17, SPR 18, FALL 18, SPR 19
* Introductory Chemistry: C+ (weakness)
* Calculus I: B- (weakness)
* Calculus II: B (weakness)
* Calculus III: B (weakness)
* Differential Equations: A (recovery)

**SCHOOLS INTERESTED**

* Cornell University (Lofty goal, I know...)
* Penn State
* Virginia Tech
* RPI
* Ohio State
* Duke University
* University of Florida
* UB

**RESEARCH TOPICS INTERESTED**

* Solid mechanics
* Fluid mechanics
* Heat transfer and thermodynamics
* Dynamics and control

&amp;#x200B;

Am I considering the correct tier of school given my profile, or am I being much too optimistic considering I don't have any research experience? Any help would be appreciated, and thank you for your time!"

**Essays, LORs, other**:  
Essay for UChicago, IMO, is a *bop*. Honestly think its rather well polished and meaningful, prob an 8/10. Other essays are also good enough, they won't hold me back I think.   
Letter of Recc comes from (1) my english teacher, who knows me well (taught me for 2yrs) and we spent afterschool time talking about the book I read that week, or some other things. All in all, one of my favorite teachers. (2) My math teacher, who reignited my love for math and science. Also teaching me for 2 yrs, and knows my inquisitive behavior in class and my diverse curiosities. Both are Harvard grads, though I'm sure that doesn't make any difference. Prob strong letters.   
Otherwise, no other circumstances. My family is in good health and well educated, we are financially stable, and no real hardship has hit us during my highschool years. There are no ""excuses"" for me.


Applying to UChicago ED1 (my dream school), as well as MIT SHASS (philosophy major) and Georgetown (Walsh school of Foreign Service) EA.

Throwaway because I want to protect the identity of my boyfriend.

So, my boyfriend runs a convention, mainly around pop culture. It’s similar to comic con, but much smaller. We have awesome guests for a small convention, and in its heyday, it was very popular! There are other conventions held around where we live as well, majority of them are friendly. It’s even customary to help each other out – my boyfriend let another convention borrow equipment before, and vice versa, in exchange for promotion. Most of the time, competition is friendly.

Except for this one con, run by “Chad.”

Chad has a small convention too. It’s mainly focused on anime. It’s nothing fancy at all – in fact, it’s not even held in the same location, we technically host ours in a different city. But this guy. Is. The. Worst. He for some god forsaken reason hates my boyfriend’s guts. I don’t really know why – boyfriend claims it’s because he wanted to partner with his convention, combine with eachother, and essentially be co-ceos, but boyfriend declined. He once confronted my boyfriend and went into a long ass rant about how my boyfriend’s convention is gonna cost the livelihood of his (unpaid) interns. He also registered some Instagram accounts with my boyfriend’s company name, and refuses to let them go. But that’s not what’s bugging me.

Chad makes every person he works with in the community sign non-competes, specifically against my boyfriend’s convention. It literally has in the contract “do not work for boyfriend’s convention."" Essentially, alienating my boyfriend from the entire community. No one can work with him. Some places cannot promote him. It pisses me off, because he loves working with people, he’s super friendly, and extremely passionate about what he does.

I guess my legal question is generally, is this dude seriously allowed to contractually bind people to not work with him? Are there legal ways around this? Can my boyfriend sue for something like this? I just want some perspective."

Long story short I might not be able to continue my education at a university. Knowing this, for the past year I taught myself basically MERN stack and actually landed 2 internships where I did web dev work. I also have a portfolio site up with pretty decent projects that are mostly in full stack js apps. Is it possible in my area (washington Dc) to land something. I'm really not picky with salary lol. I will pretty much take anything 40k+ also I am not a citizen, even though there are a lot of jobs here   half of the jobs in dc require a citizenship/clearance. Is it possible to land something? I will take any advice."

d3yrfc,1,2019-09-13,[IT/Programming] Potential Apprenticeship vs. Graduate School,z3anon,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d3yrfc/itprogramming_potential_apprenticeship_vs/,"I'm just looking for some advice regarding a recent job offer. After graduating in spring with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems,  I've been grinding nonstop to find a job until I'm able to go to graduate school.

The thing is that I was recently interviewed an unpaid internship which was designed to lead me into a paid apprenticeship. This might be a fine alternative to graduate school, but I've been made aware the resulting apprenticeship would last longer than graduate school and I wouldn't be able to choose my working field in that apprenticeship. I can live with that, but I was also told the most I could expect at the end of the apprenticeship is contract work.

If I go be an internship, apprentice, and then potentially a contractor, I'm worried I'd miss out on the potentially better career opportunities, benefits, and job security I'd receive from a graduate degree in CyberSecurity Engineering. 

I'm aware I could eventually go to graduate school later on but something seems off about the idea of an internship, leading to an apprenticeship, then leading to contractual work. The idea seems wobbly, vague, and sort of an insecure career path.

The interviewer was an internship seemingly interviewing me to be his replacement, with him going to an apprenticeship in Amazon Web Services, which I've heard is just warehouse work. I got a call to set up an interview within hours of applying. I wasn't even aware it was only an internship until the interview occured, as the job was listed as a Jr. Programmer position.

 The interview occured only a couple hours ago, but I can't help but be suspicious. In the meantime I'll continue applying for jobs, but this is the first interview I've gotten after awhile of constantly applying to jobs and so I can't help but wonder if I should consider this an opportunity to kickstart my career. 

What do you think, am I just being paranoid? Should I avoid it at all costs? Should I give the internship a chance, or hold off in case I find a better alternative?"
d40u3h,1,2019-09-14,Have I taken on too much? If so what do I drop? (Senior year stress),Jewbacca289,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d40u3h/have_i_taken_on_too_much_if_so_what_do_i_drop/,"I get that this is the type of post that you guys make fun of all the time and normally I wouldn't even be asking for opinions but my counselor called me in today to tell me that he thinks I have too much on my plate this year and that I should at least consider dropping one or two things from my schedule. For the most part, I've tried not to be a resume builder type because those kids are pretty blatant but I'm sure it'll come off that way so I'll try to explain best as I can why I've done the things I will list. I hope that in general you all understand that most of the things on my list are genuinely interesting to me.

**Academics/Classes (I want to be an Engineering major most likely)**

AP Computer Science A (Related to Major)

AP Calculus BC (Related to Major)

AP Physics C: Mechanics only (Sort of related to major and my dad's a physicist and really pushed for it)

World Religions (I was assigned this one, no choice)

AP Art History (Not related to major but I figured it would be more interesting to me than econ or psych)

AP English Lit (I really liked Language last year and the book discussions that we were able to have last year so it just felt natural to pick it)

**Extracurriculars at School** 

Cross Country/Track: All year commitment with morning and afternoon practices during season and morning practices during the winter. Personally I started doing it because my friends convinced me to Freshman year and I was really out of shape before going to high school. I'm a captain this year and also a four-year member.

Congressional Debate: Only in winter season. Usually not too bad of a time commitment with 1-2 hours of practice a week and a couple of weekend tournaments. Joined this because I wanted to improve my speaking skills and confidence

Newspaper: We have a new cycle every three weeks and I usually try to write for as many issues as possible. Its usually a 2-3 hour commitment once every few weeks plus interview and outlining time. During the winter season, I'm planning on being a sports reporter again which means during the season I'll likely be following the soccer team to their games and doing pictures and overviews of each game. There isn't really a big reason why I joined other than it sounded fun and my friends suggested it to me.

Capstone Project: It just started last year but we have a year-long independent research project. Idk about time commitment but I'm anticipating spending a few hours doing research a week early on and a few hours in the spring writing. Joined this because I had a fun idea for a paper and also because part of our responsibility is working in a writing center which I like (more on that down below)

**Outside of School Activities**

Boy Scouts: I'm going for my Eagle Project right now. Commitment isn't too bad atm but the past few weeks have been a lot of work because its coming up soon. Realistically shouldn't have a problem after I get my packet submitted and mostly I'm doing it just to get it finished.

OA VC of Membership: Last year I spent a lot of time on this because I was in charge of restarting my chapter from scratch which was a pain in the ass but I managed to get it working towards the end. I got promoted recently and now will be serving on the Lodge level as VC of Membership. I don't really know what it entails so if anyone has any advice or knows how much of a commitment it is please let me know. Moved up to the next level because even though it was really hard because I was alone I was really fulfilled seeing the end result and wanted to help out more.

Martial Arts: I do Tae Kwon do twice a week for two hours. I've done it for 15ish years and mostly go out of loyalty now.

Piano: I have a senior recital at the end of this year. My teacher says I should be practicing for 1-1.5 hours a day 6 days a week. On average I get 30-60 minutes in a day which is having me progress a bit slower than I should.

Volunteer Tutoring: Two times a week I work at an elementary school with a program that pairs volunteers with students and we teach them how to read for an hour. This is probably one of the activities I'm most passionate about because I really loved learning how to read as a kid and found I really like teaching.

Hospital Volunteer: 2 hours a week working in the errand and escort section of my hospital. I started 2 years ago because I wanted to learn what working in a hospital would actually look like and I kind of just do it because its only 2 hours a week now and I get a bit of practice interacting with strangers.

Lab Intern: Over the summer I got an intern job working in my local lab (don't want to say where I'm from) doing some circuit design and board production. Technically I'm an intern until the end of the calendar year so in my free time I'm supposed to go in and help with whatever's left on the project.

&amp;#x200B;

Context: A couple of days ago one of my teachers flipped out on me when he found out how late I was staying up (I had to do some work on my Eagle project and meet my beneficiary, write a new draft of my personal statement for English class, and turn in a research packet and abstract for my capstone project). Earlier today my counselor called me in saying he was concerned about how much I've got on my plate and that he had gotten reports about being concerned. Personally I've always thought I could handle it, yeah I would go to bed really late sometimes and get up early the next day for practice but I'd push through when I needed. But my counselor and I had a very genuine conversation talking about the stuff I had on my plate and he told me to over the weekend consider dropping some things that I listed so here I am. Hopefully among the downvotes and snarky comments that even I would make at reading something like this, I get some enlightening advice about what I should do."

I'm repeating my sophomore year starting this spring because I got sick in the middle and had to withdraw. 

I recently was flown in to interview for a software engineering internship at a big bank with a strong tech focus. There were 5 other candidates there with me. We were all given pretty much the same interview, but in the same span of time all of them completed three questions, while I only completed two.

It seemed that the majority of people in the room were sophomores aka younger than me, which makes me feel worse. Prior to this interview I had completed 46 leetcode problems, and went through probably half of cracking the coding interview. 

The really sad thing though, is that every medium level leetcode problem can take me a whole day to do. Plus, the really sad thing is that the problem that took up all my time (and thus prevented me from moving onto the third problem) was a binary tree problem where you need to remove a subtree if all members had the value of zero. 

I do attend an ivy league, but I realize that for computer science ivy league means nothing. I think the curriculum of any other top CS school like UMichigan or UMD etc would probably be the same in rigor perhaps even harder. I've always been kind of below average at my school in the computer science classes. 

I'm starting to think I'm not cut out for this. Or could it be that the sophomores I encountered at this interview, all study harder than me and do more than me?"

d47fdq,23,2019-09-14,"I was held back 2 years in post secondary (personal rock bottom), got help, and then was offered an internship at a top 5 company (my personal current peak)",RealRiver,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/d47fdq/i_was_held_back_2_years_in_post_secondary/,"Do you envy the success of your peers and wonder why you haven’t been able to do the same? Do you believe that talent and intelligence is something people are born with?  Well, you have a fixed mindset and you should keep reading.

**TLDR**: This is the story of how I was held back 2 times in a mechanical engineering major, discovered that I developed a fixed mindset, got help and fixed it, got an offer as a design engineering intern at a top 5 company, and finally passed the term. I have a cumulative average that is borderline failing (if a fail is 2.0, then I have a 2.1). My message is not even close to “grades do not matter.” What I will say is that I was able to overcome my poor gpa and situation to land my dream internship (I realize I am a sample size of 1).

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the majority of high school I was cultivating a growth mindset: I saw every obstacle as a challenge and did my best to learn everything I could. During this time I was voted into various positions and had success in academics and sports teams. I was so accustomed to succeeding that when I didn’t get into my top school choices in my final year of high school, I didn’t have the mental fortitude to handle it.

I entered university feeling like I was taken from my small pond and thrown into a vast ocean. The “failures” from earlier kept haunting me so I made a lot of decisions that would negatively impact my mental health: I shut myself in my room, avoided socializing, and stopped exercising. These were all major changes to my lifestyle and ruined my mental health.

My post secondary school has a special co-op/internship program and most students graduate with 4-6 placements/internships. I didn’t get relevant internships for my first 2 terms and decided to join a student design team where I did my first bit of work that was relevant to what I wanted. I successfully completed and manufactured a design for them and landed my first relevant internship as a manufacturing engineering intern for electrical connectors.

My grades and mental health kept declining until I failed my 4th semester in fall 2017. I failed so hard that I was close to being kicked out of the school. I thought to myself that I had only failed because I didn’t take the term seriously enough. So I left to do an 8-month internship as a machine design intern and tried the term again in fall 2018- then failed again. I realized that something was wrong so I visited a student counsellor and she told me that the problem was my mental health. I then set out to change my lifestyle, improve my mental health, and change my mindset. I started working out, changing my eating habits, started socializing more, and learned about the differences between fixed and growth mindsets. The rest of the events all occurred within the span of 8 months.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to join a new design team for a change of atmosphere and went off to my 5th coop term as a manufacturing engineering intern for a consumer electronics company. During this term I was recognized for my leadership qualities at not only my company, but also my new design team. During my internship, I was relied upon to lead a team of full-time mechanical and manufacturing engineers to investigate a critical yield-hitting issue and implement an effective solution.

After failing 2 times in a row and hitting rock bottom, I felt worthless. After my internship, changes to my lifestyle and habits, and finding a group of people where I felt like I belong (my design team) I was feeling much more confident, and happy in life.

I then went back for my 3rd try at completing my 4th semester for the summer 2019 term that just finished. During this term I interviewed with many companies and positions that I never would have expected. I interviewed with 3/4 of the top 4 most prestigious companies according to this ([https://www.vault.com/best-internships-rankings-search/most-prestigious-internships](https://www.vault.com/best-internships-rankings-search/most-prestigious-internships)) and got an offer from one as a mechanical design engineering intern. And after being stuck in the 4th semester for 2 full calendar years, I was finally able to pass the term.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe that all of this was made possible by realizing that I had developed a fixed mindset and making the necessary changes to my habits, mindset and lifestyle. A person can spend an eternity envying other people and questioning why they can’t achieve the same level of success but that isn’t productive- it doesn’t change the situation. You have to realize that it is only productive to think about what you have control over; all you can do is focus on improving yourself. If you’ve been developing a fixed mindset, I advise you to change that as soon as you can.

Keep working hard but be mindful of your  mental health.

&amp;#x200B;

I find IT topics such as networking, cyber security, cloud computing, databases and systems administration alright, but I seem to have more passion for programming and software development after recently completed my data structures and algorithms class (along side 3 other programming subjects which cover Java, C#, object-oriented programming concepts, JavaFX for GUI apps using MVC and .NET framework). I seem to really enjoy the problem solving part of programming and able to apply my creativity to build apps from scratch is rather fulfilling.

My current resume is very much geared towards IT support / helpdesk roles. How can I optimise it for graduate software developer / internship roles instead? I haven't done any side projects outside of my uni coursework, and I don't have a portfolio / github profile. Are those a necessity for getting into software dev? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Also, how much would I be disadvantaged if my major is in IT instead of CS when applying for developer roles? I'm reluctant to switch my degree from IT to CS within UTS as their CS degree includes an honours project which I fear it would be too difficult to get through (I am absolutely not the type of person that enjoys writing long essays, let alone long research papers).

I have a math degree, computer science degree, over 2 years experience; I have applied to over 150 jobs and have never had an actual interview much less a job offer.",gauss2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d47tcq/what_shortage_i_have_a_math_degree_computer/,"This is a bit of a rant, and while I am open to suggestions, I'm not writing this to actively solicit them. As the title says, I have a bachelor degree in math and an associate degree in computer science. I have more than two years experience with multiple languages, full-stack, AI, on teams and working independently; almost all internships, grants, etc. I graduated at the end of 2018. I have spent the last 9 months applying to over a hundred and fifty jobs; going to job fairs, working with recruiters, and (what feels like) wasting enormous amounts of time crafting cover letters, doing research on employers, and filling out ridiculous job applications (sometimes with mandatory surveys, virtual introduction webcam captures, and other nonsense) only to be met with silence. I got two phone calls that I can't properly classify as interviews, and nothing more. Only one company sent me a rejection email that was actual written by a person and not a canned response; most don't even send the canned response.

I know that very recently the conversation has started to drift towards another recession, but all I've heard before that is how well the economy is doing, how low unemployment is, and how bad the shortage is for STEM and tech talent. What a crock of sh\*t. I see the same jobs get reposted over and over again, and I've learned the hard way that about half of posted jobs are completely fake, and are posted by companies trying to profit off green card holders or upselling education. I only apply to jobs I am qualified for, despite the crazy requirement inflation. In the few cases I've been asked to supply a desired salary, I put a very conservative amount. 

Looking for a job is the most soul-crushing, depressing, and devaluing thing I have ever done in my entire life and I spent two years in a warzone in Iraq. At least then I had a purpose and paycheck.

Edit: to the people wanting to know why I haven't applied to 10k jobs, it's because I only apply to jobs I'm qualified for, are real and not fake postings, are a good fit for me, and are within my commuting distance (the greater NYC area). 

I do research on the jobs and companies/organizations, I  spend time crafting cover letters, and often have to go through long submission processes. 

Yes, it would be easy to spam easy apply to every job on indeed and similar, but that is part of the problem. We complain that you need to network to even get your application looked at, but why would they look at your application when they get so many from people who are just 'lol spamz 200 resumes a day'? You are actively making it harder for hiring managers to find qualified people and perpetuating  the system of fake job postings by applying to them."

I have sent out 100+ applications out there, and so far, I have only received calls from staffing agencies who found my resume. However, none of those really followed up to anything.

I've never had an interview after a month of sending out applications until Revature gave me a call. They were the first one to actually give me my first interview, but I have read so much about them and the majority were all negative. I should also point out that I have no work experience (not even an internship), so is this worth a try? Or should I back out and just keep sending applications. I have a part time job that is completely unrelated to my degree, but I cannot put this degree to waste.

I've been reading this subreddit for about a year or so and I feel I have learned a lot. My problem today is that every time I come to here to attempt to learn how to go about making my way into finance, I come across people's resumes that make mine look really bad. This is obviously extremely discouraging, so what I'm really here to ask is if it is realistically possible for me to have a decent career in finance. 

A little bit about me: I went to a small private high school in the US, after which I was unsure what I wanted to do, so I continued working at my part-time job for a year before enrolling in my local community college, planning to study Accounting. At some point along the way, I discovered this sub and it lead me to wanting to pursue finance instead, mainly because of the negative opinions people here have about accounting, and because of the greater pay within finance. Currently, I am in my last semester planning to transfer to what I believe is a target/semi-target in my state(UT Austin) to study either Finance or Economics(depending on if I get into McCombs Business School).  Eventually, I also discovered r/consulting and after researching all these fields a bit I believe that my biggest preference is for working in management/strategy consulting. However, I am also open to working in FP&amp;A, Corporate Finance, Commercial Banking, PE, and AM. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/K1yZSa7) is my resume; I believe that there are a few small errors in terms of formatting, but I'm mainly just looking for critique of the actual content today. I know as it is there isn't any area for extracurricular activities or skills or anything. This is because I actually haven't really done any since high school. I am looking to begin a volunteering opportunity soon, though, so I am hoping that can help at least some. I also am looking into having an internship next summer at my company, hopefully in Strategy, but possibly also FP&amp;A, Analytics, or Accounting. I am also independently studying Computer Science, with a view of becoming capable in Python/VBA/whatever else could be of use to me in my career. Other than that, my time is occupied with work, school, family, and a girlfriend. 

So, there it is. Am I crazy for thinking I could ever make it into finance? If not, what are my potential pathways? What kinds of positions should I be looking for? How can I help my resume? (I plan on joining any finance/consulting related clubs once I transfer to University) 

If you've read this whole thing, thank you so much, and I look forward to reading your replies."

At the moment I am stuck between a decision which I struggle with. I would like some advice from you.  
The situation is as follows:

I am a mechanical engineer who wants to become a software engineer within industrial automation, preferably in motion control and robotics.

I have two job offerings lining up, each their pro's and cons.

Job one: Kind of a start-up company and enviroment. Awesome people there to work with. I will be working on a totally new project for the company where I will work with robotic arms an let them perform large-scale 3D-prints. I will be responsible for the setup of the robotic arm as well as programming them. First they will perform what is called more 2.5D-prints but after that they want to continue to real 3D-printing. This is quite an unique opportunity to work on in my opinion.

Job two: Traineeship to learn how to work with ISA-88, ISA-95, PLC-programming, Siemens TIA Portal and TIA WinCC (all new to me). The traineeship will consist of about four months of extensive inhouse training and then work on projects for 3 months with close guidance by a more experienced engineer. It will teach me how to be become a software engineer in a very structured way and I think this will give me a good headstart into the field of software engineering. They will aso help me with my future goals through training etc. The catch is that I have to sign a study contract of 3 years of each course I take. If I leave early I will have to pay the leftover money, the dept declines every month.

The catch here is, that my girlfriend wants to move back to the USA in 4 years (she's American). I think job number two will give me a better resume for the USA (I only did internships before this because I just graduated). Also is it common to take over left over depts at previous companies from trainings in the USA? Talking about roughly $10000.

What are your opinions on this matter fellow engineers?"

Winter - 2 classes

For the first 4 classes I plan on accepting the financial aid offered to pay. So far I haven’t had to take any loans. Is there anything special for the financial aid that I need to plan for? 

As far as internship I am actively trying to secure one. After that I will try to convert to FT or seek FT employment elsewhere while doing my last class.

d4caql,2,2019-09-14,What's the viability of transitioning into industry after teaching high school straight out of college?,meatduck13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d4caql/whats_the_viability_of_transitioning_into/,"So I was thinking up a random idea. The average CS grad, who doesn't have impressive side projects and can't Leetcode for shit and has 0/1 internships, seems to usually wind up in the 50-60k salary range at some company that is not exactly using up-to-date technology. Is it a lower-stress life, yes, fulfilling, not so much. Most places teachers end up getting underpaid, but in a few states like Massachusetts 1st year teachers can absolutely get 50-55k, and job availability for math teachers/physics teachers (and CS where applicable) is relatively strong. Let's say an enthusiastic young CS grad who hated the type of aerospace/defense companies and consulting body shops where jobs are available in droves, decided to go teach instead, while also going for a masters in CS after basic lesson plans are made, and working through one or two in-depth side projects over summers. I understand this person would be in for constant 80 hour work weeks and a lot of stress, but would such a pathway even work? I guess what I mean to ask is, do companies value unrelated work experience if the education is there and there's enough side projects to show you know what you're doing?"

d4em0h,4,2019-09-14,Strained relationship with my dad,Otter_Nonsense18,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/d4em0h/strained_relationship_with_my_dad/,"My (23F) dad is really, to say the least, getting on my nerves, and quite frankly I don't know that I want much to do with him.... I apologize for the wall of text coming. 

He is calling me more and more trying to talk to me and hangout with me. But there are reasons I don't feel close to him. I just moved into my first apartment after college. And although I lived mostly with my mom and stepdad when home, he monitored what I was doing quite a bit. He's a cop for the city, and always wanted to know where I was, and would be grumpy or at least show extreme displeasure if I was out in an area he didn't like. This includes places I had to be for work, he just didn't want me working those jobs or internships. I get that he's my dad and he wants me to be safe. I really do. However, now am a young adult living on my own establishing my own life and career, and I want to enjoy my independence. 

Another thing that's been bothering me is, over his years as a cop, he's definitely developed some strong racial bias, just like his dad. He at least knows it. But it really aggravates me, I think more and more as I've gotten older too. Right before I moved out of my mom's house, my dad asked her what I was doing and she told him I was going on a date with (insert name). His response was ""Ugh I hate to ask but his he black? Sounds like a Black name."" 

He may also have some homophobic tendencies. During Pride this year, I posted several things, no reference to myself, just general support, happiness, and love. I found out from my mom he texted her asking if I was trying to ""tell them something."" (I am bi, but never come out to anyone other than my 1 close friend). Now my mom isn't really better on this, I know her views as an evangelical. But, she's all around a loving mom to me who has gone above and beyond for me, and I am pretty confident that wouldn't change, even if she disapprove. Doesn't excuse her views though either. But it's how she has responded to my athiesm. 

Now, my Dad's dad, my grandpa, was notoriously a pretty grumpy man. My dad, whether he chooses to see it or not, is becoming more and more like his dad with time. He's impatient, quick to anger, makes scenes in public and makes passive aggressive rude comments when things don't go his way. We've also got into arguments over things, and I'm sure I've contributed because I'm stubborn, but I've come away crying and hurt from the things he has said to me and the way he has yelled at me in his ""cop voice."" And these things make it hard for him to be around. 

Oh, in addition to all the stuff my dad does, I feel I should mention what he doesn't. I'll start off by saying that I was a very sick kid, like starting from around age 5, got much worse at 8 and continued to do so, peaking between the ages of 15 and 18, then improved until reaching a plateau in the last year and a half. My mom was ALWAYS THERE. And I mean always, despite running here own small business, and continuing as a court reporter, and returning for her MBA, she was there for Dr appointments, inpatient stays, ER runs, testing, surgeries. She was there to talk to insurance (under my dad's name), advocate for me with doctors, literally just whatever you can think of. Now, my dad was there *some* very little in comparison. He worked nights, so during the day if I needed anything there was almost a 0% chance he'd help or be there. But it did happen now and then. ER visits were pretty much limited to him stopping by when he could take a 30 minute break while working. Help with insurance? No. Help with docs? Occasionally, if he was there. Surgeries? I remember 1 ambulatory surgery he was at. He was there, as was my mom for a major surgery I had that required a month inpatient. He did sometimes come stay with me during the day during that. Mom stayed every night. Doctor appointments? Rarely, and always super impatient. I have epilepsy as well, and therefore can't drive. When I lived at home I wasn't on a bus route. So I needed help from parents and friends. My mom gave me rides very frequently, and my dad rarely did. If asked, he acted like it was the biggest burden, asking why my mom couldn't and finally saying ""Uggggghhhh sure I guess I will."" And when I moved into my apartment recently he complain and moaned about having to help me, and eventually did, and only gave 1 hour of his time. His reason for leaving my mom and me to do the rest was that he had to go to the gym. Helping his daughter is a flat out burden to him. 

I also don't think he cares about his side of the family very much. He had a stroke last fall, and luckily the only thing affected was some balance. However, his family who lives about 4 hours away wanted to come visit. They were worried, understandably. He would not have it. He didn't even want to talk to them. And several months later my aunt wanted to come visit him and he absolutely wasn't having it. His excuse was that he's got ""too much going on."" I'm not sure what that means, because his life basically consists of work and the gym. And she doesn't expect constant entertainment, he just wants to see her brother. 

I talked to my mom last night and he is apparently unaware of any reason I might not answer every call, or want to hang out every week. I don't know what to do. Maybe this stuff is petty and I should let it go, I don't know. But it's definitely been weighing on me. Feel free to give input, but I just needed to let this out somewhere."

*Malcolm Reynolds voice*
Here's how it is:


I graduated college in 2010 with a B.A. degree in English and a minor in Multimedia Communications. My goals for life after graduation were a profound, ""Iunno.."" Unwise, but I digress. 

I've worked a lot of jobs since graduating, namely:

•Videographer
•Digital Content Manager (for Apple and Android apps)
•Manufacturing Production Associate (for book publishing)
•Warehouse Employee
•Middle School English Teacher

I've had all of these jobs over the course of 10 years. I'm now enrolled in the local technical college pursuing an Associate's degree in Computer Networking and Systems Administration. I plan on getting as many certs in the business as I can, starting with compTIA A+ and Network+ this first semester, and moving on to CCNA and others later on. 

My questions are thus:

•I'm 31. And by the time I finish the courses for the certification, I will probably be 33. The only real IT experience I will have upon graduation will be an internship assigned by the school in my final semester. I realize there will be people the same age as me that could run circles around my ""fresh out of college"" abilities. Am I too old to get into this field?

•IT professionals out there; if I'm NOT too old to get into this field, what certs do you recommend I focus on? Should I attempt a master's degree in this field? Is that even necessary?

•My primary goal is to cut my teeth in the field by landing a job as a Systems Administrator for a school district and moving up from there. I have no problem working a help desk position for a year or two either, but, again, am I too old for that job? Are employers more likely to hire fresh-out-of-college 22 year olds?

•As stated above, I've been in quite a few different roles after graduating 10 years ago. I know none of them have anything to do with IT per say, but will they look good on a resume as ""real life experience""?

I'm an Australian living in Sydney and I'm currently in my penultimate year of uni, majoring in IT. I have some experience in IT support / helpdesk.

I find IT topics such as networking, cyber security, cloud computing, databases and systems administration alright, but I seem to have more passion for programming and software development after recently completed my data structures and algorithms class (along side 3 other programming subjects which cover Java, C#, object-oriented programming concepts, JavaFX for GUI apps using MVC and .NET framework). I seem to really enjoy the problem solving part of programming and able to apply my creativity to build apps from scratch is rather fulfilling.

My current resume is very much geared towards IT support / helpdesk roles. How can I optimise it for graduate software developer / internship roles instead? I haven't done any side projects outside of my uni coursework, and I don't have a portfolio / github profile. Are those a necessity for getting into software dev? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Also, how much would I be disadvantaged if my major is in IT instead of CS when applying for developer roles? I'm reluctant to switch my degree from IT to CS within UTS as their CS degree includes an honours project which I fear it would be too difficult to get through (I am absolutely not the type of person that enjoys writing long essays, let alone long research papers).

d4gmbz,1,2019-09-15,Need advice on leaving abusive friendship,Richpotatothethird,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d4gmbz/need_advice_on_leaving_abusive_friendship/,"TL;DR at bottom, I know this post is a monster.

Hi everyone. So, basically, my ""best friend"" and I lived together for two years in college. Mostly it was great but there were some issues and red flags that I chose to ignore. Big mistake. We moved to a new city together a couple months ago and things have just gone completely to shit. We used to live with other people, but now it's just us. Something I've learned over the past couple months is that my roommate has a lot of built up resentment and now I'm the only one for her to take it out on. About a week ago, we were both sitting on the couch and she was playing video games and I was watching Netflix. In my mind everything was fine. But, for some reason, she got super mad all of a sudden and Idk if it was me or her game.

In the moment I thought it was her game, and she got up to make herself food and started stopping around, slamming doors and banging pots and pans on the counters and slamming the cabinet doors and stuff. She came back and sat on the couch, still super pissed. I decided I didn't want to be in that type of environment so I went to my room. Then I heard her get up and go to her room and slam the door. The next day she didn't say hi to me when I got up and I didn't say hi to her. Idk what happened but it's not my job to play detective and figure out why she's pissed. So now it's been a week and we haven't talked unless it's about things we have to talk about like rent and bills. For the first few days she kept going around slamming doors and stomping and being loud in general. I decided I didn't want to act like a prisoner in my own apartment that I pay for too, so I just sit on the couch and go about my business. Also, the more she fails at trying to piss me off and the more she sees that her shit isn't affecting me, the more pissed she seems to get. She's started doing passive aggressive things now too, but they're really not that big a deal. The fact she can't ruin my mood is really getting to her. It's kind of sad tbh, and I didn't realize what an angry person she really is until we moved to our own place.

There's a lot of other issues though that have been going on since we got here. She's a HUGE control freak and has to have everything her way. She insisted we had to have designated spots on the couch and says it's just because she's super territorial, as though that's a justification(?). She gets mad over everything, like me closing the windows when she isn't home because it was loud, so she wants things to be the way she prefers even when she's not here. She almost never cleans. She got mad because I left my cup on the counter next to the sink because she has to use that specific counter space while she's cooking, even though there is space next to the other side of the stove. She insisted I get up to move my mug instead of just moving it herself. She also didn't like it when I left it in the sink. She left rotting vegetables in a bag on the counter and we thought the trash smelled, so we took it out, and then put the trash can outside to air out. She realized the next day what it was before she went to her internship and asked me to take it out, saying she couldn't because she was in a hurry. Of course I had to because our apartment smelled awful at that point. 

She has horrible road rage, and she pays video games for hours on end which I wouldn't mind except that she yells at her computer the whole time. Sometimes she plays with others and criticizes them and yells at them and tells them what to do, and when people tell her to stop telling them what to do she blocks them, claiming they're the ""worst of the worst."" If they lose a game it's everyone else's fault and if they win it's mainly because of her, in her mind anyways, which is a good representation of her mindset about life in general. 

She insisted I don't need to get a car and should just rely on her for transportation, which gave me really bad vibes, because it felt like she was trying to make me rely on her. I'm in the process of getting a car and when I asked her if she could take me to the grocery store one day for food she said she didn't feel like it. I had to fucking uber to CVS just to get pads because she refused to drive me there, even though the drive would have been really short, when SHE insisted that I could rely on her and didn't need a car...

When leaving our old place she left before me. She left a few boxes behind and asked if I could bring the stuff she left behind to the new place. I said sure. I thought she meant the boxes. Turns out she wanted me to search the whole apartment for all the stuff she left behind, but she didn't tell me this, or even let me know what to look for. So when I just brought the boxes she claimed it was my fault her stuff got left behind. When she asked if I would get the stuff she left, I thought she meant the boxes she'd already packed. I didn't think she'd want me to scour the whole apartment. Not to mention she accused me of leaving a few meaningful things behind and I kept telling her I took them and gave them to her parents to make sure that didn't happen, and that her parents had the stuff. She kept accusing me of leaving them, but she eventually asked her parents and they had them. She didn't apologize and I was really annoyed. She could have asked her parents if they had them, considering they had other stuff of hers, before accusing me. Not to mention, it's HER stuff. SHE is responsible for it, not me. I go the boxes she packed and I think that's enough. 

She is also very condescending and acts like an authority figure to others. She really hated our old housemates, and while they were annoying, just how much hatred she had for them really wasn't warranted. There's lots of other issues too, and I wish I hadn't ignored all the red flags. She once threw a tantrum because her boyfriend wanted to buy hand soap to put in our kitchen for when he stayed with us. She insisted we didn't need it, and he said he would pay for it and take it with him when he left, and she got mad and would't talk to him for the rest of the night. I don't think it was about the soap, I think it was about the control. He wasn't doing what she said and she didn't like it, so she tried to take control by throwing a tantrum. It did not work, he still got the soap. She refused to use it. She had insisted so much in the past we didn't need it that I just gave up, and I did that with a lot of other things.

She even criticizes what I eat, and I don't think that's ok. Anytime she does, she goes ""damn you ate those chips so fast!"" or ""damn you ate a lot."" I am an average person of average size btw. I eat a normal amount and go to the gym. I don't have a problem with food, but every now and then I indulge like everyone else. She is very tiny and doesn't eat much, so maybe it seems like a lot to her, which is fine but she should keep that to herself. I know what she is implying when she criticizes me for eating a lot, she's done it to others too. I think she does it to feel good about herself, but idk for sure. Either way, it's rude and inappropriate. People try to ignore her, but she keeps insisting that they ate a lot until they show that they are embarrassed. I normally just say ""so?"" and she says ""I'm just saying."" She never criticizes guys for how much they eat though, only girls. I think if a girl wants to eat a lot one day, then she should be able to without being judged like that. She also judges people for getting or being overweight, and honestly I just think who cares? It's not in a caring way, it's just her being judgy for no good reason. She is not concerned about them or their health, and will judge people for being even a little overweight. I think that says a lot about a person.

I let her take over so much of how I live my life for so long, and it happened so slowly I didn't even notice until now, because since we've moved to our new place I've started doing what I want to do, and she doesn't like it. It's only now that I realize the reason I didn't do what I wanted to do before was because of her, and I was afraid of her not wanting to be friends with me anymore and being alone. Last week when she had her fit over God knows what, is when I stopped denying that things weren't going to work out and accepted that the person I've grown so close to over the past two years is toxic and not good for me to be around. I feel ashamed of myself for ignoring so much of the shitty things she has done and said and deciding to continue being friends with her anyways.

It started out great, she was fun and bubbly and very positive, but as time went by there were more and more little things that she would do that I would think were wrong, but I wouldn't say anything, and I would ignore the voice in the back of my mind telling me that this person isn't as great as they seem. I just feel so stupid for ignoring the signs because I didn't want to be alone. I knew she had issues but knew it was because she came from a rough background and that everyone deserves a chance. Not many people accept me for who I am, so I felt very sympathetic to her situation. I came from a rough background too and we related to each other very well because of this, and I normally don't connect with others on a deep level. I thought that she would improve as time went by, but she didn't. She said herself that she would rather ignore her inner demons and deal with them in unhealthy ways, like though shopping or video games. Unfortunately this also means that all of the ways in which her inner demons manifest themselves are still here, but now I'm the only one around for her to take her anger out on. She doesn't want to change or improve, but I have, believe it or not. 

As I mentioned before, we haven't spoken for a week. Normally I would have given in and asked what was wrong and tried to resolve the issue because I hate tension and confrontation, but this time I stood up for myself. I showed her I'm not afraid of her and continued with my life like nothing changed, instead of hiding in my room. She seems to have calmed down now and I think that standing up to her is working. I'm so glad I did this, because I took all of the power she had over me away from her. Also, in the middle of writing this, she had food she didn't want, and offered it to me in a friendly way. I'm not sure what this means. I declined the offer, because I'm not about to be bribed into letting her tantrum over the past week go, or the fact that she straight up decided to stop interacting with me completely without telling me why. If someone could tell me why she offered me food and was all friendly all of a sudden, that would be great because I have no idea why.  


So, here's where I need advice. We're both college grads. Her internship just ended and we're both looking for jobs. I've been living on savings but they're running low. Our lease ends in ten months but I want to leave in four and think I should be able to, but I'm concerned about the job thing, because I want to move cities and will have to leave whatever job I get now. I am looking at temp jobs but have the opportunity of getting a good temporary job with the government that lasts 12 months. Would it be ok to take the 12 month job and then get a new one in the place I move to in four months, and just leave in the middle of the 12 moth job(with two weeks notice)? Or should I just look at temp jobs? I'm concerned about my work history being affected, because it's already not that great.

TL;DR: In an emotionally abusive relationship with ""best friend""/roommate. I'm trying to leave town in four months(don't like where I live that much). I have no job and am living on savings, savings are running pretty low. Should I only look at temp jobs, or get a regular one and just leave in the middle after finding a new job in the place I want to move to? I'm concerned about my work history, which isn't the best already."

Long version:
So basically I am a junior in college studying computer science as my major. I have been pretty lazy the last couple years only coding for homework.I am shotgunning applications for internships without any projects(I am trying to fix that) and when I get any response it's usually in the form of hackerrank or some other coding challenge.

My issue is I seem to be bad at coding or problem solving. Now I am already in debt and pretty far into my University education for quiting to feel like an option.(regardless of my ability for coding gotta finish)

So I  need some help to really improve my coding and problem solving skills because most coding challenges I'm being tested on are kicking my ass. So I really need a game plan to avoid still sucking by the time I graduate.(I don't really need to work for a tech company but I assume with a growing supply of CS grads companies are gonna get picky so sucking will lead to underemployment in an unrelated field)

The difference in my coding homework difficulty and these coding challenges are pretty huge.(like swimming in a kiddy pool versus the ocean)

What I mean is my software engineering class didn't have me practice a thing about engineering software (literally just read about software engineering and was told to code and demo a group project which could've not worked and still passed with an A-)
My analysis of algorithms class is so far extremely basic.( Learning about time and space complexity but the homework is literally make a random array and implement a sort algorithm)

So basically cause my school education sort of sucks by tech company standards for interns(My GPA is 3.4 and mostly get A- in my programming classes so I don't think I should suck that much as a student), I am basically on my own for figuring things out. I got a couple of years to improve, but I am terrified I will graduate with barely any skills(or relevant experience) if I rely on my school to teach me  everything I need to start a career as a software engineer/developer.(they are ABET accredited but at this point I am becoming concerned about finding a job if I am a decent student but no where near ready for interning at a tech company for a software developer intern role as a junior)

So what should I do specifically? I plan on coding everyday but only doing leetcode or hackerrank doesn't feel like it will really prepare me. I have purchased some Udemy courses but I really don't know what to focus on eg. Data science, websites, java, gaming, etc. They all interest me but I am not sure what I really want to do.(trying to figure that out with those courses)

Generally my priority is to get a job that pays at least well enough to afford my student loans.(aiming for at least 50k to start, I don't think that is unreasonable for a cs grad) I like programming and everything but not having a plan I am confident in is making  me very worried. I kinda knew I wasn't that good, I just didn't know I was really bad and struggling until I did these coding challenges.(before this summer I started applying and had 0 responses so I am doing my applications for next summer now)"

I’m in a difficult, albeit fortunate situation. My ultimate question is, do I stay at my current company and extend my internship or do I find work somewhere else?

Below is some context…

I’ve managed to secure a job at a very solid software company. I’m signed to work there for 8 months and have already completed 5 months of my contract. I have learned a lot and have a good mentor. My place of work is also extremely comfortable and really values a good work life balance.

However, my school’s internship program is a total of 16 months, meaning that I must secure another 8-month internship before returning to school in Fall of 2020.

If I tell my company I would like to stay they will likely make me sign a contract very soon since they are starting interviews for January 2020 soon.

I’ve already begun my January 2020 job hunt.  It is my general belief that it might be much more beneficial to my early career to gain different work experience rather than staying at this one company.

Since starting the job hunt, I have had a totally different experience than I did the first time around. I’ve received a decent response rate, and even scored a response from a FAANG company.

I have no illusions of securing a job at this FAANG company but given the number of responses from other companies, I’m confident I’ll be able to secure another job, even one that will likely pay more.

Money matters, but I’m concerned that if I take a job at a fortune 500 company it might look like a step down from my current company since the company is well-known of the realm of software. I even wonder that maybe some of these responses from other companies is credited to the name of the company I work for and not just the 5 months of work experience I have secured.

So what do you think /r/cscareerquestions should I stay at this company or should I look for work somewhere else?"

So, I really want to become a machine learning engineer in the future. Not only because it is the hottest field at the moment, but I am very interested in this field.

As of right now, I am currently a CS major. At my college, ( I go to UW Madison if that helps )  we do not really ""declare"" our major until we are done with the required course work. By the end of next semester, I can declare as a CS major since I am already on the right track.

I will be meeting with my advisor soon, but from the school website, I can also declare major in statistics by the end of next semester as well since the required courses to complete are not that many. As a matter of fact, some stat courses overlap with my CS requirement courses, so even if I double major I would only have to take additional 4\~6 courses to satisfy both major requirements.

My questions are the following:

1. Would it be worth it to double major in statistics and computer science?
2. What math courses are essential in the field of machine learning?

I'm already required to study Calc 1,2,3/ Linear Algebra/ Discrete Math/ Intro to Statistical Method(stat)/Theory of Probability(stat)/Applied Regression Analysis(stat)/Statistical Experimental Design(stat)/Inferential Stat(stat)

As for CS elective courses, we can take (1)numerical analysis, (2)intro to combinatorial optimization/ (3)into to optimization/ (4) intro to combinatorics/(5)theory of computing

And as for stat elective courses, we can take (1)Intro to Stochastic Process (2) Spatial Data (3) Intro to Time Series.

3) Lastly, should I take on any type of internship in the realm of computer science or machine learning only?"

The problem is: I have a laptop Acer Aspire VX-15 which has 7 months of use.

One day playing normally lol the charger simply stopped working even when it was plugged in and the LED lights start to flash (blue and orange) with 1 second delay constantly until I unplugged it and plugged it back in to work again, but it only works for a couple of minutes.

Throughout the days I have tried all possible solutions posted on ""plugged it but not charging **EASY FIX**"" or ""what means blue and orange led blinking and how to fix it"" like:

**\* Unplug the charger and press the power button for 20 seconds ( I can't remove the battery cuz is intern one)**

**\* Pressing the battery reset button for 5 seconds**

**\* Uninstalling the ""microsoft surface acpi-compliant control method battery"" driver**

**\* Buying a new charger (this method work for a few days but it returned after a couple of days of using the new charger - pretty rare because this removes the possibility that it is a problem of the new / old charger).**

**\* Restoring the system to an earlier version of the charger problem**

**\* Updating drivers daily**

**\* Checking if the internal battery is damaged or defective but the wear is only 5% and I really have no problems with the duration.**

My problem is specifically when I force the gpu through a game (lol, csgo, etc) or opening a few heavy programs at the same time, idk how to say that I have a thought that the charger stops working when I force the video card, but It can be pure coincidence.

I'm interested in going into industry and not academia (anytime soon, may come back for a masters in a few years). I previously did undergrad research during my cybersecurity REU last summer so I thought about tutoring for CS. I felt tutoring would be a great way to further refresh my CS knowledge and help other people. It's something I've always wanted to do lol. I already have a good internship lined up for the summer (SWE) so I'm focused on the school year. Currently I'm doing basic IT work and I'm also looking at getting a co-op but the time commitment would be higher for that. Have you faced this dilemma? With the research I would be making significantly less ($1800 over 2 semester rather than about $2600 for 2 semester with a $10/hr minimum wage tutoring). So if I did take the research I'd be making less than minimum wage given it's a stipend and I'd likely be working at least 10 hours a week."

Hi, I am a senior year computer engineer student. This summer I had an unpaid internship but in the beginning of the june I cancelled because my family said they couldn't afford the accommodation and living cost.

After the cancellation I had whole summer free and two startup idea. First one was a web app that is for carpet field football ( idk correct English term) and totally local. And the second one is about music instruments and notes, which is of course international. Second one requires a lot of ai work and is a team job( I could not do it in 4 months, i cannot do in even a year by myself). So I decided to go with first project. I talked with my friend from university to be co-founder and started working. Even though I worked part time as backend engineer last year, i did not know how to build a web app from scratch and first thing i did is learning it from the courses in udemy. My plan was to finish app and launch it in September but learning phase took a lot of my time. Even though udemy courses are finished in 10-11 days, i always ended up googling how tos and refractoring bad codes i written. I couldn't finish app. Note: my friend didn't even worked. He has a lot of excuses to not to start (like he was in erasmus last year and didn't write a line of code for months) and last week i spoke one of my other friends and he is part of the project now and team is 3 people.

my school is starting next week and we have graduating project (idk correct term again, sorry). I talked with my gf(she is in same class) about it and we decided to do subproject of second idea(related music) and continue as startup after graduation. We have a group of four and all of us is qualified to contribute project.

So now I see my situation as this: I have a good unfinished app, which will make thousands of $ when finished but requires at least one month work. I have a good idea(we talked with professors and got really good feedback) and a really good team for second idea(music related) My course schedule is a bit full, not enough empty hours for part time job. I cannot live more than 3 months with current income. If i start working part time(20h/week) , either i will let my grades decrease dramatically or give a break to web app. But it is a growing market in my country, so in 8 months there can be a lot of startup, i could be late then. If i do not work part time i cannot live, or live in depression because i will have to think about money all the time.

Note : my university is one of the best in country and i have 3.5/4 cpga. Another note : i got offer from Siemens for part time but i didn't accept it because technology they used is boring me and they insisted me to work until graduation. i cannot like every job opportunities because i was fired one due to the fact i was bored and watched YouTube videos during job hours and come 15-30 minutes late, leave 30-60 minutes early almost every day. (i always did my job on time, working fast).

What would you do in this situation? Can i find investment for the Web app in a month? Can i work part time and do both projects and study my courses?

I cannot figure it out. I am very excited about summer of 2020 but i am very scared the fact that i have to survive winter first and i don't have enough source for it."

Was getting some mixed advice on whether to include it on my resume so at one time I thought to take it off now I'm thinking it better leave it on. I had asked them to please take the article that I wrote down as an intern which basically says what I did there and what I learned and all you have to do is google search of my name and it comes up. However where their 2018 interns are listed I am not listed but the page still exists if you search my name. My question is if I wanted to include it on my resume can they say that I did not work there if they wanted to?

I know there's been posts about this before, but I wanted to try and get some updated feedback. This year, I served on a grueling internship process and my boss put me up for an Associate Software Engineer position at the front office of my dream company. It's honestly a dream come true for me. Below is sort of the job description and requirements

&gt;Responsibilities  
● Complete assigned projects related to development and analytics  
● Identify new and unique approaches to accomplish objectives  
● Document all work so that it can be understood and used by other members of the development team  
● ​Assist in administrative and support tasks related to information systems, including comp ticket and user management Technical Skills:  
Requirements  
● General understanding of scripting languages and databases.  
● Experience in .Net, SQL, Python, GCP, Snowflake, CSS and JS a plus

This job seems very doable for me. I had an initial internal interview, where they told me that this job was a lot of basic querying for the team, special projects, and would really only require some skills with Python and SQL. It sounded a bit like my internship, but a bit more technical. I had pre-written scripts and very basic code prior to get through this job.

But, I'm PETRIFIED for the technical screening. They told me it's about 20 minutes of coding exercises and then 20 minutes about high level system design. To give a bit of a background about me, I am a business management major who JUST begun a Master's in CS in a program designed for total newbs. I can do the absolute most basic of things ....I don't have the capabilities to do live technical coding questions or high level discussion on system design. I feel so out of my depth.

My boss told me they basically want to know how I think. He put me up for this....I don't know if I come off as this fraud who knows more technical things than they do or what. But, he put me up and said major experience wouldn't be needed. I had the impression this was a job to sort of groom me. To go alongside my Master's program because my boss was so high on my work ethic. I work so hard, but I know I'm going to absolutely tank this conversation. It's not my strength, and I'm beyond scared - but this is my opportunity to have a full-time job for a dream company.

Does anyone have any advice? I feel like a fraud, and I know I won't be able to nail this. I've never had a CS interview...nerves get me alone. I don't know how to prepare, what to look out for, but I don't want to look awful and embarrass my boss who put me up for it. But if anyone has any input or advice on my situation, it'd mean the world to me. I was praised so highly for work ethic, but I know that doesn't reflect on my current lack of technical ability. They haven't even posted the job, I think this is as good as mine if I'm passable, but I'm going in with 0 to go off of.

I'm sorry for the length, this is just so important to me."

So I interned as a software dev at a pretty large bank this past summer and they extended an offer to me to come back as an intern for next summer. The company is decent, but I'm not quite sure if I want to go back to the same company for another internship while I'm still in college. So while I have interviews with other better companies, should I accept the offer at my previous company and then just reject it when I get better or should I tell them from the start that I'm preparing for other companies? It seems so safe to be accept right now and reject later, but it seems immoral and my conscience is going against it. What would you do?"

Which lies the problem.

Background:
I am currently a graduate student in computer science. In my undergrads I got 2 degrees in computer science and business management. Currently I've had 2 summer internships with summer teaching programs across the east coast where I was the net admin and taught lots of kids programming and tech stuff in many different states and cities. I also have an assistantship with a completely different department than comp sci where I do everything from handle marketing and promotional material for student retention throughout the college, to handling events and staff organization, to teaching staff about new technologies to be utilized in the classroom. At the same time I run 3 clubs and I am extremely active around the University by helping faculty and staff plan large events frequently. In my free time I have lots of small projects at home involving Arduinos and lights, or game projects in Unity, and making music. I do alot of different things all the time.

Which there lies the problem. I have a general understanding of most things as I really enjoy figuring out how everything works, I feel like there might not be alot of other people that fall into my shoes, but I have a passion for problem solving. I literally want to do every job from being the software programmer that sits behind a desk for a day, to the Organization manager that restructures entire businesses, to the event coordinator for huge events involving thousands of staff and vendors all coming together for attendees. I want to teach at a university level where I can help students learn about tech and programming. I want to teach audio engineering and production. Etc....

There's so many things I want to do, and literally there is no job for such a wide range of stuff. Being a university professor was always gonna be a late game profession, but I want to do a bunch of stuff before I go to teach at least, so I have that much figured out. I've talked to lots of different career center staff and lots of resources around my university. They are all encouraging in ""you'll find it soon."" But like, there's not a lot of time left for me. I'm graduating with my masters in comp sci next year.

There's an opportunity coming up where we students have tables setup and we get to talk about our projects as employers come around to see who's the best. My resume is stacked so I'm not worried about them thinking I'm not qualified, but it's like ""wtf job you goin for here son?""
I hate bragging about myself so I really hope this doesn't rub anyone the wrong way, I genuinely would appreciate any help I can get in finding what I could aim towards...
Of you've read this long, I really appreciate your time at least."

I have over 4 years of work experience in the tech industry (enterprise sales into F100 and Public Sector), and recently moved to the Middle East with my partner due to a foreign service opportunity she received through her employer. While here, I've gotten an ""internship"" with a local refugee assistance organization (they're  a 501c3 U.S. non-profit) as an administrator for their donor relations technologies (think CRM, Analytics, and Email Marketing platforms), drawing from my experience in tech. This is an unpaid position and is 28hrs/week, so not full-time.

What I'm asking is: is this considered an ""employment gap"" that I should address in my optional essay? Is there a best way to represent this type of experience for Adcoms? The last thing I want is for this to look like I was taking a step back in my career.

I'd really appreciate any feedback!"

Next semester I will need to do an internship for preparing the thesis. The problem is I have no a single field of interest, but many such as software engineering, cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence. Furthermore shortly I will do some courses that will surely be added to the list.

Surely I can choose whatever I like for the internship, but I am worry that the area I choose will probably be the area I will work in. Companies look for experiences, so if I choose a machine learning internship I imagine that machine learning will probably be my first job and so the startup of my career. Am I wrong?

And the next question naturally follows up: Is it possible to change field during my career? Is it a bad thing from the point of view of the companies? I am never been appassionate to a single field, but I like changing and not to specialise in a single area. I am afraid that cannot be done in a working environment."

I'm currently involved in an undergrad major in Computer Information Systems and I've been studying for one year so far. If everything goes as it is going now, I'm probably graduating in July 2022, but I'm willing to delay it a bit in the future to do an internship in another country, probably just letting the mandatory internship and the undergrad thesis for the last part.

I'd like to read some advice from you guys, like: Which cities should I search in the first place? Is it really okay for a foreigner, who is not a native English speaker, to look for these kinds of internships abroad? Are there any companies (in my field of studies) that offer this kind of opportunities? Which countries are easier to get in and which others will need visas or other documents?   
I'm not certificated yet, but my English level is C1, I was even called by a local English school to be a teacher part-time. I'm looking take IELTS in one or two years though. I'm a B2 in Spanish, got a certificate two years ago. I'm currently taking French and Japanese classes. I don't know when I'm gonna take DELF, but I'm probably taking JLPT N3 next year. Ah, yeah, I'm a Portuguese native speaker.

Also, if you think I should not do an internship abroad, please tell why and give some options to go abroad in the future! I'm really open about possibilities!   
I'm currently working part-time in a job related to my field of studies and my Average Grade is 8.20 so far, if that matters.

I came across an old job listing for an “Implementation Engineer” at my company and some of the requirements are knowledge with HTML/CSS/JavaScript and JSON/XML API’s. Also knowledge with PHP and SQL was a plus. 

I also was thinking of learning Python and going down more of a DevOps Route. I have read that this is a pretty common transition for people in IT. This may be a little more of a learning period but DevOps jobs are growing.

I have a great opportunity in THIS current company, but I am not sure down the road if I were ever to leave this company - I don’t know if I would want to just be a Web Developer full time. I also am confused because if I spend all my free time studying DevOps stuff - then I am missing an opportunity at my current company to potential move up in to a higher role and i’ll Be stuck doing low end Tier 1 / Help Desk style stuff. I am really interested in DevOps and know in the future there will be a ton of jobs that are both available and lucrative - but just a little hesitant because of the opportunity in my current role. 

Can anyone help me out? This is my first job out of college so I am really looking to start making advancements in my career and picking up new skills. I just wanted to get someone else’s opinion or someone that has been in a similar situation. I have a pretty decent resume with 3 good internships on it plus a Bachelors (plus my current role at a established SaaS company) - so I know adding some coding skills will make me more marketable then just a typical “IT fix-it guy”.

I am 21 years old and have had the privilege of getting an internship at quite a big defence technology firm in my country this summer. However I live and study in London for the rest of the year. They want me to keep working for them as a Point of Contact and to do some markt analysis etc. They gave me the option of either freelancing as a consultant and making my own company from which they would buy the service from or staying as an employee of their company.

Which one should I choose? On the one hand having my own consultancy company with such a big client would be very good for my resume and perhaps it would be easier to move on after and find new clients in this sector as I have everything set up already.

However, staying as their employee means I would be closer to the company, know more inside info/be in the loop and also get some benefits in regards to job security. In addition I wouldn't have to jump through all the hoops with the taxes etc.

What do you guys think?"

note: not many people seem to know AICE courses, but it’s described to be on-par with AP and IB; IGSCE is like a precursor to AICE, it’s viewed as honors/advanced in my school system

Extracurriculars:
-Worked 3 out of 4 years of high school
-Summer internship (paid; research based), presented a poster about local water quality in front of an audience
-conducting independent research on O3 and CO2 variance in middle TN (Nashville focus)
-3 years Science Olympiad
-2 years DECA (1 time international qualifier)
-Accepted to University of Memphis Governor’s School for International Studies (passed with A+, college GPA of 4.0 earned)
-1 year TSA
-National Honors Society
-Rock Climber for 5 years


Essays/Other:

1 main for Common and Coalition App- commitment based, uses a metaphor from bouldering to establish how I was afraid to pursue what was best for me because of my failures in life and the easy way out; it’s still a work in progress, but so far, I would say its an average essay on its way to being great (also talk about the juuling issue here)

Another for supplementals- diversity based, talks about how it was difficult for me to overcome what others thought my identity was and who I thought I was; connection to my Puerto Rican family and my Russian heritage and how it conflicted (never felt apart of either); still a work in progress, average essay as of now

Portfolio- Collection of all of my monumental essays, presentations, test scores, transcripts, and other works (all the content isn’t A+ material by any means, but holds personal significance to me)


Biggest Setback: 
I got a suspension my junior year at the end of the year because of JUULing (like seriously how dumb was I? haven’t touched it since and have been free of it now for 6 months!)

Colleges:
Top- University of Washington (Seattle)
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
Vanderbilt University
UC Berkeley
USC
UTK
WashU


What do you guys think? My scores aren’t great, but they’ve been slowly improving and I’m really hoping I get a 31 or 32 for some merit at schools. I think my extracurriculars are ok too, nothing too fancy aside from the Gov School. I’m hoping that my dedication to the sciences may help me out a little bit considering my math scores are a little lower than average."

Now come fall and I have no connections for recommendations as I was never all that close to professors and my job doesn’t apply to school. I know I need some kind of internship or research experience but am very skeptical I’ll be able to achieve that since my GPA is so bad.

I have applied to a range of places but was mostly interested in getting into one of the big 4 consulting firms. I applied to all their new grad programs and was told I was over qualified for these roles as they only wanted undergrads not master’s students, so they wanted me to apply for associate positions. After applying for these positions I can’t seem to get my foot in the door. 

I have had a range of short term experiences with one long term work experience after finishing my undergrad. I have done internships with large companies including PepsiCo and PwC but still after applying to 200+ (I’ve lost count) positions I can barley get an interview. 

My experiences vary in role tasks which I think is valuable but seems to be hindering my ability to get in. I have done sales analysis, software implementation as well as conducting market research which was published.

What I am wondering is if there is any way to stand out, I was involved in societies throughout both degrees, volunteered my time throughout school, gained international experience, had research published as well as working on successful projects that have been implemented within organizations. 

I feel like I’m going crazy if I’m being honest, any tips or advice will be taken in and synthesized to hopefully produce the outcome of getting a decent job."
d53y88,3,2019-09-16,Is it appropriate to ask for a promotion?,listsandthings,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d53y88/is_it_appropriate_to_ask_for_a_promotion/,"Hey all, bare with me because I am really on the fence if I should push for a promotion, or if I should see the writing on the wall and move on to the next place. 

I have a BS in Engineering, and have been at my current job for 2.5 years. This is my 2nd job out of school, but I was only at my first job for about 9 months before I was poached to come and work for my current company.

I really at the core of it love what I do and the product of the current company I work for.  I work as a test engineer, and I prefer to use that instead of my actual title because my actual title is a type of testing that is very specific, and I actually do very little of. 

Lately, not only have I started to feel that my job title does not match the work I do, but I am undervalued by my boss, I will always be seen as his 'little sister' and will struggle to grow at this company because of that. Things that solidify that for me include the time he was chatting in my first annual review and said ""we took a risk on you because you were so unknown and with so little experience, and I am so happy that you are a rockstar"". Our one on ones are basically him lecturing me on the things I don't know, and in every meeting he continually takes my ideas as his own. He is not a bad guy, he just can't really handle not being the smartest one in the room, and hates the fact that most of his job is managing now, and not testing.  This continually leads to him thinking I know nothing, (even though being consistently satisfied with my work) and I find myself always in the ""oh you need to learn"" position, even if I know on the inside I actually know more for a specific test than he does. 

Last review cycle, I was the only one who did not get the senior engineer level position of those who have been at the company around as long as I have. This does not correlate with my reviews as there has been very little constructive feedback that has come my way that I can actually act on to hit that level, and all reviews up to this point have been above average (and I am assuming my direct peers are what dictates average). I brushed it off, because I know that the other individual on my team who got it was pushing for it hard well before that review cycle, and I know deep down my manager was not ready to give it to her. 

so now to my problem. When I look at the rubric he has for the difference between my current level and the next level, I in some way shape or form meet all of the requirements for the next position. The only time I don't is when I am handed a completely new task, that is traditionally out of my job title scope, which happens ALL THE TIME. Every time I mention this to him, he uses that one example of a new thing I am working on as a reason I am not ready........this quickly turns into a catch 22 because testing has a TON of little facets and specialties that no one will ever know all of, and there is a level of needing to be able to learn a new skill from scratch and go with it (which I do). He goes from not reviewing any of my DOEs or plans, to wanting a detailed walk through of every report every 2 or so months. The truth is at this point in my career, I do have things I know, but I also have things I know how to figure out, which I think is the most important factor. 

Also during that time I have basically taken over the running of most of the E-chem testing in our lab. I not only do the tech work (setting up samples, starting tests, logging metadata, inspections etc) but I make the test plans, do the data analysis that sets up for modeling, I have started doing SOME of the modeling (which is done by another team, but I have been trying to learn more of what they do lately, because then I can tweek my test plans to make their jobs easier) and I even do budgets, cap ex assumptions, and project timeline management.........basically if this part of the lab functioned as it's own lab (and it kinda does) I do everything from intern to director. Doing this element of testing was not at all in my job scope when I started, but it now represents well over 75% of my time. 

I am wondering if it is appropriate to ask for the promotion and a reassessment of my job title, or if there is writing on the wall, that I am always going to be undervalued here and I should just look elsewhere. if I do ask for a raise, I was thinking of filling out his rubric and pointing out all the places I meet the requirements."

I am currently searching for an internship and my uni in Belgium just dropped the bomb by moving the deadline for going abroad to the 1 October. I need to send out a quick short email to a bunch of agencies and if they are interested I would elaborate more. Here's what I came up so far. Would love to hear your opinion and get some advice.

Dear Sir/Madam,

As a third-year marketing student, I would like to inquire about available internship positions at your organisation.

I am a marketing student in Belgium where during my third and final year I will have to complete a placement in the marketing department of a company to gain real-life experience for my work ahead. The placement should take place between February and June 2020 and should be in the marketing department of a company or a marketing agency. I am looking for a placement in 'city' to be close to my fiancé who currently works and studies at 'uni name'.

I am interested in your organisation because it would allow me to get to know the British consumer better and improve my skill in a variety of marketing-related segments. I have experience in the field of project management and event planning as well as in social media marketing. I can proficiently use all of the MS office products, as well as video editing software. I also have a few marketing projects under my belt that showcase my abilities. I have attached my CV for further reference. I hope to hear from you soon.

Kind regards,

name"

i'm going to a career fair in a few days (mostly for cs internships), and im pretty anxious to talk to these reps because i have very little programming experience to the cs kids that i always see (who seem to have tons of experience)

my experience is limited to: Java from CS AP, very little RobotC from a summer program, and i'm currently teaching myself Python and focusing on learning concepts over learning a particular language.

I'm by no means experienced in these languages and im really nervous about going to a career fair for cs internships because i feel like the reps are going to look down on me or ask me questions that I wont be able to answer (though I realize they want the best students) but im still interested in learning

is it worth it going to a career fair and applying for internships with little to no experience or is it better to wait until i have more experience and personal projects to describe on my resume? im also scared about how to approach reps if i do end up going because i looked at the company list and theyre all pretty big companies and are probably less likely to be willing to talk to me ;-;

thank you for any response or advice"

I figure this is probably a variable based on a lot of factors, but recently I realized I'm being paid less than a coworker. We do the same job, have similar qualifications and experience, however he was recently bumped to senior level and I was not. So, I've begun to feel undervalued and have considered perhaps moving on. But, I want to make sure I'm correct in my feeling. I don't want to be undervalued, but I don't mind a reality check if I'm right where I'm at.

A bit about me to paint a picture:

I have a couple associate degrees all IT security related, and a BS in cyber security. I hold a handful of certifications. Web Security Specialist , A+, Net+, Sec+, Linux+, Encryption Specialist, ECIH, SSCP, CISSP. I am currently located in Utah. Not a lot of experience unfortunately, just shy of six years counting a couple internships. Four years without it.

So, down to the question. What am I worth?

Thanks for any and all input."

I currently have an offer to a Big N for a machine learning team. I have zero machine learning experience and to be honest no really nothing about it. I also have another Big N offer for basically pure front end, maybe some full stack work (return offer from my internship). Both offers are same city, basically same comp. I like both teams.

1. Is machine learning that math heavy? Will I be doing proofs at work, calculating math problems etc? or is just more data/algo driven.
2. Long term, is machine learning that much more in demand / pays significantly more?
3. Is machine learning something I need a masters/phd in to be taken seriously? Or if I get entry level experience at Big N on a machine learning team can I jump around to other big n machine learning teams
4. Why do people say machine learning is boring to work on? Is it because its not visual and you're tweaking a model all day?
5. How do you measure progress as a machine learning dev? Is it basically increasing accuracy of one model from x% to y%? And you do that for a few months before tackling a new probelm? I'm used to front end / full stack work where basically I do a feature and move onto the next."

I have no idea where it is realistic for me to apply. 

I want to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. Financially, I can only afford 3 semesters at a private school. If it's a cheaper school, I'd probably be able to afford 4 semesters. Applying to 9-10 schools (3 reach, 3 range, 3 safety) seems ok to me. 

I have a 3.42 overall GPA. My major GPA is probably lower. I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics double major with a language minor. I attend a very competitive liberal arts college. I've had two summer software engineering internships at well-known companies. I've worked part time as a TA for a computer science course at my college for the past 5 semesters.  

My letters of recommendation are going to be weak, mainly because I'm very quiet and didn't do amazing in most of my classes. I made a list of all my possible options for recommendations. Haven't asked anyone yet, so none are guaranteed:

* My CS advisor. I talk to her more than any other professor, but still not that much. I also only took CS 101 (3 yrs ago) with her, but I have worked under her as a TA for 3 semesters. However she is very forgetful. 
* Stats/Math professor that I had for one class in the past and one class currently this semester. I got a B+ in my first class with her, but I'm going to work really hard this semester and hoping for an A-.
* CS Phd Student who is teaching one of my 300-level classes this semester. She is very established and well-known in the CS industry. I am doing very well in her class so far. 
* My mentor for my internship this past summer. He is in his late 20s from India and has a Master's in CS. He has worked at the company for 5 years and is very highly regarded by his team &amp; boss. He probably knows me best out of the aforementioned people because we worked closely all summer. He offered to write me a rec letter. Not sure how good at writing he is. 

Who should I ask?

I haven't taken the GRE yet. I'm scheduled to take a practice GRE in early October and the official GRE in late October.

I have just started my Masters in Pharmaceutical Chemisty in a UK university as an international student. I know how competitive the job market is in the UK and I would love to hear some tips from you guys. 

I am hoping to work in the R and D sector of a big pharma. I have already applied to some graduate scheme but I am planning to apply to more as more applications open. I’m looking into job applications and am actively applying.

I have 2 years of lab experience that resulted in a few publications. I also did a summer internship as a clinical technician. I graduated honors from my previous US university and currently just starting my Masters so I can’t provide a predicted grade. 

Ideally, I would love to stay in the UK for 1-2 years after my Masters. I am not looking to stay in the UK long term but I would love to gain some work experience overseas. Therefore, I am looking for Tier 5 and Tier 2 opportunities. 

Please let me know if you have any advise for me."

We'll be at the ECE career fair on Wed the 18th. The past few years our booth has been swarmed from open til an hour or more after close. This year our University Relations team is trying out a new recruiting platform called yello. We hope it will help streamline the process. But it also helps us if you are able to pre-register and upload your resumes before hand.

Oddly I can't figure out how this process works (it's our first time working with it too) but you should be able to find us be signing up [here] (https://join.yello.co/) and searching. 46 people from Tech have already figured it out. Maybe there is some info on career buzz about this.

We've got open positions just about everywhere: driver development, RTL, verification, physical design, design automation, machine learning, you name it. We even have sales and marketing if you're seeing this and not an ECE student. We also have co-ops and internships, and full time positions for BS or MS students. Currently 423 openings worldwide! 

If I can give you one resume tip it'd be this. When listing tools you've worked with in the past, don't just say ""Cadence."" My typical response would be ""[Cadencel what?](https://www.cadence.com/content/cadence-www/global/en_US/home/tools/tools-a-z.html)""

Bonus tip for talking to any company. Speak up! It's loud in there!

I lack the creativity to think of a project, and I wouldn't know where to start if I'm being honest. I've usually stayed on the software side of things, but would like to get my hands dirty with lower level software and hardware.

My experience:

* 7 months of internship experience in ARM SCP firmware (temperature sensors and testing code).
* Experience with UART to talk to GSM and GPS devices but in Linux user space (C).
* Experience with multi-threading and network programming in C.
* Logic design in Verilog.

d5dgdn,1,2019-09-17,Apple internship qualifications,Meeesh-,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/d5dgdn/apple_internship_qualifications/,"I've  been applying to a lot of internships lately and I'm feeling pretty  decent about my chances to get something based on my current experience  and skill levels. That being said, I'm still pretty scared by Apple's  qualifications. I've applied to places like LinkedIn, Amazon, Microsoft,  and a few other pretty big places, but none of them seemed to exactly  have qualifications like what Apple does. I know it won't hurt  necessarily to apply and stuff and if I do get the position I do feel  confident that I can be productive and learn whatever I need to. Still,  I'm kinda feeling the vibes that I shouldn't even apply, although maybe  it's just a bit of imposter syndrome.

I  think the most scary thing to me is just that they seem to ask for  expertise in everything from web related stuff to hardware to networks  and to mobile development. I'm hoping to apply for mainly the software  engineering and hope to work on some backend stuff or work on research. I  do feel good about my software engineering skills, my math skills,  machine learning, and the relevant stuff. That being said, I have no  experience with any of the javascript web frameworks since I (for some  reason) have developed a hatred for web development so far. I have some  big data skills from what I learned from machine learning, but nothing  focused on that. I know about OS, about memory, about some physical  hardware stuff, but it's just what I know from one of the required  classes I had to take at my university and again nothing focused on  that. They also ask for experience with client server protocols and such  which I do have, but again, nothing recent and big.

Like  I mentioned above, I'm pretty sure that if I get the position I can  pick up enough about the other parts to be able to work efficiently on  the stuff that I really focus on, but it's still pretty scary to me. If I  get an interview question about big data stuff, I'll probably not be  super quick at answering it. If I get a question about mobile  development, I'll probably not be able to answer it. If I get a question  about web development, I'm pretty sure I just won't be able to answer  it at all unless it has to do with communication. Any thoughts and any  ideas on maybe how I can fill in gaps? Thanks!"

I am a Junior dentist, graduated just a bit over 2 years ago. After graduating high school with really good marks I didn't have many options to apply since I really really loved biology- human biology- and wanted to pursue a career in the field but my knowledge about the medical career options was limited and didn't really ask about it , which I regret.

I know that Medicine (as in MD) would have been the most logical option, but I know I wasn't mentally and emotionally strong enough to face trauma and death, another option would have been medical labs, I wasn't very keen on that and I didn't know about possibility of specializing in that field, so I ended up choosing Dentistry as it has medical part and it seemed easy, 5 yrs only, drilling and extracting teeth , what would be difficult about it ! and I was WRONG!

So I got into the college, first year consisted mostly of fundamental medical subjects and I enjoyed it, got my high marks again and there were no problems other than the college itself was disappointing but not much of a big deal. Moving to second year I was ""initially"" excited about the pre-practical courses and we had some and other dental and medical theory subjects. Now let me tell you a bit about myself, I am a perfectionist, white or black no grey, I am an introvert, shy to very shy, more of an academic/theory person, the good grades are my achievements and what fuels me; so if its not obvious enough, I really hated it, the pre-practical lab was a nightmare for me, I was slow, and wasn't as smooth, I feared it, managed to pass but was never satisfied with my work, Never. On the other hand, I enjoyed the medical subjects and I really enjoyed pharma course, while everyone else hated it, it was a piece of cake for me. A the end of that year I tried to switch to Medicine hoping to graduate with Bachelor of health sciences but I wasn't accepted and still don't know why! (I know our system is a bit confusing, the dental college I studied at was a private college, college of medicine is government, and yearly they open slots for scholarship transfer from private colleges to government).

I felt really depressed at that time, as I didn't have many options ; a) either complete for another 3 years and graduate or b) withdraw from scholarship and start from the beginning. And I decided to complete, my grades were still good, maybe when I will start the clinical part I would enjoy it. Logically, I couldn't choose option b because at that point , i was depressed, I didn't know what I would do otherwise, I totally lost confidence in myself. For the next three years I suffered, I was really afraid of getting patients, treating them, what if I do mistakes (and I did many), what if I hurt patients, I didn't have any passion or motivation , only one goal to graduate with good grades , and I did, I got the first in academics. 

After graduation, I did internships in various hospitals, got compliments, I was acknowledged by both patients and doctors, if I got into trouble it would be purely based on my weak communication skills, very few doctors pointed out "" you don't like dentistry, do you?!""!!.  And now I landed at a very useless job, I go only 3 days a week, and rarely get patients.I don't like the situation but because it doesn't provoke my anxiety much, I am tolerating it, but I feel I had enough! I really hate the job, I really hate teeth and all their problems, I don't want to see patients. There's also pressure from my family , my dad in particular, that I didn't mention.

I feel that I should quit Dentistry, for better or for worse, its either I will find another better path for me or I will find stronger reasons to go back. Or shall I quit at the clinic am ""working"" at now and go to busy place to overcome my anxiety/extreme dislike to dentistry. WHAT SHALL I DO??"

I am a contractor and it is my first job out of college. The staffing agency offered 46 an hour which I negotiated to 52 an hour.

I'll try to keep this as short and relevant as possible. 

I began pursing a CS degree in my early 20s after screwing around for a few years out of high school. Did well at first, As and Bs mostly but about midway into it I lost all my motivation for some reason. Kept withdrawing from and failing my classes. Tanked my GPA pretty good. Eventually finished all of my CS related courses with mostly Cs and the odd B and just had upper level science and math courses remaining (electronics, calculus, discrete math etc.)

Anywhoo, never was great at those classes and kept failing them, so I eventually dropped out in 2012. Stupid move so close to the end I know, but I was just basically spending time and money to watch my GPA continue to plummet. Finally got my shit back together in 2016, went back, finished my courses and graduated in May of 17.

After this had to deal with a good bit of family problems (looooong, irrelevant story) and depression. Got all that tucked away now and I'm trying to figure out what to do. Here are my major issues and questions:

1. I've forgotten most of the CS related stuff I've learned. My last CS related course was back in 2012 so naturally my knowledge and skills have rusted away and I need to review before I begin job hunting. But where do I start? What do I focus on? .Net and C#? Java? Networking? Also, at what point is it enough to begin job searching?

2. I have zero experience or networking. I never had an internship and don't know anyone in the field. Where's the best place to start?

3. There's nothing I have to stand out on a resume. My GPA is 2.3 and I don't have any special accomplishments or projects. It also looks like all but one of my old CS professors are no longer at the school and I doubt the one remaining would remember me. What can I do at this point?

4. Should I consider pursuing a master's degree? I would have to take out loans to pay for it, assuming I could even get accepted with my poor GPA and no recommendations or anything. Is it even worth it?

5. What particular jobs should I search for when I finally am ready?

I'm trying to get the ball rolling but I feel so overwhelmed and unsure that it's killing my motivation. Any insight or help would be super appreciated."

I can’t decide whether to stay on my current path or follow my passion (excuse the cliche). 


Currently, I’m a sophomore in college studying math and computer science, with the aim of getting a master’s or PhD in some math-heavy area of computer science. I’ve never been excited by math or CS, but I chose to specialize in math because it was the easiest subject for me in high school.


However, I’ve been extremely interested in drugs for at least two years, especially psychedelics. I’ve become emotionally invested in drug policy reform and psychedelic medicine. My school is doing research with LSD that I could hopefully assist in, and I would love to be an intern at the new Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research. It would also be fascinating to work on developing new ways to manipulate consciousness using tools from neuroscience. I could see myself getting a PhD in neuropharmacology or an MD/PhD with a focus on translational research in psychiatry. 


I’m currently in a state of indecision about my classes next semester and my life in general. I could stay on my current path for the money, prestige, and stability, or change things up and do what I think I would love. The worst thing is that I don’t even know if I would enjoy work related to pharmacology/neuroscience/psychiatry, and even then whether I would continue to enjoy it or just get burned out. I’ve talked to a bunch of people about this and still have no idea what to do. Help???"
d5ifkl,1,2019-09-17,Need advice on dealing with mental health issues and work. Should I quit to pursue healing?,brianyesadams,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/d5ifkl/need_advice_on_dealing_with_mental_health_issues/,"Hi

Seeking advice or opinion on current situation.
Ok so heres the story

I'm 34 years old
I've had body dysmorphic disorder for many years. I've also taken benzodiazapens daily (1mg) klonopin for past 11 years.
I went to grad school years for a master's in clinical psychology mainly because I wanted to better understand myself to help fix myself. During my first 1 year internship, I ended up drinking beer to handle my own anxiety the last 3 months. I finished master's degree despite this but not full degree in my state. Requires another 2 years supervision still to get full degree.

This was a sign for me that I needed to deal with my mental health first. I decided to slowly wean myself off benzos for 9 months and go to Peru to do ayahuasca and plant medicines for a few sessions. It was super helpful not I did not realize that my brain would still need another 2 years to heal and was running out of money so I went back on the benzos in order to function.

Long story short. It's coming up on 11 years since being on benzos and they are ruining my brain and my health ultimately. I was just doing odd jobs mainly to barely get by. 

I got tired of not having steady income and recently jumped back into the mental health counseling field.
I'm panicked almost every day to see clients and am taking more Klonopin and now ketamine as well to get through. This work is stressing me out making me more depressed and stressed. I don't see how dealing with other people's negative issues is making me any better.

I'm thinking about jumping ship to focus once again on getting off benzos and doing some plant medicines to be clean of all this. I have an opportunity to move and live with brother in law almost rent free to do this in another state but I won't finish this degree at the moment and am afraid for my future as I don't have much other skill at the moment.

Wondering what you thoughts are or any advice you may have dealing with mental health issues and work?

d5kbld,15,2019-09-17,Recent College Grad - Where do I go from here ?,theCarver0,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/d5kbld/recent_college_grad_where_do_i_go_from_here/,"To give you some context: I am 22 years old and recently graduated college in May 2019. I have a history of anxiety (GAD) and occasional bouts of depression. I HATE networking and am not one who is interested in ""corporate politics"" and ""climbing the ladder"". I don't want to kiss anyone's ass to get somewhere in life and I don't want to be just another cog in the wheel of a corporation or big company.

A big concern of mine is that I have no idea what I want to do for a career and don't know how to really ""follow my passions."" I feel like the first job I take is really going to set the tone for my life career and it scares me. I don't want to pigeon-hole myself in one area. I love creating and inventing. I hate doing mundane, repetitive tasks. The thing is, I feel like a master of none. I have a degree in Finance, my work experience is all tech-oriented, and I've been chasing ""entrepreneurship"" all my life. My internship experience includes: Web Development, Data Analytics. I've never even used my Finance knowledge/degree (granted I was a CS major my first two years of college).

I have been looking for a job for the past 3 months and still have nothing lined up. Most of my friends from school had jobs lined up before graduation. I have had only a few real leads throughout my application process (starting in October 2018).

I'm really just confused on this whole job searching process to be honest. I know most people don't love their first job and likely will stay there for less than 2 years. I also acknowledge that I have really been focusing solely on finding a job I love. For instance, I've basically only been applying to companies in one region and really zeroed in on a venture analyst type of role. After 2 months of applying for this type of role in this specific region, I think I finally realized that it's unlikely to happen. I've began to consider other regions but am still unsure on the type of role I want.

I get that I need to start having an income and paying my student loans back - but I don't want to just take any old job, and I don't want to work in my home state/neighboring states. A bunch of my friends work at big corporations but honestly it scares me to apply to these types of companies because of how rigorous the interviewing process is. Just thinking about a super-day gives me the willies (as does 3/4 rounds of interviews).

Rather than sending out a few strong applications to places I ""think"" I really want to work, I have found myself just shipping out as many applications as I can that only require me to send my resume. I know it's a terrible tactic. I just have no idea what direction to go. I've spent hours and hours on single applications before (kind of a perfectionist), and to no avail... so yea, I've definitely been avoidant of writing personalized cover letters as it seems a waste of time.

Anyways, I just feel like there's too many companies out there for me to make a short-list of. Too many postings. Too many career sites. Too many different companies and regions. I swear I could spend a full week just looking at different companies and bookmarking them without sending a single application out. I mean look at me now, I'm writing this post rather than applying anywhere!

I feel like a huge failure and as if I haven't lived up to my potential because throughout my life (up until college), I was seen as one of the brightest kids in my town and teachers/parents really put me on a pedestal.

I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur because I always loved inventing and trying to come up with products/services to solve real world problems (yes on my free time lol). However, that all changed once I got to college and began being a shithead. I feel like I'm a different person now, but I think that my past self is still in there buried beneath the poor habits I developed during college.

Does anyone have advice for me? Should I just keep shipping out as many applications as I can (""it's a numbers game"")? Do I focus on creating a short-list of companies I really resonate with and craft applications for those companies very meticulously (which I hate doing)?

Do I start trying to develop new skills that may help me secure a job in data science or finance (learn R, learn financial modeling)?

Sorry I know this is stupid long. My first time posting on here. Told you I have anxiety and a tendency to overthink things - what'd you expect? Please feel free to comment on any or all parts within this ""essay"" lol. I know I'm not the only one out there who is/has been in this boat of mass confusion and uncertainty.

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr -- I'm an analytical-minded kid fresh out of college who loves music and sports, has a finance degree, tech-oriented work experience, and a condition that makes me overthink everything. I have never been more confused."

d5llo4,160,2019-09-17,I'm a Zookeeper. Something is Very Wrong With the Animals Here (Part 2),NorthSelection9,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/d5llo4/im_a_zookeeper_something_is_very_wrong_with_the/,"  
[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/cz9ln9/im_a_zookeeper_something_is_very_wrong_with_the/)

I didn’t know rest for months following that terrible night. The faces of the animals slipped into my dreams, their skin twisting and deforming in ways that were beyond what was natural. Their lips would move in an all-too human way, forming inaudible words, talking to me about something.

Night after night, I would wake up drenched in my own sweat. I knew that something was wrong, and by now, the rest of my staff were catching on too. But the higher-ups were determined to squeeze all the money they could out of the last few months of summer. Closure was unthinkable.All our worst fears were confirmed when the warning alarms droned into my office, almost rattling the pane of glass from my window.

My heart plunged down into the icy pit of my stomach. I knew too well what that sound meant. It was one that every person who’s ever worked in a zoo hopes to never hear.

One of the animals had escaped.

A sudden burst of static drew my attention to the radio, half-hidden under a mound of paperwork. I pulled it to my ear and heard a sobbing male voice amidst the hissing interference. The breaths were so rapid that I struggled to make out the words he was saying.

“Hello?”

“It’s…it’s…Toby, sir.”

Toby. One of the newest interns here, he was a gangly kid with a shock of red hair, fresh out of college and with a permanent nervous quiver to him. Despite my own growing fears, I couldn’t help but feel bad for him. He sounded like he was terrified out of his mind.

“Toby, what’s going on out there?”

He sucked in air, trying to control his whimpers.

“It’s…it’s a Code Red.”

I ran a hand over my reverting hairline. The situation was so much worse than I assumed it to be.

A Code Red was the highest threat on the scale. It meant a dangerous animal escape- usually a big cat.

As I raced from my office, my immediate concerns, as per protocol, were the protection of my staff, attendees and the animal. I knew that the situation had to handled delicately- one mistake could result in injury or death. I knew that the lion was roaming around disorientated and was bound to attack if we sprung out at it. When an animal was cornered, that was when it was at its most dangerous. We had to employ stealth in containing them.

Another voice crackled over the radio.

“Code Red, Lion, in the Reptile House. I repeat, Code Red, Lion, in the Reptile House, do you copy?”

Unlike Toby, this voice was female, and a lot more recognizable. Annie, our zoo veterinarian. Someone who knew what she was doing.

“Copy.” I gritted into the radio.

My eyes surveyed the normally bustling grounds, now completely emptied of people. Candy packaging and leaflets rolled across the ground in the wind, which pattered against the sun-streaked glass of the exhibits. I was more than glad that any civilians had been evacuated, but I couldn’t shake off that growing discomfort.

That’s when it hit me.

The animals were all silent, just watching me from inside their own habitats. A panda stared out with deadened, black bead while gnawing a shard of bamboo while the birds swayed on their branches.

I turned around to find a chimpanzee, his face compressed against the glass, flaring nostrils clouding against the surface. His lips receded into a fanged grin.

They were like an avid audience to the whole spectacle, all waiting to see how it played out.

I walked on, trying not to make eye contact with any of them and soon found the Reptile house rounding into my peripheral vision, a blue tarpaulin already constructed. By now, the emergency zoo response team had already assembled, unloading their tranquilizer guns. I saw Annie holding a syringe, a powerful sedative oozing from its pointed tip. My shoulders sagged in relief.

“Annie- please tell me you know what’s going on.”

She shook her head with such vigour that a neatly tucked strand of her auburn bun came loose, falling over an eyebrow

“No idea. Samson just went insane. Smashed through the glass like it was nothing.” She murmured.

She gestured down to a spotted path of blood that disappearing into the open doorway of the exhibit.

“Took some pretty heavy lacerations. I’m afraid about him bleeding out.”

“Then we better move quickly.” I told her.

She nodded, her expression as stoic as ever, a beacon of professionalism standing over the waves of fear that threatened to wash over us. I raised my hands in the air.

“No sudden moments.” I told them.

I was determined to keep order amongst them. The most important part of dealing with a potentially dangerous animal was not to panic. I knew that losing your cool was what got people killed. Our steps were slow and timed, as not to startle the lion.

We followed the wavering beams of our flashlights into the flickering hall of the Reptile House. The ceiling light had been damaged in initial rush of evacuation, leaving it sputtering randomly between being brightly lit and near total darkness.

Our group froze when our light shone on the defined back of a five-hundred-pound male adult lion.

One of the other keepers had the tranquilizer gun cocked in his trembling hands when it turned to us.

I wanted to call the thing that stood in front of us Samson. But I knew I couldn’t.

It wasn’t him anymore.

Blood streamed down the sides of its face from its eyes, half-dried into its tawny fur. There were so much of it that the orange brown of its eyes was now red. Its mouth was stretched into a jagged grin, so wide that it looked like its face had split open trying to do so, exposing pale pink jaw muscle.

I had never seen any animal move the way it did and I hope that I never do again. Its heavy, pounding paws jerked around with every step into unnatural angles. It was as if it was moving around on broken limbs. His eyes bounced around as it prowled, rolling around as if they were loose in its skull. Clumps of its darkened mane were scattered to the ground, exposing blistered flesh.

Toby’s sneakers scraped against the floor, but I grabbed the collar of his shirt just as he was about to take off into a full sprint. I hadn’t realized he was there until I saw his pale face blinking out in the darkness. But right now, I didn’t have time to chew out the rest for bringing an intern along with them.

“Don’t run- walk away slowly.” I told him.

I knew he would never be fast enough if he decided to go after him.

Its lower jaw juddered to the point it looked ready to fall off. Then the noise filtered through the air, loud and barking.

It was laughing at us, in some low deep animal imitation of a human voice, exposing a line of sharp, glimmering teeth.

Its head began to shake so much that it blurred. Its eyeballs squelched to the floor, leaving behind two black, vacant holes.

Behind me, Toby purged the contents of his stomach onto the floor. We were all frozen, unable to turn away from the horrific spectacle unfolding in front of us.

Two dark thorny spikes were expelled from out of the emptied sockets. It was like we were watching sped-up footage of a plant growing. Something that should have taken years was happening in seconds. We watched as it extended and thickened to the point that it strained the bone. They soon jutted out almost a foot in front of its head.

Unable to stomach anymore, Toby wrestled the gun off one of the other keepers and fired three darts into it before I could stop him.

Instead of stopping it, a ripple ran through its body like an air hose had been inserted into it, inflating the layers of skin and muscle. The darts that had been embedded within it popped out and scattered onto the floor.

Then it charged.

Toby barely had a chance to react as bony growths jutting from its now-blind eyes gored right through him. His eyes widened as they shredded his lungs, the sharp tips bursting out of his back. His mouth fell open, red streaming out and staining his shirt.

It shook him off, leaving his broken body to soak in a growing pool of his own blood. It sniffed at the air, horns still dripping.We scattered as it bowled through us. Most of us found ourselves with our backs pressed up against the walls, but one found his leg clenched within its powerful jaws. It shook him like a cat with a bird, raking its claws over his face. Bloodied strips of skin fell to the floor. His screams rang through the darkness.

I closed my eyes, already erecting a mental block. My feet shifted against the floor, knees tensing up at the slightest sound they made. But I forced myself to keep moving. In the waning light, I saw Annie on the other side of the thing, her arms splayed up against the wall, trying to avoid being detected. The thin glass cylinder of a syringe jutting out of its back just below its neck, but the massive dosage of drugs didn’t seem to register in its changed body.

Pressing a finger to my lips, I waved my hand along to her. The thing tore into the keeper’s innards, maw flecked with gore. I flinched every time its nostrils flared, thinking that our presence had been exposed.

While it was distracted, we rounded up what remained of our number and left as quietly as we could. The potential pain of being torn apart by whatever Samson had become now was nothing compared to the one I felt at leaving two of us behind.

The lack of stable lighting would buy us some time- or so I hoped.

As we ran down the hallway, I could already hear the pounding paws echoing from around the corners. The snakes writhed up their glass walls, rhythmically tapping against it. The streaming light at the end of the passageway was already fading with the metallic whirring of the falling shutters.

The only coherent thought that I could hear over the rush of adrenaline and blood was please. *Please, God, let us get out here alive.*

After what seemed like a lifetime in the darkness, the outside light invaded my eyes, almost blinding me. I lost my footing and ended up half-sprawled out onto the ground. The others stumbled out behind me. Annie clutched her chest, trying to control her own frantic breathing.

The iron screen shook as its head smashed into it, to the point I was sure it would burst open. This was followed by a piercing series of grinding sounds, which was probably it trying to claw its way out.

After managing to catch my breath, my managerial mode kicked back in with a vengeance.

“Come on- we need to get to the main building. There’ll be supplies there, a phone- we can call somebody for help-“

My words seemed to hang in their air. The others stood frozen around me, staring out to the exhibits, mouths open. I felt myself go cold at their expressions. I forced myself up on my trembling knees.

The sun streamed through the gaping hole in the surface of the glass pane of the chimpanzee exhibit. Fragmented glass was scattered all over the ground, which glowed in the patterned light that streamed through the swaying trees. The chimpanzees were already long gone.

As I was fumbling for my radio, Annie’s firm hand pulled me around and I saw that the rest of the animals had vanished too. In every exhibit, there was an almost identical hole torn through. A wind howled through the emptied habitats.

The world weighed down on my back to the point where I felt my spine buckle under it. We were rooted to the spot, the sensation of dozens of unseen eyes burning into our flesh, hidden in plain sight and ready to pounce and tear us to shreds at any given moment.

There was only one word left on my mind that could sum up our predicament.

“Fuck.”"

I'm also not really sure CS is something I want to do for the rest of my life. Don't get me wrong. I like solving CS problems, and I find it interesting and fun to work with. But if you were to ask me where I see myself in 20 years, I wouldn't say CS.

What path can I take in CS that would at least fulfill some of my interests or hobbies. Managerial positions?

So, I am a sophomore who is currently applying for internships. I am quite disappointed now as all the companies I apply to ask for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms background which I won't take the class for until next semester. I want to apply to the freshman/sophomore-only programs big firms have such as FBU, UberStar etc. but they are tailored for minority groups to any of which I do not belong. I wonder what my options are?"

I did some research about what solution engineers do and have a rough idea about it. I just want opinions from more perspectives to see if it is worth it."

Most of my job is just moving certain electronic equipment, setting up chrome books for the students, helping teachers set up their chromecast, etc. It's been rather boring, but has been pretty good until today. I got a call from a teacher and so I went to her room. I see her holding a students phone and she tells me that she caught the student watching some video on her phone when she was supposed to be playing kahoot (Its like a quiz learning game). The teacher then tells me that she wants me to block all websites and apps that aren't school related on her phone while she is in class. I try to explain to her that the phone is not the school's property, and I literally can't do that. I get yelled at for 5 minutes, and then the teacher tells me that I'm not doing my job and to call the real IT worker. I tell her that he took the day off today and its just me, and she tells me that I'm lying. She then takes me to the principal's office, like I'm still in high school, and she gets the principal to come out and tells him that I am being rude and not doing my job. The principal is pretty chill though and asks for my version of the story. I tell him and he agrees and tells her that the school cannot mess with a students personal belongings.Edit: Grammar

Edit 2: Wow, this got alot of attention overnight, I'll talk to my boss about filing a complaint of some sort. I will update you all soon."
d5qddh,1,2019-09-17,Am I being unfairly compensated &amp; treated?,TutorMcFruiter,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d5qddh/am_i_being_unfairly_compensated_treated/,"**Context for my situation:**
I am a young professional at a small company. I took this position right after college (almost 2 years ago) and have been (in my opinion) excelling at my job. 

**My Problem:**
My company has a no-merit system for awarding promotions and bases it on work experience solely. When I began, I was informed that Internship experience did not count towards said work experience so I began with 0 years. That was ok with me, but after speaking with other people within my company, I learned that some other employees without relevant work experience began with a much higher salary due to being awarded the promotion when they were hired based on their Internship experience. 

I do not want to make this about race, but in addition to unfairly counting internship experience, I have noticed throughout separate discussions with employees that people of color were routinely paid or titled much lower ($10K) difference than their non-person of color counterparts. I am a person of color myself and the majority (+90%) of the company is composed of white employees. 

Next, in terms of my own performance at work, I have routinely been directly involved in projects that received extremely positive feedback from customers and have been explicitly told by other senior employees I trust, that my work was a major driver in the success of the projects. Recently, I felt like I was finally getting more recognition at the management level and was being given the opportunity for more responsibility on various projects. However, as soon as I attempted to take an active role in the management of the project, I have been (without being told) pushed aside and taken out of that position of power. I was in the middle of a project I had been working/managing by myself when I was assigned another employee to be the lead on the task when I have experience equally suited to the task and better experience managing tasks and communicating with customers. The reasoning was that I was one level below this person and therefore they were more suited to handle it (we are separated by a few months of experience). If it was an attempt to get this other employee managing experience, I do not feel that it is fair at the expense of my own professional development. 

Finally, my concern is that I have been ""putting up"" with things as I was not really aware of the greater context for promotions and salary increases. I am due for my own promotion shortly and I am not sure how to approach negotiation of my salary. I truly feel that I play a very important role to the projects within the company, but I am routinely overlooked and repeatedly placed in positions where I am starting at a disadvantage. I would greatly appreciate advice for how to approach salary negotiations and general advice about my career development. I very much enjoy my work and many of the people. I do not believe that my company in general underpays, but that I am one of a few that get the short end of the stick.

Around 2 years ago, I was looking to leave my first full time job out of college and I received a lot of responses to my job applications. I had been working in my field for \~3 years at that point (including internships), after graduating with my Bachelor's (also related to my field). After interviewing for various roles, I went on to accept an offer, and I have been working at my current job for 2 years since. I am now looking to find a new role, but I'm finding that I'm getting almost no responses to my job applications, even though I have two more years of relevant experience than I did before. I've also been promoted since then, and I have all of the requirements in the job listings. Some of these are positions in the same or similar companies that I interviewed with two years ago, advancing far in the interview process.

I'm puzzled as to why I'm getting no response now, compared to two years ago when I had less experience. I guess it could be possible that they want candidates who are less experienced so they pay less salary, but the huge difference in response is making me wonder if it's something else? Also, I'm 4 years post-grad now as opposed to 2, so it's not that much of a difference. I've applied to positions that are a ""step up"" as well as lateral moves, and gotten little response from either. I don't think there's anything wrong with my resume formats... For some context, I work in tech (operations/project management) in a big tech-oriented city. I'm fine with staying at my current job for now, but I'm just really confused. Does anyone have any advice, or similar experiences? Thanks so much!"

My area is southern Europe - Italy.

I'm an electronic engineer who just graduated in April, and now I'm currently doing an internship in a local (yet international) company - automotive sector. My internship ends in December, and from what I've gathered they'll probably keep me. Consider that now I have at my disposal a flexible working time, the company canteen ...and it's like 10mins by car from where I live, which is nice. My salary isn't that great though, but it's my first real job so I can't complain much about that.

Now, so far so good right? I mean, my colleagues are good (except one but that's fine, I can live with that) and I'm learning many practical things. And yet, I'm not satisfied at all.

My work is basically an electronic designer - R&amp;D... and while I appreciate it, I've found that it doesn't interest me at all. I've also found that the automotive industry is like a jail (I'm exaggerating of course): once you begin workin in it, you'll probably do that for the rest of your life with little chance to change sector.

I've been searching online about different job descriptions and yesterday I've found one that was basically perfect to me: the Sales Engineer. I'm a guy who wants to travel a lot, and I think my english is good (...I probably make some mistakes but I'm practicing). I also like talking to people about products and with a good mentor, I think I could manage to become one in the future. I've tried to look for open positions and it looks like I could find something in the bigger town (which is 35mins away from where I live).

So here's the problem: I've tried to talk about this to my parents and my close friends. They basically said that I should be grateful that I have this job which is comfortable because it's near home... and if they were in my position, they'd just continue to work where I am. I think they lack a bit of a open mind, but of course I respect their opinion.

You guys think I should continue here or try to have some luck as a sales engineer?

Thank you for reading this, and I wish you a good day."

While I don’t shame this way of life, i want something more eventful with my next 4 years. I want to wake up every morning knowing that there’s a bigger plan to work towards ( besides going to class). 

In my freshman year, I’d like achieve: overseeing  a research project, getting joining career related club, getting certifications in IT early so I can get an internship at google, gathering a team to build an iPhone application, get over 100k in scholarships... am I being too unrealistic yet? 

You see, I’m not sure if my mind set is rational, or fairytale. Please share your opinions and stories of what you’ve done while in school, for they could potentially give me greater insight on what to expect.

this post has gotten A LOT longer than I had anticipated, but I somehow got carried away. I will try to sum it up somehow.

I am a 26 year old male from europe and I feel as if my life has been an utter mess so far.

I have struggled through school and life, failed 2 classes, finally graduated and did not know what to do with my life.

after some more struggles I finally decided I wanted to become a therapist for children and teenagers and thus I knew I'd have to study ""social work"" aka ""social education"", add a masters and then do a 3 year apprenticeship. so 8 years in total.

I finally started college at the age of 23, move to a huge, ugly city, far away from home, lived alone, had a good time for a while, but it got wore gradually until I finally broke down completely.

I have been struggling with mental issues my entire life: anxiety, depression, suicidal ideations. all of them have gotten worse over time. I believe to have suffered from depression as far back as being a child  and I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was about 8.

I always felt weird, off, like an alien on another planet. I have always been highly sensitive, emotional, full of creativity, and the feeling that something ""grand is supposed to happen"". I don't exactly know how to describe it, but since I also dreamed very vividly ever since, there has also been this one dream in which a gathering of powerful ""entities"" stoof in front of me an so to speak decided that I was supposed to...to what? I don't know if that makes any sense. well,  I guess I have always felt there has to be more to this life. but I never knew what and I grew frustrated more and more, realizing, that I couldn't even cope with the basics of living, let alone achieving anything memorable in this lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway. since I have always been struggling through school, never really learned, never did my homework, always flew under the radar, smart enough to  barely make it but just not capable or motivated? enough to achieve anything. I hated school.

my mother was concerned, so to make a long story short I have been diagnosed with ADHD at the age of around 8 or 9. must have been 2001 back then. they prescribed me meds right away ( I do not recall which substance , which dosage or how long) but I do recall that I did not like it due to the sideffects. they made me nauseous and just didn't feel right. so we stopped. I got worse and worse in school, so we tried meds again at the age of 14. I had to stop because they took their tool on my liver, but my mother said, that I did a lot better in school back then. so again no more medication. the issues got worse, I grew more anxious, frustrated and depressed and finally had to switch school.

also my father had left us when I was 5 years old and basically vanished. I had a stepfather instead. both my mother and my stepfather hated themselves, each other and let it all out on me, abused me emotionally for over 15 years. it was NOT a good place/environment to grow up in.

nontheless my mother always took care for me and supports me to this day. she is very dominant and basically raised me to be dependent on others. it is a weird love/hate relationship...

&amp;#x200B;

by then at the age of 17 was the first time I recall that I was very obviously depressed. I had been for years, but back then was the first time I just started crying in the middle of the day out of nowhere.

I sought for help, found a therapist, she told me that this would me normal for my age and prescribed me antidepressants right away. I took them hesitantly, and I didn't take them properly (not daily, sometimes more, sometimes less). stupid, I know, but I didn't know much back then. 

so that was my attempt at therapy then.

I got into a bad relationship, got worse in school, started smoking cannabis and finally graduated at the age of 20 with a very bad GPA. now already severly depressed and NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH MY LIFE.

I fell into a deep whole, burdened with the lack of structure and the question what to do next.

I decided to go abroad for a year, live with relatives in the US. I went and it was the most horrible time. my girlfriend of almost 4 years couldn't stand me being so far away for so long. she cheated on me and broke up with me. my grandmother of 4 years (who I loved dearly) died of cancer after 4 years of therapy. I couldn't even attend her funeral. I was severely depressed and suicidal. I couldn't take it any longer and decided do cancel my plans of being abroad for a year and came back after only 4 months. I failed.

&amp;#x200B;

I ended up in a psychosomatic clinic, for 12 weeks which helped to some extend. I starte with antidepressants which I took for 4 year. my diagnosed ADHD had been ignored consequently by the doctors and by myself.

after that I decided I finally wanted so start! go to college live my life and reach my goal of becoming a therapist!

&amp;#x200B;

college declined me because of my shitty GPA, I had to wait yet another year and finally started studying at the age of 23! I was so excited and happy to finally start a new chapter, leave the old stuff behind!

I moved to a city far away from home. home is a small town in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by beautiful nature.

college was in a huge, dense city with over half a million people and 10 million people surrounding. loud, fast, cold and ugly. I hated the city from the first day but I gave it a try.

&amp;#x200B;

I moved into my own little apartment, loved it at first, even though it was very very small. I fell in love with literally the girl next door, which was doomed to fail but I got into a relationship nonetheless. 

ah this isn't much of a summary, is it? ok.

I started college, I fucked up, I ended up being severely depressed and suicidal. I still am and my life is in shambles. I don't know where to go or what to do and I hate myself.

I finally realized that I might indeed have ADHD! duh. and now I am afraid that it is already too late to turn my life around but I will try nontheless.

I tried ADHD medication once again about 2 weeks ago. I tried Vyvanse (15mg daily) and I did indeed notice some very remarkable effects. so THIS is how it is to have a ""normal"" brain! it was such a relieve!!! 

BUT the sideffects were horrible (see below) and I grew more anxious and depressed every single day, so I stopped it again. I finally found something that seemed to work, but I just could not handle it. 

&amp;#x200B;

now I am sitting here. 26 years old. full of pain and remorse, in a degree I don't know what to do with once I am finished.

I hate myself. I am so afraid of life.

after I had been to clinics this year again I decided to transfer to a college near my hometown. I guess I'd feel better here. but I am so afraid. 

&amp;#x200B;

but I WANT TO LIVE! just HOW? which career do I want to pursue? what is wrong with me? do I actually have ADHD? what may help? which meds?

ok I'll try to update this tl;dr tonight. my brain is fried right now, sorry.

thanks for any reply and take care!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

this is my first post and I guess I just need to vent somehow.

so, I am a 26 yeard old male from europe, who has suffered from depression and anxiety what feels like all my life but really noticable since I've been about 17  years old. I got diagnosed with depression at the age of 18 and somehow tried to get better since then. it has actually gotten better sometimes, but not really and now the last 2 years have been absolute hell.

I have struggled through school my entire life, I failed 2 classes, had to switch schools and finally graduated with some horrible grades at the age of 20. by then I was already in a full blown major depressive episode, which I sadly didn't really identify as such.  aside from my issues in school and social life I also had a very hard upbringing, my father leaving basically vanishing when I was 5 and my mother and stepfather emotionally abusing me for years and years. I've always been insanely anxious, selfconscious, had low selfesteem, no selfworth, no nothing. I had my first suicidal thoughts when I was about 8 years old. 

at the same time I always had the feeling that something was off about me. that I'm not actually stupid, that I do have potential, that there is something I am supposed to do. I always wanted so much from life, I wanted to be acknowledged, wanted to make a difference, wanted to make people laugh and smile, I wanted to truly live and enjoy life. I never understood just how grey and bitter so many grownups were, never understood how people seemed to waste their life away with dead-end 9-5 jobs which they obviously hated just to get home to a relationship they hate and subsequently ruining their health, killing their spark and in the end just die. I never understood school, the endless rehearsing, repeating, being formed for the system (yes, I know this sounds ""edgy""). I always had been a dreamer, I've always been overly emotional, sensitive, creative. I spent more time dreaming about things, than actually listening to other people. I cried when watchin children's cartoons, just because I felt so deeply for the characters, I always .felt the pain in my mother's soul, I hated competitive things such as sports because I didn't understand why people wanted to ""fight"", to be better than somebody else. 

I hated school because I gradually got worse. everbody else seemed to do okay, almost effortlessly, but I just couldn't.

I COULDN'T. I stared at the papers, stared at the tasks, stared a the teacher, the board, my peers. I was there physically but not mentally. I just couldn't understand. I often wanted to. I really wanted to understand, pay attention, memorize, but I couldn't. I've never really done my homework and the times I did, I sat hours on homework that should have taken 20 minutes. but I just played around, stared at the wall, scribbled and dreamed. 

my mother, even though she really did treat me horribly in many aspects, also has always been very supportive, almost oversupportive and caring towards me. she always took care about everything. I do believe she only meant well, but at the same time she took care of everything because ""I would fail anyways"". I'd ""do it wrong"", it would ""end up in a catastrophy"" if I did anything. 

still. she was worried about my behaviour, so she brought me to a doctor and then there, boom:

at the age of around 8 I had been diagnosed with ADHD! it was 2001. I don't recall much about that time but I had been given medication. I believe it was methylphenidate, but I don't know in which form, dosage or anything. I don't recall how long I took it either, but I'd say it had been only a few weeks tops. because I really did NOT like it. I didn't like the sideffects, it made me naseous, tense and it just didn't feel right I believe. I don't know if I did any better in school with it. but apparently we decided to stop medication and that was that.

then my issues in school and life got worse and worse: at age 14 we tried medication another time. I tried it, my mum now claims that I did indeed improve in school, but the medication had some bad effects on my liver and for that reason, we stopped treatment once again. I did not get any CBT or coaching at that time.

from there on things got worse gradually until I had to basically drop out of grammar school when I was 17 and switch to another school. I had already felt  off and sad for years at that time, but there at the age of 17 was the first time I can recall where I just started crying. I started crying in situations in which I didn't really have any reason to cry. I just did. 

I had my first breakup at that time, things got even worse and it was the first time I saw somebody for depression. I had neglected/not taken my ADHD diagnoses seriously ever and the therapists/psychiatrists I saw apparently didn't take it seriously either. on my first appointment with a therapist she told me that it is ""normal to feel a bit sad and off at this age"". she prescribed me antidepressants right after the first session and that was that. I hesitantly took them, but I didn't do it properly: one day more, one day less, don't know how long, but again I stopped taking them due to adverse effects.

I got worse every month.

nonetheless when I finally graduated schook I was 20 and I had to decide:

what the hell do I want to do with my life?!

I've always been bad in school, I had no hobbies aside from gaming, I had only very few friends which also were only into gaming and my social skills, my confidence and my general development were far behind my peers. I had great ambitions still, but just didn't know where to direct them. well actually I always thought of acting, comedy, voice-acting or such things, but I was waaay to anxious to even consider these. also they were deemed very risky choices.

now all of a sudden after living under the impression that something is wrong with me, that I am stupid, lazy or just not capable, I was supposed to choose what I want to do with my life. learn a trade? go to college? which major? 

I was utterly confused, anxious, devastated.

I chose to go travelling for a year, decided to visit/life with relatives I have in the US and just kind of try to figure out what I want to do with my life.

at that time I had been in a relationship almost 4 years. sadly my girlfriend didn't cope well with me leaving for an entire year at all and even a year before I left we already had severe issues. to make a long story short she made it incredibly hard for me and once I was in the US she cheated on me and broke up with me, which devastated me.

parallel to that my family back in my homecountry was devastated, because my grandmother (the only woman in my life that had ever given me a feeling of being loved) had been in cancer treatment for over 4 years.

a week after my girlfriend had cheated on my and broke up with me, my grandmother died. I couldn't even attend her funeral because I was so far away.

after that incident, after only 4 months of being in the US I decided I couldn't take it any longer, cancelled everything I had been doing and flew back home.

severely depressed, suicidal, girlfriend gone, grandmother gone, behind my peers, still not knowing what I want to do with my life.

I ended up in a psychosomatic clinic, which helped me kind of.

I started with antidepressants after that (lexapro) and took them for over 4 years. (tapered them in July 2019) also I had been in CBT for over a year.

after being in the clinic I decided to say ""fuck it"". I was 22, I had gone through a lot of shit my entire life and now I finally wanted to live. I wanted to live my life. leave the past behind and do my own thing.

so there I was. 22. felt pretty shitty all my life. no confidence, no skills, no nothing. all I knew was, that for some reason people seemed to like me, they talked about my empathy, my caring/loving nature, my humour, my wit and my charisma. (all of which I never saw in myself)

I knew I wanted to do something that makes sense. something that I'd look back on one day and say ""you did a good job"".

now in the clinic I had been to I had my first real contact with psychotherapy and I was fascinated by it.

I always had been able to read other people very well and I had been a pretty good talker (at least in my mother tongue). I knew I wanted to do something that made sense, so I felt like, I wanted to help other people somehow.

I decided I wanted to become a therapist, because I had already endured so much shit in my life that I wanted to prevent any other person from ever going through that and/or help them overcome their struggles.

sadly, my GPA was way too bad to study psychology and to be honest I was convinced I wouldn't succeed in this supposedly very demanding major.

after some research I found out: I could become a psychotherapist specifially for children and teenagers!

and what would I have to do for that? study Social Work. add a masters degree. and after that I could to a 3 year apprenticeship to become a therapist for children and teens. so at least 8 YEARS of studying and working.

I know...

&amp;#x200B;

but hey, I finally felt like I have a goal!! I finally knew what I was supposed to do to reach a certain thing. so I decided to go for it.

I applied for social work at different colleges. mind you, that I had only very little interest in social work per se, but I knew I had to go through it to reach my goal.

colleges declined me because my GPA was too bad. I had to wait another year. so I did and I finally got in.

at the age of 23 I finally started. I got to choose between 3 different colleges and chose to attend the one that was furthest away from home. I felt like I wanted to become independent and that  I would achieve it via this way.  come from a very small town with 1000 inhabitants in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nature and decided to move several hours away to a city with 600.000 inhabitants and a surrounding area of 10 million people. a very loud, fast-paced, ugly, anonymous and cold city.

but I finally started! I loved myself! I was excited! I had overcome so many things and now I finally had a plan! a new life! a new chance! new city! finally moved out from home, had my own little apartment, started college! WOW! I felt so alive and good.

but yeah. the story of course doesn't end there.

I lived alone in a student dormitory. I said to myself that I would NOT get into a relationship right away, because so far I had very bad issues with emotional dependency and I felt like I just wanted to be free and do my thing.

2 weeks after starting my new life I fell in love and got into a relationship...again a dysfunctional relationship, which still gave me a sense of belonging and security. after all I knew NOBODY in this new city. far away from home, living in a tiny aparment, studying something I am not interested in but which  I have to do to get the job which felt like I wanted to pursue..

I have always had an addictive personality. years of videogames, then relationships. at the age of 19 I smoked cannabis for over a year on a daily basis (together with my girlfriend). in my 4 months in the US I smoked almost on a daily basis. after that I quit and said to never do it again, but once I moved to this new city, one of the first things I did, was to buy cannabis.

so I smoked weed on a daily basis once again. I did ecstasy, speed, cocaine sporadically at parties and then I got into psychedelics, mushrooms to be more specific, which I took more than monthly. I have to add that I took both the cannabis and the mushrooms very seriously: I documented everything from strain, to dosage, to time, how I felt, my experience and everything. looking back I was clearly trying to self-medicate.

after my initial excitement for my new life wore of I started to worry again. I felt soooo wrong in this new city. I actually hated it from day 1. I did not feel as if I am in the right place at all. but since I have felt like this my entire life I told myself to stick with it and give myself some time, let things develop.

I really tried. I went to college, did my courses, my assignments, I exercised 5 times a week, I had a relationship (which was very loving, albeit being dysfunctional), I only went home about 4 times a year and the distance actually helped to finally improve the relationship with my mother after so many years of conflict, I kept on taking my antidepressant daily, I ate healthy, I even got myself a job, I tried to make friends and I at least found some aquaintances, went out, went to parties, raves and such and I felt good for about 1 year. one year that felt as if I was actually living. I made it through my courses, I had a relationships, work, a goal, I had a 6-day-week, a proper schedule somehow. 

but lingering deep inside of me was this thing. this thing that has always been there. that thing that grew and grew. that thing that wanted to burst out and destroy everthing, tear me down, bring me to my knees. and it got stronger everyday.

I grew more unhappy with my relationship, I wanted to break up. I wasn't interested in my courses. I was unsure about my long-term goal, I got homesick, I didn't like my job, I felt alone and isolated, hated the city, hated my apartment. everything felt so wrong. I grew more and more anxious and began to realize: yes, I have managed to make it through many courses, I even got good grades on some papers but I had NO CLUE about what those courses were about actually! I had learned NOTHING!

I wrote papers (as always) the day before, handed them in 1 minute before midnight, sometimes managed to get a straight A on it and had NO IDEA what I actually wrote. (looking back, that was hyperfocus)

so there I was. 24/25. I was in the thing I decided on. this city. this relationship. this major. this life. and I worried. I worried all day. what was I doing with my life?!

&amp;#x200B;

I knew I had to break up, so I decided to do so. I did but we got back together. it took me an entire year to finally struggle through and following through breaking up with this young woman. it was the hardest thing I had ever done, because I truly loved her, but we simply weren't compatible in the long run. (long story short: she was muslim, I am not, we haven't had sex in 2 years of being together and since I always planned on having kids one day, that would have required me to convert to islam and raise my children accordingly, which I didn't feel like doing, so instead of realizing that right away I spent almost a year on reading the quran, studying her culture and religion, to see if it was for me, but in the end I had to break up)

all this time I thought it was the relationship that made me feel bad and tought it might get better once I freed myself. it got better for about 2 months. the summer of last year. for some reason it was one of the happiest summers of my life. I felt like depsite all the things that felt off, that I was getting somewhere. that I for the first time in my life stood up for myself and decided to say NO to something that wasn't for me (my relationship).  also I had QUIT ALL DRUGS! I felt empowered. I was 25. I had been working out for so long that for the first time in my life I actually found my appeareance to be ok. (even though people had always told me how attractive they found me my entire life, I always found myself hideous) I had only 3 more semesters of college in front of me and  felt  ok with everything.

&amp;#x200B;

but then it really started. after the breakup. it really started again. and I noticed it way too late. my depression got bad. reall bad. I grew more depressed and anxious every single day. I felt so alone and isolated in this city. apparently my girlfriend had been the only thing that had given me a sense of security. an anchor. but now that she was gone I started to realize:

&amp;#x200B;

I am 25 years old. the last few years have been an utter mess. I am living in a way too small apartment. alone. I study something I am not very interested in. I have only very few friends. the only real friends I have live several hours away. I had so many projects and hobbies planned (I wanted to start dancing and acting parallel to college) and I have done none of them. I wanted to go a semester abroad but I haven't because of my relationship. I worked out less and less because I was missing the energy. I got fired from my job because I wasn't paying attention enough, I got homesick, I hated myself. I hated my life. I felt like I have wasted my life, made horrible decision. 

still, I tried to keep going, but it got worse every day. to the point were in January of this year I found myself jogging at 4 o clock in the night through ice and snow because I couldn't deal with my inner agitation any longer. I felt like I had to run a thousand miles. I was so incredibly depressed and suicidal that I felt drawn to every bridge, every river, every highway.

I tried to push through, but I started to call my family and suicide hotlines on a daily basis just to get some relieve, just to feel a bit less lonely and lost in this insane world.

I turned 26 in January and noticed wrinkles on my face. AGING! I am aging. the good years are over the prime-time is over. you are an adult now. you are supposed to know what you are doing. enough with playtime. 

FUCK! I panicked. what the fuck have I done?! I wanted to do so much, yet I did nothing!

I failed my entire life! school, graduating, relationships, friendships, my year abroad, choosing a major/career, actual living and now also my courses! I had to drop out of course because I was so suicidal!

I had not therapy while in college, only my antidepressants! and those in a very low dose, apparently not helping!

I finally realized: I do NOT want to become a psychotherapist for children and teenagers. I do not want to spent my life with mentally ill children and their worried parents. I lost my goal and ended up with studying something I grew to hate! what the fuck am I supposed to do with a degree in social work? I had issues my entire life and now I am supposed to work in a field which is DRIVEN by people's problems? 

everything fell apart.

I wanted to run away! I wanted this to end! I just wanted to wake up and be 12 again! I wanted to be home! I wanted to have a new chance!  a new life! I looked at a life of regret!

&amp;#x200B;

I kept on repeating over and over again to so many people ""I alread grieve about the life I could have had"" and ""I feel as if I have never really and will never reach my full potential"", ""I always feel like I am driving with my foot on the breaks"".

&amp;#x200B;

my condition got so bad that one day my mother and her friend (luckily) decided to drive to my aparment and get me out of there. I didn't want to, I didn't want to give up, but I just couldn't keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

this year at 26 I ended up in yet another clinic. after 10 days they kicked me out because I was ""too depressed"". they wanted to put me in a psychiatric hospital to ""stabilize"" me aka drug me until I am a zombie, which I didn't want to do.

so I ended up in a crisis intervention-clinic for 2 weeks, which helped.

since I was severly doubting my major and wanted to drop out, this was my main topic 24/7.

but everbody convinced me to just finish this degree. it takes 7 semesters and I already had 4. I only needed to to one more semester of courses. 5 courses. 1 semester of internship and 1 semester bachelor-thesis. then I'd be done and could either use it or do something completely different, but at least I'd have my degree.

so I was convinced to finish my degree.

I got back to college, back to this city I hated and after only 1 week I was severly suicidal once again. I couldn't stand it any longer, started calling friends, family and the suicide-hotline again, several times a day.

then my family finally convinced me to just stop and  pause for one semester. I would kill myself if I kept going like this. I didn't want to but I knew they were right. so I put everything on halt, and ended up in yet another clinic.

I was actually glad to have made that decision. I had been to this type of clinic before when I was 22 and it had seemed to help, so I was confident it would help again. since I definitely had time for an entire semester I hope to stay as long in this clinic as possible (max 10 weeks) but sadly, they kicked me out after 5 1/2, because I broke one rule. I slept at another patients room. (don't want to expand further on this, but long story short everbody was shocked and mad at the staff that I had been kicked out because of such a small incident.)

still, the clinic kind of helped. being with likeminded people helped. what didn't help was the fact, that I again mentioned my ADHD diagnosis several times but the staff kept telling me that I don't have ADHD because I ""could pay attention in conversations""... Also I wanted to talk about my PTSD (I have been sexually abused as a child), which they did ignore. instead they once again for the thousand'th time they diagnoses me with ""recurring medium depressive episode"" and ""anxiety disorder"" and ""anxious-avoidant-personality-disorder""

now. there I was. 26. my life in shambles. not knowing where to go or what to do, looking at a mountain of failures, unfinished projects, long lost dreams and a plethora of pain, anguish, horror and devastation. lonely, no real friends around, failed college, lost my goal, my relationship, the little life I had, again living at my mom's house, while all my peers from highschool were already done with their master's degrees, travelling the world, heck even marying and getting children. 

but again I had been convinced by so many people to finish my degree. 

I decided to do so and since I knew that I just COULD NOT go back to this damn city I tried to transfer to a college near my hometown, to a city of which I know that I actually feel well there. I tried to transfer and I succeeded!

I cancelled everything in my city of anguish and an now currently trying to build my life from ZERO in this new city.

my major requires to do an entire semster of internship, which I am currently attending. it is not something I feel like I would want to do my entire life, but it isn't horrible either. also I simply need it in order to get this damn degree. 

I also have found myself a therapist, which I will start seeing next week.

I am looking for flatshares, hoping to find a good, healthy environment for me. 

I am way closer to home (only 40 minutes), which kind of feels like a failure but to be honest it makes me feel a lot more secure too. also I have my family dog waiting there, which is a life saver.

yesterday I finally received notice about my transfer to this new college: in the college I started I had already acquired 139 out of 210 credit points! (normally I would have been done in 6 months from now)

my new college apparently only accepts 97.5 of the CP I already had. so about 44 CP lost. worth about 9 courses. which is utterly frustrating. I will now have to do my internship and then 2 semesters of studying in very demanding courses plus writing my bachelor-thesis. and I am fucking afraid. adapting to a new environment, a new college, new professors and most importantly having to write exams again! learning! memorizing! at my initial college I was very happy to have a lot of presenations and write a lot of papers, which I am good at, but in this college I apparently have to really just learn and learn and vomit it all out on a piece of paper a the end of the semester. the one thing I have never been able to do and which has broken my neck and self-esteem so many times! 

and all that for a degree which I don't even know what I am supposed to do with it once I am finally done at the age of 28.

&amp;#x200B;

now all of this happend. I know the past is the past and that I can not change anything about it. I do believe that I only had good intentions so far and that I really tried to do my best. I know that I could not have known anything before it actually happened, I could not have known that my grandmother would die while I am abroad, I could not have known, that my relationship would end up the way it ended, I could not have known that I'll loose interest in my ""goal"" once again,  and so on...

and now I am here. especially these last 12 months have been the worst of my life. I am still extremely depressed many times, and suicidal more than I can bare. I won't kill myself because I don't want to transfer my pain to anybody else.

&amp;#x200B;

and in fact I WANT TO LIVE! I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO LIVE! and that's the whole fucking point!

&amp;#x200B;

I WANT TO LIVE BUT I DON'T SEEM TO KNOW HOW! I am so fucking frustrated. I have been convinced for so long that I am not only lazy, stupid, incompetent and hideous, no I have actually been convinced that I am mentally retarted and that people are just too kind to actually tell me.

and now after these years of pain and torture, after ruminating about my past, after trying to treat my depression for years, I have finally realized something: 

ADHD. fucking ADHD.

all this time. for over 17 years I have known about ADHD and I had actually been diagnosed with it. I tried to treat it a little bit, but not really. 

&amp;#x200B;

I never took it seriously. and I HATE MYSELF FOR IT!

&amp;#x200B;

so many people say ""oh if only I had been diagnosed sooner!"" and I actually have been diagnosed 17 years ago but I did not treat it properly!! now I am littered with comorbidities and my life is so deep down the shits that I have no clue where to even start or ever recover from all this pain and these traumatic events!

&amp;#x200B;

still. I am here. I am alive. I want to live. 

I had made an appointment with a psychiatrist a few weeks ago.

&amp;#x200B;

she told me that from what I told her so far she is nearly certain that I have ADHD and thus she prescribed me Vyvanse. I was hesitant at first and I took it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have taken 15mg in the morning. and I noticed and effect after about 1-2 hours. I have felt slight euphoria and I was stunned about just how QUIET my brain can actually be! I was not aware just how noisy my brain is. I could have heard a needle drop in my head! I was so clear and really able to focus. I could follow conversations! pay attention, respond accordingly and actually REMEMBER stuff! the second day I actually read an ENTIRE BOOK in several hours. I was just so focused and interested and I actually felt like I understood what I had read! I was much more organised and confident, as soon as I thought that I wanted to do something, I actually did it and FOLLOWED THROUGH! my thoughts were so much more streamlined, all the things hat had been piling up, all the new tasks in front of me: transfering to another college, finding new doctors, finding a flatshare, making appointmens, just getting my shit together - it all felt much easier. I felt so good!

BUT

sideffects: sweating, dry mouth, tense muscles in jaw, head and neck, slight headaches, subjectively raised heartrate (didn't actually measure it), increasingly worse gastro-intestinal problems (bloated stomach, nausea), loss of apetite, troubles falling asleep AND severe erectile dysfunction (it was impossible to get and maintain an erection and my orgasms were just not statisying at all) AND I grew more anxious, tense and depressed ever day.

after only one week I decided that I couldn't take it any longer. I asked my psychiatrist and she recommended me stoppin the medication. so I did. felt horrible and sleepy for 2 days.

&amp;#x200B;

but now I feel better again. the adverse effects are gone. BUT! the noise is back.  I have a billion thoughts, a billion ideas. it is so OBVIOUS to me now just WHY I have always had and still have an incredibly hard time choosing a major/career and actually STICK with it

I have missed out on so many things because I simply could not pay attention! I have so many projects laying around, so many hobbies I wanted to pursue, so many places I wanted to see, I have 200 books I bought because I found them interesting and I have started to read about 40 of them, while finishing only about 10. 

I have always been told that I am smart, that I have potential, that I look good, that I'm charismatic, but I never saw that. I always wanted to live, to actually DO something but I couldn't.

now I am AWARE of all of this and I of course read a lot about ADHD, I saw so many videos about it, talked to doctors, had my first diagnosis at the age of 9 and 

&amp;#x200B;

I STILL DOUBT THAT I HAVE ADHD!

&amp;#x200B;

and I am confused about what to do now. 

&amp;#x200B;

really finish my degree, even though I have no clue what to do with it, even if they handed it me tomorrow?

what about medication? I am thankful for the experience with Vyvanse because it made me realize just what is going on in my head and how it could actually be, if things were ""normal"". But apparently these sideeffect were just way too [much.](https://much.now)

now what? try another medication? treat my depression first? my ADHD first?

I feel like I have finally woken up at the age of 26 and now have to relive these ""wasted"" 26 years within one year. 

and I am terribly afraid of making further mistakes, afraid of falling deeper and deeper into despair, into mental illness  and to waste my life on sickness, worrying and ruminating.

&amp;#x200B;

**I WANT TO LIVE!**

**HOW?**

**DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAVE ADHD?**

**WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?**

**I AM SO AFRAID OF AGING!**

  
**I FEEL LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE!**

**WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?**

**IS THERE ANY MEDICATION THAT REALLY HELPS WITHOUT DAMAGING ME EVEN FURTHER?**

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to live. please. let me live.   


I want to get up in the morning an feel ok and not greatet by millions of negative thoughts and worries. 

I don't want to look in the mirror and worry about having wasted the best years of my life.

I want to be asked in a conversation "" and, what are you doing with your life?"" and actually give a happy and confident answer! 

I want to leave my demons behind me and finally live up to my potential, without destroying my body with some severe sideffects. 

ok. this was A LOT longer than anticipated. but I guess this had to just leave my system. writing actually makes me feel better I just noticed. to whoever made it through all this text: wow. thank you for reading this part of my story. 

I hope you are doing well today. somehow we can make it. take care!

My CV:
- 3rd (final) year maths student (its in Imperial College in the UK, hence a 3-year programme)
- Good academic results (average 90s), top 5% in cohort
- did a 2-month research-based internship on some ML, and familiar with Python (this may spin off a journal submission) 
- GRE: 169V 170Q

I have a good (but not great) CV and what is glaring is the lack of formal instruction in CS - UK universities are inflexible in allowing students to take courses from other departments. Do I stand a chance? Should I apply to joint maths + CS programs instead if they are significantly easier to get in with my CV?

d5zdwh,4,2019-09-18,I [24M] got several interviews into the process. Then the recruiter went radio silent. What's happening?,APP6A,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/d5zdwh/i_24m_got_several_interviews_into_the_process/,"TL;DR: I went through several rounds of interviews at a consulting firm, basically getting to the last stage short of being hired. The recruiter then said I didn't get the position, but that I was on a shortlist of candidates that they wanted to reach back out to after getting the budget for the new fiscal year approved. It has been over a month and I have heard nothing. All of the other places I've applied to have been saying nothing to me whatsoever. What's going on? And what should I do now?

——————————

For some background: I'm 24 and recently completed my master's degree; my academic background is in international relations research, and I have a year of administrative experience in a large supranational institution.

I applied for a research position at a large consulting firm and, not long after sending the application, heard from a recruiter with the company. She conducted a phone screening interview, which I felt went well. The same day, she sent me an email to schedule a battery of in-person interviews. I came into their office to interview with a couple of people who worked in research roles but were not in the department that I had applied to work in; they were screening me to see whether I was a good researcher in general. This consisted of a case study interview, a behavioral interview, and a writing assessment; I felt that I did reasonably well in all three, although I thought my best performance was in the case study interview.

That same week, I received a call from the recruiter saying that I performed extremely well in the interviews and, in particular, that the case study interviewer said that her interview with me was ""among the best that she had conducted."" The recruiter made a point of saying that this isn't language they just throw around, although I suppose everything should be taken with a grain of salt. The recruiter then scheduled a phone interview with the hiring manager for the position, which was the last stage in the process before hiring. We had an hour-long interview that, again, I felt went very well.

Two or three weeks passed without me hearing anything from the recruiter, but I then got an email saying that I was not selected for the position—they wanted someone with more business experience relative to academia. She said in her email that she was ""exploring other opportunities at \[the company\]"" and hoped to ""be back in touch soon with a position that may be in a group that is best suited for your overall skill set."" I emailed her back to say that I was disappointed in the outcome but was still interested in working for them. To my surprise, I received a lengthy email in response:

&gt;I am disappointed too, as I know you did so great in the case study, which is a huge part of the interview process. We actually have had a handful of candidates not make it through the \[phone interview\] due to the business acumen experience, and we have a short list (to include you), of who we’d like to reach out to once we have a few more positions open up. I do know budgets are getting approved, this week and next week, and by the end of next week we will have additional positions that are approved for hire. It is my hope we get a role open in the best suited practice for your skill set, and can proceed at that time! I would say in the next few weeks, we will likely be able to be in touch about new opportunities. In the meantime, I will chat with my colleague who is a little closer to the individual contributor research hiring, and see if she has heard anything about what specific business practices will be expanding in a few weeks and let you know! We will definitely be in touch soon!

I thanked her, and said that I looked forward to hearing from her. This was over a month ago. I sent two follow up emails: one two weeks after receiving the initial email, and a second one two weeks after my first follow-up. I have heard nothing in response. What is happening here? Am I actually being sought after, and this is just a lengthy process? Or am I being strung along, and I shouldn't hold out hope on this panning out?

As an aside, while I normally wouldn't be so invested in any one opportunity, this is the farthest that I've gotten in the hiring process for a 40-hour-a-week job since finishing graduate school. I am working a 24-hour-a-week internship (which, miraculously, is paid) that has virtually no prospect for advancements within that organization and, before that, I had a string of temporary assignments lasting between two to three months at a time. Online applications have garnered basically no response. I have also been reaching out to friends and connections, some of whom have said that they would refer me for open positions at organizations and companies that fit my skillset. These, too, have not been successful—I only got one interview as a result, and the other referrals generated no response at all. I'm coming up on a full year of either unemployment or underemployment since returning from graduate school, which is why I've been so focused on this (seemingly) promising lead."
d5zq46,1,2019-09-18,Considering taking a short term job?,revolutions96,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/d5zq46/considering_taking_a_short_term_job/,"I’ve been with my current company since I graduated from college in May 2018. It has been a bad fit. I currently work as a claims adjuster. I get very frustrated at my current position and I have a very long commute, over an hour. These are the two main issues I have with my job. I just don’t see a future at my current company and it’s not something I want to be doing in 5+ years.

I recently applied to an administrative support postion with a company working on a renewable energy project. The company has offered me the postion and is willing to pay me more and I would have salaried benefits (weekends off, vacation, sick time, holidays) with the option of working overtime from the first day I start. It would be a much shorter commute for me. Even though it is more or less an office job, I do think it could be interesting working in the renewable energy field and the experience may stand out on my resume. It may also pave the way to other jobs.

2 of the cons with this job is that I would be working longer hours (50 hours a week/ the good thing is I would be making a lot more money) and that it is only temporary. The project is projected to be complete by spring 2020. They did say that typically this company likes to keep its employees and will give you the option to transfer to a new project once the old one is done, however, this could mean I would have to travel for work, but I am not entirely opposed to in the future. I would need to think about it when the time comes. Otherwise if I don’t stay with this company I would have to find a new job in several months.

I have also interviewed with another company as of last week and have applications in with several other companies right now. Even if I do have this postion offered to me, if one of the others I applied to offers me a postion, I could always change my mind with the reasoning of the other positions being long term.

The only other concern I have with this job is that I worry how the short emoyement time will look on my resume even if the experience is great. My current postion is currently the longest one I’ve held. My previous work experiences were all internships, ranging from a few months to a year in duration, and summer jobs between school.

Does anyone else have any positive experiences of working on short term projects? Did they transfer into a long term postion?"

Initially i went in to this because i had no idea what i wanted to do so i kinda just picked it. I finished my first semester with a bunch of C’s. the classes and workload was so stressful.. it affected me mentally and physically. my second semester i managed to get all Bs and up since i had gotten used to the workload and environment. these were all general engineering classes, nothing to do with computers. I came into college with 0 knowledge about programming and computers while everyone else had previous knowledge . I still don’t know much programming as a sophomore. Currently i’m taking some computer and electrical engineering classes like digital logic design and principles of elec engineering. it’s only been 3 weeks since i’ve started, but it isn’t that bad and the stuff we do seems at least somewhat cool and interesting. i’m getting better at managing my stress and workload. my only problem is i don’t know if this major is right for me.. i don’t hate it i don’t love it, i’m kind of just in the middle. i’ve thought about other majors but really nothing interests me and i’ve already completed a year in this it would be hard to leave. i want to actually enjoy computer engineering in the long run... but i don’t have the slightest clue of what we actually do in our jobs, what my day would look like, what i’m expected to do—nothing. i’ve been looking for some volunteer or internships but i literally cannot find any because they all require experience 2+ years in programming. i don’t have any. i’m really just trying to shadow people in the field so i actually learn what they have to do. i’ve searched all over the web and people say i will hate it if i don’t have any interest and just doing it for the money.. this scares me because i don’t know if i even have the interest. i’m super lost and would like some help. any information or advice is welcome. thanks"

So far I have done two academic internships (in top institutions in UK and US), both in different areas of computational physics but not in ML explicitly.

For myself, I've found that school name and the names of the companies you work at matter far more than what your experiences actually are for most places. E.g. no one cares that you did X, Y, Z they care that you went to this school, or worked at a specific company.

Getting an interview outside of FAANG, and your more traditional fortune 500 companies, is like pulling teeth I find, despite having experiences. When thousands of people apply for the same 2 jobs available, most of us don't have a chance in hell if we didn't go to a top school and work at FAANG (obviously there will be cases outside of this so please don't come here and say ""WeLl I gOt a JoB hERe"")

I'm a new grad myself but after shadowing some senior members of my team, I have been green-lit to interview candidates for an internship at my company. I am pretty excited but I'm also sort of worried about determining if a candidate should be moved on to the next round or rejected right there.

As our interviews are only 1 hour long, I don't know what exactly to ask the candidate to check if they have a good grasp on CS concepts. During my own job search, I've been exclusively asked Leetcode style algorithmic questions, so I seem to focus most on these sort of questions. But there's a lot more to CS than just that, such as OOP design, database design, and so on.

I conducted my first interview earlier in the week and I asked fairly basic algorithm questions (specifically about hashmaps and binary trees). I think if a candidate can correctly solve questions regarding these fairly common data structures, that's a good sign that he knows most CS fundamentals, right? Data structures knowledge is crucial but at work we generally don't deal too much with them... the most I use are hashmaps or lists, very rarely once I used a tree for XML traversal, and I have yet to use recursion. But these are crucial skills for all developers so I guess every candidate needs to be well versed in them regardless of if we use them or not.

The thing is, if I am a round-one interviewer, I can write down my notes for the next interviewer, telling him, ""Hey, I asked him questions on (for example) hashmaps and trees. He's strong at recursion. Ask him about other data structures, or some OOP concepts"" and this way we can holistically test the candidate at every concept. I generally test data structures because that's what I've always been asked in interviews. But is this the right thing to test even if we don't use them a lot? Should our focus be more on the stack we personally use (so, Java and C++ pointers specific questions)? If it comes to algorithmic questions, what's a good guideline I should grade these candidates on? How ""good"" is good enough to move on, or to be rejected?"

One of my biggest hopes entering college was that I'd receive a SWE internship for this coming summer (2020), as I know that getting an internship after your first year is the perfect segue to better opportunities later on. I attended my university's career fair last week not expecting much, but actually received an interview with a company, and today, an offer to work next summer for them in an AI/ML role. It's a cool job- however, while not bad, the pay is not wonderful (I know many other companies pay more), it is in the city that I go to school in when I would prefer to be in the city closer to where I am originally from (across the country), but the most important thing for me is, I am planning on applying to the Big 4 freshman-only CS internships, as well as normal SWE internships for other companies. I know it is really hard to get those, but if I can somehow pull it off, I would 10000% much rather work there than at this company. This company is an extremely small startup (&lt;10 employees) and I'd personally rather work at a more established company. Don't get me wrong, I would love to work at the company I received an offer with and I am very interested in their work- I am simply more interested in those other roles.

At the same time, getting an internship, any internship, for next summer was my biggest dream and I could not be more grateful that I got one because I heard that many freshmen do not get them. The downside- the company that gave me the offer wants me to let them know by next week. I'm sure they'd give me a month or so extension if I ask nicely, but the bigger company internships only get back to you in February ish of 2020. It's not fair to ask this company for a 4 month extension (right?) and I doubt that they'd even give it to me if I asked. If I accept this offer but end up getting one from a better company later on, I'm going to be devastated. However, if I turn this down in hopes of getting another offer and then don't get anything, I'm going to be absolutely crushed sitting at home doing nothing next summer thinking about the internship I could've had.

Does anyone have any advice for what I should do or have been in this situation before? Please, anything helps. Thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: Reneging is not really an option because I got this offer through my school's career fair and the company will most likely contact my school if I go back on my acceptance, which carries a lot of consequences such as not being able to attend future career fairs."

As the title suggests, I am wanting to get into the field of software engineering but I am getting a realitively useless major. Originally, my plan was to go to law school so I picked an interesting but not practical degree. After completing internships at two different firms, I have begun to realize law may not be for me. So I took some time to explore other interests. Having loved the courses I took in bolean and symbolic logic, I thought software engineering might be a good fit. I took a class on Java at my local community college as well as an online course in computer science and have since learned that I find the field fascinating and want to make it my career. The problem is that I am set up to finish my degree next spring as I only need 4 more classes. My university (Arizona State if anyone is interested) does not offer a minor in computer science and double majoring would require roughly 90 more credits so it is not an overly appealing option. Which has me stumped on what to do next. A local community college offers a certificate as well as an associate in computer programming, which focuses heaviliy on Java, C++ and sql and I could complete the program in roughly 1 year. Would that be a solid path? Alternatively, I have looked into the postbacc computer science degree at OSU, would that be a better option? Any suggestions or reccomendations are appreciated. Thank you!

tldr; I'm wanting to get into software engineering but am getting a liberal arts degree."

I want to make a solid project which could help me to learn embedded hardware/software and data processing using GUI(web based, or windows program).

I've searched in /r/embedded, r/electronics history for posts with keywords ""final year"" or ""projects suggestion"" , searched in google and YouTube. Unfortunately these attempts didn't give birth for a satisfying project idea, so I've decided to ask you kind people for inspiration and ideas..

I was thinking of something along the lines of making a portable measuring device, in example: taking voltage current characteristics with my built hardware(PCB with adc's, current shunts, STM32, UART/BLE/wifi) and displaying them in my frontend program/web.

I had an internship where Me, and my Partner designed PCB for 3 phase inverter with wattmeter IC's . And wrote firmware for STM32F4, and a C# program to collect and display data i really liked everything about it and I got the job after internship ,but unfortunately I cant use it as final year project.

I have basic knowledge in C, C++, C#, python,openCV. I'm very eager to learn embedded, currently reading Mastering STM32 which is a fantastic book in my limited experience.

So please could you suggest me a project in which i could really learn embedded including hardware and software and would be able to finish in roughly 8 months?

TL;DR

What embedded project would you take on if you had 8 months and would be eager to learn embedded hardware/software and a little front-end for displaying and manipulating collected data in windows program or in web based GUI."

I have been following this sub for quite a while now, and I would like to get some thoughts on a situation I am currently facing. I graduated last year with a BCS degree and have started preparing my master's application and I am looking to apply at European universities (Germany and Finland) at the moment.

I currently work as a Systems Engineer at a local solutions integrator/distributor which deploys IoT and ERP products for hospital and operating room management at hospitals. As of now, I am not directly working on embedded development, only managing, deploying, designing, and providing support for already deployed systems or currently in development products.

I would like to list down all significant embedded related projects/courses for context building in ascending order (oldest to latest).

* Freshman year digital logic circuits and basic electronics using discrete ICs and logic gates.
* Internship at a local makerspace where I ended up making my first IoT project, wireless extension cord using NodeMCU 8266 and Blynk.
* The Light That Needed Space, a perceptive object designed by a teacher I met outside my alma mater. The brightness of the eight panels of light decreased when you moved closer to the object. I helped design the PCB, configure the transistors, LEDs, ultrasonic sensors, and program the Arduino Mega. I could not finish it on my own as I was not able to sequence the brightness of LEDs in a specific order.
*  How will you conduct in the company of plants? An installation designed by a local artist who hired me as a developer to do the technical setup including generating MIDI output using analog input from indoor plants using Arduino.
* Studied Embedded Systems and used AT89C51 to interface a variety of sensors, devices,  and ICs. Main projects from this course were RFID Card Logger using AT89C51, RDM 6300, and 16\*4 LCD and the other was a basic implementation of Fuzzy Logic on Arduino Uno.
* Water Saving Shower, worked with an industrial designer to design and prototype a solution from scratch including user research. In the end, our demo was a showerhead made up of misting nozzles and a solenoid switching system using Arduino Uno. It was a mess.
* Took Computer Architecture, Computer Vision and Systems Programming by choice as electives, had a blast in these three courses in my 2nd last semester. 
* I ended up building a facial recognition-based doorbell with another friend of mine as our Final Year Project using OpenBR, VueJS, NodeJS, Python on Raspberry Pi 3. I did not work on the Web Dashboard of the project. I only worked on the modules directly related to hardware such as interrupts, sensors, locks, facial recognition, BlueTooth, a bit of networking, power management, and PCB stuff. I designed a 3-foot long miniature door prototype and in the end, we won an award at a national computer project exhibition.
* At last, I volunteered as a facilitator at the local makerspace in which I used to help organize weekly public ""Arduino Nights"", conduct sessions on Arduino's, Pi's, NodeMCU's, and other small embedded devices, help manage the makerspace, procure hardware supplies for the makerspace, conduct outreach campaigns, and I also had the opportunity to collaborate with brilliant people on multiple events, projects, and researches. I volunteered for roughly three years at the makerspace.

Now, I am in a situation where I miss doing certain things related to embedded systems which I did in the past, and I am confused about which direction or area to explore. My friends are either going for studying theoretical computer science or working as hardcore developers. So, I am having a hard time to relate to anyone around me. I am halfway through writing my general statement of purpose and other application material but unable to finalize what I really want to work on.

I didn't plan on making it this long, however, after mentioning the above details, I apologize if I was unable to make this worth your reading time."

I'm at a point in my work life that I feel certifications are needed to progress further in my career. I started out at an MSP with little IT experience back in 2016 and am currently handling the day to day for a medium sized business (hotel). I've learned a lot in large part to the company owner and my manager willing to teach me what they know to get me up to speed. I'm comfortable with Meraki, Opera, Micros, and Windows. A lot of what I have learned started back in 2006 with my first job working in a school district as an intern for IT. Left that in 2008 to jump into hotels, and now I've got what I consider the best of both worlds.

Now, however, I don't want to settle for just being a support tech/IT manager (whatever the hotel decides to call me that day). I want to actually prove what I know. What are some of the essential certifications that most users have? I know there's debate whether or not certifications help, but I have seen from personal experience certifications opens more doors and commands better pay. I was looking to work towards the CCNA, but with the changes coming in 2020, I'm holding off. I'm also considering the following certs, in no particular order:

1. MCSE. From what I've gathered, this and the CCNA are considered basic for those who are truly dedicated to improving themselves
2. CCNA. See above
3. PDC. I know nothing about Linux besides what Mr. Robot and Jurassic Park have shown me, but I figure a Linux Essentials might teach me enough to decide where to go from there
4. CISSP. I've had a couple colleagues take this, and it seemed interesting. Not necessarily my focus
5. SCP. We use this application, and I've considered starting there
6. M365C: Modern Desktop Admin
7. PMP. This one I'm most interested in, as I've felt it plays to what I am good at. But on that, I know I need to get more done before attempting it

Tl;dr tired of mediocre pay and want to actually better my career path. What would you or your business look for in terms of certifications?"

Because of this people often don’t recognize me or remember my name during the off chance I do come up to there desk to ask about a certain project. 

Today I was talking to our IT guy who I hadn’t seen in person since I’ve rejoined and asked a technical question pertaining to general day to day work. Long story short the way he replied made me believe that he (like many others) didn’t recognize me and so I quickly added something along the lines of “oh, I’m so and so from ___ team.” He then replied “yeah, I know.” In a way that made me my anxiety flip it’s lid.

I have a hard time making sure the tone of voice I’m using isn’t coming off as harsh/deadpan or rude and I’m very anxious that I’ve now upset someone by accidentally making this assumption.

We have lived together almost those 2 years, except for 6 months where I lived in California for an internship, of which he flew out to see me 3 times within those 6 months. Me and him have always had a great relationship. We rarely fight, we almost always get along, his friends tell me I’m their favorite out of all their friends girlfriends, his family loves me, everybody tells me I’m a good for him. Almost about 2 years ago my boyfriends dad passed away suddenly. My boyfriend lived with him to help take care of him and when he passed it was real hard on my boyfriend and he ended up getting left the house and all the bills that came with it as well as dealing with all of his dads stuff.

About a month ago me and him were on a vacation with a bunch of our friends when one of them mentioned to me that he was planning on breaking up with me when the trip was over. So I went and confronted him about it and it turns out it was true! When I asked him why? All he could tell me was that he has been unhappy and has been unhappy for awhile and just wants to live alone. He said that there is nothing wrong with me or any of the things I do, it’s just because of how unhappy he is makes it hard for him to feel “in love” with me but that he still does love me. 

As I packed my stuff out of his house right before I finished he told me that he doesn’t want me out of his life and that every time me and him are together he has an amazing time. That he was going to label us as “it’s complicated” and that he promised not to be with any other girls and for me to keep my key to his house and leave my cats (I have 4) and half my stuff at his house and that we’d talk but it doesn’t guarantee that we will get back together. 

It’s been over a month now, almost 2 months and all he’s really done is talk to me occasionally and send me a Snapchat every night. What should I do!?!? Literally my life feels like it’s shattering because I thought he was the one for me! And I still want to believe that."

So, I’m currently at an internship with a PR firm that works with several nonprofit organizations. I love it there and feel very strongly that I’ve done a good job. I’ve been able to generate significant media coverage for the clients I’ve worked with and have received positive feedback from the people I work with.

I’m a recent college grad and needed to build up my resume which is why I looked for an internship. I also have a job, but it’s under a contract and it’s about to end. So, basically I’m going to be in a position where I’m out of a job and left with only an internship.

I’ve been recommended for a few full time jobs but I don’t want to accept anything until I know for sure that my internship won’t turn into a job.

I need to talk to my supervisor at my internship about my status as an intern and ask if there’s any chance of me being offered a full-time job. 

How do I approach this? Should I tell them I’m looking for other jobs? Am I being presumptuous?

Help."

The position isn’t SWE. It’s more of a networking related job. The listing for the job is [here](https://jobs.cisco.com/jobs/ProjectDetail/Technical-Consulting-Engineer-Co-Op-United-States/1267175)

Apparently the position said no networking experience needed and I decided to give a shot at the interview to see if I could get the hang of technical interviews. Did not think that they would actually email me back.

Tomorrow I will be in a video call with one of the university recruiters. I still had some questions that I wanted to ask about the offer, because as much as I do take an interest to how networking works under the hood, SWE is a passion of mine I’ve wanted to pursue. So I just wanted yalls opinion and see if this one question of mine I wrote to ask the recruiter tomorrow was  appropriate: Can I continue in the summer at Cisco as a software engineer/developer intern?

Since the co op will last from January to June, I would be going straight into a summer where I’m still free to do whatever. However I’m a little bit nervous on giving off the wrong impression by asking this question and basically fucking myself over first impressions wise. I appreciate any replies."

I'm writing this after a year of feeling awful with myself, my life and I hope I don´t make it too long for you guys.

So first, I want to introduce myself, I won't give any names in the little chance that somebody I know read this. I'm a 23 years old computer science student currently enrolled in one of the most prestigious colleges in my country but also the most expensive one. Since I was in middle school I got the idea to get into this college but I knew I had to work really hard to get a scholarship because my family wouldn't be able to pay for it and thankfully I did even though it was only 50%.

So, I made it into this college, but I never thought that I would feel so out of place. There were so many rich and good-looking people that were able to be in this university without the need of a scholarship and because they were locals, they had already big group of friends while I'm here, a foreign student without much money.

I made some friends and one day I meet this other guy from my hometown that was in the same major and he was almost the total opposite of me, his family had a lot of money so he didn't need a scholarship, he had a nice car, his apartment was way nicer than mine and was taller and overall more good-looking than me. I started to chat with him and tried to become friends but I think we just didn't get along, every time that I saw him walking in college I would try to say hi to him but he always ignored me even though I'm pretty sure he saw me (I always felt it was because he thought he would be the only guy from my state and was shocked to see somebody else from there in this college).

So we took some classes together and I remember him getting really bad grades while I was getting good grades but I didn't think too much about it, I just wanted to maintain my scholarship and make it into a big tech company like Microsoft, Google or Facebook in the US so that I could finally be able to pay my own bills and even be able to help my family, I wanted to be the first person from my hometown in one of these companies.

After 2 years my dad was fired from his job and things started to go south really bad. I had to get a part time job to be able to at least pay for my own food, but it is so hard to exercise, hang out with friends or do anything when you must study and work at the same time. So, because of the stress and lack of exercise I started to gain weight and suddenly I felt so bad in my own skin, I just hated looking at my fat self in the mirror. The hope I had was that if I got an internship in a tech company I would get pay a lot and I could focus on other things and not only in having enough money to survive.

So I came up with the idea to make a mobile game with ads that could at least help me get some food and would make my resume look somewhat nicer and I sacrificed my free time working on it but it just wasn't enough, even after 6 months I felt the game wasn't ready to be launched so I still haven't been able to release it.

Time passed and Microsoft came to my college and I was able to land an interview for their internship and I honestly thought I did a good job, I had good communication with the interviewer and managed to finish the problem the gave me within time. I started to feel so happy, I thought that things were finally going my way for once, I was finally going to be able to do other things than studying and working, I was finally going to be able to lose weight and have enough money to pay my own stuff and not having to worry my family about it.

But then yesterday I got an email, Microsoft thanked me for trying but told me they didn't had a place for me with them. And in that moment, for some wicked destiny reason, the guy from my hometown passed by with some friends and they were congratulating him about getting the internship in Microsoft.

In that moment I went blank but after a minute I felt something I had never felt in my whole life, so much hatred towards myself, so much angriness, so much desperation, I felt stupid, inadequate, like such a loser, I felt like jumping from the building and just stop everything in my life. And then I started to wonder what went wrong, how even though I did better than him in classes he was able to get the internship and not me. And I remembered how last year I've been working my ass off while studying and working to get the internship, to finally make my family relaxed about the future and how last year I barely had time for myself. Seeing all my efforts go to shit, all my hope gone just like that, I just wanted to disappear from this world.

I was able to withstand the hardships because I had a hope, I felt that if I worked hard and keep trying I could get the internship but losing that I realized how for the past year I've felt like I'm just dying slowly, living to study and work, working to survive but not living my own life. Right now, I'm just thinking how fucked up destiny can be and that no matter the hard work and the sacrifices, sometimes life is really unfair and the fortunate keep being fortunate.

If you made it this far, thank you. Writing things down helped me somewhat but I'm still feeling like shit, I feel like I'm done living like this, but I just can't give up. I don't want to make my family sad, honestly all I want in life is for them to be happy and I hope someday God can give that to us."

They say pick something you are interested in, but for me that's the problem. I have no idea what I like or don't like.  Many projects on the list seem to be centered around machine learning, but do far in the course we haven't been taught anything about machine learning. I guess for some projects they want you to go and research an area of computer science and contribute new research findings or implement something based on the findings already out there. For projects like these, I would be worried they are out of my depth and I wouldn't be able to get a good grade in them.

I have done an internship which involved some web app development, and I have an idea for a basic mobile application that I could do. I spoke to the lecturer and he thought it was a good idea but I am still worried that because it's lower complexity I won't be able to achieve a great grade. A component of this app could be centered around computer vision, but I haven't got a clue of it would be feasible.

So far in my degree, I have managed to get good grades (the highest grade band possible). I had this vision of going out and working for one of the top tech companies or moving to the states and working in new York or California (am from europe), but I feel like I could make one mistake here that brings everything down. 

I am really worried and anxious about the whole thing. It feels like a minefield that I've gotten close to the end but I could step on a landmine and the whole thing could go wrong."

d6e0zf,1,2019-09-19,Can't decide for my Master's Degree,Bulbosauron,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d6e0zf/cant_decide_for_my_masters_degree/,"Hello everyone. I have been pondering my decision for a while and I can't get my head around it: maybe some of you can try to give some hints towards a decision. 

&amp;#x200B;

I will graduate in less then a month from my Bachelor's program in Physics (from Italy). After a long search and application period, I have tracked down my possibilities between 2 very different choices: going to study **Computational Physics** in Sweden or **Data Science** in my local city (both 2 years long programs).

The first possibility means that I will keep studying physics, while at the same time learning some very useful stuff about computers, simulations and machine learning. The level will be as high as the one I am used to right now, but I will have to adjust to a totally different lifestyle (even though this part doesn't really scare me).

The latter means that I will abandon anything related to physics, but I will gain more insight about machine learning, neural network and, in general, data analysis. The level of this faculty won't be as high, for there will be people with more diverse background, but I will remain in my city, hence with my family and gf close to me. 

As of late, due mostly to the work I'm doing with my thesis, I have gained a lot of interest towards Machine Learning and Data Analysis, while at the same time I have lost interest in advancing a more profound level of studying physics – I believe mostly related to the terrible way I have been taught in during these past 3 years. I still find nature and physics fascinating: it's just that I have become ""numb"" to it, after hours and hours spent learning it.

I have both tried all sorts of ""objective"" ways to find a solution and asked for suggestion to my friends and family, but nothing as come out of it. 

Both faculties are excellent and will give me great possibilities once out of University, even though slightly different. 

Computational Physics will give me a more diverse knowledge and background and I will have to study at a more advanced level mostly mathematics. I will some Machine Learning, but not everything that I do will be ""job-focused"", hence I will have to do some extra work myself depending on what I will be able to lend once out.

Data Science is definitely more ""job-oriented"" (they have an internship program sponsored by a bunch of big companies) and will give me heavily practical tools for my future work life. My mathematics skills won't be as good, but I think my level of Machine Learning will be far better. Also, I will work, during my studies, with more ""real-life"" data, as well as learning to be fluent in table management (requested in the workplace).

Everything that I wrote is obviously very hopeful in both cases, for I cannot predict what I will be facing. If anyone has some suggestions, it would mean a lot to me."
d6f25d,1,2019-09-19,old email draft i never sent but stumbled across recently. feelings are still sort of the there (things have improved since) but thought it might be cathartic to vent post...,[deleted],Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/d6f25d/old_email_draft_i_never_sent_but_stumbled_across/,"Hey,

I just wanted to respond to the conversation on Saturday.

First of all, I think I can relate to your situation way more than you realize.  If you think struggling alone is easier for me than anyone else, you're wrong.  When I go through struggles, I think I feel the loneliness even more acutely than you, because somehow I can't allow myself to share it with others.  Even faceless friends on the internet.  Especially with mom being the way she is, and my feeling like I absolutely HAVE to be a positive role model for you, when I feel like I'm slipping, it really feels like I have nothing solid to hold on to.  I literally don't tell anyone, not you, not mom, not T, not S, and I always wait until a pain or crisis passes before letting anyone know.  If I ever express anything about a struggle or problem I'm having, it's because I've already come to terms with it.  My skeletons and demons are buried deeper and darker than you realize I think.  Eventually, everyone's problems and struggles even out, I believe, and so to say I don't understand is a very callous and dismissive way to disregard my feelings and concern.

I told you on Friday that whatever decision you make, I want you to be able to rationally justify it.  Not emotionally, rationally.  Positivity and happiness can come into your life in many ways.  The mental break you need periodically can be volunteer work at a homeless shelter, a long hike or camping trip, sometimes just a day spent in bed.  Those types of moments for recharging are worth so much more than an endeavor like the one you're planning, because it's something you are doing for yourself by yourself.  I think there's something very empowering about that.

So in short, I don't think positivity and happiness is a good reason to go.  Tell me that you've done really well in school this semester.  Tell me that you've made friends in school.  Tell me that you are happy where you are.  Tell me that you have an internship lined up for this summer.  A vacation should be a reward, not a therapy.  

Now, I know you've already decided, and you may have already purchased tickets.  Here's something else I know.  You don't have very many chances left.  There's only so many straws you can use.  And the fact that this crisis came up at all is alarming.  And disheartening. I wonder if what I tell you is getting through.  I hear all the time that a person will not hear what you're telling them until they are ready.  And you can't tell me that you're ready.  You can only show me.  

I want to circle back to a point you made that really upset me.  I take vacations, yes.  I take international vacations.  My schooling cost more than yours.  All these things are true.  There is a huge difference between how I've spent this money though.  The vacations I take are planned out months to years in advance.  I never plan an international trip more than once a year, usually I don't fly international more than once every 3-4 years.  I didn't even go back to China for gongong's funeral, and that bothered me for months.  

I went to a private school although I could have done just as well at a state school.  I went on vacations while I was at school, and I traveled with friends and my boyfriend.  Here's the difference: I earned it.  I worked my ass off to get the grades.  I spent sleepless nights, I passed on social events, I lost track of high school friends, and there were times I thought I was going to break down (there were a couple breakdowns as well, but that can be discussed another time).  I earned my vacations and paid for them myself.  And I made damn sure I'm on track to earning back the money mom spent on my education.  And I remember that I'm where I am now because she paid the way for me, and I'm trying to position myself to be able to take care of her when she eventually retires.  

It really hurt.  That attack hurt a lot actually, and bothered me longer than it probably should have.  Lashing out at the way I use my money felt like an attack on all the things I've earned.  It felt like a discredit to my accomplishments and milestones.  I'd been working for 4 years before I took my first real vacation without family.  Yes, it was early on in college.  Yes, it was with a boyfriend I had only just started dating.  And yes, there were some reservations from mom and R about how wise it was.  But get this, I got straight A's.  I built trust.  I demonstrated success at the one thing I needed to focus on at that point which was school.  And if mom had still been against it, I would not have gone. 

There may be some truth in your accusation that I don't understand.  I simply can't understand how you are making such an obviously wrong decision.  The only way I can understand it is to remember what it was like when I was in a bad place.  I remember having a choice.  I remember realizing that there was a hard choice and a soft choice.  That the soft choice was like a balm, felt like it would be uplifting, felt like it would be energizing, but that ultimately, it would only make it even harder to face stark reality. And I remember that the hard choice would hurt, and suck, and break me down even further before finally paying off.  The pay off was never the grades or whatever accomplishment it was.  The pay off was the ability to do it again.  To grind even further the next time.  It's called endurance.  It's called resilience.  

...

Mainly having mixed feelings cause in some ways, not sending this felt like I was just rolling over and letting her make groundless bitter accusations that were undeserved.  on the other hand, things have eventually moved on so alls well that ends well yeah?"

I know my wife and I need to leave to have any sort of chance to work and make an adequate living in our respective careers.

I've gone to HR specialists to review my resume and they only suggested a few changes which I made.  I've done mock-interviews with professionals and all of them have said I passed with flying colors.  At this point, I just don't know what else to do.

d6g127,23,2019-09-19,[California] Pharmacy Licensing Process,LegalPharmThro,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d6g127/california_pharmacy_licensing_process/,"I'm sure many are unaware of the pharmacy licensing process but in California it's awful to begin with. To summarize, it's a 2 exam process both completely computerized and multiple choice. One exam, NAPLEX, is a 250 question 6 hour exam while the other, CPJE, is a shorter 90 question exam. Everyone's frustration is with the second exam, the CPJE.

With this exam, the board of pharmacy takes 60-90 days to give a response on your score, during which you cannot work as a pharmacist, as they are graded in batches. This latest batch started on 7/9/19 and over 60 days later they've decided that the exam has been compromised some how.

Apparently this happened a few years ago as well, and everyone's exam scores during that period was nullified and they had to retake it. A lot of us get hired on as grad interns, or manage to get into residency programs, which all require licensing by a certain time frame. This will lead to us getting terminated from work, and kicked out of residency programs. And of course our debt (300k +) is piling up and we have no way or reasonably making payments. 

Do we have any kind of legal case against the board of pharmacy here? It seems outrageous when it only takes a week or two in any other state for their licensing but for California it takes an average close to 3 months."

Luckily, i’m taking online classes through my university and staying at home due to an awesome internship I got, so i’ve been able to help my mom out around the house and with taking my two youngest siblings places. stress is still really high in my house and things are always tense. in the small time my mom has to spend with my 16yo brother, they are always getting into arguments and my mom does the same thing to him that she did to me when i was in high school(become extremely invasive and tear him down for everything he does [he does far better in school than I ever did, 4.3GPA, 35 ACT, gonna get a full ride wherever he goes to college] and just get on his ass about everything for no reason), and because of that, my brother gets a lot of his sense of self worth stripped away because he “isn’t doing enough” to please the only parent that he sees (he and I don’t really see our dad on weekends because we work doubles in restaurants friday sat sun).  like 4-5 years ago, he talked about killing himself when my family was going through a really rough time (dad lost his job and mom wasn’t working), and we didn’t really know what to do, but thankfully, it didn’t happen. i’m worries that he’s going to go into a really harmful downwards mental spiral like I did my senior year. to give some context, my senior year, I wanted to die. I just wanted all of it to be over. I was getting declined from a lot of my preferred schools, and then I got accepted to my first choice (which I am currently attending :-) ), and about a month and a half later, my mom came into my room while I was on facetime with my long distance girlfriend at the time, and told me to hang up and she immediately told me that my dad lost his job. again. twice in three years. no notice. no severance. everything crumbled around me. my parents who were always planning on paying for at least half of my (and my siblings as well) education, were no longer able to, I got my financial aid package the week earlier, zero assistance due to my dad’s salary, all decisions were final. I had take out $33k in loans to pay for my first year of school. I just wanted everything to be over. I thought I was fucked and was going to have to spend my whole life paying back my student debt (which i’m still going to have to do but that’s just life) and I thought about killing myself. I didn’t get to see my dad, my mom and I fought all the time, my siblings and I didn’t get along, but my family would’ve gotten my $60k life insurance policy and they would have been able to make it out of my dad’s job loss okay. To this day, I don’t know what stopped me. I don’t know what to tell my brother if he ever has to go through something like I did. I don’t know how I got out of my situation, some days I feel like i’m still in it and think that everything and everyone could be better off without me. I don’t know what stops me. I’m so scared that I won’t know what to do or what to tell to my brother if the situation were to ever God forbid arise. what advice do you guys have for me? all input is appreciated more than i can tell you"
d6h18b,3,2019-09-19,CS or IT major career opprotunities,Timeteller4,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/d6h18b/cs_or_it_major_career_opprotunities/,"I'm a junior that hasn't declared a major yet, but I am on the fence of whether or not to pursue computer science or ITI. I've heard the major itself is very bottleneck as in you have to take certain required courses before progressing onto the next. Such as having to take calculus 2 before being able to take data structures and so on. So far I am taking three IT courses credits, but I'm only doing this so I can pass intermediate algebra because I didn't pass RU Ready Test by one point.

Next semester I intend to take precalculus 115 and Introduction to computer science in the same semester. For the summer I plan on taking calculus 1 and data structures at anther University institution closer to where I am and keep going from there. My first impression of the IT courses so far is that its basically a writing class and I'm not learning anything practical that I can use for potential internships interviews.  Is it better to stay with IT and minor in CS or keep going with CS major? I can't shake the notation that by going IT it will slow me down for future career opportunities like Software Development jobs. Will having IT instead of CS on my degree make that big of a difference to the employer? I've noticed on most job applications it has the ""CS or related discipline"" attached to it so I assume IT would fall under that category? Thanks."
d6h6qn,2,2019-09-19,Bad experience at university's career fair?,alexandrrrrrro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d6h6qn/bad_experience_at_universitys_career_fair/,"So I don't have any internship experience and only one personal project, but at my school's career fair I tried my best to highlight the skills I used in my personal project (Python and data stuff). However, some companies straight up told me that they needed a GPA of 3.0 or higher so they wouldn't even take my resume. Fair enough. I spoke to one of the Indian contracting companies where they straight up said I didn't have enough experience so they ""might find something for me"". Ok. Lastly, out of the 100 companies there, I failed to thoroughly research a certain tech company. When I asked questions about the company, I got a condescending response and got told ""I should've done my research"" and I was then ignored. The recruiter didn't even say goodbye or anything he just turned around extremely offended that I didn't know a lot about their company.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I doing these wrong? I tried to be extremely genuine because I hate being fake with people. I wanted to show that I was interested but not some robot that put up a front. I'm known at work for being extremely social and helpful with our clients, but at this career fair you couldn't have known. Now I'm very discouraged from applying to jobs.

Is there something I am missing?"
d6h6tr,209,2019-09-19,Bedtime Story,h2j1977,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d6h6tr/bedtime_story/,"
 
“Eldron, tell me a bedtime story,” Faish said making her best pleading face. Faish was 6 years old. She was spending the night with her grandparents while her parents were off celebrating an anniversary. She pulled the covers up and adjusted the pillow up to just the right height that she could look at her eldron’s four purple eyes. “Tell me the story of the humans coming, and how you met Eldra. That one’s my favorite.”

 
Kiosho pulled a chair up to the edge of the bed. He tucked Faish in, using his larger arms to pull the covers in around her, and his smaller arms to tightly tuck the blanket around her small frame. “Ok, little one. But just one story, then it’s time for you to slumber. Do you need to go to the bathroom first? Do you need a drink of water?”

 
“No, eldron. I’m ready for the story,” Faish said expectantly. She’d probably heard this story a dozen times before, but she never grew tired of him telling it. The humans fascinated her. They were so strange with their two eyes and two arms, and that fur that only grew out of their head. She thought they were super cute, in an ugly degrooc sort of way. Thinking of degroocs, she looked around the room. “Eldron, where’s Vilo? Can he sleep in here with me tonight?”

 
Kiosho called out, “Vilo, come here buddy.” A few moments later, the clacking of Vilo’s claws could be heard coming down the hallway until his lithe six-legged body slipped through the doorway. Vilo was a standard degrooc – black fur with chitinous plates around his almond-shaped head and down his spine. His four green eyes looked up at Kiosho, waiting for instruction. Kiosho patted the bed, “Come up here and lay down.”

 
Vilo tilted his head a second, questioningly. Normally beds were off limits. But he wasn’t going to waste the opportunity.  Vilo quickly jumped up and made himself comfortable at Faish’s feet, kneading the blanket and turning in a circle. Laying down, he curled up and put his head on his feet.

 
“OK, all set? Can I start the story now?” Kiosho settled into the chair and looked at his granddaughter’s face. She looked so much like her mother, his daughter, but she also had the upcurved chitinous horns resembling a crown along the top of her forehead like her father.

 
“Yes, eldron, I’m ready. Start at the beginning. When our ancestors went into the stars.” Faish squirmed a bit, trying to get her foot where it could touch Vilo. She wiggled it back and forth, ‘petting’ Vilo through the blanket. She was hoping he would eventually get up and lay down next to her so she could cuddle him like a plush toy.

 
“You know the story so well! Do you want to tell it to me instead? I’m tired too. No one’s told me a bedtime story in forty years. Do you know what it’s like to not sleep for forty years because no one would tell you a bedtime story? It’s exhausting!” Kiosho feigned a huge yawn, stretching his four arms each in a different direction.

 
“You’re silly, eldron. I saw you napping on the couch earlier today! Eldra had to shake you three times before you woke up. We almost ate dinner without you.”


“You’re a clever one. Always paying attention. From the very beginning you said, right? Ok.” Kiosho cleared his throat and shifted his weight in the chair, finding the most comfortable position possible.

 
“It was a thousand years ago. Our people, the Grolnori, had just developed faster-than-light travel. It was a time of great turmoil, uh, difficulty. Our worlds resources were strained by our large population. It was decided that half of the world’s population would have to get on colony ships and go to a new planet. The closest planet that would work was eight hundred light years away. It would take over three hundred years to reach with our fastest ships.” So, for years we built ships. Some beings volunteered to get on the colony ships, excited by the adventure. Others were chosen through lotteries. Eventually, years later, they were ready to depart.”

 
Kiosho looked down at Fiash, seeing if she was still awake. Her magenta eyes looked back at him, expectantly. “Hundreds of colony ships left on the same day – ‘The Departing’. A few weeks into their journey, they went beyond our ability to talk to them. The remaining beings on our world, Trugo, went about their lives. Years passed, and the conditions on Trugo improved. We weren’t using nearly as many resources, and we were able to come up with new ways of reducing pollution. It was a golden age for our kind. Sometimes, when times are good, important things are forgotten. It didn’t happen in one generation, but over centuries. The history files can’t pinpoint exactly when it happened, but the last recorded mention of ‘The Departing’ was about six hundred years ago.”

 
“For the next six hundred years, we didn’t even know that there were other Grolnori out there, somewhere. We didn’t know if they ever reached the planet, Kerefi, or if something had happened to them. We just lived our lives normally. We didn’t really explore the galaxy around us much either. Everything was just too far away. Even with our newest FTL drives, it was still multiple lifetimes to reach anything. Sure, we explored our solar system, developed some colonies on Hago, our moon, and Oprivia, our neighboring planet. We set up mining operations on all twelve of the planets in our solar system, and some of the asteroid belts, too. But we never left our solar system again.”

 
“Then one day, about thirty years ago, a strange space ship suddenly appeared above Trugo. Our people were thrown into a panic. No one knew what they wanted. As far as we knew, we were alone in the galaxy. The ship, using some crazy universal translator device, broadcast greetings to every government on our planet. They identified themselves as humans. They said they were friendly, that they were exploring the galaxy. When we asked them where they came from, they told us a planet called Earth – forty-five thousand light years away. We asked how long it took them to get here – how many generations had passed on their ship. We couldn’t believe their response. The trip from Earth to Trugo – all forty-five thousand light years, only took them a minute.”

 
Faish piped up, “It’s because they had wormhole drives. We learned about them in school last month. My teacher said that humans were crazy for creating a technology that let them rip holes in space, and then travel through them. But she also said they were very smart. No one else in the galaxy has ever figured out how to do it.”

 
Kiosho smiled. He was so proud of his granddaughter. She was so smart. “I thought I was telling you the story, Faish. Are you sure you don’t want to take over?” Kiosho teased, rubbing her forehead with the two thumbs on his left hand. “No? Ok, I’ll continue. After a few days of negotiating, they were given permission to land and meet with a delegation – a group, of our most important leaders and scientists.”

 
“I was working as an intern for Dr. Doro Fverig, the most influential physicist of the time, so I got to come along. The delegation gathered at Klolo Point spaceport. The doctor and the other important members all set at a large table, while we interns, attendants, and staff members were relegated to some seats along the walls of the conference room. Everyone was so nervous. The room was full of whispers and chatter. We had been briefed on how to interact with humans. We’d seen holos of what they looked like – so very different from us. Two eyes, two arms, five fingers on each hand with only one thumb. No chitinous horns, plates or ridges. Just smooth skin in varying colors. We knew that the males and females looked very different – males were typically taller, heavier, and bulkier. They sometimes grew hair on their faces as well as their head. Their females were smaller, sleeker and curvier, and only had hair on top of their heads. We were told that they liked to ‘shake hands’ as part of their greeting rituals. And that they like to bare their teeth in a ‘smile’ as part of a greeting.”

 
“It didn’t matter. When they first walked in, we stood there dumbstruck for a moment. The people they considered average height were a full head taller than our tallest representatives. They were almost twice our width on average, too. But, due to their lack of natural armor or defenses, their average male was only slightly heavier than any of us. The first time you see one of them smile and show you all of those strange flat white teeth, it’s unnerving. But once they started talking, it’s like someone filled the room with a sedative gas. We found their tone soothing. And they were so friendly, and polite. They masterfully engaged even the most difficult and standoffish members of our delegation. I was so wrapped up in the sight and sound of them, that I actually missed most of what they said. But I did hear them say something about having a surprise for us, as that made me curious.”

 
“That’s when you saw…, sorry eldron, I got excited. I didn’t mean to interrupt again,” Faish mimed locking her mouth parts, and looked back to Kiosho, waiting for him to continue.

 
“That’s ok, Faish. This is my favorite part of the story too,” Kiosho said sweetly. “Where was I? I think we had just sent half of the population to Kerefi?” Kiosho teased Faish, waiting for her to react. “No? Oh, right, we were meeting the humans for the first time.” He winked with his left eyes and carried on. “That’s when the door to the conference room opened again. It was like the atmosphere was sucked out of the room all at once. A few of the aides actually passed out. Because as we sat there, meeting these aliens, interacting with these humans, another group of beings walked into the conference room. Beings that looked exactly like us. They were the Grolnori that left for Kerefi. But we didn’t know that. We had forgotten. But they hadn’t. They still told stories of their home world, so far away, basically unreachable across the vastness of space. Their leader began talking, explaining how they had met the humans and formed an alliance with them. How they had given them the coordinates for Trugo, asking to be brought along – to be able to revisit their ancestral home.”

 
“It was about that time that I stopped listening again. Not because I found them boring. But because one of the visiting Grolnori caught my attention. She was apparently an aide or an intern like me, because she was at the back of the room, and didn’t speak. But she didn’t need to. She was the most beautiful being I had ever seen. Her plates glistened like stardrops, her eyes were the most beautiful pink I’d ever seen. I don’t think I heard another word of the meeting until it was adjourned – almost four hours later. Dr. Fverig had to throw a data chit at me to get my attention. I took the data cubes he wanted me carry and excused myself. I nearly got fired over that. He was so angry that I abandoned him. But I didn’t care. I walked over to the human delegation and carefully made my way to the being that had entranced me. I was so nervous I almost regurgitated. But I worked up my courage and introduced myself.”

 
“She was so friendly, and her voice curled its way around my ear membranes, sweet as javo nectar and as melodic as a plooko bug’s nightly call. I knew from that very moment that I had found the being I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. But, to hear your eldra tell it, she practically had to drag me to the joining ceremony three years later.” Kiosho looked over to Faish, who appeared to be sleeping peacefully. He quietly got up, put the chair back where it belonged, and crept to the door. He almost shut the door before remembering Vilo was lying on the bed and may want out during the night. Quietly, under his breathe, he said, “Good night my little heart.”

 
As he started to walk to his own bedroom he was interrupted. “Eldron, can I have some water, please?”"
d6h8cw,2,2019-09-19,Felling lost in CSC369 (St George),[deleted],UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/d6h8cw/felling_lost_in_csc369_st_george/,"How're you doing on this beautiful day you brilliant bastard?

So I'm taking CSC369 right now, and this is my first exposure to hard-core OS concepts. I wasn't one of the people who fancied learning too much about OS in my spare time a couple years ago but now I actually feel excited to be learning about them (because of my greater appreciation for hardcore CS things after 2 years of university).

However, my experience in the first couple weeks of classes has been...underwhelming. I frequently feel like I'm lost and can't quite follow Karen's explanations - which is bad because I feel like she's a very friendly prof who would have been excellent if only I could understand what she's saying. For instance yesterday we did an activity about file systems and inodes and I couldn't understand the simplest of things while everyone else around me finished it in no time

I've also applied for a couple internships and will be looking to get some PEY interviews in the coming weeks, so it'll only get busier for me in the coming days. 

Anyone here who felt the same way but did something to turn their experience around? Appreciate any suggestions. Also, anyone else feeling the same way or is it just me?"
d6hbfb,3,2019-09-19,Do you like giving advice to people with non-traditional backgrounds? Liberal Arts degree to social work experience to coding bootcamp to hopefully a final career. YOUR insight is welcome and appreciated!,HousePlantBinge,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/d6hbfb/do_you_like_giving_advice_to_people_with/,"Forgive me, I know there are 1,000 posts of liberal arts folks asking about career transitions. I, like probably most people who make these posts, just want some tailored advice if anyone is willing. 

A little background:

* I went to a college I can almost 100% guarantee no one has ever heard of. Student body less than 400, and exclusively a religious school during the time I attended; they have been branching out into some different majors since then, but overall they are the same. Not going to go into why I did it; it was a controlling parent thing. But the school is accredited and I graduated with honors and a 3.76 (some places round to 3.8 so that's why I include the extra digit).
* Since then I have discovered a love for finance, data, banking, and especially economics. I was a financial coach at a non-profit for a little over two years, which basically means I was acting as a social worker who focused on personal finance. 
* I made a career transition choice about 4 months ago to quit my job and work full-time learning data-science through a coding bootcamp (Flatiron). It's going well, and I'm learning so much. My plan was to get a job, leveraging this data science experience, that would offer tuition reimbursement and I would get a Master's in economics or public policy. 
* One roadblock is that, while the tech world may be relying less and less on experience and more on technical interviews, I don't see the same trend in the financial world, which apparently still cares quite a lot about your background. I didn't realize this until relatively recently. 

My dream jobs include central banking (Fed, ECB), humanitarian-finance work (IMF, World Bank, UN), or a similar international economic/labor think tank (OCED, ILO). These are pipe dreams, so I won't be crushed if I don't get a job at these specific places. My hope is to do something that matters, and that helps people, but is also intellectually stimulating. I could do one of these without the other, but it will always leave me unfulfilled, I believe. (I know the places I've listed aren't perfect, but I have my reasons, and I'd rather not discuss their flaws.)

I've always done well ay anything I've really tried hard for. I only say that to say that I'm confident that if I got an entry level job at any of these places, or somewhere else, I would eventually climb the ladder. I'm just trying to figure out where that first opportunity could come from.

I've considered a lot of things, but as time goes by it's narrowed down to trying to get an internship (yes I know you technically need to be in school for that, but I've gotten close to getting internships nonetheless) at a prestigious place like the Fed/large bank, or an entry level job at a less-known bank or even just something that involves finance.  

I'm also a pretty good networker and am good at building relationships. I've volunteered a lot and met some awesome people. A lot of people I've networked with really want to help me, and they have tried , and I've been so incredibly thankful for their help. But somehow something always comes up. I've gotten close to getting several career-changing opportunities where they like me, and I like them, but it still falls through. 

Nothing is beyond me right now. I would be a teller at a bank if I thought I could use that to be promoted internally. I would 100% clean toilets at the Fed if I could transition into something more cerebral down the line. Problem is, the probability of that kind of stuff working is pretty low. Not impossible, but unlikely. 

So my very drawn out question is: where do YOU think I should look for that little glimmer of an opportunity? What has worked for you, or people you know? Is there something you think I'm overlooking? I'm interested in so many things I cant even count, so if you're thinking about something you think may be relevant, I'm all ears. 

Thanks to all of you!"

Basically as the title states, I'm trying to figure out if this is an appropriate time for me to attempt to transition into the industry.

Last spring I graduated with my BS in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. My grades were average but I was able to acquire an internship during my Jr-Sr year summer doing basic help desk and deployment work for a large healthcare org. I also obtained a position as an Introduction to Computing lab assistant in which I helped first-year students learn how to program in Java. After graduation, I returned to the same company as a deployment support technician and am currently in this role.  My responsibilities have shifted more towards building out Windows 7 machines through our system management appliance, maintaining and upgrading servers, writing batch scripts to automate basic tasks and recently developed a system with Python to generate and store cable lock combinations.

Last week I obtained my Security+ certification and I am wondering if it's reasonable to try to obtain a better position in the security field. Please advise. Feel free to PM, I am looking forward to hearing all types of feedback. I also apologize if this is posted in the wrong place.

Question: does my current experience &amp; credentials qualify me for a job in information security?

I've always worked hard to be at the top, not because I have grit or because I'm a naturally hard worker, but because being not at the top is scary as hell to me.

For the most part, I've been rewarded for this type of thinking and behavior, as you might expect. The problem is that this way of thinking is killing me. I plunge headfirst into things that I know I'll hate just because I know it looks/sounds good, from internships to classes. I hate my school but I've stayed because of its reputation. I won't try new things that I think I'll like because I'm afraid I'll make a fool of myself. When I feel that I've impressed someone sufficiently, I'll start dropping the ball because I feel like I've already proven myself to them. And the list goes on.

And now that it's come time to graduate from college, it's painfully obvious that I could never be happy in any of the more ""prestigious"" jobs that I could pursue, but something in me is just so reluctant to ""settle"" for something that I'll enjoy more but that isn't as well-regarded or that makes significantly less money. At this point, it's only a little bit about impressing others - another big part of it is that a huge part of my self-image relies on being ""better"" than other people, even though I know logically that academic and professional success says nothing about a person's actual character.

I don't want to continue to live this way. I don't want to wake up in 20 years and realize I hate my life (i.e., have a ""second mountain"" moment). My ""ambition"" (read: narcissism) is eating me alive.

TLDR; how do I learn to be content with just being ""enough""?

Google's applications opened 3 days ago. Is there a balance I can strike between more preparation while still being considered 'early enough', or so I really just get in as soon as I can? Thanks."

At first the psychiatrist thought I had Auditory Processing Disorder. She told me that APD can sometimes be misdiagnosed as ADHD so she had me take one final assessment just to rule out whether it was APD or not. Turns out it wasn’t and the psychiatrist diagnosed me as ADHD-PI at the age of 22. I went back to my PCP after getting resources to help me understand more about my adhd. My PCP then prescribed me 20mg Adderall XR for a one month trial. I have been taking it 3 weeks so far and It seems to be working. However once I go back for my 1 month review, i’m going to ask if i can get the IR prescribed to me. The XR works fine but cuts off right up till noonish since i take my dose 7am.  

Overall My whole process was from 4/19-8/19 (5months) all due to the lack of me not remembering to make appointments and having to wait for that psychiatrist’s availability. Other than that I got diagnosed right before school. I went back this semester after being academically suspended for the 3rd time and I can say that I’m really doing well in all my classes. Plus landed this internship which has been amazing cus i literally do nothing major but getting paid for it. My experience has made me finally understand what was wrong with me and was given resources/tools that I got to help out with my adhd. It’s only been 3 weeks since i got prescribed and 5 weeks since diagnosed. I’m at a good start so far and hopefully I plan on keeping it that way."

Company A is a very prestigious company in the sector and the internship pay is twice that of Company B. Selecting this company will definitely be a boost to my resume. The pay is not as important to me (In my opinion).

However, Company B is not as prestigious as Company A (But still quite well known). However, they are known for grooming their Interns and extending their contracts too. 

The most important factor is that Company B is going to allocate me to a project that involves Machine Learning and Full Stack Development, while my role in A is supposedly as a backend engineer. I am specialized in ML and Data Science, and have a huge intererest in ML and Development, in which B suits me perfectly.

I’ve been having no luck. I had one of my judges reach out to some federal judges he knows, some AUSAs he knows, some connects in the DOJ, and some people in the AG of my state. I’ve also used my previous connections to try the same (for example, my father knows the current state elected AG, they went to high school together) 

My school’s career services office is a joke, but I’ve kept in touch to work the connections and done as they’ve asked (resume update, networking event, etc)

I’ve used my schools job bank, indeed, my state’s bar association employment site, my state’s government employment site, and Craigslist. 

I’m asking here if there are any good resources that people know of to look for jobs and/or any good resources to apply to non-litigatory jobs. 

Also, by taking that county court clerkship, have I screwed myself from working higher up in the state? The fed? Anywhere?

Apologies for another chanceme post. I will be graduating soon (from a small university) with a bachelor's degree in computer science and a master's thesis in high energy physics. Now, I'm drawn towards studying at the intersection of AI, cognitive science and neuroscience which happened after I did some ML research in a computational neuroscience lab (specifically reinforcement learning). I figured computational cognitive science would be a good fit (please let me know if you happen to know about any other field which matches my interests). I'd like to apply to PhD programs in the US (as an international applicant) for fall 2020 and some in Europe and would like to know if anyone here with a similar background got into those programs. My profile:

\- 8.6/10 GPA with coursework in computer science, AI/ML, physics (and some bio &amp; chem, guess might be useful in neuroscience). Research and master's thesis in high energy physics (computationally focused). A publication in high energy physics (reputed journal). Some projects in AI as well.

\- A summer research internship in reinforcement learning in a computational neuroscience lab. Before that, another internship in a high energy physics lab. PIs in both the labs are well known (if it affects the application). Currently working in an AI lab with a focus on RL and probabilistic and symbolic reasoning.

\- LoRs: One pretty strong from my thesis advisor, can't say much about others but they will surely be positive. One of the recommenders is well-known in computational neuroscience and AI/ML.

\- GRE: Yet to appear but expecting 320+.

I'm having doubts on myself and would like to know where I am lacking and what can I do to improve on it. Let me know if anyone needs further clarification on anything else. Many thanks!"

I am research master of economics student, during my bachelor I took two courses about R and I have two short internship experience(each of them was 2 months) and my responsibilities can be considered as 'data analyst' who uses R. During the first year of the master I took three econometrics courses in which we focused on linear regression, logistic regression, time series and panel data.

This year, I will take two data science courses in which we go through Elements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical Learning books, plus I will also take two micro-econometrics courses, one is theoretical and the other is applied.

When I was younger I was bullied a lot. I was skinny and admittedly a bit weird, but I don't think I deserved what I got. This lasted 7 years, and I got depressed over it. I made 2 attempts on my life in that time by rope. Then I moved school and things got better, I managed to get a girlfriend too and I was taking care of my health, but was still skinny. I loved her a lot, but it took me too long to realise that she was a manipulator who totally lacked empathy. I learned this when I started uni and she started shagging her co-worker directly after our breakup. 
The breakup seemed easy for her, but I had all my emotions invested. I didn't trust anyone like I trusted her and I hated myself and her for what happened.
I went back into depression, started cutting and made the decision to leave uni as I wasn't enjoying it anyway and felt worthless being so expensive toy parents. I decided to make a career through a different route.

I came home but I was still messed up. I made 2 further attempts on my life by slashing my left wrist and other vessels and sitting in a warm bath. There was a lot of blood both times, but I lived again. 4 months later I had gotten out of my depressive, dark chapter and I looked I to work. I had good grades as I had always worked hard in school which let me get an internship in accountancy. I love it, I work with great people and my work has great variety. So now, overall 7 moths from my breakup, I'm happy for what feels like the first time in over 10 years, and I love it.
I should also mention that this whole time, what kept me going all this time was bodybuilding. I gained 24kg from my old skinny self and when I had nothing and noone, I still had that.


So now for the situation, I'm happy now, I have friends, I have a great job with future prospects, I'm very fit and take care of myself, don't smoke, drink responsibly, and overall in this position I feel extremely lucky to have almost thrown it all away, but still have everything.
However, the years of bullying and isolation, whilst in a single sex school means I now just don't know what to do with girls, and I'm not in a position where I regularly interact with new people. 

So, Reddit, how can I catch my meeting and flirting skills so I don't work myself lonely till 30?"

Also, is Django relevant if I like Python?",workthrowaway4000,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d73lp2/junior_dev_not_doing_big_feature_work_does_that/,"Hello. I'm a junior software dev a few months into a first role. It seems like I'm mostly bouncing around projects right now, but leaning towards DevOps stuff.  

Quick question about that - As an intern, I built ya know projects and stuff. Or completed big feature tickets. However, right now I'm doing small like maintaince things. Clean this up, extend some functionality, integrate something. I'd say it's real dev, but no big ticket resume items. How do you sell that on a resume?

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the title - I enjoy Python. I'm mostly a fan of API dev in general and honestly it's not complicated enough to where I can't figure it out in any language.  

However, I have limited time. I want to work on some big project and learn Jenkins, build out an API, I need SQS, I want to fuck around with HA in AWS, CFT, whatever. A lot of this is Python, but Django is awesome to me. However, it seems like career options are limited.  

Should I just learn Nodejs even though honestly I low key don't enjoy JS at all. I gotta build a front end and forcing myself to learn react makes me want to shoot myself. Java I don't mind. Build process and whatnot all feels ass, but whatever.

Looking for an open ended discussion on how to spend my weekends trying to advance my skills in a good direction. Don't wanna go do Django and learn Jenkins and build out a CI CD pipeline for myself if it's useless for applying for jobs eventually and I shoulda learned full stack JS lol"

I'm currently a student at the University of Texas at Austin studying mathematics with a certificates in computer science and statistics, but I really want to attend graduate school for a computer science or mechanical/industrial engineering masters and hopefully enter the data science/software industry after graduation.

The problems I've been having so far are that I do not have any internship experience, and I will be graduating in either December 2020 or May 2021. I hope to get some research experience through the math department and learn some more programming in the my free time so that I can work on some projects. I also feel like I have a mediocre GPA (3.35) and tried to transfer into the engineering/CS departments at UT but got rejected, so I'm now trying to go to graduate school for these fields. I'm hoping to raise this GPA to a 3.5+ in my remaining semesters here, but I think it will be quite hard since I have only math/computing/statistics classes to take (currently taking two math/two stats classes right now) and those classes take up a lot of time.

So, the advice I'm looking for is should I focus more on classes and get letters of rec for masters programs or projects/research? I'm trying my best to focus on more applied math/stats classes, but my lack of experience is hurting me. Also, am I out of luck for getting into some good/decent graduate programs with some funding? What is realistic for me? Any advice would be appreciated!"

They’ve sent me all over the world. Up until the last year I had truly enjoyed working there. In the 4 years I’ve been there my supervisor, and 2 bosses above that have changed, numerous people I work with have either left or been fired.

Idk how to make small talk, how to talk to distant relatives, or how to make conversation fun unless I'm drunk. Actually, the only way I truly feel comfortable in social situations is when I'm drinking (which is infrequent, don't worry).

I just feel so ashamed of where I'm at, at my age and am embarrassed. When I think about what a potential partner, all I can think is there's no way anyone will want to be with me because of the way I am. My social anxiety and anxiety, in general. is so bad that my independence is nonexistent, and I rarely leave the house or do anything on my own. This is what makes me not feel like an adult...

However, I've always learned to adapt and work around my SA. For example, I got a good job (that's remote), I figured out a way to get a dream (remote) internship, AND I'm able to finish my college online. This is why I rarely leave the house. I also still live with my parents, so I really don't have to worry about bills or anything. Also, I actually do have friends, but we don't get to go out much because we are all broke.

So, here's the thing that got me thinking about all this: Tomorrow is my cousin's wedding and I am anticipating seeing a lot of distant relatives that I rarely see. I was always quiet around them anyway, but just feel nervous going to this wedding because now that I'm not a kid anymore, I feel like I need to impress them. I just simply don't know how to make conversation with people I'm not comfortable with and don't know anything about them. I also feel like I will just cling to my parents and grandparents since I dont really know anyone else there, and that I'll look like a freak. Another thing, when I'm nervous, my mind goes completely blank! So when someone asks me to explain what I do, etc., I feel like I won't explain it well enough or have the right things to say. 

How do I come across as a functioning adult at this wedding and in general?"

I  am research master of economics student in one of the leading universities in Europe, during my bachelor I took two  courses about R and I have two short internship experience(each of them  was 2 months) and my responsibilities can be considered as 'data  analyst' who uses R. During the first year of the master I took three  econometrics courses in which we focused on linear regression, logistic  regression, time series and panel data. Hence, I believe that my  econometrics knowledge and background are good.

In the second year, I will take two data science courses in which we go through  Elements of Statistical Learning and Introduction to Statistical  Learning books, plus I will also take two micro-econometrics courses, one is theoretical and the other is applied.

So,  do you think that this background is enough for being data scientist? I  believe that I should experience more in the application aspect,  especially for coding. What should I do more in order to survive in the  industry? Do I need learn Python, my opinion is that improving my R skills will be more efficient than learning Python from knowing nothing, is this true? 

Your comments and suggestions are more than welcomed and very  valuable for me..

Thank you."

I have been working on my Bachelors in Bioinformatics since 2016, and it looks like I am going to complete it by the end of Spring or Summer 2020. 

I guess my ideal “end game” would be the career my Mother has, who has spent her life working her way first into Project Management for Big Pharma oncology studies, and is now a project director for clinical research into new types of cancer treatment. The pay for a position such as this is close to or over $200K.

However, my Mother was a far better student than I ever have been or will be, and had perfect grades and a prestigious instructional name behind her degree that landed her internships and entry level positions in her field.

I am struggling with finding a relevant entry level position I can even apply into, and I am working as a Barback/Barista in an Italian Restaurant in The West Village. I make $24/hour, which is far better money I have made previously in jobs back in New Jersey, where you can expect to make about $10/hr anywhere you go.

At this point, I resent my work environment and responsibilities, I live in an area with a lot of hyper-privileged people around my age (Wall Street), who obviously either have completed their degrees and have professional positions or are funded by their parents so they can work unpaid internships. When I’m at work in the Village, I’m serving the same type of people I will see when I walk home into my apartment building and it stings, but I need the money and I can’t figure out how to break into an entry level position.

I need a way out for the sake of my sanity. There is obviously nothing wrong with working service and I applaud those who can do It for years but I’ve done it for about 6 months now and I can’t stand it. Literally any job where I make the same money but don’t have to abuse my body and mind to make it would be better.

I have tried applying into data entry, administrative assistant, and mail room type positions but I may not be looking into the right places. I’m wondering if there’s an industry an aspiring data scientist can get into that pays above minimum wage. 

My hirable skills include:
-C++ proficiency 
-Java and JS proficiency 
-Perl Knowledge
-Customer Service/(Client Relations)
-Ability to upskill
-protein structure analysis

I am wondering if there’s essentially something I’m missing here, I hate coming home sweaty and exhausted, having terrible hours, and not knowing how much I will make from week to week based on how many hours I’m given.

Thank you, and sorry for the thesis."

d7gbr8,2,2019-09-21,Engineering Co-op vs. Finding your own Internship,peregrin5,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/d7gbr8/engineering_coop_vs_finding_your_own_internship/,"So I applied and was accepted into an engineering co-op program. It will basically be a year of experience at a company the co-op program chooses for you. One of the reasons I applied was because it sounded like the program was well established and that I would be put to work instead of being relegated to a corner or something twiddling my thumbs. Also it's more of a sure thing, so I wouldn't have to stress about getting an internship in my last two years. It's also well paid.

However some of the people I talked to said I would have been better off finding my own internship, because I might be placed at a company doing things I'm not that interested in (I know I would like to work in particular field). I mostly took the plunge because I didn't want to be stressed looking for an internship and failing to get one in my last two years, but these people were saying that I wouldn't have had a problem finding internships because of my grades and experience. I'm not sure though as I've already been rejected from a few opportunities that I was really hoping to get.

Also when I was applying for the co-op program, they made it sound like people who drop the co-op will get black-listed from all the companies who are members of the co-op program. I don't know if they explicitly stated this, but it sounded implied, and they were really trying to put the fear in us to either fully commit or don't."

d7ji4p,1,2019-09-21,Sophomore looking for advice on ECs (&amp; summer programs),brookelikesbooks,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/d7ji4p/sophomore_looking_for_advice_on_ecs_summer/,"Hi guys! I'm a (female) sophomore looking for some pointers on how to find EC opportunities/develop my ECs. I'm doing well academically, but I'm a little late in starting meaningful ECs as I didn't realize their importance until recently. This meant I didn't get to explore and try things out freshman year- that's why I'm trying to figure it out now! I've never been particularly drawn to one subject matter/field, and I'm not really into sports/music/etc. I'm interested in politics/government and I write a lot in my free time, but I only recently started exploring these interests. I'm also interested in business, but I haven't done anything to explore that so far.

Freshman year I did pretty generic activities:

\-Key Club (50+ hours of community service)

\-Frosh cheerleading team (10 hours a week)

\-Taking extra gymnastics/cheer classes (2-3 times a week)

\-Volunteering at a local animal shelter (2 hours every weekend)

\-CSF (California Scholarship Federation)

I've been continuing these activities this year so far with a couple differences; I'm now on the JV cheer team (time commitment is now about 15 hours a week) and I haven't decided if I want to do Key Club again since it's such a generic club. I enjoy doing community service, but lots of people have told me I should just devote the time to a specific cause rather than Key Club. I don't think I'm going to do cheer junior/senior year because it takes up a lot of my time and I'm not super passionate about it- I mainly joined because I did cheer for a year when I was younger, and it's fulfilling my school's two year PE requirement.

Additional activities I've started this year so far:

\-Started my own blog over summer (I only have about 10 followers, and I haven't focused in on a specific topic to write about, but I do post consistently)

\-YMCA Youth and Government - model legislature and court where we debate bills and model the government (meets weekly, but there's a couple weekend long conferences with other delegations)

\-Spanish National Honors Society - (basically a Spanish club but had requirements to get in: being in Spanish 3 or above, all As/Bs in Spanish courses) 

\-Member of the editorial staff for a teen literary magazine (it's called Polyphony Lit and anyone can apply for a position, you should check it out!) - I'm the lowest rank of staff as a new member, so I just read submissions and offer feedback/my opinion

\-Member of my school's yearbook staff (counts as a class period/elective)- I'm mainly going to be writing copies, but I'll also be designing some pages

\-Member of a local leadership/volunteer committee that has monthly meetings and various events with the goal of helping underprivileged families in our area

\-Peer tutoring in my school's history center once or twice a week at lunch (mainly in the subject of AP Human Geo since that's the history-related class I took last year)

I've definitely upped my game since last year and I'm diving deeper into some interests, but I go to a fairly competitive public high school where everyone seems to be involved in tons of amazing organizations/clubs/activities; most of these activities are somewhat competitive and it's difficult to get leadership positions or get involved unless you're popular/friends with the current leaders in the club/activity. 

Side note- I wanted to try out for my school's mock trial team, but I decided against it because it was a huge time commitment and the competitions would have conflicted with Youth and Government events. As far as activities I'm still considering getting involved in, here's a few (please offer your opinions on what would be good for me to try!):

\-School clubs more tailored to my interests -my school has around 80 active clubs so it's overwhelming for me to figure out to join. The clubs I'm currently considering are JSA, FBLA, Amnesty International, the school literary magazine club, National English Honors Society, Speech &amp; Debate, UNA-USA, Young Entrepreneurs Society, and Young Investors Society. Obviously I am not going to join all of these, but I'm torn on which ones to join since they all relate to my current main interests. I want to figure out which ones will be the best fit for me so I can commit to them for the rest of high school, since I'll already be a year late in joining/being able to work my way up into a potential officer position.

\-Company program- My school partners with Junior Achievement to help any kids interested in starting their own companies. I think this is technically a club, but it's sponsored by our career education office so it's a little bit different and more of a serious commitment than a club. However, I don't really have any company ideas... the advisor said lots of people come into it without ideas, but I'm not sure if I would be able to come up with a genuinely good business idea even with brainstorming.

\-Internship- I contacted a county government official that's kind of a family friend, and he said I could intern with him whenever I have the time. I definitely want to take this opportunity, but I can't until cheer season is over.

\-Dual enrollment classes at my local community college- A lot of kids at my high school do this, and I thought it sounded really cool since you can get college credit and it's a way to take classes in topics that interest me/that aren't offered at school.

\-Summer programs- it's pretty far in advance, but I was wondering if summer programs would be worth it for someone like me who doesn't have a specific career focus/direction. I know a lot of the most prestigious programs are for juniors, so that's a limitation; also, I've heard of a few prestigious writing programs (Iowa, Kenyon, etc.) but I don't think I'm at the level of writing that those programs expect. I mainly write for fun- I've had a couple of poems win local-ish contests, but nothing major. I also was thinking a leadership seminar/conference/program might be a good idea as I can be kind of shy/awkward with people and would like to improve my public speaking and leadership skills. I know it's important to continue exploring your interests in the summer, and I figured I would start looking for opportunities early since I'm very indecisive and will need the time to figure out the logistics.

I'm sorry for rambling, I know this was really long. Basically, I've read about all these people having unique and intriguing extracurriculars that they're passionate about with lots of leadership roles, and I would love some advice on how I can get on the right path to do something similar. I haven't ever had a leadership role in anything, and I would like to find some activities that I can really enjoy and get super involved in/get leadership roles in. I know it probably sounds like I've joined a lot of random activities and am spreading myself a little thin already, but it's just because I want to explore and I'm not sure how much is too much/what I should try.

Thank you in advance for any advice you may have!"

d7jz1x,1,2019-09-21,[New grad question] What should my goal be?,throwawaycs2020,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d7jz1x/new_grad_question_what_should_my_goal_be/," Hey all \~ existential crisis I am dealing with; tl:dr at the bottom. Thanks for your help!  


I am a recent graduate applying to fulltime jobs now, and somehow I got very existential during this search. I am very thankful to have gone through a university with a built-in intern program and have had multiple internships, including gigs at Microsoft, and Google, in SWE roles. I have so many companies I dream of working fulltime for, including the two that I mentioned, as well as other ""unicorns"", however when I think about it... I really don't know if this kind of ""chase the prestige and total comp"" goal I should be chasing anymore.  


All of these companies have very smart engineers, they all have great pay and benefits... However, I am not sure if I will land on a team that I will like to be around, or a product I am really passionate for. I have had experiences where the team I was on really affected how much I liked my job, and as an extrovert being around people I enjoy working with is very important for me.  


If I am on a product I am passionate about, I will not be making much impact because I am a) a total newbie still as a new grad with only intern experience, and b) will probably be at too big a company to make these changes.I have thought a lot about joining startups, however I feel that I am not passionate about a lot of their ideas, and it is easy to have poor leadership at a startup who does not follow the best coding practices, or at least definitely won't have time for any kind of mentorship. I really value learning from more experienced and smarter engineers who can take their time to help with questions getting ramped up, although I do also put emphasis on self-driven learning.  


The other option is midsized companies, but even those are growing very fast. Stripe is becoming more large-scale, recently worth more than AirBnB. The other great midsize company that comes to mind is Brex.  


Overall, I am not sure what I should be striving for now. I am very fortunate, and in my opinion a lot of luck was involved, that I was able to intern at these great companies, and other smaller companies that had great engineering teams too. The whole ""go for prestige and TC"" thing, I feel will get kind of old... Should I optimize for learning from very smart people? Focus on the team vs the company? Or should I ignore my instincts and risk it all on a startup?  


I think I would really enjoy being able to be on the first team of 10-20 ppl to build something, as a life goal. Like the OG Chrome, Instagram, or LinkedIn teams. However, I don't think I have the know-how to do these kind of engineering feats quite yet, and honestly, I do not feel creative enough. Is there a career path I can take to meet this objective?  


tldr: new grad \[me\] interns at big companies, and is thinking \[rather spoiled-ly\] ""is there all that is?"" New grad debates going for startups with very little mentorship and high risk, vs big companies and just riding TC and dealing with teammates they may not find ideal. New grad thinks about midsized companies, but claim few match their passion. New grad asks experienced folks (you guys!) what they should aim for: learning? impact? New grad's dream is to be part of a founding team that builds a great new product, but also knows this is kind of wishful thinking.  


Thanks for your time!"

Credit wise, I am a Junior.  I took a lot of common core while in High School, so all my core are complete HOWEVER I'm technically a sophomore due to this being my second year in college.  Due to this, I feel like I have to be on my A-game and start to get internships because experience in the field is extremely important!  Now, this is where my ""drama"" starts, unlike the majority of my peers that brags about knowing three languages and having prior experience, I feel as if I'm bearly a master of the one lanague (Java) that we went over.  I fear that I am not ready for an internship simply because I lack the skill set to function in the real world and fear that I would get fired.

This is when someone asked me if taking a semester off from school and doing coding bootcamps would help me gain confidence and learn more languages.  I don't think that it's a bad idea, but I worry that taking a semester off from school might hurt me more than help me since I'm more likely to forget information from my previous classes.

So instead of solving this problem by myself, I turn to Reddit and to people who know better than me.

&amp;#x200B;

Should I jump straight into internships or take some time off and go to coding bootcamps?"
d7mfln,5,2019-09-22,"I graduate next year and I'm very scared about job prospects. Looking for advice on big vs. small companies, Private vs. public sector, and a few other things.",NoBrightSide,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d7mfln/i_graduate_next_year_and_im_very_scared_about_job/,"So I will graduate with an Applied Math degree (picked the wrong major).  My programming experience comes from taking a few programming courses, doing several software projects, and doing a software internship this past summer.  Now, my goal is to work as a  low level developer (C/C++).  At my internship (unpaid), the company was a start-up and I feel like I learned a lot on my own however I also feel that I did not accomplish much and that I was mistreated due to the fact that I wasn't paid and was coming in with a weaker software background.  I also did not really receiving any mentoring.

Now, I don't think that this internship is representative of the industry culture.  I will be applying to basically every position I can find.  I'm curious as to how a big company differs in terms of the experience you gain compared to working for a small/start-up company.  

Since I'm at the beginning of my career, should I aim for a big or a small company if I want to rapidly build my experience/career?  Maybe this is a stupid thing to say but I don't think I will be paid  much money at the start because 1) I have very little experience 2) I don't have a CS/engineering degree.

Next question: Is it a bad idea to start at a private sector for this career if my goal is to quickly gain as much experience as I can?  

Final question:  Before I left my internship, manager said I could work there after I graduate (nothing is in writing so its not concrete).  Should I pursue this as a last resort, considering that my experience at the internship was not so good?  My issue wasn't the technical aspect.  It was more of how people mistreated me there.  Additionally, I know they would pay me less than the standard for entry-level.    

Do I really have to go to the Bay area for the best career growth?  I'm really looking for jobs in Southern California.  I will not be able to afford the cost of living in NorCal.  

At the end of it all, I'm really just making sure that I'm making the right steps to develop my career."

I was originally going to post this in /r/college but decided that posting here would have more relevant and helpful information. Please feel free to contribute either your own experiences and/or advice to me if you choose to do so at all. Also, I apologize if this type of question gets thrown around a lot - I only searched for threads specific to my potential choices beforehand.

Here's my current situation **(tl;dr at bottom):**

I recently entered a large university studying Biological Sciences with the hopes of becoming a Field Biologist/Researcher. However, not only am I struggling in my Chemistry and Math courses, I am also 1 year behind the classes I'm supposed to be taking on my major map. I really wish this was simply a self-esteem issue or a laziness factor but I have been routinely asking the professors questions, trying to understand the material, and staying in the library until 11:00 and have still been failing my exams and getting poor marks on coursework. It seems that I just don't have the chops to succeed in the scientific field; also, I've heard from multiple sources that unless you're super passionate about research (p word, I know, bit it's got a kernel of truth to it with the Bio undergrad job market being what it is. I'm interested but not passionate) it's a bad idea to take that route. As much as I hate to give up and quit, it may be for the best.

I'm a person who believes you shouldn't always major in what you're passionate about but rather what you're good at so you can contribute to yourself, your family, society, and/or the world at large (pretty idealistic, I know.) For me that's writing which, luckily, happens to be both.

The only problem lies in the fact that English... doesn't exactly translate well to finding a high-paying job, ESPECIALLY right out of college. I have no illusions towards it. I do have a plan, though. *Double major in Linguistics and Secondary Education* \- there's a lot of overlap between the two since they're both BA degrees. Take that extra time and use it to *get certified in areas such as Translation, Applied Computing (basic programming), Technical Communications (tech writing), and TESOL, as well as to learn foreign languages* (am currently looking at *Russian and German*.) *Internships* and finding a *study abroad/one-to-multiple semester-long transfer programs* are also top priorities. After school, *teach English in a less-popular European country -* most likely *somewhere in East Europe* (and IIRC teaching English out west isn't like in E.Asia where they hire virtually any white alumni, you have to have a degree specific to teaching. Even a certificate won't cut it.) After I decide to leave... I don't know yet but I'll figure it out. This route won't make me money but it's solid from what I can tell.

**tl;dr Freshman in Biology that's struggling with intro-level courses despite putting in time and effort, thinking about switching to a double major at something ""useless"" but that I'm good at (Linguistics+Secondary Ed), want to teach English for a few years overseas in a European country, am wondering what my prospects in the job market will be post-teaching if I invest the extra time I have into getting hard skill and language certs/minors while still in uni**

Has anybody else taken a route similar to this? Again, I would be grateful to hear any experiences people have had or any advice wrt my pathway."

I'm on mobile.

Some backstory and important details:

I interned for this company last summer. Got an offer the last day of my internship. There are raises (up to 5%) between rotations and after you finish the program and take your ""official job."" All summer I heard you can't negotiate the salary because it's a rotational program. Last week I found out one of the people in my program was able to negotiate and get a salary roughly 5k more than mine (they didn't intern). This person has a degree similar to me (BS in CS, I have a BS Engineering degree in CS &amp; Engineering, basically CS and CE). The other people in our program dont have CS degrees but do have similar tech degrees (information systems and stuff). I feel like since I have a more technical degree and this person is getting paid 5k more then I should also get that 5k more. I don't know how to bring this up. Or if it's just too late. 

For the record, I absolutely love the company. The culture is unlike the culture of other companies I've interned with and have researched about. There's great benefits here and amazing flexibility with working remote and taking time off and stuff. This program is also going to give me amazing experience for future employment (like 3 different roles in just 2 years). So I don't want to leave the company right now. 

Any advice and help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Have any of you ever felt like you just weren't cut to be an engineer? 

While in uni I always thought that I would make it in this career. I did relatively well in classes (making As and Bs). However I have never done too well and struggled whenever doing the actual engineer work. I have had three internships and I feel like I didn't do too well in any of them. I have been an EE for 3 years and still feel the same. Both managers and coworkers have commented that I am doing well, I know that I haven't. I am constantly making mistakes and not learning as quick as I should. I have lapses in judgement, unable to make decisions, easily forget things, and sometimes losing sight of big picture thus causing mistakes in the low level design. My quality of work is also poor. It's difficult to compare with others in my group due to experience gap and their work quality is much better (some have been here 30+ years and next guy with least experience has been here 10ish years). I'm extremely lucky to be in the group that i am in (R&amp;Dish kind of group) because i know if i were in any kind if group, i would have been fired pretty early on due to the lack of production. 
I will admit however that i cause this to myself by working slow, procrastinating the more important work needed to be done, and lolly gagging around so it may be morecof a discipline problem throughout my internships and job.

Has anyone else ever been in same position or feel the same?"

I'm 25 and have been a part time HR intern for about 7 months now. I applied to a full time benefits coordinator position that I really want, and I made it to the second interview. Will be finding out tomorrow if I got it or not. I had a really good feeling during my first interview, but during the second interview they seemed kind of disinterested. I wasn't asked any personal questions, they didn't talk about pay or giving notice :/

I literally constantly freak out about what I'm doing with my life. My HR intern job is part time and I've been working part time at my parents restaurant for 10 years this October. I feel so stuck. I did really well in college (3.93 GPA) but graduated in 2015 with a degree I didn't want to pursue (biochemistry). My plan was to go to med school but once I learned more about it I decided not to proceed. I think I might want to go to dental school, but am worried about that being the wrong decision and giving up on it too. I can't get a lab job anymore because of how long I've been out of school.

My 23 year old brother who still hasn't graduated college has a full time career job at a great company. I was the one who was supposed to have my shit together, and I just feel like such a failure everyday, and like I'm too smart to be this stupid.

Anyone who's been here and turned it around?"

d7xlnt,1,2019-09-22,Media Analyst to Finance (Help!),gi2bull,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/d7xlnt/media_analyst_to_finance_help/,"I'm seriously considering a job change over to the finance industry and I'd like some help getting some direction with where to start.

I graduated last summer with my degree in quantitative economics from a big state school in the midwest. My GPA isn't great, but coupled with an interest in data and being the only undergraduate student to win a university-wide hack-a-thon, it was alright enough to get me an internship with an Ad-tech company in NYC. Though it was pitched as a tech-internship most of what we did there was focused on digital campaign strategy.

After the internship I was more hell-bent on staying in the city than anything else so I began applying to any position that required elementary data analysis skills.

This led me to finding work at a media agency as a data analyst. More specifically, my job is to write queries in SQL to mine individuals and then pass them into our proprietary modelling process powered by R. The amount of statistics you need to know for this job is elementary statistical modelling, and an understanding of basic machine learning algorithms (CHAID decision trees, regression modelling, etc.). The amount of programming knowledge you need to have is mainly writing complex queries in SQL, some minor data transformation in Python, and occassionally adjusting method parameters in R.

However, after about a year into the job I find that I just can't stand the day to day anymore. It's become increasingly apparent that I just settled into this job because it was safe as opposed to finding a career in an industry that I actually care about.

With that said, I've reached out to some of my friends in finance over the past few months (mainly structured finance analysts) and from what they've said it seems like something that I'd really like seriously consider.

Now for some quick stats about myself, aka what I'm working with:

* Can't remember anything from my finance classes in college
* Can't remember most things from my accounting classes in college
* Most of college was spent with a focus on statistics, macroeconomic theory, history, data analysis and web-development (it was a phase that ended up becoming my minor)
* Pretty okay at mathematics (Calculus 3, Linear Algebra), but am by no means exceptional
* I consider myself a very fast learner especially when it comes to understanding systems and languages
* No banking experience

Despite having an analytics heavy background, what I really like about the sound of finance is the interpretation of financial statements, researching markets, and being able to put together reports with your findings. Seeing the big picture by piecing together clues like financial statements and domain knowledge of whatever assets you specialize in just seems to be the challenge that I crave. I know code is useful to some departments, but it would be great to work in structured finance.

I also really just want to learn from someone. I like to learn and while advertising is a space that doesn't really seem to change all that much (in my opinion), finance sort of requires you to learn all kinds of things from all kinds of people. I love to listen, read, and piece things together.

What I've been told is that I should pursue the CFA charter and see how I feel after taking the first exam, but I'd like to break into the industry sooner rather than later. Others have told me that with my industry experience I should be looking into TMT analyst jobs. What jobs should I be looking at/applying for? What should I be focusing on the most right now? Should I be focusing on passing the level 1 CFA? Should I be focusing on networking my way into the industry (really struggling with this, been cold messaging people on Linkedin)? How does one break into the finance industry in NYC?

Any help is appreciated really."

I originally planned to move to Denver with my brother in March. Reason being is so I could work any random job and make a little more money. I know people discriminate against people who don’t have local addresses so I was thinking about waiting till after I move in March to apply to jobs. When I move out there, I’d get any random job and start looking for a tech job.

I was talking to a friend tonight who gave me some advice. I’m currently doing an internship this semester. He told me that I should just apply to places in Denver right after graduating and fly out for interviews. He told me that if I take a noncareer job after graduating it will set me back. That it will be something that I’ll have to explain.

So I’m thinking about following the advice. Put my brothers Denver Address on my resume and fly out for interviews. 

I wanted to wait to save some money, but if I just apply to jobs and move after I get hired to an actual tech job then it doesn’t matter. I just thought it would be better to move out there first and applying while I work at any job to pay rent.

Will the break and working a noncareer job hurt me, and would it be in my best interest to apply to job while out of state and fly in for interviews??"

So I told them I wanted to study 2 classes that I needed finished this trimester along with my internship. They said it was completely fine to do so and I was happy. Then I got an email from the coordinator saying that their higher ups contacted them saying I can’t do those 2 classes because the first one of the 2 is a prerequisite for the 2nd class and I am not allowed to study them together.

d86mxx,8,2019-09-23,For those who moved right after college. How did you do it? Advice?,ArAMITAS,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/d86mxx/for_those_who_moved_right_after_college_how_did/,"So Im graduating this fall and I’m doing an internship this semester.

Here  was my plan: my brother lives in Denver. I was going to work any job till March and then drive to Denver and take another random job to just  get me enough to pay rent. Then once I was out there I was going to  start applying to actual career jobs.  I’ve heard that people discriminate against people without local  addresses, so I thought it would be easier to just move out there and  work at a Target, be a waiter, or whatever. Then apply for jobs in my  career. Id wait till march to save more money and avoid the worst of the winter.

But... I talked a friend  tonight who gave me some advice. He said it would look bad to have a  break like that, that I would have to explain it. That it could set me  back. He suggested I use my  brothers address on my resume and fly out for interviews.  That As soon  as I graduate that I should start applying to jobs in my career and be  prepared to fly.

That makes sense,  but thats betting that I’d have the time to fly back, get my car and  drive all the way from FL to Denver for my first day of work. Also  I don’t see how I could start applying until after I graduate, because  they will have to see that I’m attending a Florida college and my  internship is in Florida....

So the goal is to get to Denver and work in my career field.  Btw, my degree is in IT. The only  experience in IT I have is my degree and this internship.

I’m dead set on moving to Denver, it’s just a matter of what’s the best way for me to get out there...

Whats  the typical way people do this after college anyways, haha. I mean it  seems to be a common thing for people to do.

So, for those who did move right after college -  how did you do it? Advice? Did you just stay put and apply until you got something. Did you work a job outside of your career while waiting to land a job? did you apply while in your last semester and how?? Should I be worried about people not hiring me becuase of my location and also will it be a negative if I take a noncareer job and have a several month break? Aren't they going to wonder why I didnt start applying right after college If I move out their in March?"

Guess I was pretty lucky (or maybe unfortunate), but i got job as Data Architect as my first job straight from school.

I was intern in this company in IT security and managed to spoof fingerprint sensor on iphones, samsungs, huawei (gotta say the head of IT security wasnt so happy that I managed to do it) and it was also subject of my bachelor thesis. So I made some impression and there was this new department forming and the boss from the department took me for interview and said he would hire me as Data Architect. Name sounded good, data always interested me, so I thought to myself, why not.

Oh boy. I was promised there will be some senior that will give me a bit headstart how the things go and what to study. Well, lets just say there was one guy, that left after 4 months and he had no clue how to do it.

I started a bit self learning only to figure out that if you want to do real good data architecture, you need to know so many data topics etc. And some projects started rolling in and im quite overwhelmed right now and not sure what to do.

Right now Im trying to soak up DAMA book into me, its about 600 A4 pages, but I just dont get the time, I have to work overtime, because sometimes i miss the proper knowledge etc.

The money is quite good for position straight out from school. Im just getting little burned out right now (9 months in).

Any help with some nice courses that could give me a bit more headstart. Hell, even some youtube videos if you know are some good source. Im trying to watch some dataversity courses, they are sometimes for me around 1-3am so im not so fresh for work next day, but I really want this job. 

I just wrote it fresh from my mind, so hopefuly this makes sense, if there will be any questions, ill try to answer some.

thanks!"

I'm studying to be a nurse. Already finished the biggest part. Only have to pass 2 internships.
I have a really hard time doing them because of my ADHD and anxiety. I am so afraid to do something wrong, and I already failed 2 internships mostly because of that. I can't handle the stress anymore, am so afraid to fail again. And that is why I am failing it again.
I am 100% sure I am and will be a good nurse. During vacation I did the same job as I would do when graduated and everything was going fine. But now school is started again and I just broke.
Today I had a meeting and my manager said that this way I will never finish. My adhd is in the way and maybe I have to stop with my study. 
I am devastated and don't know what to do. This is the one and only thing I want and can do. 
I just feel numb and feel like my whole life is falling apart.
And I know I'll have to talk to my bf and/or parents but I just can't. They never understood the problems I have because of adhd (and anxiety)."

I'm currently a senior at a pretty good CS University and have gotten 3 internships, one at a pretty well-known company.

On the other hand, it seems to me that there are a bunch of people who don't do any prep at all and get jobs at Google/FB/Amazon, etc. just because they have good fundamentals. I've taken data structure and algorithm courses, and higher-level courses like Compilers, and such. What can I do to prep for interviews that aren't just Leetcode prep, which seems not to be helping me?"

I am a third year in college obtaining a BS in Business Management and just recently completed a HR internship with a rather large Fortune 500 company. 

Basically, I’m wondering if it would be more worth it to obtain another internship for this coming summer, or if I would be fine with the internship experience I have now and then try to advance my career through obtaining an aPHR certificate?

One other factor to this all is that I just got a job at what is basically one of the local smaller grocery stores in my college town. Their goal is for me to basically complete the implementation/expand the capabilities of their POS system and do some database work. I’m hoping I’ll be able to convince them to eventually give me some HR responsibilities within the store to give myself even more experience as well.

There's an internship near me that offers cloud experience, primarily in Azure - and I was considering applying to this one. There are also some other basic I.T. administration internships similar to the job that I worked last Summer, but I want to try not to spend too much time in help-desk, so that I have the chance to best build relevant skills. Also, should I be an aspiring systems engineer first, before even considering DevOps - and if so, what would allow me to work myself into that path?

I am in a kind off questionable position and unsure how to take things, hope that I can get a few tips and suggestions from you guys. 
I am a 27 years old guy living in London with my partner. I have graduated this March in another country (I basically couldn't finish the thesis and internship before moving to the UK) and I have finally obtained my bsc in IT. My last year in uni were specialising on information security and some cyber security as well (mostly information security, isms etc, not the pen test stuff). Obviously, when I moved to the UK I didn't have my degree so I am doing the normal jobs. I worked as a security officer, receptionist and education adviser. Now my current company is quite good but can't pay me too much (talking about 20k pa), my job title is irrelevant and I am wasting time. However, I do everything IT related in this office (around 20 staff members) including phones sec cameras and websites as well. I've been here more than two years now doing my job-title duties + anything IT related + occasional designs and operations as well.
Now I am trying to find my dream job within IT and I really hoped I will find something security related. However, I cannot indicate on my CV that I have proper IT experience, except stating that I am an ad-hoc it support for the company. Because of this I've tried to look for graduate positions/no experience positions etc. 5 weeks into job hunting so far I've got only a few nay's and most of them won't even bother replying. I'm not the pushy following up person though. 
I wouldn't mind spending much more time on the whole job hunting activity but my partner is kind off pressuring me (she is supportive though) 
The average graduate salaries in security are around 25-30k pa here and this is what would be perfectly enough for me but seeing no responses I feel like I should lower my expectations and look for the lower ones as well 20-25k(normally involves trainings etc). I feel that I would be capable doing an entry level job in security and I plan to take the security+ exam in the next months just to strengthen my qualifications.
An alternative for me would be to work at some sort of administration/support position with slightly higher salary 22-26 and put the extra money I earn into more qualifications. However, that still doesn't give me any work experience in the field. 
At this point I am unsure which way should I continue but I really hope I won't have to be in admin/support for my future years. I am also unsure if London is too difficult for me with the competitors or I am doing something extremely wrong.
Another negative thing is that my qualifications are rated overall as an average which would convert in to 2:2 british (grade A in USA) but most of my course/exams minimum scores were 70-90% to pass. I believe I can talk about this on an interview but not sure how to present it on a cv/cl.
I am unfortunately getting demotivated with the whole process but I know for sure there are lots of other people underqualified doing much better jobs. 
P.s I speak 4 languages from which 2 are competitive (English and Russian) and 2 not so helpful. 
What would you do?"

Well, this summer I was really busy with my university's exams and my internship, so I found myself with only three weeks off to go on holiday. I dealt with it almost perfectly by going with my friends first and, one week ago, I joined my parents and a couple of friends of them to go on a trip in Portugal.
I've been having a really wonderful time, don't get me wrong, but throughout the whole two trips I couldn't have a single moment alone: I wanted to get the most out of it, so I've basically spent all the time I had wandering around the different locations we visited without even keeping a couple of minutes to chill out. In addition to that, to save some money I've always spent the nights in shared rooms in Airbnbs or hostels.
Well, this was the rule until tonight. At the reception of our current hotel we discovered that (wonderful!) my parents made some mistakes while booking, and it turned out that I had a whole room for me and myself only. I couldn't believe it. I got my card and I went straight to the room, eager to finally enjoy some time alone. When I got into this really nice apartment, I immediately noticed the breathtaking view overlooking the beaches and the underneath side of the village my balcony was oriented towards. 
Well, I don't know whether it was for the gorgeous outlook that elevated my soul and mind, or for the three-week of forced abstinence that was driving me crazy. The fact is that, while going through the balcony door to get some fresh air, I let slip out of my mouth way louder than what I meant (like, I kinda shouted it) something that in English I'd translate to ""Finally, tonight I'm gonna jerk myself off to death!""
I swear, I don't know why I couldn't simply KEEP MY FUCKING MOUTH SHUT. ""No big deal, I guess I just need to revise a bit my etiquette"" I thought for a couple of seconds. And I, foolish guy, even started chuckling while thinking about that.
Still with a dumbass grin on my face, I turned back to grab a cigarette in the bag I left in the room, and that's when I realised I had fucked up.
Going out I didn't see it, but I was in a shared balcony. Like, why on earth would somebody design a hotel with these damn shared balconies. That said, what I came across was the two unsettled Tom look-a-like faces of my parents' friends staring at me. Shit. Do you guys remember the ""me: lays in bed and start masturbating/everyone else at the matress store:"" memes that were popular some months ago, don't you? Well, that's how I totally felt IRL. Damn it, that was some really awkward shit.
As I muttered some dumb excuses they started giggling, so I rushed off back into the room. Now I'm here, writing aboit it while sitting on the toilet, just to avoid thinking that in half an hour-ish I have to join them for dinner. 
Fuck, as of now I'd rather drown myself in my own crap than having to face their glances tonight.

Tl;dr: I shouted in front of my parents' friends my night's plans of violent masturbation; and I gotta meet them in few minutes, with no clue about how to behave"

Ill try to keep this as short and sweet as I can. Basically, I am having serious doubts about where my career is heading. I just turned 21 13 days ago, and am entering my senior year at William Paterson University in New Jersey. I am majoring in Finance and want to be something of a Financial Consultant, or Investment Banker, or Financial Analyst or something like that (clearly Im not too sure yet just know want to do something in Finance).

That's where my first question comes into play-  I know that WPU is not the most prestigious college in the world (I wasnt the best high school student to say the least, and had go to a community college for 2 years to gain study habits and grow up). But now I find myself here at the very end of the pack of all the students rushing into graduation and landing Finance careers. My Gpa isnt horrible (currently 3.6) and I have business experience working as an Accountant, (it's a decent job 15 $ an hour) but slowly over time they raised my responsibilities and expectations without raising the pay, and im dying to get out. I've been applying everywhere, and the only two places that reached out to me were Northwestern Mutual and AXA Advisors.

Man, how excited I was when I got those emails and felt like I was a step closer to a real career. I was stupid and did absolutely no research on either one, and just showed up to the Northwestern Mutual interview with a smile cheek to cheek. The interview quickly turned south when the guy revealed to me that I would be selling their life insurance and other products to people in my ""personal market"" AKA my friends and family. This was not at all what I wanted. I had no interest in this type of work whatsoever, and was quickly very disappointed with myself for not learning more about this scam. However, the thought of having an internship, a good name on my resume, and someone sponsoring me to get my Series 6, 7, 63 or whatever the fuck their little pitch was sat in my head for days. I was so torn. However, I eventually declined the opportunity after the interview after a massive amount of research, and then again was at square one.

Here is my second question, did I make a mistake? I mean, I am in ALOT of student loan debt as my parents are not the most wealthiest people. I work part time constantly and need the money on the side to survive. This internship would've sucked all my time, and potentially relationships out from me, and left me thinking constantly would else could I have been doing except cold calling my friends and family. But would the name and experience and opportunity to learn and even possibly gain my certifications and license have been worth it? Would it have been better than potentially no internships (still pending if this will turn out true or not) Unfortunately, well never know. But it's killing me. A couple days passby and in my email inbox I see an email from an AXA Advisor. The joy comes again, and quickly goes when I research reddit and find that this company literally has been compared to Northwestern Mutual and has terribly negative reviews. I dont even know if I should answer, but is it better than nothing? So far, I havent returned the email.

I guess what Im getting to is this: am I completely fucked? Is a college student who didnt attend a top tier school ever going to get a real career in Finance? I feel like just the name of my University is killing my future career and attracting all these lower level internships and opportunities to come my way. I dont know wtf to do or where tf to go. I need advice, help, past experience and stories from anyone who took the time to read this. Its horrible for me to constantly come on here and have to read about how the next company that reached out to me is really just a low level scam company trying to take advantage of college students.

Thank you for your time, and any advice, help, information or criticism is greatly appreciated. Ask me any questions and be honest.

P.S.- I know that someone may say it was stupid of me to turn down the only real internship opportunities I got, but I really feel like these companies are not what I was looking for. My mom was telling me you have to start somewhere and my dad was telling me to tell them to go fuck themselves. Its so confusing. Please help."

I'm an intern and i deal with a lot of tables with a lot of data, i have to highlight data equal or higher than given references, using conditional formatting makes my life a lot easier for that.

But some people don't like that, for whatever reason the rules used is troublesome for their job, they want me to go cell by cell comparing it's data with the references value. Which takes a lot of time and it's incredibly boring to do.

Is there a way to remove those rules but don't lose the new cell format? I tried a few things like copy and paste as value and then removing but It still didn't work.

If any of you could help me with that i would be really grateful, as i will keep doing my job without people getting on my ass for making my life easier.

I earned my AS in psychology at a US community college in spring 2014, but during my last semester sustained a TBI in a car accident and my cumulative GPA dropped to a 3.69. After finals I had to pause school for a year on doctor's orders. During recuperation I moved to the middle east and basically did nothing to try to let my brain heal.  

I went to a US university in fall of 2015 (deferred entry) and asked about clinical psych PhD programs. I was told I'd need to get onto a research project, do a practicum and an internship, which would be difficult as everything was full. 

Luckily, I talked to doctoral students directly and became a research assistant on a project for one and a half semesters, then he let me go because he didn't need me anymore. I did one semester practicum in a clinical psych center run by the PhDs. I worked as intake, sometimes helped with administering evaluations (MMPI, etc.), maintained client records, helped with group therapy on occasion and processed payments. I also did a one semester internship at a homeless transitional housing facility where I did intake, maintained client records and assisted clients one on one doing homework assigned by their case managers; like looking for full time work, permanent housing, and practicing emotional regulation. I took a double course load and graduated in June of 2016. After missing two finals to testify in court, my cumulative GPA wound up at 3.76. 

In April of 2016 I started working 8-20 hours a week as a remote volunteer crisis counselor. Immediately after graduating, I moved back to the middle east to start an MSc in clinical psychology, sadly I was turned away on the first day for not being a local national (still fighting to get my tuition back actually). 

I kept doing my volunteer work, and even got a 6 month paid position in the org until January of 2017, when I then went back to my regular crisis counselor volunteer work but upped it to 20+ hours a week. I also started helping run a couple of support groups (TBI, anxiety, and sexual assault). Continued in comments..."

Has that worked for anyone here?,CashingOutInShinjuku,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d8fzqf/what_fields_can_i_break_into_by_adding_a/," Beyond going back to school for a different 4 year degree, what kind of education can you get that means something to a potential employer? Before I left the US to teach English in Vietnam I had applied to 500+ jobs after getting laid off. I was only at my first job for a year, and it took me a year of unemployment after college to find that job. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, before leaving for Ho Chi Minh City, I had been unemployed for an additional 1.5 years and my spotty, unemployment-filled resume coupled with my German and Scandinavian Studies degree made me an unappealing candidate to say the least. Without additional transferable experience or valuable education that isn't teaching-related, if/when I decide to move back to the USA, I am just going to be in the same position again. 

&amp;#x200B;

My resume includes a few years of various digital marketing volunteer gigs and a couple internships. By the time I leave Asia there will also be a few years of teaching English on my resume which is either great or perceived as an extended vacation depending on the employer. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some examples of education I hope could jump start my transition into a new phase of life:

* paralegal certificate
* IT/Programming certificates
* digital marketing related certificate like SEO
* digital marketing related programming 
* something that could lead to international work because I have experience adapting to a new culture
* watchmaking school (one of my interests)

So, I must be missing a lot here... what else can you think of? Has doing this worked for you? Please keep in mind that this post is angled towards liberal arts degree holders."

Edit: to keep it short. I pay too much rent for me to handle on my own, im stuck with irresponsible people who are keeping me from leaving, i need advice for the sake of my sanity.

I am a 21 year old male living with a family of 4 in a small house. i live with 2 sisters and a single mother. I've thought about this a lot but I figured I can get a bit of advice or opinions from others because I am a very open person and I might have a wrong mindset on this but I feel I am being used and manipulated by my family, or my mother mostly. this isn't a story of pity but I need to explain the backstory for it to make sense.

I love my mother and I respect the hard work she did after my father left when we were just kids. My mother has always been on welfare ever since my father left. My dad was the bread winner while my mother stayed home providing everything a ""housewife"" would do, we were poor ever since my father left. we have always lived in poverty, mother never having a job. she would rely heavily on welfare and would do little jobs like babysitting to get income which I do appreciate. As a kid, every single time I would receive money from either a birthday present or gift of some kind, I would give her almost everything, and give myself very little. I've noticed my mother was always very money hungry. she would be a different person when money was present, I've noticed every single time I got money I'd feel my mother right behind me expecting it to be given to her, which would happen since I knew she needed it more than I did. but it was stuff like my mother buying stuff from my money and lying about it, stealing my cash from my shelf, or taking more than what was needed from my bank account.

At my teen years I've noticed this more and more. I got an internship at an early age during high school and would go straight to work after my school hours ended and got home late tired, but I would do this for my mother. when I would get my check I would do the same as I did before, keep almost nothing for myself and give it all to my mother. 

jumping to the present I would say, compared to my sister and my mother, I gain a lot of money. I work 2 jobs and i would say I gain about $2,000 a month while my sister gets $600 and my mother gets no income. before my sister, mother, and I would pay equal or enough for the rent, but my mother and sister guilt tripped me into paying the whole $700 dollars rent myself as well as $102 for cable and wifi while my mother pays nothing and sister paying for food which would be around $250 I'm guessing. the reason I know they guilt tripped me is because prior to the responsibility of the rent on me,  I was talking to everyone about saving up for a car and planning to move out with roommates. I feel I am stuck in a small 1 bedroom 1 bath no living room very small messy house. Im a nice guy. I feel they are abusing my niceness and know i will never leave them struggling. If i leave, I know they will be homeless and struggling to live and i am not the type of person to just abandon them, i am not like my father. I've had so many missed opportunities from job sites, car purchases, and living opportunities. 

when I first started paying rent, my income was small. I would only get about 1k every month, went to college and only had 1 job. I had 6k in my bank account from me saving up at around 19. ever since then my bank account has decreased and decreased and today, I am at less than 1k. I've had to stop school for a semester, I cant buy a car. i am not able to move on with my life. I cant move out. im stuck. i feel depressed. I tried talking many many times. they do not listen to me and shrug me off by saying ""you're complaining about this again?"" or something like that. they don't seem to care for my future and opportunities. they only care that i keep the payments coming. i was a happy man before. now every single day i dread coming home and seeing my family. I've always done things alone, with no help from family or friends, i hate asking for help but i dont know what to do. i hate my life and i need help."

I am currently 25 years old, almost a graduated enginneer and an intern in a relatively large company where I don't have much autonomy to practice these kinds of skills because, basically, they don't let interns touch their database, only people who have experience with that kind of task.

But my ultimate goal is to become a data analyst and I want to ask you guys what path I should take to achieve that and what resources are the best and most useful to achieve that.

I have taken the Automating The Boring Stuff With Python course and am finishing the projects in the Python Crash Course book, so I'm a beginner in python. Tried to take a pandas course and actually finished it but I don't know what I should do next.

I have also gone through the book Microsoft SQL Server 2012 T-SQL Fundamentals by Itzik Ben-Gan, so I know a little bit of SQL as well. But I'm kind of lost and don't know how I should proceed, SQL or pandas + numpy + matplotlib in order to become a data analyst? Where should I initially focus on? And after that?

I have looked into sites like Datacamp, Coursera, EDX, Udemy and Udacity. Which of those is the best to focus on Data Analysis? Mind that I have some cash to spend but not that much and also not a whole lot of free time because I still have a few classes to attend and spend about 8-10 hours going to or coming from my internship. 

This is a medium to long term goal of mine. My internship will end december 2020, so I have at least one year to achieve that goal. Sorry for the long post. 

Thank you guys in advance!"

* Work experience: \~4 year at matriculation (50months).
   * 1 year at \~seeded startup as Product Manager (was intern for 1 year and converted at graduation, then promoted from APM to PM 10 months later)
   * 8 months at mid-size tech company as Product Manager
   * 2 years at Fortune-50 company as Product Manager for a 12-million user product (current role)
* Extracurriculars:
   * 5 years - co-founded non-profit for connecting students across campus + social empowerment for Asians (on-boarded 9 universities across 3 states)
   * 2 years - mentor/planning committee member for local nonprofit aimed at helping First-Gen/Low-Income college students
   * 1 year - alumni representative at undergrad
   * Held multiple executive positions at various student organizations during undergrad
* Undergrad school/major: Computer Science from a State University
* Other education/coursework: N/A
* Race/nationality: Asian American
* Sex: M

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: 720 (Q 48, V 40, IR 6)
* Undergrad GPA:  2.717
   * I realize my undergrad GPA is basically bottom 10-20% of any of the top schools. No real excuse except a lack of insight, which I called out on my optional essay. I've always had a job since senior year of high school so I never prioritized academics because I always thought of it as a stepping stone to a job. I've since realized that is not the case and tried my best to address how I've changed (job promotions, PM for large company, upward trends in GMAT, etc).
   * I didn't take any supplementary courses yet but will look to it if I fail this semester
* Strong LoR from current and previous supervisor

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA:
   * short term (3-5)
      * go back into Media/Technology in NYC for a seeded/growth-stage start up as a senior product manager. Goal of moving into managerial and helping diversify company portfolio/ expand market
   * long term
      * start up in media/technology.
* Target schools: Columbia BS, YaleSOM, Booth, Kellogg, Wharton, Sloan
   * ED for CBS, R2 for everything else.
   * I realize they're all reach.
   * I'm going back to prove to myself I can get into a top tier program because I didnt prioritized education as a child. This is more of a self-esteem thing if anything; I dont think the T10+ programs would provide the same value to me
   * I've visited all the schools and connected with faculty/students/adcoms as much as I can

I realize my profile isn't super strong and I'm ORM. Just wanted to get people's thoughts on anything I can improve on in the last minute."
d8pdr8,1,2019-09-24,Career and life advice needed. From entrepreneur to ...?,everyusernameexist,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d8pdr8/career_and_life_advice_needed_from_entrepreneur_to/,"Throw away account...

I’m in my mid-twenties with a lot of experience and skills but I can’t identity possible positions that I am both qualified for and interested in.  

I currently own a multi-million dollar (in annual sales) retail business - that honestly speaking I have no interest in - with a partner.  Although we built it up to be pretty successful, I have yet to see the fruits of that in my personal life.  I originally got into it for the love of business but I have literally no passion in the actual business category.  

I graduated at the top of my class in computer science with internship experience.  I’m a good communicator and leader.  I have web development, design, business, leadership, and management experience.  Including leadership experience in athletics. 

Unlike many other entrepreneurs - I really wouldn’t mind working in another organization or with a team.  

I really don’t care about money and I really do care about making an impact at some level.  I’m kind of tired of the bottom line mentality and would like to get away from that if possible.  I know I can get a job coding (would need to touch up my skills) but that doesn’t excite me.  I need change and some chaos.  I need to solve problems and be able to dive into my work.  I strongly considered law enforcement but I can’t figure out a career where I can use my computer science knowledge and also not be behind a screen all day.  I also considered nonprofits but I don’t know exactly where my skill set would be most useful.  Nonetheless, I do want to make a decent salary and be able to “avoid to live”.   

I’m ready to explore other opportunities.  I’m confident the business we built doesn’t really need me anymore.  I’m also single with no real reason to stay where I am currently residing. 

Any thoughts, comments, or concerns would be helpful at this point.  I’ve felt stuck for the last few months."

I’m interested in pursuing a career path in data science but also software development since the two have a bit of overlap, being coding, particularly Python. I worked for a year doing Excel work and some Python. I have an offer for a software security/development internship and I’m wondering how much this would help down the road with landing some kind of developer position. They emphasized that it’s possible to get a fulltime offer after the internship. If I don’t get that, is this internship worth taking given that I’ve already graduated? How much would this experience help with getting into the data science profession, given that I would be using solely Python, not in a data analytics environment but in a development one?"

My school has done nothing to prepare me for the world of IT. I've taken a course on the CompTia A+ exams but I did not feel prepared at all for the exam afterwards, and my results on practice exams showed it.  After that course, I took a course on Windows Server 2016, but it was just a broad stroke over everything there is in Windows 2016, I don't feel like I know that operating system front to back at all. I feel completely inadequate and I get the feeling that my coworkers are expecting me to have more knowledge then I actually do . I guess my question is where do I begin? How can I better prepare myself? I've spent some time studying for the CompTia A+ exams but haven't actually taken them and I just started a course on the CompTia Security + exam.

They may have thought about me for a while after I embarrassed myself socially and may have mentioned this to their friends, but that’s about it! All these years I have been feeling shame and DELIBERATELY holding myself back for nothing! I wanted to meet unrealistic standards and overcompensate (BECOME A PERFECT HUMAN BEING) to be liked and ease the shame/guilt of my past; but guess what: I have not reached these standards because perfection does not exist! 

I am a 27-year-old living and am currently conducting an internship at an accounting firm with absolutely nothing to show in my life because I allowed anxiety and SHAME to hold me back! Imagine ruminating for the past four years because of a social mistake (a really minor one I should add) on Facebook in 2015 and deliberately (pretty much) failing exams as a result! This is how bad is has been for me!

The point I am trying to make is that I believe that a lot of us are carrying too much shame and guilt and this in addition to the anxiety is holding us back! Your problem is not your addiction to smoking/drinking/video gaming/internet, lying, anger or overthinking! These are all symptoms of your anxiety and living a life without meaning! Only once you sort out your anxiety and find meaning will you be free!

HERE IS MY ADVICE (this is what I did/am doing):

1. Think about two/three things that have been holding you back in the last 5-10 years and write them down.

\- Anxiety \[excessive sweating on face, irrational nervousness, failure to think straight in social situation, pure OCD}

\- Lack of self-esteem \[related to anxiety\]

\- Guilt and shame about past conduct \[worsened as a result of anxiety\]

2. List how these things have been holding you back and what effects this has had on you!

3. If these things weren’t holding you back how would your life be different and how would you be living today?

4. Now ask yourself, can you do something about these things and what exactly do you intend on doing?

&amp;#x200B;

Unless you intend on committing suicide, you will all have to face your fears because if we don’t the next years of our life will be just like now only worse!

You don’t need a self-help book, a girlfriend or money! All these things may help but unless you discipline yourself and actually work you will remain in this cage until you die! And if it is the past that is holding you back like it did with me, realise that every person whatsoever their condition desires to be happy! The ‘normal’ people are too concerned with their present to care about you! By all means apologise where appropriate for past conduct but MOVE ON (i.e. work on yourself to make yourself happy TODAY)!

Some people will read this, thumb this up and return back to this forum (which is quite negative) and feel sorry for themselves instead of doing something; but I will never look back again! I will make myself happy, never allow myself to be intimidated again and I hope you will take the steps to do that, too!

GOOD LUCK!"
d8spc6,5,2019-09-24,How do I transition from education to corporate training? Are there other things I should consider?,Catladybutbasic,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/d8spc6/how_do_i_transition_from_education_to_corporate/,"I'm sorry in advance for writing a novel, but my MA is in English after all...I graduated in May, and for reasons I won't disclose, wasn't able to work until August so I didn't really start looking until then. I originally thought I wanted to get a PhD, but I decided that wasn't for me, so I'm trying to get my foot in the door in something semi-related in a corporate setting. I'm fortunate enough that I don't have to take the first thing that comes along, but I thought I'd found my niche  and am starting to get discouraged that hiring managers don't appear to think the same about me.

Before I get too into the weeds, here's bit more relevant educational background: My undergraduate major was also English, and I have a minor in education and a teaching license. Education wasn't offered as a major at my university, but I took as many classes as I could and got certified to teach. I have four years of teaching experience, two at the high school level and two at the university level while earning my MA - so a non-tenure track position, not even an adjunct, but I was the sole instructor of record for the class. I interned in technical writing for an engineering firm as well. I made $45K teaching high school. I made $10K plus tuition remission teaching at the university, and I made $15/hour as a technical writing intern. I understand that in switching careers, I'll be starting something at the entry level, but I'd really, really rather not go below what I was making teaching high school, and I really want this new job to have the potential for long-term growth, as in moving up both in rank and in compensation.

I looked into technical writing and marketing/PR and don't want to pursue either of those full-time, although I wouldn't mind if my responsibilities included some similar tasks. I also looked into publishing and was offered a job but turned it down and subsequently ruled publishing out. I've been mostly focusing on learning and development jobs like curriculum/instructional designer, but I've gotten only one call-back and they said they couldn't meet my salary requirements. I know I'm not the ""ideal"" candidate for these positions since my degree is not in instructional design (honestly didn't even know instructional design was a separate degree from education) and I'm in an area with a lot of tech and health companies without any tech or health education/experience. **So how do I sell the fact that I've been responsible for designing my own curriculum in every class I've taught, pretty much from scratch and without a lot of oversight? That I've taught STEM students and worked with engineering subject matter experts even though I myself am not a science-person? That I can learn whatever content they need training on more easily than they can teach someone who knows the content how to deliver it effectively? Or are there other careers that are worth looking into?**

Two things that would be nice but aren't absolutely necessary: Ability to progress to making $100K (Teaching high school, I would make $20K more at retirement than I would now, and that's just not something I'm going to commit my 30 year career to); ability to work on a part-time/consulting basis when my partner and I start a family in a few years (obviously not both that and make $100K at the same time)

TLDR; Former teacher trying to break into the corporate world. Definitely not interested in publishing, probably not interested in technical writing or marketing unless the perfect role came along, having difficulty getting into learning and development as it seems to be a pretty saturated market. **Any ideas for how to get started as a curriculum developer/instructional designer/instructional facilitator/trainer? Or other careers that sound like they might be a good fit?**

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I should add, I don't really want to go back to school right now. There are plenty of other things I'm interested in studying, but I'm kind of burnt out on academia, and I have student loans I'd like to pay off, and my partner and I would like to get married, buy a house, and start a family in the next \~3 years. So while I might consider a certificate program with a huge payoff, I won't be going back for a $200K MBA anytime soon."

I have a tough decision to make. A colleague has been promoted and his position has been offered to me. The thing is that the company os going through a downsizing and the contract being offered to me is a temporary one, seeing that the role might be erased and the tasks divides into to people.
No matter how I perform, at the end of march I may be let go. There's not much way to tell the probability of the role continuing to exist or not.

(The paycheck will increase significantly but it is not my main concern right now).

On the other hand I can remain in intern, with my contract expiring on 12/2020, having more time to develop and a more stable scenario.

I worked very hard and had a GPA of 3.7, did plenty of networking, tons of extracurriculars (sports, fraternity, other clubs), and had a very good research internship for a government agency. I applied to maybe a dozen jobs right as I was finishing up college and made it to final rounds of interviews at a few of them before getting rejected. I was a little bummed by the rejections but it didn't really bother me too much at the time. I decided to take a bit of a break and do some traveling and volunteer work for a few months before carrying on with the search...

So in January I settled down and got back to applying to jobs. After dozens more applications I had a few more leads and interviews but nothing worked out. I received one job offer working a pretty dead end job at a call center that I turned down because the pay seemed awful. In May I decided nothing in that city was going to work out so I moved in with some family members in DC. I've since applied to well over a hundred jobs and only had three phone interviews and one in-person interview. I've always been a very positive person but the constant rejections are making me feel so worthless and i hate being such a strain on my family. So many of my friends from college in my major got jobs immediately after college after sending out just 5 or 6 applications. Now Im worried thats its taken so long to get a job that the gap will seem like a red flag to employers and I feel so helpless and stuck. It feels like my degree was worthless because I feel like I did everything right during college and cant even land an entry level job. I'm very fortunate to have family and enough savings to support me but I graduated well over a year ago I'm now desperate mentally and financially. What did I do wrong? Am I actually unemployable?"

**Background:**

The reason I graduated with no major is because I initially went out of high school just looking to get into IT and the ""default"" path to me was going into CS. About halfway into my 2nd year, I was doing poorly (gaming addiction + bad study habits --&gt; procrastination) and failed a few courses. I also decided that CS was not for me, so I applied to switch majors. The Head of Dept. for IT advised that if I were to graduate in a timely way, I'd need to go for the no major option. At the same time he recommended me to go for the courses relating to the networking major which I've since enjoyed.

Though I passed all the networking courses with okay-ish results, I failed a couple other courses along the way (same reasons as above - I'm working on fixing them), dragging out my degree to 4.5 years (standard completion 3 years).

**Currently:**

So here's my problem - I've graduated with bad grades and without experience in IT (no internship), and I'm looking to land my first job, but I have no idea where to start or where to go. I'm not sure what sort of job titles I should really be looking for (network engineer/technician/administrator?), and what level of job I should start out with (help desk? NOC?).

So far, I'm looking to get a CCNA cert by going through the ICND1 100-105 and ICND 2 200-105 exams. I've bought the CCNA Official Cert Guides and the Boson Practice exams to discover what topics I'm weak in so I can work on strengthening my knowledge.

But I'm not sure what should go first: landing an entry-level job without CCENT/CCNA, or completing CCENT/CCNA to improve my chances?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

For months, I have been looking for someone to go with me to see my favorite artist on tour (I was too young to go to any of her previous concerts) and saved up all summer for. Good friends, classmates, outside of class friends, friends, etc. (BTW me and my friends are in college.) They were either too far away (flights, etc) or had no interest in seeing the artist or couldn't not make it. My original plus one was going to go but couldn't find a cheap flight. Concert is next Saturday and I was running out of options. 

Lastly, I considered my ex, we ended on good terms almost a year ago and went our separate ways. We talk from time-to-time about school and summer internships. Nothing flirty. I remembered that he enjoyed this artist too despite how many years it has been since she was on the Billboards and mainstream. I asked him (via text) in a general tone that I couldn't get anyone else to go and if he can fulfill that extra ticket. He said yes and left it as that.

It went over my head, but my mom (very picky with people, as so as I) did not like him back when we were dating. I told her and she was upset and was back to the period that I was dating him. Displeased and I knew that it was not going to go well if I went with him. (btw, I commute to college from home) I had no idea that my aunt is into the artist as well and offered to go instead. I am short on family, so my mom means a lot to me (don't get me wrong, I'm independent and all.)

How do I uninvited my ex without sending the message of 'a better opportunity' or I am cutting him out out. Our schedules with class and work are not flexible for meeting up beforehand. Is there an easy message that will be ok? I know that he will be disappointed. I had thought about ""My aunt is coming in town and really wants to spend time"" but it kinda sounds rude

\---

Short: I invited my ex (I am on good terms with) but I realized that going with him will damage my relationship with my mom. How do I 'uninvite' him so I can be on good terms with my family. (My 'cool aunt' (not a regular aunt lol) has offered to be my plus one)"

So I'm a CompSci Sophomore in college, and so far I love it. It's honestly one of the first times in my life that I've genuinely felt good about myself and environment and wish to keep that streak running.

However, I'm currently in this entrepreneurship club/program at my school (let's call it LLD), and it requires way too much of my time-- with 12-15 hours every single week. It's only been 4 weeks and people are already backing out of the program, and I also want to. The only issue is that as much as LLD sucks the life out of me, the women who run it are very influential on my campus and have a hand in pretty much every Computer Science club here.

I was actually in this program as a Freshman, and probably around 20-30% of participants dropped out, and these women are very spiteful against them. Every single mention of last year, they talk about the ""uncommitted"" who left. I just started a new CS club on campus, (plus I want to do other extracurriculars in the field) and I'm worried it'll be hard to collaborate with other clubs if the LLD women don't trust/respect me. I didn't realize just how difficult this program was until I started a job and take harder classes.

Currently, I have a 15-20 hour job, run my new club as Vice President, and have to stay on the President's list (gpa requirements) for scholarships. It's a lot for someone like me, not even counting internship season, and my anxiety keeps flaring into frequent anxiety attacks from it all. LLD is a pretty serious club/program and I'm really scared of breaking this commitment, also because I'd be making it harder for the team that I'm leaving by going. So, I wanted to ask for your advice. Should I tell them I 'm going to leave or suffer through the next 7 weeks of the program?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you so much for the advice and guidance! I'd genuinely appreciate any feedback received."

I am a 22 y.o. college student in Brazil. I started college in 2015, in a public university. I choose Computer Science because...well, I'm not really sure. But its all free.

Since 2017 I've been looking for internships (or full time jobs, if no experience was required) that were somewhat related to my degree, but I found little sucess. 


Now Im really close to graduating, and due to the way this college works Ill also get a Bachelor degree in Science and Technology. Because I didnt got a job I decided to stay a little longer and try also a degree in Information Engineering (alot of classes were already taken because they were obligatory to Comp. Sci.), so I would get a 5 year degree with only ~2 more years at the uni.



Now its where I should make a decision. From what Ive read, I can try for a Masters degree in Comp Sci., but every class is in the afternoon, which would completely ruin any plan for a job. Also, Im not really a straight A student, failed a few classes but as far as I know that would not be a problem.



Should I try it? Im 22 already, maybe its too late to look for internships? Ive failed some (20+) interviews already, and I cant even count how many applications I did. Should I just get the Comp Sci degree and leave? Complete the Engineering too? Look for the Masters? 


Edit 1: I also feel like Im lacking in programming skills, but I find that difficult to solve since Its not something I use (or have a need to use) daily. Kinda like learning a new language, without practice and real ""interaction"" feels like an uphill battle. Maybe trying the Masters could be just a waste of time (my time, college time, professor time). On the other hand, even if I fail it, there is no ""punishment"".


Sorry about my english, google can only do so much."

So I'm a final year college student pursuing a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering. Planning to get in CyberSec right after college so decided that Sec+ was the way to go. Don't have any real work experience per se, but have done two internships related to Security/Networking. Also, I had studied for CCNA before this but haven't taken the exam.

**My Prep:**

So I started studying about 5 weeks ago. I read the **GCGA Darill Gibson** **book** cover to cover solving all the practice questions and taking both the tests. This took me about 2 weeks. Had college exams and project submission in the next 2 weeks so wasn't able to study during this time. Now with a week to go, I bought the **Jason Dion Practice Tests** and took one to gauge where I stood, got a 75%. I then binged all of the Professor Messer videos in about 2 days and took another test. Got 81% in that. By now, I realised that I knew most of the concepts and just needed to practice and learn from my mistakes. I used the Security + SY0-501 Study app until I started to recognise the questions. I also used the following free tests/material :

1. ExamCompass: [https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests](https://www.examcompass.com/comptia/security-plus-certification/free-security-plus-practice-tests)

4. For PBQs: [https://getcertified4less.com/uploads/file/SecurityMiniCourseHandbook.pdf](https://getcertified4less.com/uploads/file/SecurityMiniCourseHandbook.pdf)
5.

By the last day, I was getting an average of 84% on the Dion Practice Tests.

**The Exam:**

I had 82 questions totally with 5 PBQs. The PBQs were....well amazing. They tested so many concepts in a single question that it's impossible to get right if you don't understand them perfectly, and also there isn't a place you can get anything similar, so I'd say getting even 3/5 right is pretty damn good. The remaining questions were decent. Most of the time, you're down to 2 options and usually need to read the questions multiple time to understand what they EXACTLY expect. I didn't feel like I would fail while going through the test but was expecting to cut it close. All things considered, I'm pleased with an 808.

My advice would be not to overthink or overstudy and take the exam when you feel like you understand the concepts and not worry about some practice test score cause trust me, they are nothing like the real exam.

Also, I couldn't have done it without all the advice and resources shared by the people in this subreddit. Thank you, and I hope this post can help some of ya'll out.

I did well in everything, and rarely encountered problems in my coursework or research internships.

For my M.Sc, I have done equally as well in all of my classes (at a different school), and paid a ton of money (more than my funding) in rent, tuition, etc., putting myself in a financial hole. I’m now about to submit the initial draft of my M.Sc thesis. My supervisor wanted me to study a (pretty intense) paper about a subject that was completely new to me, and write my thesis so that he could understand the material of this paper without putting a ton of time in to work out the details.

I have done this. My supervisor acknowledges that my thesis has helped him understand the paper written a few years ago, so I should have no trouble having it accepted, right? Well, I have verified all of the results presented in the paper I am studying, putting the details in my thesis  with the exception of 2 calculations. I have been trying for weeks to verify them but I am unable to do so. My supervisor has the attitude that unless I can verify these calculations (that were done by a well respected researcher in the field and are definitely correct), that my thesis is incomplete and he won’t accept it. He also hasn’t offered to help much with trying to verify these calculations as they are “just calculations”.

I don’t know what to do. I have a meeting Friday to go over the “final” draft for my initial submission but I’m not going to be able to have what he wants by then. If he doesn’t allow it to be submitted because it fails to meet his standards, I don’t know how I’m going to handle it. I have been losing sleep, unable to eat, and generally feel nauseous trying to do my day to day routine because this is stuck in my head every day. This past year or so has been really rough on my family (lost family home in a fire after I moved, mother needs major reconstructive surgery on her knee in the near future, family’s closest friend was just diagnosed with cancer), and I feel like it’s all too much. 

I feel that, even though I’m so close to being done, if my submission gets shots down I should just step away from school and focus on sorting my life out because this is no way to live. Does anyone have any advice or calming words? I would really appreciate it.

Sorry for the rant."

One challenge I am facing is understanding the monumental existing code base in order to be able to fix bugs or add features as they are assigned to me. All code I have dealt with before not written by me has been tiny snippets, so this is a big step up. 

There is very little existing documentation, as to what the code does or how it works, and no comments within the code. I've also never worked with the two languages it is written in (a combination of Angular and C#). The closest thing to documentation I have access to is a massive history of git commits. 

I would pair with some other members of my team for mentorship or advice, but due to various circumstances, a number of members of the team have left very recently, leaving the remaining developers under an extremely high workload. 

I feel under pressure from my managers to be completing tasks I am assigned, but feel like it's not possible to do so without constantly taking time from the more important members of the team.

I'm headed towards the heart of my final year as a student. I have had some personal issues and some academic problems in the past that have lead me to change majors from Mechanical to Industrial Engineering. This has lead to me facing problems of looking terrible on paper, mainly from an academic and work experience standpoint.

I feel confident that my resume is well put together, as it has been vetted by multiple students, professors and professionals. I also complete and add in cover leaders when needed. 

I have other experiences listed on my resume as well.  These are involvements in multiple university athletic bands, along a special leadership program my uni offers. I also attend career fairs and browse online job openings once or twice a week. 

Even as I started to become grounded academically and even finding some interviews, last year my lack of experience and academics kept me out of an internship. This leads me to a complete lack of experience in my field of study. My only work experience is in retail as a result. 

I'm starting to be concerned that obtaining a full time position will be extremely difficult for me because of my past failures and shortcomings. I got back on track academically after switching majors, but I feel as if it was too little, too late. 

To put it frankly, it's all disheartening to me. I'm still looking and trying to make connections with people and companies but my motivation for doing so is difficult to sustain.

I’m from New Zealand and have done some of my Comp sci degree in the US. I loved it so much that I would like to do an internship or a grad role at a tech company (large/medium-sized) in the US.

Can New Zealand citizens get software development roles in the US easily? Do companies often help overseas employees with visas? How can I check if I am eligible for a visa (assuming I have an offer)?

Does anyone have any experience with this that they can share? Any help would be much appreciated!"

I am currently a cyber security/network system management student at a two-year tech school, and also a intern at a cyber security firm. 

I recently heard a conversation about how an individual can start their IT career in Cyber, but that individual will be just ok at his/her job. And one must start their career at help desk/entry level, and work their way up to system admin, then cyber. 

I am still relatively new to the field, and believe that this is just one way of thinking, but I’m curious to hear  from those with experience and knowledge, and would appreciate a comment below. 

Thanks,"

I have always been successful in everything that I do, I graduated college, I can learn and adapt quickly to a lot of different environments and jobs and can fix almost anything. But I also get bored easily, this has led me to have lots and lots of different jobs. I have worked in restaurants, been an explosives technician, an EMT, a field science intern for a climate research firm, a mechanic, a ski instructor, the list goes on and on. Most recently I have been a farmer, which has been fun and I would say that I am extremely grateful for what I have and for the people in my life but I have recently been feeling lost.

I am just going to set the scene for where I am at mentally, you can skip this if you want. Ten days ago I was in a pretty bad car accident. It was a Saturday, I had just finished cutting about 20, 100' trees up into logs to be chopped and stacked for the winter (I live in a little cabin out in the middle of the mountains), and since it was a Saturday I was going to go out and have some beers as I normally do. All of the time. I don't live that far from town so I go pretty frequently. I have been seeing this woman who has been a lot of fun but made it clear when we started seeing each other that we are just friends with benefits, I have a hard time with that but I enjoy her company so I have been putting aside my desire for something more and rolling with it. Anyway, I had a long day and she was being really kind of mean so I got to where I drink and started slamming beers. The good high ABV IPA, which I can normally knock a few down and be fine. But I was on a mission to feel better because you know alcohol solves all our problems... She joins me at some point in the evening and we end up going to another place to drink more, she is also on a mission to get hammered so there we are. The next thing I know, I wake up in the hospital. I wrecked my truck into a boulder field that is on the way to my house, my head went through the windshield and I broke a couple ribs. Mind you, the only thing I have on my record is a couple speeding tickets. Not to say that I don't make questionable choices, I just don't usually do something so stupid to get caught. So, here I am all injured ( I am actually really lucky I have as few injuries as I do, I have some kind of guardian) and reflecting on how I got to this point in my life. I write every day, about everything really but I try to focus on the possible reasons of how I got here.

Here is the point of this post. I have always drank on a daily basis but don't have an issue with stopping when I need to. Yes, it is hard for to stop drinking when I start for the night, but I know that. I have been trying to identify my trigger to Start drinking and I think I have identified it, or part of it at least. I hate being alone, physically but mostly emotionally. The only time that I have even thought about drinking is after someone has come to visit me to check on me and hang out for a little while. When they leave I get this really deep sinking feeling in my chest and almost what I can only describe as dread. Then my next thought as they walk out the door is, I want to go out. I want to see people, I want a beer, I want to make some connections with new people or hang out with friends. But it is really powerful. It seems so irrational to feel that way to me because I live out in the mountains, purposefully away from people. I like my alone time usually, but these past few months I have been on a path of drinking and socializing beyond a normal level for me. I just don't know what to think about it or where to even start to address this behavior. I usually have myself on lock, I am usually aware of who I am and every choice I make has a purpose. But I took a wrong turn somewhere and now I am lost. And it took an unfortunate accident for me to realize this. It has been a crazy year, to say the least.

I don't really know what I am looking for by posting this here, but if someone reads this and has the slightest bit of wisdom or something, I will be grateful."

My dream school is Cornell CAS, which I know is a reach, but I'm also planning on applying to BU, NYU, and similarly ranked schools. Please be honest - I've been stressing so much and most people have no clue when it comes to chancing me!

**Major**: Computer science

**GPA**: 4.0 (45 finished credits, 58 at the end of this semester - will have all A's on midterm report probably)

**SAT**: 1480 in one sitting

**College ECs**: Teaching assistant for multiple CS courses

Teach weekly high school health classes under a volunteer program affiliated with my school

Intern in IT department at a well known hospital (originally worked on a team project there under an internship program geared towards women in tech, but then it became extended to a regular internship)

Currently taking preparatory steps towards AI-related research under a professor at my school; not sure how far I'll specifically get with this within the next month, but hopefully will be actually involved in the lab next month

Recently interviewed for my school's selective interdisciplinary honors program - 90% sure I'll be accepted, so I'm listing it here.

And some volunteer work at an activist archive

**Recommendations:** Two from well-established people at the hospital, which I believe will be probably be the best (one of these people in particular still references our project constantly and is extremely enthusiastic about it). Three professor recs - one CS, two humanities since CS courses are really impersonal at my school - not totally positive as to how these will turn out, but I'm assuming they will be strong\~very strong as I really excelled in these courses and befriended the professors to the point where the humanities ones were trying to convince me to double major.

**High school info**: Not going to bother listing high school EC's since they weren't anything spectacular, but I won a national gold medal for my writing (received by &lt;700 people out of 300,000 submissions). My high school situation was a bit complicated. I started off with a great average at a really prestigious/competitive HS, then switched to homeschool due to health reasons; I had a great course load and prepared for close to 10 AP exams, but was unable to take them because although I was approved for medical accommodation for standardized testing, I was unfortunately unable to actually receive it -- which I plan on mentioning somewhere. I do feel like having an unconventional background followed by success in college might help though?

Thanks so much in advance!!"

They extended me a full-time offer for after I graduated this past May. From the time my internship ended til when I started, they went through some internal department changes with having the previous director of my department leave their position and my mentor moving up higher who is now my boss. I started this job out very strong and excited, I got things done on time and kept up with what was being assigned to me. I enjoyed what I do.

As the days went by, the demand for what is being asked from me started increasing. Now it's came to the point where I can barely keep up and I'm missing deadlines because other things taken priority. I work for a decent sized company (\~3000+) and we are a small department of 3 people that focus on different aspects of project parts, but one person is in a completely different time zone as me which makes things difficult.

I have only been in this position for less than 6 months and I dread going to work each day. I tried justifying that this is my first ""real"" job and I'm still transitioning from a school mindset into the corporate world. However, I feel that something is not right. I cry every so often because I feel like an absolute failure for not being able to keep up with what is expected out of me and I end up disappointing my boss. My job is starting to consume my life to the point where my boss almost expect me to drop premade plans to stay late to be able to keep up with my workload. I get so fed up with the poor communication from everyone on my team no matter how many times I reach out and say something. If something wrong happens, whether it's a typo or a broken link in an email, the blame sits very heavy on my shoulders for awhile.

I've spoke up many times about how I feel overworked and overwhelmed. My boss showed me empathy and was understanding about my feelings. But the truth is that no matter how much I talk to her, I will always be overworked because of the way things are and with no plans of hiring anyone new to the team in the near future until next summer rolls around when we will be getting a summer intern. I feel that I'm not a good fit for my job. I think I am too immature with my skillset to be in this type of position and that someone else who is more experienced in their career should being doing my job.

The only thing still pushing me still is the projects I've worked on: craking a vigenere cipher, cracking a playfair cipher, and an automated ""hacker"" which images the main drive (/dev/sda) of a target and sends it back to the host machine for analysis. The last project gets a bit more in depth, but I can explain it further if needed. There are two other projects I've worked on, but they're unrelated to cyber security.

Is there anything I should keep in mind while looking at these entry level jobs? I feel hopeless seeing 3-5 years work experience on every single one."

I recently graduated from undergrad and have been working as a software engineer for about two months now. Up until about junior year of college, I had always wanted to go into research and be on the forefront developing and discovering. Things have really changed in the last two years as I have been struggling with, among other things, what I want to do with my life.

At the same time data science was an interest of mine throughout college for which I had a few internships. Working as a software engineer, I've been feeling the ""what if"" feeling coming over me recently. I wonder if I should have continued on data science and gone to grad school. As graduate scholarships are getting closer, it feels like a do or die moment. I don't feel like I'm ready to go back to school or even if I fully know what I want to do but it feels like if I don't apply not, I'll have wasted another year waiting hoping for some sign or something. 

I found data science interesting but, having done internships, I never felt like I enjoyed it in practice and likely liked the idea of it more than the actual practice of gathering, cleaning, and aimlessly wandering through data. I wonder if that's because I wasn't prepared for the work or if it's just not a good fit.

We're three paragraphs in and I'm already all over the place. I'll just make a list of why I think I should go to grad school and why I shouldn't and would love it if some of you with experience could share your insights as I work towards making this decision

Go to grad school:

- Study deeper into topics I'm interested in. I used to enjoy studying and exploring topics in data science and ml in my free time during school and it felt like I enjoyed it then

- Having that opportunity to build my skill set and knowledge

- possibly actually get into research (despite starting and failing a few times in undergrad because I wasn't sure)
- getting a higher degree

- fulfill a long lived dream of pursuing higher education if not a PhD. Not to mention my parents'

- I already asked professors for recommendations, started an application for a scholarship, and reached out to my advisor for help. If I just drop it now, I'll just feel like a quitter. Would they help me in the future if I just stop after they have said yes

- it'll just get harder and harder to go as I keep working and am acclimated to the work lifestyle

Why not go:

- I don't honestly know what tangible benefits I'll get from it

- not even sure if data science is for me (but I guess after 3 years of undergrad and two internships around data, if I don't know yet, will I ever)

- during my internships, as well as some data analysis on currently doing at my job, I've felt like I don't quite enjoy it as much as I thought I would. It honestly feels like I'm blind and just swinging my hands around looking for something but not sure what

- I could continue to work and build my career at my current company which is growing quickly

- it feels like I'm applying more because the deadline is coming/if not now then when and less because it feels like I'm ready or I need it

I clearly don't have a strong case for why I should but I don't feel like I'll know for sure unless I at least try and, who knows, I could want to go in half a year by which point it would be too late. 

Would love to hear any thoughts from others who have been at this question. How did you make your decision and would you have done something different?"

Sophomore in CS, but graduating May 2021 (year early) . This will likely be my last internship before graduating.

Internship A:
Sandia Laboratories - TITANS R&amp;D Software Engineering Intern

Internship B:
BAE Systems - Software Engineer Tech Intern 2

The Sandia internship seems like it has more engaging projects, but I wouldn't want to work for them after graduation because they reserve their engineering roles for those with Masters degrees.

On the other hand, BAE just seems more realistic for me to work for after graduation. Kind of like a backup offer.

1. Which of these companies seems more impressive on a resume?

2. Does having a security clearance provide any benefit to getting hired in the private sector?

3. Do any of you fine people have experience with either of these companies and have any insight to share?"

Few months on and my boss started to give me more and more work and didn't really understand the amount of work i'm putting on (I must say that I trained myself during these last months ).

This month, I 've been told that I had to return earlier in school to continue my studies but I had to finish my legal internship, so I asked my school and my boss for solutions.

One solution was to put me in a part-time internship for the remaining month of work so that I could start my school which would not have changed much, and my boss refused saying that i will  not have the time to do much. I accepted the offer to continue in full time because i can continue school in February.

I must say that i""ve go a small salary working as an intern and  I'm currently doing the job of 3 competent people ( community manager, marketing, commercial ).

I would like to have objective feedback on what I could do next? I've tried to talk to him but my boss does not value me and lives in his own world it seems, he does not understand the amount of work i'm doing and does not want to understand.

I may go  to my school talk to them about the situation and then break the internship contract since I validated my year and I have no risk if I share bound to my status as an intern."

I'm a student from Southern California completing my degree in Information Assurance and Business Administration (did a minor in Organizational Communication if that matters), and am wondering how the job market for Info Sec is out here? 

I worked an internship in Tempe in Networking and Security, but have not heard back yet for an offer. I do not want to stay in California - period. When I moved to Tempe for the three months it was the best time in my life. 

I've been working university jobs related to IT and helpdesk while I completed my degree and at my community college. I've also attended many workshops taught by my school's cyber security clubs. Last year I held two positions for our school club and this year I possess two more, as well as three years of participation for our universities cyber security fair. I volunteered for cyber security events, participated in a digital forensics competition, and completed about 3 CTF events. 

I am in the process of working on my Sec+ and AWS Associate certifcations and am more than willing to learn quickly in a job like SOC Analyst, Info Sec analyst, or Information Security Associate. 

As a first generation student I really tried to keep myself busy, but it seems like it's still not good enough and I may have to enter general IT (helpdesk, work my way up). I have no problem with that if I can find a job in Tempe or surrounding cities. My degree will be completed in December 2019 and I'm looking to move over to AZ mid January 2020.  

With that said, how is the job market out here for entry level cyber security work (if it exists). How about general IT help desk or Level II and III helpdesk? Are there any resources for job postings? I have been using my LinkedIn account and am very active on there for positions. Have not heard back yet. My resume is a full one page, no more no less. 

I can share my resume if any hiring managers are looking at this post and need to hire soon! 

Thank You,

It goes from May to August and I'm hoping to land one of the positions.

This week I noticed they posted the summer internship on our company website this week (meaning I can actually apply for the internship now if I wanted to)  

Why would a company take internship applications for something that won't start for nearly 8 months?"

At my previous internship we had a IPREO/BD Advanced account where you can search an asset management firm and download an excel spreadsheet with their portfolio holdings. 


Working on a school project and I would like this holdings spreadsheet for 2 companies. Would anyone be willing to help, it's simply a few click of a button on IPREO, I can compensate a meager amount or work some deal out?

I am an international student from Austria, currently in my first year of a BSc Computer Science program at the University of Manchester, in the UK. 
On to my question, I am interested in summer internships and was wondering if it is reasonable to apply for summer internships in the US? Is it better to apply to bigger companies or rather start ups? How do I find proper internships? 

Hope anyone could help me out.

d9plk6,3,2019-09-26,Just left a career fair - how do you compete?,MarcinTheMartian,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/d9plk6/just_left_a_career_fair_how_do_you_compete/,"TL;DR: Just had a career fair. Feel stupid compared to all the people around you. Can’t seem to get anything out of trying to connect with recruiters. How can you compete with top students?

I go to a, what I would consider, pretty good state school for computer science, and we just had a tech career fair.

My first conversational pitch to a recruiter went poorly. I was nervous, didn’t know what to say, and was quite literally shaking. 
My second conversation went very well, but felt very impersonal and the recruiter interrupted me once or twice with something else (she thought she lost her iPad, etc). Although not discouraging, it was annoying. 
My last conversation, and this one really shot my confidence and all around optimism, didn’t even start. The company was a big research and development company and pretty prestigious. The student in front of me already had multiple internships in AI and programming at other top companies, consultant jobs in IT, and so much more. In fact, what made me leave the line, was the recruiter being more excited to hire him than he was to even apply and work there. 

I’m by no means a genius, but I’ve always been a good student and maintain a GPA around ~3.4 on top of the honors college. I’m trying to join more clubs, participate in more hackathons, and be more proactive, but the time management is nearly impossible due to class scheduling and event times and overall BS. 

What do people do to compete against top students looking to get into internships? How do you get those first jobs/internships/research opportunities with only personal projects, hackathon projects, one high school internship, and limited credibility? 

All of these fairs are so discouraging even if they help with soft skills like communicating and pitching yourself. Hopefully I don’t get too down on myself and something amazing comes out of it all."

Free worker for experience/training!!

I've obtained my Security+ and am currently studying for the CySA+. I don't have a strong IT background, but I am learning on my own (started Automate the Boring Stuff, started Pentester Academy for red team exposure, planning on getting a simple home lab up and running, networking in my city via Meetup). I lack IT experience outside of a 2nd level application support position over a decade ago.

I'm hitting the paradox of needing a job for experience and experience for the job. I am looking for part time remote work (unpaid is just fine), side projects, internships, something that I can put on my resume to hopefully get me out of that paradox (or at least show that I'm not letting something like that get in my way).

I'm a lazy piece of shit so I went back to very poorly managing my time now that I'm living under a student schedule again. 

The code I'm writing now is hot garbage to the point where it seems like I'm deliberately ignoring good practices. Back in the office I would spend a few hours looking up either internally or on stack overflow on best practices or conventional ways of doing things, but right now I'm just copy-paste hacking things together because I don't care enough.

I'm writing a REST API and there's a part of me that's is screaming at me to use mongo better and actually index my keys, or organize my code better, or not have these obnoxious god functions that manually check edge cases. I don't think I'm the best programmer, I think I'm pretty bad at it in the grand scheme of things, but I feel like I'm slowly forgetting the habits I built over the course of the summer.

Nothing I write now would pass review. I feel like I'm regressing, like I'm losing skills because I'm being so sloppy now, but I also just don't have it in me to spend the extra like 20 hours a week for zero payoff. Like I have a bit more muscle memory when it comes to designing a system, but I don't have it in me to grind out something with the intent of keeping the code clean. 

Sounds like I'm bragging but I admit that I'm pretty bad at this, but I feel less bad than I was a year ago.

Is this a common feeling for people that come back from their internships?"
d9tnab,19,2019-09-26,[OC] The Guardian Project; Chapter 1,Speciesunkn0wn,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9tnab/oc_the_guardian_project_chapter_1/,"(New story! This one should be easier for me to continue. XD Enjoy!)

The Guardian Project 

All around Jackie is a noticeable flurry of movement throughout this R&amp;D base located on Astral 4 b, a rocky moon with enough gravity to support a small, imported atmosphere thanks to the parent gas giant. Security personnel, scientists, engineers, and other useful people of a variety of aliens and humans are busy getting last minute materials and checks set up for the Guardian Project trainees' first experiences inside their prototype Guardian mechs. 

“Lieutenant Lonson!” A male voice calls as one of the security supervisors walks toward her in the shuttle bay. “I’m Ensign Cartel, I’ll be taking you to your new mech.” He states and salutes her. 

“Thank you, Ensign.” She replies with a smile and returns the salute. “Lead the way.” She begins walking after him through the bustling halls and along walkways set to the side of some deeper hallways lined with tall doors and stairs going down to each. “I’m guessing each of those doors is where a Guardian mech is waiting?” 

“You would be correct.” He nods. “Your R4P-T0R I is down at the end of the hall, closest to the firing range with a TR1-CR4 I opposite. Based off the original prototype frame, but with different functionalities that I’m sure you’ve been briefed on.” 

“Yup. R4P-T0Rs are meant for offensive punches and overwhelming force while the TR1-CR4 are more defensive, to protect R4P-T0Rs and any hostages, slaves, or civilians from return fire.” She nods. “Gotta go with a R4P-T0R, big guns and from what I saw of the concepts, looks more like a starfighter, which I was originally training for.” She grins. “Can’t wait to see what it’s actually like. The simulations can only do so much.” 

“Can’t tell you.” He shrugs and begins walking down the spiraling stairs to the right-side door next to an even bigger set of blast doors marked with 'Firing Range'.  

The tall doors open to reveal a ‘small’ hangar like room filled with electrical equipment and a supporting structure with the mech, colored dark blue with light grey tiger shark like stripes, partially unfolded and disassembled; legs under blue gel-like seat and internals with an odd spine-like structure on the back of it connected to the back of the mech and the arms.  

A light grey 'box' is placed just behind the wrist, which is connected to a taloned, five fingered hand. Each foot ends in three taloned toes with the inner toes holding a far bigger talon with a noticeable gap where the cutting edge and pointed tip would otherwise be. 

As Jackie looks over the oddly organic looking mech, movement catches her eye and a female engineer is busy looking between a couple laptops and typing on them as crane arms in the ceiling pick up other disassembled pieces and hold them over the mech while waiting for the pilot. 

“Lieutenant Lonson, this is Tech Specialist Jetta Monroe. TechSpec Monroe, this is Lieutenant Jackie Lonson.” Ensign Cartel gestures between the two once he leads Jackie over to the engineer. “I’ll leave you two to it.” He salutes and walks off as the women look each other over while shaking hands. 

Jackie’s eyes drift over Monroe’s body, taking in the regulation length black hair, bronze skin and the royal blue eyes signature to natives of Azure III. Nearby is an unfolded set of blast armor. 

“As he said, TechSpec Monroe. I’ll be taking care of the R4P-T0R mech if you take damage, as well as general maintenance, fire support, and hacking with my own tech and weapons.” She says, smiling at Jackie. “I take it you know the reason of the Guardian Project?” 

“Nice to meet you, Monroe. And yes, I have. All volunteer experimental program started by humanity to work toward ceasing all piracy and wars in the Galaxy. And currently only humanity is insane enough to actually volunteer for being permanently merged with a mechsuit.” She replies with a smirk. 

“You heard?” Monroe asks with some noticeable shock. 

“They decided I was high enough rank to hear the full story. And because I was Number 1 of our class of 10.” She replies, shrugging as she speaks. “I think it just makes it cooler. I’ll get to feel *myself* firing the guns, sprinting at high speeds, ripping through armor, all that!” As she talks, the dreamy grin on her face spreads further. 

“Well, sounds like you’re ready.” She turns and looks up at a small observation deck overlooking the hangar and makes a thumbs-up before turning it 90 degrees a couple times. The people monitoring the mech from inside all give her answering thumbs-ups and Monroe steps into the blast armor, the padded panels quickly closing up around her back to seal her inside. “Alright, I’m ready, the observation deck is ready. Climb the stairs and sit down in the cockpit.” She gestures to the mechsuit, her tone carrying a smile. 

Jackie nods and quickly climbs the stairs and walks along the scaffold’s ‘table’ to sit down and slide her legs into the channels in the mech’s thighs’ gel layer with her arms slipping into the arms of the mech so her shoulders and hips match up properly. The unfolded panels of the legs close up over her own and the chest piece begins to be pulled up via some pulleys on one of the crane arms, another one lowering the front of the mech’s neck and head. Those parts wait until the front of the torso is partially locked into place before Jackie’s head is totally engulfed in squishy darkness by the gel thanks to the front of the neck and the head. 

Several groupings of needles punch in down her spine from the base of her neck, as well as into her nerves down her limbs, earning a heavily muffled shriek of pain with Jackie’s vision going blurry, despite the darkness, as hisses of pressurized gas lock all the parts into place. While she blinks, she gets images of the hangar from significantly higher up than when she climbed in. After a few more blinks, that view has totally taken over her vision and she begins to move her eyes, noticing the surprisingly tiny form of Monroe off to her right. “Uuugh...d-did...it work?” She groans, a tongue sliding over sharp, metal teeth. 

“Yes! Yes, it did!” Monroe bounces excitedly as she looks up at the humanoid raptor shaped mech. “Better than we expected too. Mental integration was 120% faster than we anticipated; from the prototypes we were expecting almost five minutes before the subject started to move their eyes and speak. The simulations of the upgrades suggested at least a 10% increase to that time, but they appear to be working far better than we thought they’d be. Or you’re just extra compatible. We’ll find out after the others are hooked in.” She announces to Jackie as the other human, or in this case, former human, begins to move her head around carefully. 

She looks over her shoulders to see a ‘pack’ sticking up over them slightly, with a barrel visible on each side of her head, no doubt some heavy weapon system. 

When she looks straight down, part of her view is taken up by what are obviously smooth, nigh featureless, black colored breasts covered in dull, yellow hexagonal patterns. “That’s a good thing, although...uh. Why does the mech have boobs?” 

“Oh, those are part of the batteries.” Monroe replies. “Any part of you with those hexagons are part of the batteries. At full charge they’ll be solid yellow-orange and glowing quite nicely.” She taps a few keys and some wires hooked up to the mechsuit begin flashing yellow as they start pumping power into her as she continues looking over her new body from the sitting position. Hexagons on her upper arm and leg muscles join her chest as they glow brighter and wider, soon totally filling up all the previously black or grey space.  

“Woah...that’s cool. But, not exactly stealthy?” She asks with some confusion. 

“Well, you’re not supposed to be.” Monroe laughs. “You’re supposed to be visible so people don’t cause trouble when you’re nearby. Or quickly stop when you show up. It’ll be up to other groups or later models to be stealthy. Also, don’t worry about them appearing to be weak spots. You’ve got heavy-frigate-grade shielding, so they’d need to hit you with starship weaponry to cause any significant percentage drop to it. Not to mention that while they are batteries, they won’t explode when hit if they do get through your shields.” 

“You’ve tested this I assume?” Jackie asks after Monroe finishes her explanation. 

“Correct.” Monroe replies and waves for her to stand up, which she does. “How does it feel?” 

“Extremely powerful.” Jackie grins, beginning to carefully stretch as Monroe taps some keys and the various wires detach from her neck and back. 

“Alright. Diagnostics say you’re all good for the time being, want to put your new body through its paces?” 

“Hell yeah!” She nods and pumps her fists. 

“Follow me to the firing range, we’ll test your weapons first.” Monroe replies and leads her toward the door back into the hall before opening up the firing range’s door and letting Jackie through. Jackie looks around at the variety of targets; ranging from ship dioramas of various types, to a small urban environment, to just generic swinging target practice, with the whole section surrounded by further armor on the walls and a shield inside covering it all to prevent any errant shots. “First test is going to be your dual wrist mounted Armiger MK IV QF anti-infantry cannons. Modified to fire twice as fast, hence the QF for quick fire, so in total you have 8 times the fire of a single Armiger MK IV.” Monroe states happily as she starts up the basic firing range. 

Jackie grins as the panels of the grey ‘boxes’ on her wrists slide up and two barrels slide out from each with several more panels folding out to reveal heat sinks. She raises her arms as her vision changes slightly, letting her see from each of the wrist mounted guns at the same time as her ‘normal’ eyes. “Woah...that’s different. Am I supposed to have three different views?” She asks curiously, moving her arms around. 

“Yes, you are. It’s to help you aim your weapons no matter which angle the enemy is coming from.” Monroe nods. “Test begins in 3.” Jackie quickly shifts her aim forward again. “2. 1.” The first hologram forms and Jackie fires off a searing purple package of plasma from one barrel, followed rapidly by the shriek of ionized air with a high-pitch clap of thunder upon them passing through the hologram and exploding on the ground behind it, making the range’s shield ripple. A couple more pass like that before physical targets appear and she’s allowed to mow them down, the rapid fire of her guns sounding like a hissing banshee as she melts through the metal targets and knocks them down within 5 seconds before her guns stop firing and the air around the heat sinks is visibly boiling. 

“Uh...I don’t think the air’s supposed to look like it’s on fire around the heat sinks?” Jackie asks with some concern. 

“What? Shit! Eject the cannons before they explode!” Monroe ducks behind the console for extra protection as Jackie mentally detaches both sides of the boxes, hurling them around her hands to flip into the range where the overheating containment mechanisms promptly explode just in front of her, shrapnel deflecting off her flinching frame’s own shielding. “Fuck. They told me they fixed that!” Monroe growls as she peeks back over the console. “You alright?” 
 
“Yeah. Little bit shaken though.” She nods. “Couldn’t feel them heating up beyond the sight of it, and never fun to have stuff fly at you at high speeds. Thank you and the mechanics and other engineers for shielding though. Only dropped 5 percent...that’s a damn big explosion from those things.” 

“You’re welcome, and those *are* 4 plasma accelerators. Not like it’s a .50 cal.” Monroe retorts. “Or well, I suppose 40mm HE cannons would be a far more accurate example of what they act like.” She adds, tapping her chin a bit. “I’ll get the mission record after we’re done and see what went wrong. Now, your Type-9 Fire-lance particle accelerator cannons.” She instructs Jackie, who eagerly folds the turreted, blocky weapons from her ‘pack’ and over her shoulders. Dull, orange lights appear along the length as she moves sideways to the armor panels before taking aim and those lights quickly glow bright orange in rapid sequence as the beams erupt from the focusing barrels to cleave through the freighter, corvette, frigate, cruiser, and battleship dioramas one after the other before slamming into the shield on the back wall and shattering it to crater the meters of armor in the very back of the firing range. Silence fills the room, broken only by the hissing sparks of an overwhelmed shield emitter nearby. 

“...I think your default is a bit too strong.” Jackie states after a few seconds and checks her power levels; the hexagons of black and grey are now visible once again. “In .025 seconds of firing at 50% strength, each particle accelerator cannon drained 25% of my power, leaving me at 48%.” She looks at Monroe. “I’m thinking I should have these batteries split up a bit as opposed to all in one grouping, so that I don’t end up going dead from shooting a weapon too much.” 

“That sounds like a good idea.” Monroe nods as several mechanics rush into the room, followed by repair mechs to get to work fixing stuff. “Let’s uh. Let’s leave the melee testing for tomorrow, so they can get this all fixed up.” She suggests and walks toward the door again. Jackie follows, swishing her tail gently behind her. 

“Alright. Obstacle course?” She asks excitedly. “I want to run, to feel the power this thing holds!” 

“Obstacle course.” Monroe nods. “I’m going to stay inside my blast armor, just in case, if that’s alright with you.” 

“It is. You’re far squishier than I am now.” Jackie shrugs as Monroe climbs the stairs up to the walkway Jackie used earlier, putting the human just a little higher than the 4.572 meter tall raptor mech. 

“Thank you. Obstacle course is left at the T-junction at the end of this hall.” She continues walking. 

“Want to ride on my shoulders? It’ll go faster.” Jackie asks her, looking over with a smile. 

“On your shoulders? Uh. I... don’t see why not. It’ll test your strength more...” Monroe replies, surprised at the question as Jackie holds an arm up and over her, letting the human grab onto her hand before moving Monroe up and over her head and carefully lowering the woman onto her shoulder. Monroe sits with her legs around Jackie’s neck, like a child when given a piggy-back ride. “Alright. Now Mush!” Monroe grins, quickly getting over her surprise before whooping in excitement as Jackie breaks into a jog, moving far faster than any human could run within single-digit-seconds of moving. 

“This is awesome!” Jackie grins, her tongue hanging out of her mouth a bit to flap in the wind, much to Monroe’s amusement when she notices. 

“Yes, yes, it is! Slow down before you end up falling over on the turn!” Monroe responds and Jackie begins to slow her jog down to a walk. Thankfully the halls had quickly emptied while she was meeting her mechsuit, so there were few people to potentially hit, and all of those were up along the walkways out of the way anyway. She turns left and walks toward the doors at the end reading ‘Obstacle Course’, but does turn her head to look down the other way and see ‘Proving Grounds’ at the end of that way. The doors open as they approach to reveal a variety of heavily reinforced climbing equipment and obstacles.  

“So, this is the Obstacle Course... Uh, what’s in the Proving Grounds?” She asks as she looks around. 

“Yup, just like your basic, albeit far bigger and more reinforced. As for the Proving Grounds, those are literally every kind of environment we have encountered on planets. From Venus, Mars, Deserts, Tundra, and other natural stuff, to unnatural like an ecumenopolis.” 

“Woah. Sounds like a fun place to test stuff.” She smiles as she crouches down to let Monroe slide off down her back. 

“I’m sure the 10 of you will enjoy it, especially the live fire portion.” She replies, briefly unfolding her faceplate to show her smirking. 

“...Live fire might be fun...” She murmurs, sounding a bit nervous before starting to stretch, which is most likely from habit. 

“I’ll go get the timers set up while you limber up. Not that you really need it since those electromorphic muscles will never grow stiff and will stay flexible for decades with proper maintenance.” 

“Well, I wanna know how flexible I am anyway.” She replies as she bends forward far enough to look up at her tail. “...Of course, my ass is shapely too. Can’t have anything less than the perfect shape for a woman huh?” 

“Don’t look at me. I just made the muscles and batteries, it’s the other engineers that designed how the female and male versions should look. Specifically, the Kruvent Collective.” 

“The Kruvent Collective? Those techno-religious buggy fellas?” 

“The very same.” Monroe nods as she taps away at a console. “They copied the body shapes of those who got picked for guarding the Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers since they’re considered the most ideal forms of military prowess.” 

“And the reason I’ve got the tits and ass of a lingerie model?” 

“An intern got a hold of the models for the female designs.” She replies with a shrug. “They got reprimanded, but by the time it was found out, it was too late for the first models.” 

“Of course.” She grumbles as she finishes. “Well, which should I start with?” She looks over at Monroe. 

“Hmm...Try the sprint track. Let’s see how fast you can run.” Monroe replies, happy to get back on track and away from awkward questions. 

Jackie grins and walks over to the long, straight path with several cameras and sensors along the length to track acceleration and speed. She takes a runner’s start and waits for Monroe to give her the count down. 

“3. 2. 1.” Monroe counts down. “GO!” Jackie shoots off, and within three powerful strides is at a top speed of 250km/h, finishing the whole 100-meter track in under two seconds. And promptly tripping when she hits loose sand at the end of it to go sprawling and kicking up a nice wave and cloud of dust. 

“Ow...Note to self. It takes more to slow down than to speed up...” She groans as she sits up and spits out sand from her mouth. 

“You ok?!” Monroe calls and begins running toward her. 

“Yeah! I’m fine!” She calls back and gets up. “You built this thing tough! It’ll take more than that to break a joint or bone or whatever!” 

“Ok! Good! Uh. Try the climbing walls next then!” She turns around to walk back, seeing that Jackie is alright. 

“Ok!” Jackie jogs down the track toward the large metal walls of handholds and ropes. “Just like in basic indeed...” She murmurs, looking at them. “I wonder if I can jump them.” 

“High Jumps are next to them! Do those after!” 

“Alright!” She moves up and waits for the next countdown. 

“3! 2! 1! Go!” Monroe finishes counting down and Jackie easily hauls herself up with just her arms over the shortest wall, moving to the next one and grabbing the rope with one arm to haul herself up to get her free hand up onto the top of the wall and goes over again, before repeating the method as much as possible over the remainder, finishing faster than she did as a human despite the course being longer and taller. “That was good!” Monroe calls. “Jump the next ones!” 

Jackie happily jogs back and moves to the high jumps before easily clearing the 1.8m hurdle by stepping over it, jumping over 2m, and soon finds she’s capable of clearing 10 meters from a standing jump. 15 meters is within her ability to reach up and grab before pulling herself up and is the end of the course. 

“Woah. Those muscles are damn strong.” Monroe announces while wiggling a bit. “You’ll be a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield to be sure! Especially once you figure out how to brake.” She teases Jackie. “Now, your balance while walking, jogging, and running.” She gestures to 100 meters of logs. “And after that your vertical climbing ability with those claws on a slick metal wall.” 

“Sounds fun to me!” She replies, having finished jogging back as Monroe was talking. She gets up onto the platform in front of the log and begins walking down it at a normal stride, before jogging back, and finally running. Her claws leave obvious marks in it, due to using them to help keep her balance. 

“Good, good.” Monroe nods and gestures to the vertical climb. Jackie’s powerful, metal talons dig in with ease and she begins pulling herself up, but just drags her claws down through the metal, leaving jagged gashes and thumping her nose into it quite hard. 

“Ow...” She groans and picks herself up off the floor. “I think the metal is too weak...” 

“...But that’s frigate grade armor!” Monroe says in shock. “And you didn’t even have the energy talons active! We might have gone a little overboard on the sharpness...” She muses. “Although you do weigh 5 tons, so weight is almost certainly part of it too. Well. Uh. Since we can’t finish this, I’ll ask them to change it to slabs of different grades. Freighter, Frigate, Cruiser, and Battleship and we’ll come back later after the ZG training room so you can practice space flight.” 

“Hell yeah! Zero G flight is awesome! And what I’ve trained for.” She grins, wiggling excitedly after bounding over to Monroe before picking her up and placing the human onto her shoulders again. “Which way?” 

“It’s next to the Proving Grounds. On the left wall where there’s the most room.” Monroe answers and gets back into her sitting position as Jackie walks off toward the room. Once inside after a short walk, Jackie sets Monroe down so the technician can get to the console controlling the gravity panels inside the main section of the room, and the raptor mech steps inside, eagerly waiting while bouncing on her feet. “I’d suggest you stand still so you don’t hit the ceiling.” Monroe laughs as she begins slowly lowering the gravity as walls rise up to prevent Jackie from exiting the ZG section of the room. 

“Right!” Jackie stops until her sensors register no gravity in the area and folds her leg, arm, and back mounted thrusts out to take off and begin testing how moving with them works, then shifts to fake dogfighting, including the very necessary pew-pew and near miss vvvVVFvvvv noises from her mouth. As she ‘dogfights’, her maneuvers get tighter and faster until she’s well past the ‘starfighters rip apart and pilots turn to bruised goo’ limit. 

“Definitely going to be a force to be reckoned with. I’m going to turn up the gravity now to test your lift off capabilities. Please get close to the floor and we’ll see how much force you can produce.” 

Jackie slows down and shifts to press against the floor as gravity is returned to Earth normal before getting up and managing to take off with ease. “So, I’ll be able to take off with anything below Earth gravity.” Jackie grins at Monroe, who nods and begins turning it up a bit each time until, even with a jump, Jackie slowly sinks back down. 

“So, you can’t even achieve neutral thrust at 35m/s^2.... Well, you won’t have much issue on just about every land-able planet then.” Monroe smiles at her. 

“Sweet!” Jackie grins and gravity is restored to normal again so she can leave the room. “What next?” 

“Next is to see if they’ve fixed the vertical climb, and if they haven’t, I’ll go look over the data of your mission recorder while we wait and take a break from all this.” Monroe smiles. “Please pick me up.” She holds her arms out to the side to make it easier for Jackie to do so and they’re off to the Obstacle Course once again.  

Upon looking in, they see workers busy changing out the panels, so they move to the console and Monroe hooks Jackie to it in order to look over the mission recorder and see what happened to the guns and the various forces she experienced and all that wonderful engineering data. 

“Ok. So, we might need to just go back to the normal Armiger MK IVs instead of the QF versions for now. Or just 1 QF per wrist mounting to avoid the backed-up heatsink. That happened in atmosphere, out in space it would take far less time, so that needs to be fixed immediately.” Monroe sighs. “Or we extend the heatsinks significantly and possibly include a quick-change disposable one....” She muses to herself, summoning a hologram from her wrist and beginning to quickly design a new set up. “Or just the quick-change disposable ones in what you’re currently equipped with. What do you think?” 

“Bigger heatsinks and the quick-change disposable ones. Means I get to shoot for longer.” Jackie replies after a few seconds. 

“Alright. Normal Armiger MK IVs or QFs?” Monroe asks, looking up at her. 

“Normal ones for now, again, shoot longer. Shooting fast doesn’t help with long term suppression which I probably will have to do quite often.” She replies as soon as Monroe finishes speaking. 

“Ok! I’ll send this to the fabricators and we’ll see about getting them fixed to your forearms.” She opens her faceplate so Jackie can see her smiling. “Everything else looks good, well within tolerances.” She tells her before looking over at the workers. “Oh good. They're done. Let’s see what will hold your weight.” 

Jackie smiles and moves over to try climbing again, skipping the freighter and frigate armor to go for the cruiser. She manages to slowly climb it, but misses with her foot, jerking her down and sending her shredding her way to the ground again. “Damn it.” She huffs. “I’m not even cutting halfway through it and it’s hardly holding my weight. It’s probably going to be similar with the battleship armor.” 

“Well, won’t hurt to try it. Battleship armor has a different outer surface.” Monroe replies and Jackie moves over to it, the outer surface of the battleship plating squeezing around her claws and managing to support her weight. 

“Oh cool!” She grins as she climbs up with significantly more ease. “Battleship plating is able to support me.” 

“That’s good to know.” She nods. “But it won’t when your energy talons cut through it. So, let’s go back to the firing range to test that since it should all be fixed now. It’s been four hours.” 

“Alright! Want me to jog back again?” Jackie asks excitedly as she jumps off and lands in front of Monroe with ease and hardly needing to flex her legs. 

“Eep! Yes!” She squeaks at the sudden jump, falling out of her chair. “Ow.” She holds a hand up and Jackie easily pulls her back to her feet, then picks her up and jogs out of the Obstacle Course to the firing range. They arrive in less than half a minute, slightly less time than going the other direction due to Jackie knowing more about how her new body functions and reacts, and she walks into the newly fixed room. In the back, a differently colored armor panel shows where the impact had taken place. 

“Alright, go and cut through the different dioramas with your energy talons.” Monroe grins as she settles down in the sensor and control console. Jackie grins back and jumps over to the freighter diorama, all her claws’ gaps in the cutting edges flashing orange and the blades leap into place to start melting and slicing through, as well as crumpling it under her weight as she lands on top. Within seconds the ‘ship’ is sliced into two halves with every room exposed to nonexistent vacuum. She runs to the frigate which is right after the freighter and it offers barely any more resistance before she’s ruined the interior of that and off to the cruiser. The energy blades of her large toe talons make short work of the meter-thick plating and she’s removed a good chunk of the hull before rampaging through it as well, cutting the ceilings open to provide space for her inside it. After that, it’s off to the battleship for a slightly longer time thanks to stronger and even thicker armor. She Sparta kicks a 3-meter-thick bulkhead designed to slow or stop a bow cannon round from another battleship after slicing and melting through all sides of it and happily walking out as she dismisses her energy talons. 

“...You ripped through all of those in 5 minutes.” Monroe stares at one of her screens. “Wow. Just one of you will be deadly in boarding actions, and that’s not including ranged weapons or having a TR1-CR4 following behind you with a shield protecting you further.” 

“I take it that’s good?” She happily bounds over like an excited puppy. 

“That’s *very* good.” Monroe nods. “Well, that’s everything to test for today. We’ll do the Proving Grounds once the others are done with their tests. I’ll take you to your room and then you can go to sleep for the night. 

“Alright.” Jackie replies and moves to follow her.

Yes. It is supposed to end like that. A perfect 5k words including the title. Couldn't bring myself to break that."
d9ts11,1,2019-09-26,I [22F] live with my parents and I want to move with no income (long story),Ashwood19,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/d9ts11/i_22f_live_with_my_parents_and_i_want_to_move/,"I desperately need advice because I'm caught between one heck of a rock and a hard place.

So I just finished university this past May with my BA in Anthropology. I didn't have a job lined up right after college because I didn't know if I was going to be living at home or two hours away. Health issues kicked in, I couldn't get work for a couple of months, and around July/August I felt comfortable with searching a job.

Note: At this point, I've only been employed once, and it was on a six to eight month internship. There was a variety of reasons why, I won't go into detail. You just need to know that I basically have no job experience and it wasn't entirely my fault.

My hometown and surrounding areas -- rural, mind you -- proved to be more than difficult to try to find work. So when I went back to my college town (two hours away) to visit some friends here over the last week or so, I ended up at a career fair where I felt I could possibly secure one of the jobs there. The starting pay is estimated to be $15/hr, unlike the jobs I applied for at home that started around $10/hr. 

I'm seriously considering moving because I have three friends living together that were offering to let me stay with them if I could land this job. It would give me a roof over my head and they would help cover my food expenses for the first month while I wait for my first paycheck to hit.

So to the whole point of the story... my mother isn't happy about it. Both of my parents have no income whatsoever and wouldn't be able to front any of my medical expenses and so on, especially since I have no health insurance. They haven't been able to assist in my pursuit of a license or a vehicle, and additional family members haven't stepped in to help with the problem.

I'm in a position where I may also have to put the house mortgage in my name to avoid problems should both my parents find themselves in an assisted living situation (both are about 50+yo). 

I'm not saying I know better. I'm not saying that I know what's best in this situation. I want the advice of those that have experience with this dilemma, especially from those that may have come from poverty-stricken communities. I really would appreciate any help whatsoever. I'm sorry for this being so long, it's just that there's a long history that led up to this and is complicating the issues. If there's *anything* I missed that would help clarify this situation any further, please let me know and I'll add whatever is missing.


tl;dr: I have a job I'm about to apply for two hours away that I'm likely to get, one parent isn't happy and is afraid of me going into the world alone. Neither have any income whatsoever, I have no job experience. We all grew up in poverty. I want to make the best possible decision, but I have a lot of things I need versus what I could have if I got the job."

In my experience at least, computer science at the university level has a hard time teaching concepts at the theoretical and conceptual levels, as well as at the practical level.  A lot of professors read off slides or just expect you to google things.



By the time you get to your first full time job, there is so much self-learning going on and learning from co-workers that I feel that college was largely for nothing except getting me an internship that lead to full time work.  I definitely feel like I could do this job without a degree since I started programming in high school and was already well used to googling answers to my problems.



Even though hiring for tech is largely skill based, it is also largely degree based.  Look at how huge the university programs for tech companies are, which provide a good amount of candidates for their entry level positions."
da0lq6,6,2019-09-27,"Postponing graduation, adding a minor, talking to Ntafos",jjolteon,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/da0lq6/postponing_graduation_adding_a_minor_talking_to/,"Hey all, I'm in a bit of a sticky situation and would like to hear y'alls opinion/advice about it.

Basically, I applied to graduate this semester since my degree is finished. I'm a CS major. I had planned on getting an internship of some sort for Spring 2020. I'm planning on going to graduate school at UT in Fall 2020 so I can't exactly get a full time job. Anyway, the prospects of a Spring 2020 internship were looking bleak so I asked my advisor if I could withdraw my grad application so I can at least take some more CS classes to bide my time. They said no, UTD has the right to graduate any student that has completed the requirements. I asked if wanting to spend the rest of my scholarship money was grounds for postponing, still no.

So I had the idea of adding a minor to my degree. I'm one credit away from ean Information Assurance minor and one credit away from a Software Engineering minor, but I'd probably go with information assurance. I asked my advisor if I could add a minor (I know you can usually just do this from Orion, but I [can't since I've applied to graduate](https://www.utdallas.edu/registrar/files/Undergraduate-Change-of-Major-update-major-sub-plans-and-minor.pdf)) and they said I'd have to talk to Dr. Ntafos to get a minor approved at this point, and they don't know if he'll approve it, but I'm welcome to try.

So now I have to talk to the myth, the legend himself, Dr. Ntafos. I believe I'm a pretty good student with a 3.8 gpa if that helps at all. Does anyone have any advice as to how I should go about this? What I should say, what information I should include, what I should omit? Should I do email or an irl appointment?

This whole situation has come about mostly because of poor planning. I don't know why, but I was trying to get done with classes as fast as possible despite having 4 years of scholarship. It was definitely a case of working hard and not working smart.

Regardless, any advice?"

I think it's safe to say that you could call me a failure. Repeated 2 years, one in primary school and one in high school. Quit an education I was really positive about because I was failing both my grades and my internship due to my lazyness and my gaming addiction, was too lax to find an alternative education, spent a year half-assing work 5 days a week, doing nothing to find out what I wanted to do with my life, joining an education that I wasn't too sure about in the first place, only to find out that I had no clue what I am doing there.

I lie about a lot of things, mostly my well being, primarly to my parents, sibling and friends. I'm not happy, not at all. I have my moments, but that's about it. It's caused by a lot of things, afraid to come out as bi to my father who I live with, the constant lack of urge to do something except lie in my bed, jerk off or play video games, not having any fucking clue of what I'm doing with my life, not learning from my mistakes, repeating those mistakes.

I'm very scared. I'm pretty sure that I'll run out of options eventually, that nobody will help me out because I keep making the same dumb mistakes over and over again, that I'll end up on the streets, and that I'll most likely end up killing myself because I see no future in me. 

I don't know what to do. I don't see the change in myself, I can't bring myself to do it."

I'm currently a freshman applying to internships (need to work on my resume though) and have already had a CS internship

In an ideal world, I'd probably just apply to whatever internships there are, but I have little to no experience with data structures / algos. Or I can't remember what I did with them / all the little things

I can’t do Leetcode medium. Leetcode easy is kind of hard for me sometimes. I often forget how to basic stuff like getting the length of an array or a string. 

I've been learning C++ at school and I've been out of practice with Python (my preferred language) so that doesn't help with that whole situation. I'm probably going to try to build a small project to get back into it though 

I have pretty terrible working memory honestly (I swear I'm not *that* bad at CS though)

To put it bluntly, I’d rather not traumatically fail any technical interviews because I don't have the ability to bullshit an answer 

The earliest I'll be taking (an actual) data structures / algos is next semester (at best) or next fall 

I’d study all the material myself, but I've been struggling to acclimate to college and the whole time management thing. Also my concentration is nonexistent half the time and I commute around 2.5 hours a day

As a result I'm not sure I could realistically study and *retain* as much as I’d necessary for technical interviews

I’m currently leaning towards just applying for first/second year programs, but I’m kind of concerned my experience would make me seem “overqualified” for them, despite me not knowing enough to pass a normal technical interview

Also, I know FBU asks for your high school transcript, and I have some truly abysmal math grades on there. If that’s also the case with the rest of them, I’m fucked to put it nicely

I'm not really sure what the best course of action would be, so I'd really appreciate any advice regarding my situation!"

da2hz3,243,2019-09-27,61b saga explained,codininja1337,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/da2hz3/61b_saga_explained/,"***NOTE: [this is only for those who have seen all the memes/posts but don’t really know the full back story].

So basically Hilfinger released project 0, an “extended finger exercise”, and people got to work on it (most in the last 5 days from the looks of it). The project was completely new (never done before in 61b) and thus the AIs/ some TAs were not very informed on the project and thus couldn’t really help students. This problem snowballed into a hours long wait times in OH and 100s of piazza questions going unanswered. So this sets up the initial shitshow as this is a project that probably 10 people in the entire world know about/can really help (and the main one is the professor but he’s too busy to help). 

Office hours got packed with wait times of up to 20+ hours (wtf I know right). Also there was an incident where a student apparently made an AI (academic intern) cry because they couldn’t help the student with the project code... this is terrible already.

NOW, to make matters worse, the autograder they provided was giving people incorrect scores as it wasn’t running the correct tests (EDIT: see comment below for the reason the autograder wasn’t correct). This meant that for certain cases, removing certain portions of your code actually increased your score! 

Students quickly realized this and explicitly asked TAs on piazza if they should make changes to their code to ensure the highest autograder score, even if it might not be what they think is correct. TAs responded saying yes and that the autograder score runs no additional hidden tests and that it will be the FINAL score/grade for this project. Several students on piazza noted how the autograder isn’t fully accurate and actually encouraged staff to re-release a version of the autograder that rewards people who finished the whole project (aka this is where the people who “snitched” on the autograder meme comes from lol). 

Fast forward to a short period after the original deadline for the project, the staff decides to FREEZE the current autograder logs and “modify” or fix it. They claim your score will not go down. Now this is very concerning for the people who followed the advice above about doing whatever it takes to get the highest autograder score as this score might now be changing. Additionally, people turning their project in late could now not see the results as all autograder logs were frozen until they released this new version like 1-2 days later. Rip. 

To top it all off, several students were telling others on piazza that they deserved a low grade if they tried to exploit the autograder and that they should drop the class if they think it’s too hard. This was essentially the gist of the piazza drama between students. One student even emergency dropped the class and left a huge note on piazza highlighting the issues with this course and CS at cal in general... 

Anyways, so now the staff has decided to hire more staff to help ease the long waiting times and has stopped working on individual code debugging in OH and has switched to conceptual help only. Seems like a step in the right direction. 

Overall a classic hilfinger experience. I’ll update y’all on more as we go through the year lmao."

I've applied to &gt;250 jobs (in various states) since this February, and have only heard back from \~20% of them.

Of the few I've heard back from, half have been immediate denials, and the other have gotten me in the office or on a video call for an interview.  I've had multiple people (professors, resume advisors, career advisors) look at and help me refine my resume so it looks nice and passes the automated systems as much as possible, but it still seems my resume (and all of my cover letters) aren't enough.  This especially seems true, because as soon as I get in the office, I get through all the interviews really well, pass the coding challenges, and make it to a references stage.

But, still, I somehow end up always receiving an email saying the exact same thing, that the company is ""unable to continue the hiring process"" for the position now, but they will contact me if the position opens up again in the future.

I will admit that I am somewhat picky in that I do not want to work for a defense contractor in any manner in which I will help build weapons, work on drones, etc, and while I would prefer not to work at an ""Implementation Company"" (ie Epic, Fast Enterprises), even those companies wouldn't hire me when I've applied.  Same story with internships as well.

I go to meetups, I network like crazy, I'm constantly working on personal projects for fun and to keep myself relevant, I update my resume frequently; I feel like I'm really trying hard.  I'm even taking on some low pay contract work and working retail to try and keep my head above water in the meantime, but I'm still heading way downhill with that.

I came out as a lesbian about a year ago and things have been downhill ever since then. I still live with my parents and am a sophomore in college. Before I came out, we had a deal that as long as I was going to school/working and paying them rent, I could stay at home. Now, every single little argument I have with my mom or dad is a reason to kick me out on the street. I have no other family I can go to- both of my grandmother's are broke and can barely survive themselves. I was abused by my older cousin as a child and I would rather not have to move in with her, but she's probably the only person I could go to if I couldn't find anything else. The rest of my family is either too homophobic or too broke to take me in, even temporarily. I have a job now, but it only pays me something like $40-$150 a week and is extremely variable as its an as-needed sort of thing. I go to community college full time and don't exactly want to have to drop out after I've already payed my tuition for this semester, but if I have to in order to get a real job then I guess I'll just have to suck it up and do it.I don't qualify for financial aid, my birth parents(the people kicking me out) make too much money. I also probably wouldn't qualify for governmental aid like food stamps, either, for quite some time as my dad doesn't file his taxes on time and continually claims me as a dependent. We've argued over it in the past, because I've wanted to move out but haven't been able to build up the savings I need to get a place to stay. My parents wouldn't help me then and they definitely won't help me now. Where should I go to get some genuine assistance? What sort of things could I do to make it easier on myself? I'd hate to have to sell everything I own because all of the things I could actually get money for are things that I need for school, or gifts that my parents bought me and they would throw a fit if I sold them so that I could afford a place to live. I feel almost like they want me to be homeless and are using this as some sort of punishment now. I don't know what I did wrong. The fight that brought it on today happened after my mom woke me up from a nap I took for about an hour after work this morning. I've been living in fear for some time now because every little disagreement or annoyance with my mother becomes an excuse to kick me out. I'm devastated and I feel totally helpless. I've been in therapy for about 2 years and am in debt from that already, despite still being eligible to bill my parents insurance for it. I'll definitely have to quit therapy when I move. I'm about $1000 in debt from copays, and I have to pay $500 in less than a month for the rest of my tuition this semester. I have $40 in savings at the moment. The car I've been driving to work and school is registered in my parents' name and they absolutely will not let me keep it when they kick me out. Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR basically the title, plus I have -$1460 in my bank account now and will soon be without a car.

Update: It's been a few months and I'd just like to thank everyone for their responses and support. I've managed to get help, both financially and with school. I've managed to pay back my medical debt and I even have a couple hundred in savings now from my job- I had to start another job to do this, but it's going well and I'm definitely making more than minimum wage now. I'm hoping to start an internship with a national lab this summer. I took some of your advice and filed my own taxes- this year there's a new thing in my state for tuition reimbursement, so what I've spent on tuition for 2019 I'll likely get back at the end of the fiscal year which is a little over a thousand dollars. I completed last semester with some help from my teachers. After making my post I set up appointments to talk to every single teacher I had that semester and explain my situation. I was able to get some extensions on projects and an extension for my tuition payment, so I managed to do well in my courses. My GPA actually improved after that semester instead of dropping like I was afraid it would. I've gotten help from some LGBT organizations near me and have started the process of transferring to a 4-year University that's in the state. I've applied for scholarships for STEM students this semester as well, and am just waiting for them to be paid out, as well as applying for every single transfer scholarship available to me. I definitely won't get them all, and even if I do qualify for most of them I can only use one at the university I'm transferring to so I'll just enjoy my one-time grants and take the highest scholarship so I can hopefully move out into the dorms and out of my aunt's garage. She was sympathetic to the situation and let me move into the little garage-conversion apartment she has back there as long as I pay utilities and buy my own groceries/help her buy groceries for the two of us. I've been staying above water and things are looking up. I really want to thank everyone who responded with advice and encouragement, I really really appreciate it."

I know that there is a couple internships here in the UK that first years can apply to and from what I've heard chances for first years to land an internship aren't even all that bad, especially if you look for one in the thriving start up community.

dahidg,4,2019-09-28,Am I emotionally unfit for the workplace?,throwawaylifeat30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dahidg/am_i_emotionally_unfit_for_the_workplace/,"So there are 3 instances that concern me:

Instance 1: On the first week of my internship (it was my first work environment), I freaked out towards the middle of the week in the sense where it seemed like I was struggling to adapt to my new environment. I didn't know what the expectations were of me. I got really scared because I thought I was screwing up by not immediately understanding the company culture and what my department does. I was too afraid to ask questions because I thought it would make me look like an idiot and undependable. Manager was worried that I wasn't asking any questions (did not verbally tell me that, told the other intern that). Felt like my co-workers gave up on me. After a few weeks, I felt better, finally understood my situation, and adapted. 

Instance 2: This happened during the same internship however 5-6 weeks into the internship. The department is very small (think only 3 people). Everyone went on vacation around the same time so it was me, the other intern, and maybe 1 employee from the department around. So, this employee is regarded as the expert who is the most knowledgeable about the field in the department. Ever since the start of the internship, I'd always greet everyone in the morning and say goodbye after every work day. I have a feeling that this guy didn't expect much out of me after the first 1-2 weeks where he asked me ""do you have knowledge of X and Y"" and I said no to most of his questions because I don't. I had problems starting up my work, asking him for help (after spending literally 1-2 days trying to fix it) and he seemed very frustrated after going through that. The 2nd intern comes in a few weeks after I did and I notice that hes treating her better than he treated me. Hes more willing to help her out and he gives her compliments (never gave me any compliments).
At lunch, I'm always hanging out with her (she wants me to hang out with her). When he walks by our table, always greets her, NEVER greets me. Once I noticed that, it started to get to me because I felt like I wasn't making progress on my project at work and wasn't doing a good job (because none of my co-workers wanted to help or check up on me). Basically, I felt like their treatment of me was a reflection the quality of my work. So, one day, in the afternoon, I was getting very frustrated that I wasn't making progress and was feeling depressed due to this and thought about how lonely I was and my emotions and anxiety peaked. I think I almost had a panic attack at that moment. I couldn't take it anymore so I left work a little early. 

Instance #3: I had a job fair today. The very last recruiter (of the day) I talked to happened to be the manager for the department that I wanted to work at so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to sell myself since the job position was listed as hiring majors not including mine. I talk to the recruiter and tell her my elevator pitch as shes reading through my resume. She cuts me off and in my head, I'm thinking ""uh-oh"". She starts asking me very specific technical programming questions that I have no experience in. I literally screw up my answers because I wasn't expecting such questions at a job fair. I was hoping that she'd ask me about my experience. So after I wrongly answer her technical questions, she asks me for my cumulative GPA. She tells me to just apply online. I ask her if theres any improvements I can make to my resume and she says ""for your major, you apply to Z"".I ask her ""well, how about the job position X (which I mentioned at the start of the conversation)"". She then responds ""oh, we don't hire your major for that role."" I have a surprised expression on my face (I shouldn't have shown a response) and I thank her for her time (abruptly ending because I saw that there was no point in talking to her any longer). After that, I walked away feeling like crap. I would not show my emotions like that at a professional event because it looks really bad on me but I was having a bad day at the start and this was one of the companies I was really interested in applying for.

So, overall, I'm worried that my behaviors mentioned above
are too emotional for a work place environment. When things are good, I feel good. But when things are bad, I feel really bad and get a little emotional. Is this a big issue?

TL;DR:    I freaked out on 1st week of my internship because I felt overwhelmed from not understanding their expectations (it was my first professional experience).  I almost had a panic attack at work 6 weeks into internship because I wasn't making progress on my work and one of my co-workers was mistreating me which made me feel depressed.  I abruptly ended a conversation with a recruiter once she said she wasn't hiring my major for the position I wanted but made an unhappy facial expression (wasn't having a good day and felt somewhat depressed)."

I'm seeking help/ideas in learning all of the following technologies in small, incremental bites so that I can build a very small and simple web app using them. I am in an internship right now and want to develop using these technologies:

* C#
* ASP.NET (internship doesn't use ASP.NET Core, so I don't have to worry about that at this point in time)
* SQL Server (although I don't actually use SQL Server, it's more like SSMS)
* Front End: HTML5/CSS/JavaScript

I do have some experience with learning to code/automate things via PowerShell and that knowledge of programming carries over well to C#, just need to learn the basic syntax, concepts, technical jargon, OOP using C#, and practice to get better at it.

The Other experience is messing around with SQL a little bit when I was doing a training for it, in Oracle (and some recently using SQL Server 2017 and SSMS), but need to review that again).

I am learning a little bit of ASP.NET using PluralSight but it turns out some of what is used on the job did not align with what I was training myself to do, and simultaneously I discovered C# is a bigger gap that I need to work on than ASP.NET (I'll be picking up ASP.NET here and there through tutorials, reading and practice and asking questions about it on the internship.

I was thinking I could build a simple front-end for the AdventureWorks database and see if I can manipulate the data in some of the columsn of the database through the web app? Does that make sense to go that route to learn the above mentioned technologies over time? 

Tools I am already using:

* Visual Studio 2019 for coding/.aspx/.aspx.cs/.ascx/.ascx.cs files
* also using VS for database migrations (but I don't know how to run them, set them up, etc)
* Gitbash for windows - haven't set this up yet...still experimenting with setting up my directory structure first
* TortoiseGit for comparing files to diff, etc

Anything else r/learnprogramming would suggest? Now I need to figure out how to combine the tools/sample databases and actually make a small front-end that connects with a working database to understand how these technologies work."
dak5ff,0,2019-09-28,"I'm 18 and been working as a Software Engineer for 4 years now, not sure if I should go to uni or not.",em_1477,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dak5ff/im_18_and_been_working_as_a_software_engineer_for/,"As the title says, I'm a bit unsure about going to college or not. I'm in my final high school year, and I have to make a decision pretty quick.  


 To give you some context, I live in Eastern Europe. I started to code at the age of 9, and at 14 I received an offer for a junior position as a web dev.  
Later on, at 16 I quit my job and accepted another offer from another company. It's also important to tell that in my country very few companies have their own products, we basically do a lot of outsourcing work (Aka we're hired by other companies to develop their projects, mainly because we're cheaper). Considering this, I got to work on a lot of large-scale apps, for huge brands that I'm sure you heard of.  


Now, at the age of 18 I switched companies again, I went from Web to Mobile ( React Native ) now working on a large-scale really popular Uber-like app. My current title is ""Senior Software Engineer"".  


Considering all of the above, I'm really not that motivated by going to uni. At my previous company one of my responsabilites was to train interns and juniors on Javascript stuff. I was pretty surprised when I noticed that most of the fresh students can't be used on real projects because of how unprepared they were coming straight of uni.  


Getting another job in my country is also pretty easy, I receive at least 3-4 offers on linkedin per day. I'm also paid extremely well.  Considering all of this, is there any worth on going to uni? I'm mainly asking this because even though I've been coding for a while now, I still feel like I'm not good enough because I don't have a degree."
daka86,2,2019-09-28,What are some reasonable and realistic expectations an intern and employer should have for a successful internship in Software Development?,powershell_account,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/daka86/what_are_some_reasonable_and_realistic/,"I say that because there are companies out there wanting interns who are really contractors who are paid low and are some how able to do the job hitting the floor running in their first day/first week/first month without having some kind of a support structure for a successful experience in their internship...and unfortunately these unrealistic expectations do not help the employer, the intern and the employees.

I understand not all companies have that kind of capacity to run an intern program in Software Dev. when their own devs are so swamped with work that taking their time away from their own work means their work gets delayed to help a Software Dev. intern.

So, with that being said, has anyone here have had a successful internship experience where it led to a full-time with your company and if you would be so kind to share your experience?

What were your expectations before going into the internship of your potential employer?

What was your employer's expectations of you before they hired you as a Software intern? 

How did you know you were assigned with tasks that were fit to your level of skills?

Did you have any feedback or issues within your internship phase where you felt there was something you needed to address with your manager? If yes, how did you go about doing this so that it paved a path to your success?

This is my throwaway account as my main is known by friends.

So far, I worked as a backend engineer for total of 1 year at start ups, was a pre-sales intern 5 months in a cloud provider and junior devops since last summer at a fortune500 company.

**I will add details, but please skip to ""What next?"" if you are not interested.** I am adding the details, as most probably I will be talking about this all during an interview.

**1- Details: Overall I am happy with my current company.**

What I do is mainly on-call, api integrations related to monitoring, and full stack design and development of internal monitoring and management portals as a junior engineer. Product automation (infra, installation, upgrade etc) is initially designed and developed by another team but their work is now handed down to my team, and I am developing new features to monitoring side there as well. (Someone else doing the customer notification work, someone else doing the back up/restore etc).

I am also very content with the benefits and income my company offers. This is unmatched in my country given my experience level.

I am however not happy with my own team, as people are incredibly toxic and unable to communicate. They constantly gossip, plot and believe in their own stories and act accordingly. This, of course, creates unnecessary drama out of nowhere all the time and get in my way of doing my job.

I had a very frank talk with my manager 3 months ago letting him know that I cannot work like this, I am not here to deal with people, the stress is not worth it. Manager has been keeping an eye on me ever since and actually became more communicative with me, that it actually helped me relax and continue my work with enthusiasm.

**2- Details: I am having a rough year in my private life**

Office is in a very remote place. A lot of my friends didn't even considered working for us due to location. I commute total of 3 hours every day with public transport, the fastest possible. There are private shuttles reducing commute to total of 2 hours, however they have strict hours for pick up, that effectively makes me away from home for 13 hours. With public transport at least I am able to work flexible hours.

My mom had an heart attack earlier this year all of a sudden. It was a major one but she survived it. She returned to her normal life but of course not like what it was before for all of us in the family. This event changed my perspective about a lot of things ever since.

Due to our busy lifestyle, my partner and I are having trouble with arranging our wedding. We cannot even find a proper house due to high prices, earthquake hazard risks, logistics of our offices and what nots.

My country is just going downhill in all aspects. Economy, politics, people.. everything. Most of our friends immigrated already or trying to. Ones that cannot or do not want to are loosing it day by day.

It was already stressful enough as it is. I was already considering to move back to my hometown closer to my parents. My partner's job is transferable between offices and also the prices and commute hours are much much lower back there.

The only problem is, available devops jobs are only 3 in count, and possible earnings are halved at best scenario.

**3 - Details: I lost it**

I live in Istanbul.

Istanbul is a first degree earthquake hazard zone. The fault that has potential to create a 7 earthquake started moving as of last weeks. Two days ago there was a big earthquake (5.7), and almost 300 little earthquakes over the same regionever since. Professors from my alma matter explained that now they have this data, their models estimate this fault can generate an earthquake above 8.

There is still no major plan on ""how to"" in case of an event. People are blindly told to go the emergency areas, which are just some governmental buildings, schools or mosques. I mean how long people are going to wait there, for whom or for what are not even decided yet. No one has proper a plan, no one.

This is just s.. hitting the fan in day light and everyone seems to be continuing their life as usual.

This was just ""it"" for me and my partner. It's just not the earthquake anymore. It's everything.

We literally grabbed whatever we have of importance and relocated to back my hometown before anything happens.

Luckily, I already had a sick day off due to dental work on friday. I let my manager know that I am leaving the city and considering to stay away for two weeks (as my partner was going to be away that much already, I cannot stay alone nor my partner will leave me alone). I asked to work from local office (yet I cannot transfer here) and if this is not arrangeable I am considering to use my vacation days.

**4 - What next?**

I am very safe and relaxed now. All I need is a new job.

I am now looking for a devops job. I crossed my fingers and hoping to get one of those rare 3 jobs available in my area (lol).

Maybe I should start considering fullstack development jobs again? I don't want to look insane switching job titles every other year, and I really like devops and would love to stay in.

I don't know much about remote job market. How is the working conditions anyway ? Where do people find reliable companies ? Should I post my resume in reddit job seeking subs?

I know going solo will take the longest and requires more than technical skills. So let's keep it as an option but not rely on it.

I think putting out a simple app or so initially to showcase how far I made it in terms of my skills is a good start. I worked with several cloud providers, so maybe I should start getting certs for at least one?

I considered starting a blog but seriously everybody has one of those and I am not sure how legitimate are those as I can clearly see most of the content is copy paste, or just very similar. I do not have anything new to add to the scene so I am staying away.

I considered going back to school, but I missed the deadlines for spring semester. At the very best I can enroll next September, but that's just too far away to consider now.

So far these are all the things that came to my mind.

TL;DR at the bottom.

So i graduated in May 2019 and still haven't found a job since. I had been applying to entry level positions since the start of my senior year but took it easy since I was stressing over coursework, but had ramped up the applications ever since. I never had an internship but I have a few school projects and a personal website from scratch under my belt. It has been at least 200+ applications now (I kept track until like the 120th). During my senior year, I had two offers that i rejected because they didn't fit what I was looking for and they also hired me based off of one behavioral interview, which I thought was weird; my career advisor thought I could do better as well.

I'm losing confidence, which I didn't have much to begin with. I am realizing now that a job in software development or other CS related fields might not be the right move for me. I enjoy programming but I don't have the knowledge or technical skill to back it up. I'm the type that just dives in and googles everything and somehow figures everything out, but easily forgets everything if I don't use it for a while. That's how I've gone through college and graduated successfully but I don't think that will work on the job. I have a bad memory and have difficulty remembering technical terms/names. I have also been worrying about the stress of a software development job since you have to keep up to date and constantly learn, which I thought I would be fine with but am now realizing the scope of it all.

The stress of the potentially incoming job has been overwhelming me, but another thing is that I come from a very small town so I am not use to the big city. My college city was a lot bigger but the area made it seem small so the transition wasn't as bad. The downside is that there's very limited opportunities so I would have to move to a big city most likely, which is stressing me out because I don't know how to function in a big city.

I am currently working as a waiter with 12hr shifts everyday so I don't have time to learn and create more personal projects. It took me weeks just to create my personal website from scratch doing 4+hrs a day, partly because I was learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap on the fly. I am still applying to entry level positions with little to no response so far. I am not sure what else to do.

I have been thinking of steering away from the very technical side of things so maybe a Business Analyst position would be a better fit for me? It's a possibility. I am just not sure how to gear my software developer resume into a business analyst resume since I have mostly prolang and coursework projects on my current resume.

If you have any suggestions on what I should look for, or what other fields I should go into, or any other tips, that would be much appreciated. If you would like to see my resume then please leave a msg and I will DM you. Thank you for taking your to read through my post.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Graduated 5 months ago and still haven't found a job, currently working as a waiter with 12/7 shifts. Stressing about impending stress of the software engineering job/role and moving to a big city. Thinking about pursuing a business analyst role instead, but need help on how to change my current software engineering resume to a business analyst resume. Any other tips and suggestions would be much appreciated."

I'm currently a freshman over at NJIT and am pretty much having my first case of impsoter syndrome. 

Basically, my major related classes this year don't offer much in terms of applicable knowledge (AFAIK). I'm taking Roadmap to Computing this semester which is basic Python and I'll be taking Intro to CS next semester which is based on Java. I've had prior exposure to Java because I took AP CS A in high school but did not receive AP credit unfortunately. Anyways, so far I've been coasting in this Python class, it's a hell of a lot easier than I thought it was going to be, but that's pretty much because of how barebones the curriculum is. None of it is remotely related to any real world problem solving and I know that I should be keeping my expectations in check (especially as a freshmen), but how can I get an internship as a freshman if what I am learning isn't necessarily applicable in the workplace?

I've done plenty of research on here and I know that it's very uncommon for freshman to get an internship, unless they have an abundance of knowledge. But, I see the few success stories on here and I'm basically wondering what can I do to set myself apart from the crowd? There's only so much I can do on my spare time when it comes to studying other languages, I'm usually bogged with other classwork. But, I've joined my school's ACM chapter and this mentoring program they have for computing students. There's a career fair next week that I plan on going to, but my resume has nothing really significant regarding my planned field of work. So ultimately, I've just been in this state of confusion and nervousness as to what the future holds. I know I don't have to get an internship as a freshman, but hell I'd really like to have one. 

All info and help is appreciated!"

So I just finished a Codility challenge for an internship. I made a huge mistake...unfortunately, I thought that my knowledge of DS &amp; Algorithms would get me through the challenge. I definitely failed big-time though. I struggled for a long time to think of an optimal solution and got TIMED OUT errors for two of the questions. So now I know that I gotta really work on my coding challenge skills!

Just a few questions:

1) I've been applying to internships, but would y'all recommend putting that on hold until I improve my HackerRank/Leetcode skills? Or just to do both simultaneously?

2) How do y'all test your method solutions? Do you write JUnits separately in an IDE? Or  just print out stuff from the main method? 

3) Where's the best place to start interview prep? An online source like HackerRanks or Leetcode or Codility? Or a paper one like CTCI?

Thanks in advance!"

About a week and a half ago, I received a final round interview for another company, where they will be flying me out to OKC for three days for the interview starting October 16th. (I'm a senior ME by the way).

&amp;#x200B;

Company 1: 

1) Had an amazing summer internship experience, really liked the work I did and the company culture.

2) Rotational Program - Living in 3 different cities for 3 years to experience different aspects of the company, really like this idea. Plus I could start my 1st rotation in the city I went to college in, which is appealing.

&amp;#x200B;

Company 2:

1) Comparable work to Company #1 (field engineering - lots of travel, etc.. which I like), but less work-life balance (24 hr on call, working on a rig, work holidays, etc..), and also has a sort of rotational program.

2) Starting pay seems to be a little less, than Company #1 (from what I've been able to find online).

3) Potential for international work - This is a big one, I've always wanted to work/live internationally for at least a few years, Company #1 is US only. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about calling Company #1 to ask for an extension so I could explore all possible opportunities, but the same situation happened last summer, and it was denied, so the odds of getting an extension this time are low.  As this is my first full-time job out of school, I really wanted to be able to cover all possibilities so I could make the best decision for myself. What I've been thinking was to accept Company #1's offer, and still go on Company #2's interview - and if Company #2 ends up giving me a better or more attractive offer, to rescind my acceptance.

Does this course of action seem reasonable? I've had some friends do something like this in the past and it seems a bit shady when I think about it, but let me know your thoughts!

Also, I have NOTHING to put on my resume. Should I just put the volunteering/clubs that I did in high school since I’ve never had a job/real industry experience?

daq6v8,1,2019-09-28,Should I Study Abroad for a Semester and Live by myself for a semester or Live with my friends and graduate early?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/daq6v8/should_i_study_abroad_for_a_semester_and_live_by/,"I have been having a dilemma for the past month, which I have kept putting off except for the fact that now off-campus apartments are starting to sublease, so I need to make a decision soon.  I normally have my mind completely made up, but I just can't seem to come up with a solution.  Pls help Reddit!!

**Option 1: Study Abroad for a Semester**

*Pros:* Get to be in Australia/Fiji/New Zealand/Hawaii for the four months while being able to take credit hours + all other benefits of a normal study abroad program; Ends earlier than the semester so I could potentially work for All of May, June, July, and August

*Cons:* Since its a Spring Semester program, I would have to live on campus by myself so I wouldn't be held to a 12-year contract and make my parents pay for spring semester (If I sublease in the spring I don't think any of my friends would want to live with me bc they would be stuck with a stranger)

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: Live with my friends and graduate early**

*Pros:* Get to live off campus with my friends and would be able to resign the lease for senior year; could potentially study abroad over the summer (but wouldn't be able to work &amp; get an internship), or could potentially just travel by myself at some point in Europe or something; would graduate early so would be able to get into the job market faster

*Cons:* Wouldn't be able to study abroad for the entire semester, wouldn't be able to get internship if I did study abroad over the summer, also would be more expensive to study abroad over the summer instead of the spring because I wouldn't need the credit hours

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is confusing! For me, I am fortunate because my parents are willing to pay for my college including study abroad, but I want to have money saved up for after I graduate.  I also think it might be lonely for me to stay by myself in a dorm where mostly freshman live while all my friends are living together in an apartment."

I am a future software engineering student, who will be graduating in about 2-3 years. Sad thing is, I no longer like non-basic programming (anything above an intro to programming/OOP course).

Another field that I am interested in would be cloud computing to be a cloud engineer. (r/cscareerquestions sent me here).

dav5ca,36,2019-09-29,I feel like a diversity quota hire for my internship,klarrynet,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/dav5ca/i_feel_like_a_diversity_quota_hire_for_my/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I haven't been able to get it off of my mind ever since I got my intern offer. If there are any minorities who've gone through these feelings, I'd love to hear how you dealt with them.

A few weeks ago, a FAANG recruiter reached out to me for my resume, and then got me signed up for an on-campus interview. I figured that they got my contact information from my applications from the past two years, and assumed that the reason they reached out first was because I was a woman. My suspicion was confirmed when I saw that 90% of the people at the day 1 interview were women.

The whiteboard questions were fairly straightforward, and I'm honestly really proud of how I did on the second day interview (you had to pass day 1 to get to day 2). I illustrated my thought process out very well, and my interviewer had to ask almost no leading questions for me to get to the optimal solution. That being said, I feel like the questions were almost.....a bit easy for a FAANG interview, not to mention that there were only two interviews total (I got asked about four questions).

Obviously, I'm delighted that I got the offer, and I do think I'm a very capable programmer who'll do fine there. Still, I don't feel that I've deserved it at all, knowing that this interview was literally set up as a diversity initiative, and that the interviews I had might have been slightly easier (and shorter) than what normal people might have had to go through.

What's worse is my attitude about it with the people who found out. Everybody has been really happy for me (both the men and women) saying I deserve it, but I keep shoving it off as ""I did do well on the interview but honestly I wouldn't have any sort of offer if I weren't a girl"".....which is really doing a disservice to all of the women engineers out there. This isn't the first time I've pushed off something as ""it's because I'm a woman lol"" (namely my internship from last summer), but this time, I really can't be proud because I know that I got an interview soley because I'm a woman.

I guess I might be acting spoiled about the whole situation, and should just accept my lucky situation instead of complaining about ""but did I deserve it???"" since at the end of the day, it doesn't change the situation much. Still, if there's any advice anybody has as to how to process these feelings, I'm all ears.  


Edit: Thanks for all of the supportive comments! I think a few contributing factors were probably that a week before, I had a couple of technical challenges that were much more difficult than what I was expecting, and I just barely passed one of them (got rejected right away by the other). Because of that, I assumed ""Ah, all big tech companies must give interview questions that are this hard"", not realizing that sometimes, you end up a bit lucky without an intentional ""we're giving this job to you because you're a minority"".   


In addition (and this is probably the biggest factor that I didn't realize at all), a lot of the CS kids at my college do this very annoying thing where they judge your worth as a person with wherever you're interning. A lot of them assume every person who gets hired at a big-N is either a genius or had connections, and that nothing could possibly be wrong with your life if you have a good SF internship. I hate having expectations on me, and I don't want people to have an inflated impression of me because of a lucky opportunity I happened to get (this is a reaction a friend of mine already had). I've begun to realize that I should just ignore all of that bullshit, and enjoy myself without worrying about what these people think."

Felt super pressured to take the job and have a steady income and be able to pay rent, etc. I really wanted to move home with my parents and spend more time finding the right job but said fuck it - money, independence, immediate satisfaction...

Surprise surprise I made a huge mistake. It was alright for 3 weeks before I started just hating it. I’m almost 5 months in now. I’m anxious and stressed out when I get home everyday. Anxious and visibly depressed at work. The office recognizes my boss isn’t an easy person to work for, and I just can’t take it. I’m not interested in the field anymore (law), I’m not interested in getting yelled at everyday, I’m just not happy and I haven’t really been happy since before I graduated. The job doesn’t even pay well and 40% of my income goes to rent. I’m sitting here on Sunday afternoon sad because I’m too anxious to enjoy watching the football game with my dad before I need to go home and go to work tomorrow. It’s miserable. I just don’t like it. A month ago I planned a weekend camping trip, took this Friday out of work. Didn’t enjoy myself at all because I was so stressed out about work.

I’m almost at the 5 month mark. Is it time to start looking for new jobs? My dad says to just get out but first contact everyone I can to try and find something better. My mom says leaving so early is career suicide. I don’t want to be anxious at work everyday. I don’t want to be afraid of getting yelled at, I don’t want to get yelled at for putting things off for a day or too because I’m too busy to get to them. I just am truly not happy here and I haven’t been since week 3.

I didn’t sign any contract or anything though in the interview they said they were looking for a two year commitment. I said whatever job I was getting I was looking at staying for two years before going to grad school. If I liked it here I’d stay for 2 years. I just hate it and am not happy. I deserve to be somewhere I enjoy. And honestly they deserve to have an employee who doesn’t hate being there everyday."

day8mv,8,2019-09-29,Trying to find out the development of my social anxiety + depression,Curiouslytripper,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/day8mv/trying_to_find_out_the_development_of_my_social/,"Hey guys, I've been anxious and depressed enough that I can't take it anymore, when I was the age of 0-14 I was a funny, very social, empathious fun kid. I always had friends, always was a part of everything and everyone recognized me for my laughing. Untill I hit my puberty ( not the reason why I'm anxious I think ) since that time I got even scared to open the door, I still don't have a job ( I'm 16 now ) and I'm currently in wait for my new school which I'm 2 months later then everyone else. Just because I canceled my other school since I was too anxious of finding a internship work place. I still only have old friends from the time when I was 'myself' and no new ones. I've always been very hyper since I was a kid and then my parents decided to diagnose me and turned out I had ADHD. It dind't bother me at that time. I do speak to my parents but not very much. Especially not about my feelings which I don't do with barely anyone. I dissapoint them alot with my anxious feelings for example the one from when I needed to find the internship work place. My mom keeps saying that I'm anxious because I have been judged by everyone my whole life and I know she is right but its not only that,  I have also been taking Ritalin for a few years and from that moment everything changed, one day when I felt very anxious after 30 minutes of taking my Ritalin. I was in school at lunch break just with a bunch of friends because I wasn't having those anxious issues then, but I felt very depressed and anxious then and I also later called my mom asked if I could go home because I was feeling sick. I dind't mention that I was anxious to her. Next day I woke up and again took my dose of Ritalin ( I'm not gonna call it medication ) I felt exactly the same as the day before so I called my mom again and asked if I could go home. I still dind't tell about the anxious and negative thought I had. From that moment I wasn't feeling myself untill this day. I am feeling so tired, nothing makes me happy and I just feel so fucking miserable and anxious about even doing the smallest things. The worst thing is that I KNOW I can be myself because I have been in the past, but I don't know how or what to do. I'm also using little doses of sativa or hybrid strains of weed ( I vaporize them ) and it does really help for my ADHD to calm down my brains but it still doesn't make me feel myself happy from how I used to be. Obviously I still have some days where I feel happy but those only happen like once in a month . I also once was out for dinner with the whole fam and I was feeling very drowsy and just not active but I brought my filled vaporizer ( dry herb vaporizer )  with weed. So I vaped outside and I was myself again, I was talking to my fam and it was like I was reborn again. When I got home I was so happy and mostly proud, I later said to my mom what I did when I went outside and she already knew I smoke and shes okay with it as long as I don't get addicted and she also was a bit happy because she really saw the diffrence, its not always when weed works like that. But when I'm with friends and I smoke I always feel very comfortable around them and have a good time. They mostly make me forget to look at my phone so thats a good sign. I  really want to feel like how I used to because most people liked me then alot. I also stopped growing from when I was using the Ritalin and last year I have grown so much from the moment when I stopped using it. I feel like ritalin fucked up my serotonin receptors because I know alot about all drugs. I know that Ritalin is in the same family as speed which makes it possible that it fucked up my serotonin receptors. Anyhow I've also tried LSD a couple of times and it made me social anxious as fuck, really dind't wanna see anyone when I did that. But I know that that isn't how I am because I used to be so social but how come I'm not anymore? If anyone has tips or questions. Please feel free to ask / tell them!! I use L-theanine now for a while and it makes me alot more relaxed in my head, but they don't bring back the old me. I don't use chemical pills ever again because they're dangerous and addictive. Not only because they're toxic itself but also because they might have fucked up my whole personality. Its insane that when I think of it now they just give speed to 8 year olds because they have a disorder which makes them hyper in their head. Its not right, thats the reason why I only use natural products to relax my brain, L-Theanine, weed and omega-3. I also have used XTC like 3 times and when I do xtc I can talk to people again with no problem and it just goes extremely easy then. But I don't use it more then twice a year. Please if anyone has any tips or comments pleasee ask or tell them! Also if someone knows how to like boosts my serotonin/dopamine receptors I'd love to hear how. I really wanna get back to the person I used to be. And I'm not the only one. Thankyou for reading &lt;3"

I was offered the opportunity to continue working remote in a part-time role from my internship last year but I already had an on-campus job. I have been talking to a couple companies that would offer this opportunity which why I’m asking this whole question because the part-time work would pay at least twice as much as research.

I’m not trying to get into some god-tier grad school, I’m mostly looking at the University of Minnesota. My plan is that when I graduate I’m going to find a job that has a tuition reimbursement program and start getting a Masters within two years of graduation. People with knowledge of how grad school admissions works, do you think I need that undergrad research or do you think I can get in with just industry experience?

Francis and I had classes together, she introduced me to a whole new world of friends (that I still talk to), and had helped me overcome some challenges in my academic and personal life. I was always so happy to see her and to spend time with her. Shall I dare say, but Francis was my best friend at some point in time. However, in the past year or so, I've noticed some things about Francis that have turned me off. 

One of the academic challenges that I had to overcome was being put on Subject to Dismissal during my first year of college. I'm currently a 4th year, btw. It was a difficult time for me: adjusting to college, being away from home, having to put myself out there socially, dealing with a bad break up. And so, my grades suffered. Then, during my second year of college, I had a housemate who attempted suicide, and this put a huge hole in my motivation. However, about 3 months after the events, I lost 20 lbs (which was good  because I'm overweight), and landed two internships. Currently, I'm an employee at both of these places, having moved my way up from proving myself a worthy individual (lol). I wanted more for myself , despite the challenges I went through. I wanted to prove to myself that I could overcome and bounce back stronger. 

All the while, Francis was kind of stuck in the same place... and she wanted to be there. She's okay with settling. She's okay with ""the next best thing."" She isn't interested in self-growth. Not only that, I feel like our relationship is very 80/20, something I don't appreciate. I feel like I can be her rock, her emotional support, but she can't be mine. In times where I confided in her, she would revert the conversation to herself. I found that in these situations, I ended up comforting her instead of vice versa. I feel like I dont matter. 

I'm sad that my morals and values to really align with hers. That I'm moving forward while she's just ""okay"" with how she's doing. Is this me growing apart from her, or me just being a complete a*shole?"

Now the Dilemma im facing is a bit tricky. Okay so to graduate we need to make final year student Project, I have this great idea about an app that includes many technical things such as: Machine Learning, Data science, AR, app development, 3D modeling, web development and some others. I can see the idea being pretty useful. 

Now the tricky part. My team and I, we just received an offer from a small scale company working on projects related to ""smart cities"". They asked us to work with them as an intern and by doing so, we will get an experience letter of one year and gain experience by working on IOT. This will also exempt our college Final Year Project. 

Which option would you suggest? Working on my own idea, I will have a product that i can own and ofcourse the learning part, I will get to learn a lot of different technical skills if i work on my idea. And if i choose the second option, before i graduate I will have 1+ year job experience and skills related to IOT. Which option is the better?"

I'm 21 years old, and this year I got back to Webdev again, but now with intent of becoming a professional programmer aka making a living of that. Also I started college (IT system engineering), got a free place until I graduate after 3 years.

I was very satisfied with college, enjoyed it. However, I didn't know that in this degree I will study minimum of programming. Also I already got into internship, learn new things related to industry I wanna get into daily, what's great.

This week I realised that getting the degree is stressing me out and takes up much time that I'd rather spend at the office or home programming. I rarely have time for sports too.

I'm doubtful about this big decision. If I quit after 2 months, I will have to pay half of the yearly price. Also, I will just get into more group projects, so I may cause inconvenience for other fellas. But graduating is important for future, or is it just that others made me think that way

Damn, 3 years is such a long term. I'll get a job in few weeks. To my mind, I'll have a serious job in a year, and if I get a good full-time offer, I'll sure wanna drop college.

So, I wanna ask, does any of you, who graduated, found any use of your degrees? Was it worth it?"

db44v3,1,2019-09-29,Choosing a Path,Boober2,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/db44v3/choosing_a_path/,"Okay, I'll try to keep this part short because it isn't the most important part of the question. 

I'm a recent college graduate and I got my degree in Mechanical Engineering. I'm at my first job after school, I've had a couple internships, and I'm 100% certain that mechanical engineering isn't what I want to do with my life. My last couple semesters at school, I took a couple classes that made me realize that programming was something I was actually passionate about, first in a finite element analysis class where I used MATLAB and in my last semester of undergrad (lol), an intro to computer science class that I took online and really really enjoyed.

 So, I'm looking to switch into the computer science field, particularly web development/software engineering, but I'm not sure quite how to go about it. I've started to teach myself more through EdX, which I think is a good first step. I've drawn up a couple paths for myself and was wondering if anyone else had experience doing the same thing or has worked with/hired people who have gone down these paths. My plan is to stay at my current job for a year, continuing to teach myself, and then take the next step (whatever it may be). The options I have are:

1. Completing an undergrad degree in software engineering. I'm from New York and SUNY Oswego has a software engineering bachelors that I could likely complete in two years- I looked at the curriculum and I have all the electives/non-essential classes taken. I've also done the college thing before so now I understand the importance of joining clubs and doing other extra curricular stuff to enhance my skills. I did well (3.70 GPA) in my undergrad and have a good SAT score, so I think I would be able to get good scholarships and financial aid.
2. Getting my MBA and then doing a bootcamp. The school that I went to for undergrad (Clarkson University) gives good financial aid based on GMAT scores and I think I can do really well on it, especially if I study a ton. I'd continue to teach myself the basics using EdX and MIT Open courseware while getting my MBA, and then once I finished, do App Academy/Hack Reactor/something else. This has the added benefit of me being able to reunite with friends that are still at school and although an MBA isn't what it used to be, I still think it could prove advantageous later in my career, especially if it doesn't cost too much.
3. Finish my year at my current job, then go right to a bootcamp. This one is pretty self explanatory and is basically the quickest/least expensive way of getting into the job market, although it's also the one that leaves me with the least experience entering the field.

I was hoping I could get some feedback on this from people who've had similar experiences/hired/worked with people that have done stuff like this or come out of these programs. I appreciate any input I can get here!"

Even then, it was too late, and he died a year later at the age of seven, which meant I was absolutely horrified to discover a similar lump on myself.


Over the course of a few days, as I awaited my doctor’s appointment, the lump grew ever-so-slightly. It had a strange shape, like a column of bone that hurt to touch.



During the examination, the doctor looked at me with concern in his eyes. It pretty much confirmed what I’d already suspected; That the growth was bone, and it would probably turn out to be cancer. 


He didn’t hesitate with referring me to a radiologist, and told me to return once the imaging had been done. 


A few days later I returned, and as I sat in the office, on the brink of tears, a thousand thoughts ran through my head: What to tell my sister, how to spent the remaining time left on Earth, would it hurt as much as it did with my brother? At the very least they’d certainly have to amputate my arm, which would severely compromise my gaming abilities, can you even drive with one arm?


Then the doctor called me in…


He didn’t seem concerned, but baffled, as if he hadn’t the faintest clue what was wrong with me.


After some consideration, he finally started speaking, unleashing a jumbled mess of medical terms and incomprehensible sentences. He took a deep breath before finally stammering out: 


“It- It’s not cancer,”


Despite the presumably good news, he didn’t seem relived. There was something he held back.


“Then what’s wrong?” I asked.


“It’s a- it’s a tooth.”


He couldn’t explain it any further, so he just showed me the x-ray. Even with my limited anatomical knowledge, I could see it clear as day; A tooth was growing straight out from my ulnar, its roots firmly cemented in the bone, while the crown pushed on the surrounding tissue. 


On one hand, it wasn’t cancer; On the other, I had an impossible, bizarre growth extruding from the wrong part of my own skeleton. 


The doctor sat down with me and explained the concept of teratomas; A type of benign tumours that frequently grow hair, skin and partially developed organs. Despite it’s unusual presentation, we settled on that idea and scheduled me for surgery.


It was a quick and simple procedure. A couple of days later, they discharged me and told me to rest a bit before returning to work.


I was content, though admittedly a little bit disturbed by the whole ordeal.


Life went on, and my arm healed up nicely. The scar almost completely covered up by the inappropriate amount of hair I’d started growing during my teenage years.


A couple of weeks passed, and the surgery was all but a distant memory. 


Then, after a morning of increasing back pain, I found blood in my urine…


Doctors will typically tell you not to get all riled up just because you found blood in your piss, because it could be caused by pretty much anything, and might not be blood at all. 


However, I did worry, and with a sense of panic, I rushed to the emergency clinic, where they quickly tested my urine to confirm the presence of haemoglobin.


That, alongside my back pain, made them feel confident I was suffering from nothing more than an innocent little kidney stone. 


One of the interns performed an ultrasound scan just to rule out cysts and whatnot, but her casual demeanour quickly turned to an expression of fear as she put the sensor against my skin. 


She excused herself and left the room, only to return after ten minutes, dragging with her an older, presumably more experienced doctor. He seemed annoyed to have been called in for something so simple as an ultrasound. 


He grabbed the device without introducing himself, and tried looking for a kidney. Just as with the intern, his annoyed confidence quickly turned to  one of worry, and he too, left without explaining what the hell was going on.


By then, my discomfort had turned to excruciating agony. They’d already put me on an overabundance of painkillers, but it barely put a dent in the suffering I had to endure.


I stood up to grab ahold of the doctor, ready to demand answers, but once I got to my feet, my vision started fading, and I collapsed to the ground. 


From there, my memory was hazy, a combination of pain and drugs put me in a trance like state. I vaguely remember being taken for some sort of scan, and a tube being shoved down my throat, and finally, everything turned black.


***


It would take me two days to awaken once more. At which point I was greeted by a team of specialists, all looking way out of their depth.


They explained as best they could: That I’d fallen into a coma following severe, internal bleeding, and that I was an inch away from death when I was brought into the operating theatre. 


I had almost died, and if not for an insane stroke of luck, I wouldn’t have realised.


Despite the success of the surgery, they still seemed nervous, and I could tell there was more to the story. After a lot of talking around the point, and even more bizarre medical terms I couldn’t possibly comprehend, I got mad. 


“Just tell me what the fuck is happening to me!”


The oldest of the bunch, finally stepped up and started explaining himself. 


“Mr. Woodcomb, to be brutally honest. We haven’t the faintest clue what kind of affliction you’ve come down with. It’s quite frankly, beyond anything we’ve dealt with in the past.”


“Wha-what does that mean, am I going to die?” I asked.


He took a deep breath. 


“We can’t know how the disease will progress, but-”


“What is happening to me?” I yelled as I tried to sit up, still too groggy from the drugs, unable to feel the presence of my own body. 


He explained what had happened to me, that my stomach had started migrating towards my left flank, where it had enveloped itself around my kidney, slowly, but certainly absorbing and digesting it. The process obviously severed its blood supply, which caused the bleed that almost killed me. They’d fixed the tooth, and they’d stopped the bleeding, but a part of me knew it wasn’t over.


“I’m still not fixed, am I?” I asked.


He shook his head. 


“I’m so sorry, Mr. Woodcomb, but this disease, we don’t know how to stop it. At this point, we’re just treating the symptoms.”


By then, I’d woken up enough to coordinate my movements, but I still couldn’t feel my right arm.


I turned my head to check on it, and saw that the vast majority of my lower, and half my upper arm, had turned almost completely white. I tried to lift it, but my muscles simply wouldn’t budge.


The skin looked so smooth, like perfect silk covering an almost shapeless blob. I’d always been a skinny, albeit toned person, so my veins were fairly prominent. Except that now, they’d all seemingly vanished from my forearm, leaving nothing but a stump of a vessel I could see actively retract away under my skin.


“It happened just before you woke up, there was no time, we couldn’t-“


“What the fuck is happening to me?” I asked once more.


“We don’t know,” he said. 


I looked at him in despair, these were the people that were supposed to help me, if even the professionals were baffled, I was screwed. 


“Mr. Woodcomb, your arm has absolutely no blood supply. I’m sorry, but we need to amputate it as quickly as possible, you shouldn’t even be awake right now.”


They made me sign a consent form before proceeding. Just the act of writing my own name with my one remaining, functioning arm, was an excruciating ordeal.


Another few hours went by, and my right arm was a part of the past. 


Once I woke up from my third surgery, the doctors informed me that I was to be transferred to a more specialised health facility; they didn’t even have the curtesy to call it a hospital. 


They airlifted me, wrapped in a containment box of sorts, to prevent the spread of a disease that could potentially be contagious. 


While flying, I was strapped down with no view of my surroundings. Wherever they were taking me, they wouldn't tell, and based on the few glimpses I got of the world beneath us, I wouldn’t have known anyway.


On the ground, I was met by a team of doctors dressed in hazmat suits. The ‘health facility,’ looked more like a warehouse than anything else, and didn’t ease the growing fear within me. 


They rolled me through an airlock, ensuring nothing infectious could get in, or out.


The inside of the facility was a massive, isolated room with hundreds of patients lined up next to each other, no rooms for privacy, nor drapes to keep them apart, which meant that they all probably suffered from the same condition as myself. 


One of the patients stared at me. He panted with shallow breaths, as his chest had transformed into a thick wall of bone, each rib fused together, making breathing an almost impossible task. 


Another, younger woman, had skin that seemed to be shrunken a few sizes too small, stretching to the point where it had become a pathetic cover of epithelium, allowing her muscles to be clearly visible.


But the worst, was the patient in the bed next to mine. All his limbs had been amputated, and the entirety of his skin was covered in thick, bright red arteries, some of them actively bleeding, while others had been burned in a futile attempt at cauterising them. 


He groaned in agony, almost inaudible, strained sounds emerging from his toothless, tongueless mouth. His eyes and nose were missing, replaced by seemingly healthy skin, simply grown over most of his orifices, including his ears and scalp. 


He was trapped in pain, unable to hear, see, or communicate with the world around him, but if he could, I’m certain he would’ve begged for death. 


After a couple of hours of staring at the horrifically mangled people around me, a doctor approached me. He was a tired looking, old man that had been broken by the afflictions of others.


“I’m doctor Foreman, your name is Eric Woodcomb, correct?”


I nodded. 


“I’m going to administer a drug, it’ll slow down the progression of the disease.”


“Will it help, can you please help me?” I asked frantically.


He looked around, seeming to check if anyone could hear us speak. 


“It’ll slow it down, but it won’t cure it. We’re not even sure what causes this disease, but anti-mitotic drugs seem to put it into a sort of stasis.”


“What is ‘it,’ exactly?” I asked with a trembling voice. 


“It’s an infection, Mr. Woodcomb, though it’s not bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, or prion in origin. All I know is that it affects anyone that touches it, and that we’re not going to be able to contain it for long.”


I then asked a question I already knew the answer to. 


“Am I going die?”


He just nodded, his emotionless face never changing. 


“Ho-how long do I-” I said, before he interrupted me.


“A week, maybe two. Once the disease has converted all of your organs to an incomprehensible mess, and when even the most experienced forensics team would be unable to recognise your corpse as that of a human being, that’s when you’ll die.”


His bedside manner left a lot to be desired, but it was obvious that he’d gone through that speech a hundred times before. He was detached, desensitised from the nightmare that surrounded him.


As he turned around to leave, I noticed his arm had bone spicules, skeletal spikes protruding through his skin. 


“Doctor, your arm.”


He looked down at it and sighed. “I told you it was infectious, everyone in this room, staff, patients, even the fucking dogs that've lurked around the site. The guys outside wearing hazmat suits have been hunting them down, but it’s too late for that. Not that their fancy protection gear will help them, but I’m not going to break those news to them.”


I was speechless, and he could tell his words hadn’t comforted me in the least, he just didn’t care.


“I’m sorry, but you should make peace with your family, friends, whatever you have in this world, because if we don’t find a viable cure within the next week, they’re torching this place.”


***


As the days progressed, they kept bringing in more and more patients. Some looked mostly normal, healthy even, while others were unrecognisable; Their faces replaced by a solid mesh of flesh, and their organs relocated to the surface of their skin.


One of them had his heart placed outside of his chest, beating as if nothing had happened, with thousands of additional arteries extending from it, like a red spiderweb covering most of his torso.  


The pain must have been too much, because as he walked past my bed, he grabbed his own heart, attempting to rip it off. A few of the arteries tore open, spurting crimson blood all around him, but the heart itself wouldn’t budge.


He groaned, and with one final pull, he fell dead to the ground, clutching a clump of meat he’d managed to pull from the now, dead heart. 


As they lifted his lifeless body onto a stretcher, I got a better view of his face. I realised that I recognised him. He’d been the doctor that examined my lump, the tooth stuck in my bone.


He died because of me…


On the fifth day of my containment. I started to lose vision in one of my eyes. I could feel it pulsating, growing within its socket, but I didn’t dare look at myself in the mirror.   


A few hours passed, and suddenly I just felt a pop, followed by the sensation of a viscous liquid, trickling down my face. 


My eye had exploded, and still I didn’t have the guts to put myself in front of a mirror, or to call out for help. 


In a couple of days, they’ll burn this place to the ground in an attempt at preventing the spread of whatever disease has infected us. The doctors aren’t hopeful about a cure, but fire seems the safest option, just turning us all to ash, a price worth paying to save the world I suppose.


At least they’ve given us all a chance to call our loved ones, but I don’t have much of a family left, so to speak.


The thing bothering me the most, is that I’ll most likely die without knowing what killed me, where the disease came from, and how I could have avoided it all together; Hindsight is twenty-twenty and all that.

I already have 2 years of professional experience in my field and also some projects to show off that I have worked on my free time.

I do have a bachelor degree, but it is not in Computer Science.

What are my chances, if I keep mass applying, hoping that someone is willing to sponsor me? Also, how about the internship (as opposed to H-1B) visa? I've heard that it's easier to get hired with that as a foreigner.

I have a biology related bachelors degree and just got my Masters in Computer Science with a concentration in Health Informatics. The curriculum was half comp sci (python, java, networking, sql) and half health IT. 

I was not able to do an internship related to Comp Sci since I was working a full time job during the day to support myself. I completed my programming classes first, and then took on the Health IT courses, so the programming skills have disappeared a bit. 

What is a good way to get my foot in the door with a comp sci career? Is it focused just on learning programming languages or are there other skills as well such as hardware, networking, etc.? Which languages are recommended? I was thinking python, java, SQL, maybe C++, but let me know if I'm way off. What type of projects should I post on my own personal github to show off my progress? Are there a list of recommended projects somewhere or should I just get creative on my own? What are recruiters looking for on a resume with no prior comp sci work experience?"

- Topology I
- Complex Analysis

Classes I might take if they look better for graduate school:

- Advanced Calc II
- Number Theory
- Mathematical Logic

dbdww2,3,2019-09-30,"Wrongful Termination, do I have a case?: Please read carefully! Was told to post my story here! Any advice is appreciated!",PurplePrincezz,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dbdww2/wrongful_termination_do_i_have_a_case_please_read/,"So I’m born with 1 hand. I don’t receive disability, I don’t need assistance and I don’t use it as a crutch. I’m a black, African American female.

I started my previous position as an unpaid intern. After 2 months, they hired me for a paid full-time roll.

One of the women there made created constant problems. She would come in while I was working with patients and snatch things out of my hand, yell and belittle me in front of customers and staff. She would gossip about me and I could over hear her telling everyone how stupid I was and that she didn’t want to work with me. She refused to teach or train me. Blowing me off when I asked for help.

I spoke with my manager and she told me that I should just let it roll off my back. This continued for months. You could feel the tension and it was really toxic.

Before I left, I tried speaking directly with the coworker who either refused to problem solve or would make up lies about what happened when we spoke. We tried sit downs with the office manager. Any mistake I made, she made sure to tell the manager and the whole office knew about it although I was supposed to be training and learning. She belittled me constantly.

One of the other white coworkers asked me if my mom was on drugs when she was pregnant because I’m born with one hand &amp; I’m black. I told the office manager and she said she was angry this had happened but I should let it roll off my back because I “hear these things all the time.”

I asked my manager for feedback/how I could do better, but she couldn’t help me because she never worked in my role before (LPN/MA) do I HAD to work with this person. They were very aware of her attitude and did nothing as previous people had the same problem. I went home crying most days from work. The wouldn’t fire her because she had 25 years of MA experience — hard to find.

The office frequently had me working alone because the coworker would make up lies to call out of work (I caught her at Applebee’s after she called I’m sick and asked me to cover for her. I said no.) or because my other white coworker would call out or be late to work because she had personal things — like moving —going on.

They would call me repeatedly at early hours of the morning on my day off until I woke up and agreed to come into work if that person called out. They even shorted my paycheck 10 hours because they didn’t want to pay me for coming in or pay overtime, but I record my hours. I couldn’t take breaks sometimes and we didn’t clock out either if we didn’t have a break. So that’s a violation right there (I’m an hourly employee, not considered a professional so this applies).

Finally after one long 12 hour shift I made a mistake &amp; after explaining that this is how I was taught by the coworker, that’s when the doctor told me if I couldn’t get along with her I should leave (I guess said out of frustration) but I was so fed up I agreed and said I wouldn’t be coming back.

Now they’re giving out bad references because “I left without notice”. I’m NOT using them for a reference, but it’s either explain a 1 year gap in my resume and lose my only paid experience in this role or keep them on my resume and have these employers call behind my back.

I was suspicious, so I hired a reference checking service where I have on paper proof that they are saying my skills are horrible, but I’m super reliable (contradiction no?), and that I’m not eligible for rehire “after the way I left.”

So far my only other option is to explain that I have a bad reference in an interview to head it off at the pass, but I don’t know how effective that will be.

Like I said I don’t prefer to sue. I don’t care about the money, I just want this to stop. They’re making it difficult to get another job. I just want to work.

ANY ADVICE WOULD BE APPRECIATED! Thank you!"

So, closer to the beginning of this year I received and accepted an internship offer from a B4 firm for the experience. I also had a summer 2019 internship at an industry company that I was very interested in. I ended up having a fantastic time at the internship and received a really really good full time offer. The company even allowed me to start later in the summer so that I could complete my B4 internship, so I decided to accept the offer to start full time in Summer 2020. However, my question is, should I contact the B4 firm and let them know that I will not be converting to full time, or should I just keep quiet and complete the internship ( which I still would like to do)."
dbf1by,29,2019-09-30,Final year student looking for advice on what to do between now and end of January,FatherWeebles,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/dbf1by/final_year_student_looking_for_advice_on_what_to/,"**Background:** I'm in the final year of my CS program.  I don't need to take any classes between now and through the end of January 2020.  Before today, I thought I would've received an offer for an internship because it looked like it was a slam dunk: was told personality was perfect fit for position and firm, assessment was near perfect, but ultimately I can devote only 3.5 months full-time, and the project they had in mind would take longer to complete (initial phone interview started in late August).  HR said I'd be a shoe-in for a junior dev position there after graduating if one is available.  

**Current State:** So now I'm wondering what to do next.  Fortunately, I was accepted into a mentor/mentee program that starts tomorrow, so that'll be a great way to get advice, bounce off ideas and network; the mentors are recent graduates who work in the industry and the mentees are STEM students.  My main interest is software development and security.  I have previous work experience in a different field and can easily build rapport with people.  My resume is in a good condition (reviewed by several people and will have mentor review it as well).  Recently I earned the Security+ certification.

**Next steps(?):**

1) Start thesis

2) Keep applying to internships/part-time jobs

What time should i start emailing profs? Im thinking right now or latest, end of october. What do you guys think? 

Also, if a prof doesn't followup even after a second email to remind them, would the best course of action to find some time to talk to them in person?

I just got my intern offer for Microsoft for this summer, and inquired about the org. Apparently, my ""Business Group"" is Cloud and Artificial Intelligence, and my ""Product Group"" is Commerce and Ecosystems. I started searching C + E up online and came upon a swathe of Blind posts railing against the org, saying the tech is ancient, the product is boring, etc etc.

I'm curious if anyone has experience with this org, maybe from an internship, and could give me some ideas on the reality of the work there. The reason I'm asking, is that I have another offer with a different company (return intern offer) that I very much liked, and would pay equal to Microsoft. I was hoping to try something new and maybe work with different tech, but I'm worried this would not be the move.

Please let me know if you have any experience with this org or something, I don't want to take Blind's word on it.

I got into this field because I thought it was interesting, matched what I was good at, and payed a pretty good average salary. Now I feel like I'm just constantly chasing the next thing to add to my resume so that I can momentarily feel slightly less bad about myself.

Started going to this interesting tech club? Why aren't you in a leadership position yet? Leadership is what recruiters crave. Got a leadership position? Well, why aren't you president? Nobody cares unless you're president. Became president? Well, why didn't you start your own club? Nobody cares unless you're a founder of something.

Got anything less than an A in a class? Trash. Got an A in the class? ....well, why didn't you get an A+? If you weren't even good enough to get an A+, can you really say you know the subject? I mean, GPA obviously doesn't matter, but you're obviously not gonna get emails back from recruiters unless you have over a 4.0 GPA. 

Got an awesome internship at an interesting company? Well, it wasn't FAANG, so who cares? Got a FAANG internship? Well it wasn't one of the good FAANGs, so if you really think about it, you really didn't accomplish anything. Got into a ""Good FAANG""? Well, the other intern works on his own startup idea when he goes home. Why aren't you working on your startup idea? Do you even have a startup idea? Are you even trying?

Got into the best school in your state? Well, it's not a top X school, so I guess you just didn't work hard enough ehh? Got into a top X school for your Masters'? Well, it's not a top X-- school, so really anyone can do what you've done. Got into a research program? Why haven't you published in a top conference/journal yet? How do you expect to get into a PhD program without top first author publications? Oh, by the way, you want to get your PhD now. I know you said you didn't want to before, but seeing some of your friends do it is making you feel insecure. 

Part of me feels like I just want the ""I don't really care that much about what I do, so let me just work 40 hours a week and then do whatever with the rest of the time"" life. But another part of me feels like ""If you don't work harder and spend 60-80 hours a week trying to be better than your peers, then you're going to lose out on opportunities that other people only dream of and you'll regret it."" It's almost like I feel like I have this obligation that I can, so I should, and I should just ""save laziness for later"". 

But it seems like the more I work, the more I feel like I have to work. There's no ""good enough"". There's no endgame. No matter what, there's another level, another thing to feel insecure about, another reason to feel bad about not grinding and feel like my desire to chill out is just laziness that I should ignore. I feel like my own ""tiger parent"", and it's starting to really take its toll.

Has anybody else had feelings like this before? Did you do anything about it? Any regrets along the way?"

I have strong analytical, communication, and interpersonal, and problem solving skills. I do not have any professional management/leadership experience and would like to build that competency as it’s important to a successful leader in any organization. I believe my lack of full-time experience is what’s hindering me relative to other candidates. 

I applied to fellowships last year and unfortunately was not successful in obtaining one. However, I still have my eyes on the prize in becoming a healthcare leader. I’m highly ambitious and a family centered thinker. 

My ultimate goal is to become a COO of a hospital. Where is a good starting point? What are the communities thoughts on a practice manager role? Is there growth in that position? Or would an analyst position be better suited for my long term goal of becoming a COO.

If you’re currently in a leadership role at a hospital, I’d love to chat and gain your career advice. I would be willing to share my resume as well. 

Any advice or leads help!"

First time posting here so sorry if im in the wrong place , please redirect me if so ! 

So I'm a third year cs major at a pretty big state school. I didn't choose it because I loved Cs, just because I didn't know what else to do, and had taken apcs in high school so I thought why not cs.
Fast forward to now , I've done 2 internships at some established companies. (not faang tho) I'm currently in a systems programming and a computer vision class. 

But everyday when I go to my cs classes I realllyyy don't want to be there. 
The assignments for computer vision are so complicated and we only get 2 weeks to do them, and the systems programming class the Prof is new and I don't understand anything.
And I really don't even feel like I want to. I feel like I'm not cut out for cs, I'm not smart enough, I don't think fast enough, and I don't think I can compete with the other people in the field for these jobs. Everyone is just so much better than I am. I really want to switch majors but I'm already 3 years into this degree, and that's the only reason I'm not changing it right now.

But I really don't want to do CS. And I don't know what to do about it. Sorry for ranting, I just needed to get it all out, I guess !"

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from a state university in June 2019. Throughout my undergrad years I was not fortunate enough to land any internships except for a co-op term at a Fortune 500 company. During my final semester I began a serious search for a full-time employment opportunity. I attended my school's job fair and made use of the networking opportunities that came with being enrolled in my senior design course. I was able to land an onsite interview at a major defense contractor and I enjoyed my experience during the visit. Unfortunately, I was not able to obtain an offer from them. I'm pretty sure the reason why I was turned down was that I interviewed for the wrong teams. After that I felt too pressured by my coursework and my teammates to abandon them for more interviews so I stopped actively searching for opportunities. I was later approached by recruiters from other companies, but I never obtained more interviews.

# The Situation

It has been four months since I graduated and my life has only gone downhill. I had to move back home and immediately lost all of my independence. I have tried to apply to jobs at large US cities because I want to leave my current location and start a new life, but my lack of experience has cut down my chances. Recently, I have started to receive some attention to my online applications with some recruiters reaching out to me. The problem is that those opportunities have starting dates in January or February of next year. Even if I were fortunate enough to receive an offer from any of these companies, I'm not certain that I would be able to wait for them. I wake up every day and have nothing to look forward to. I have no friends to talk to and my transition is mostly on hold, which has made me feel depressed. Due to these circumstances I have set a goal to start a new job before the year ends. But where do I find these jobs? Everywhere I look it seems as though the only positions for which I qualify are made for those who are yet to graduate.

# Summary

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering from a state university in June 2019. I had to move back home and immediately lost all of my independence. I want to find a new job at a large city so I can start a new life, but I can't wait until next year. Is it possible to find a job that starts within the remaining three months of the year?"
