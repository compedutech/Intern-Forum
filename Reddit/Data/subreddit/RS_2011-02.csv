Then he told me that he needed to talk it over with the rest of the team but that he would get back to me tomorrow. 

Today I got this email:

I figured I might as well explorer all avenues for looking for jobs so I figured that I would post on here as well.

I'm a sophomore dual computer science and information science student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. Northeastern university has a cooperative education (co-op for short) program that allows their students to spend up to 3 six month sessions working full time at a company or doing research. I've started looking for my coop session, which is coming up starting in July (or June) and ending in the end of December.

My past job experience includes working at TripAdvisor LLC as an IT Intern where I participated in daily helpdesk and IT team operations including deploying new servers and laptops, setting up and trouble shooting a thin-client environment, dealing with equipment RMAs and repairs, deploying a secured HDD solution to the employees as well as whatever else the IT team assigned to me. I've also worked at Zazu, a small startup that is developing ""the smartest damn alarm clock"". You can download it and look at it on the Android Market. Finally, I've also worked at Northeastern's computer helpdesk where I was part of a team of ~40 students that provide tier 1 technical support for PCs, Macs, and Cable TV as well as created scripts and tools to aid in diagnosis and remediation of personal computers. You can see the rest of my experience [here (my resume)](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/nate/NathanHeaps_resume.pdf)

For my first coop, I'm looking for a paid position in the IT field (since that is primarily where my experience is). I don't really care where it is, it could be in Japan for all I care, as long as the pay is enough to cover the cost of living. If you think that you might have something available, please send me a PM. I can also send you a link to my current transcript on request, I have nothing to hide.

Here's some final documents about me:

 So like many recent college grads (double major BA in Psychology and Film and Media Studies, UCSB class of '09 w00t!) I am looking for a job in hopes of moving out of my parent's home and maintaining whatever amount of sanity I have left.  It's been a year and a half since I graduated and I've been stuck selling computers at Best Buy for most of that time (terrible, I know).  I have an internship that is more relevant to what I'd like to ultimately have a career in, but it's unpaid. Anyone know of any part time jobs in the Bay Area with a flexible schedule and decent pay (15-20 bucks an hour)?  My ideal job is working for a media company but I'll take anything right now, just something to get me living on my own again.
I'm pretty sure Best Buy corroded my soul, so I'm willing to do sales, I'm familiar with computers (I built my own if that helps at all), I worked security for a year and a half at college, and I've worked with Final Cut Pro for various film projects.  Any advice or help is greatly appreciated. I'll even contribute my first week's pay to anyone who can hook me up with a job.

Thanks!"

I am planning on going for a masters after my undergrad. My GPA is at a 3.42, I am working on a research project with a professor, I do a bunch of activities like i'm on the executive board of my fraternity and do a sport here, also I have a bunch of community service under my belt. I am also familiar with MATLAB &amp; SolidWorks.

I recently left an internship fair an hour ago and there was almost hiring mechanical or aerospace engineers. I was at a career fair last month with the same result. The one person I actually had a full conversation mentioned that an ME may start off between 40-50k. That number hit me hard, that is not a lot of money whatsoever...

What really got to me was that it contradicted all the research I did before college. I remember looking at the department of labor and seeing higher numbers like here http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos027.htm and here http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes172141.htm

What I'm really asking is should I be worried? First about securing a job, and two about one that will pay me well? That same guy told me that you get paid on how well you sell yourself.

Also is there anywhere else I can go to get internship information, maybe one you guys know about something that would be of interest to me? I would be happy to send out my resume...

I always have regrets because my parents always wanted me to do pharmacy because its secure and starting pay is about 100k, but doesn't increase after that really...but then again i'd be happy getting that much without an increase! The reason I didnt do it is because it is more chemistry and biology heavy and I'm very much a math/physics guy.

Any input would help me soo much! Also is there anything you guys would recomend I do to improve my resume, like anything I should learn? thanks guys, i'm kind of going through a 'mid-college' crisis"

Someone had been nice enough to put a fleece jacket out for Marley, but he is still cold and shivering. We posted on Craigslist and made a lost animal report with the city. Unfortunately, neither of us can take him in—we’re both in grad school so we have class and internship for 8-10 hours a day. We would love it if someone could provide a home for the pup. Thanks for your help!

tl;dr Lost Chihuahua in Jacksonville, FL needs a home.

fg8l4,1,2011-02-06,Out of school for 4 years without a job: advice about going back to school for 2nd Bachelors (long w/ TL:DR),DietCokeTin,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fg8l4/out_of_school_for_4_years_without_a_job_advice/,"**TL;DR:** Went to UTSA for 2 years, did well my first year (3.92 GPA), completely flaked out for my second year (0.6 GPA), got myself grounded and focused on studying but went to Full Sail and graduated on time with a 3.64 GPA, helped out my dad for a year under agreement, started looking for a job but couldn’t find anything, moved to Houston and got a job at a hotel so I could at least make some income to pay down the massive loans I took out for school.  After 4 years, I still haven’t been able to find a job, so I’m thinking about returning to school (UT for a BS in CS) for retraining / reeducation / better opportunities and to get my mind active again.  Should I go back to school and finish up my second BS and adding even more money to my massive student loan debt (~100k)?  Read The Plan: for a more in depth question, if you wouldn’t mind.

**Then:** I always wanted to be a game developer, so I thought a CS degree would take me there.  I started out at UTSA, had a great first year, completely flaked the second year, transferred to Full Sail and graduated with a BS in Game Design and Development.  After graduating, I helped my dad per our arrangement for 8 months, then started looking for a job.  I moved to Houston later on to be in a larger town, stop mooching off my parents, and continue to pay back my student loans.  It's been 4 years since I've graduated and I've yet to find a job.

**Right Now:**  As of right now, I live in Houston working nights at a hotel making $12.50/hr, I do tutoring and teach some on the side, and I’m trying to start a small mobile apps studio.  I make ~$25k per year, and because I finally figured out the stupid importance of money and how to manage it, I’ve been able to funnel about $8,000 per year of that into my student loan with a decent size emergency fund and no other debts.  The problem is after a year of doing this, I’m beat.  I work almost 18 hours a day for about 6 days a week, I have absolutely no social life because I work nights, and haven’t been able to enjoy a lot of the things I used to.  I’m OK with that, you have to do what you have to do.  However, considering I have ~$100,000 in student loan debt left to pay, I don’t think I could survive doing this for another 12-15 years.  I need to find a catalyst; I need to do something that will springboard me into a more prosperous place.

**The Plan:**  I plan on transferring into UT Austin using my original credits from UTSA and finishing up my CS degree there.  Should I get in this coming fall, I should be able to finish up my degree in 3-4 semesters plus summers.  I don’t know if I’ll be able to get in for this fall semester, as I would have to apply as a transfer from UTSA with my failed craptastic year and low GPA, as UT Austin does not care if you have an undergrad degree or not if you’re seeking a second bachelors.  To help boost my GPA as well as fulfill some of the UT Austin degree reqs, I’ll be taking classes at the HCC (Houston Community College).  When the summer ends, I’ll be moving to Austin regardless if I am accepted or not, as it must cheaper to live in Austin than in Houston, and the software and game industries are huge there.  If I’m not accepted, I’ll continue taking transferable credits at ACC (Austin Community College) and try again the next semester.  I’ll also be working there, as I’ve made a lot of contacts in the hotel industry.  If/When I get accepted into UT Austin, I’ll still be actively looking for a job, internship, or any opportunity that will get me to where I want to go, as well as putting effort into rebuilding a current portfolio and working on the mobile apps studio.

**EDIT:** Holy hell, I submitted this thing and it's the longest post I've seen.  I've cut out a lot of backstory and context, but if anyone is curious I can post it as a reply."
fg2op,1,2011-02-05,"Reddit, how do I deal with my girlfriend's stalker ex-boyfriend",jvi,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fg2op/reddit_how_do_i_deal_with_my_girlfriends_stalker/,"I've been with this girl for about two years now, and I'm really in love with her. The problem is right now we are on completely different continents due to school/work. I'm about to graduate, but she's finishing an internship and still has a year of school to go after that. We've probably only been physically together for a year, and it's been rough at times doing LD, but we've made it through the hardest parts and we're still going strong.

Anyways, this week, out of nowhere, her ex-boyfriend calls her (he's on the same continent as me, but not the same city) and tells her to leave me and get back with him. Now, I know little about him (I don't even know his name), but I know he's an accountant and pretty smart (top of the class), and they were together for about 2 years before he cheated on her. 

But, this guy basically destroyed her life. He made her move with him to a different city, and she's the kind of girl that believes in sacrificing a lot for love. She also gave him all her money because she was working at the time and he wasn't. Then, he cheated on her and left her there and went back to his city. She couldn't go back due to financials. Her life was a mess since then, which is why she has to graduate later with not as good a degree.

I met her maybe 4 months after she broke up, and I always try to help her financially and make her happy (she had depression for a while), but she pretty much always refused any money, so I just always insist on paying whenever we eat together. I'm also just a poor student, but I just spend money very rarely, so I have quite a bit saved up.

Now, she pretty much tells me everything that happens in her life, which is how I know the guy called her. And, he's been calling her day and night for a few days now. She also told me that she previously tried to file a restraining order against him, but the guy's parents pressured her parents and forced her not to do it. These are asian parents. They'll do anything for their son, even at the cost of the well-being of others. Also, the girl's parents are very nice people, and would probably put other's needs before their own or their daughter's.

Since the ex-boyfriend and her physically apart, I know a restraining order doesn't make much sense right now. And she says she doesn't want to do it because it will ""ruin his reputation."" But, the guy cheated on her, took all her money, left her in a cold place by herself, and is now harassing her to try to get back together.

I'm not sure what I wanted to ask anymore. I guess I just wanted to type this out. But, does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? When we're physically together, I'll probably insist that she file a restraining order, but is there anything else I could do? I've told my girlfriend that I could call the guy or his parents and have a nice chat simply telling them to stop harassing my girlfriend, but she refused and said she ""can handle it.""

She's under alot of pressure right now due to work and the coming school term, and I just want to try to help get rid of this additional unnecessary pressure. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

tl;dr my girlfriend's ex calls her out of nowhere and tell her to dump me and get back with him. he has physically abused her in the past, but they've never had sex. i want her to file a restraining order against him, but she refuses because she doesn't want to ""ruin his reputation."" how do I keep my girlfriend safe?"

fhmgz,6,2011-02-08,MSCS people: was it worth it?,[deleted],compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/fhmgz/mscs_people_was_it_worth_it/,"EDIT: Just saw a post about someone complaining about ""should I get a MS"" spam. Sorry! I didn't know where else I should put this

EDIT2: I am in the USA.

Hey guys. I'm a 2nd-year (almost 3rd year) student at a university, doing a BS in CS at the moment. I'm starting to think about grad school a little bit - my school has a program where if you keep your GPA at a 3.5 or above and do enough undergrad research, you can apply to grad school and not have to take the GRE. On top of that, you can finish your BS AND MS in a total of 5 years if you are accepted. (being accepted depends largely on the fact that you have done undergrad research)

Does this sound like a good path to take? I have done absolutely no undergrad research so far so I would probably need to get on that. Also, I'm kind of interested about how useful a MS is in the real world, seeing as the company I intern for only has 1 guy with a MS. My dad's trying to push me to do it because he thinks I'll hit a 'glass ceiling' at work if I don't, but I'm not sure it always works like that...

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Advice needed.",hiplesster,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fiali/my_wife_a_medical_intern_is_having_a_really_hard/,"She's a first year medical resident in internal medicine. She's in a rut and continually gets shit on. 
Examples:

* She frequently has to care for other intern's bounce-back patients, when that intern is allowed to go home early or take the day off 
* based on completely random assignment, she constantly gets patient loads that make her cap out (i.e. 7 patients at a time) while other interns only have 4 or 5.
* She has gotten a pretty rotten rotation schedule and she has not even had a vacation yet (outside of x-mas break). Her first vacation isn't for another month.

She is at her wits end and I'm extremely worried about her. Are there any doctors (or spouses) out there who have any ideas on what I can do to help her out, and maybe what she can do to help herself? 

I think that once she gets to her 2 week vacation, she can decompress. But now, every little thing sends her over the edge. She's had 2 black weekends (no days off) in a row, and she is just exhausted.

She loves what she does when she's not run down, and she really can't quit anyways (signed a 1yr minimum contract - and it's a BIG no no to break that). I'd like any advice, stories, etc. you may have to offer."

Here's the thing. The vast majority of my jobs up until 2010 were restaurant, food service jobs. As of August 2010, I work on campus in the computer labs, fixing printers and helping people with passwords, crap like that. Not terribly glamorous work, but probably a step higher than being a waitress/cashier. From May 2010 to September, I was volunteering for a Ph.D candidate in his lab, analyzing soil samples.

So. Should I just not mention the food service jobs on my resume since they're kind of...irrelevant and were mostly during high school? The only problem is that it would make it seem like I haven't held a job at all until last year, which isn't true. Is there a cut-off date? Should I omit jobs that were before a certain year? What to do?

Basically, I've heard the key to summers is getting an internship during them.  And I've been having a ton of trouble in that area (and now I fear I'm way too late).  I hope I'm just doing something wrong that's easily fixable, but it's pretty disheartening when after career fairs or whatever, your friends all get interviews and some of them wind up with great internships, and I wind up with nothing.

In fact, I've never actually had a real interview before.  And I'm 21.  All the jobs I've had (organizing an extremely unorganized file cabinet at an engineering office to an easy-to-use electronic form in summer 2009 and my two jobs which are basically TA'ing) I have gotten without interviews.

The thing I'm most worried about I guess is way in the future.  I haven't really done any projects (part of being interested more in the theoretical parts of CS I guess) and it looks like I'm not going to have time to get involved in any right now--as part of trying to make myself better (can't find a better word than that) I kind of overloaded myself this semester and don't really have time for much else.  And I'm scared that when I'm older I won't be able to get anything because I never had anything when I was younger.  And I'd say some of the anxiety comes from still not knowing what I want to do--I do not particularly want to be a code monkey / software engineer, and my biggest interests outside my field are transportation (like civil engineering), linguistics, and modern east Asia (thanks to the awesome people I've met here at my university that are from there!  I actually went to Taiwan last summer and am studying Mandarin Chinese because of it) and of course my ultimate dream job would be simulating proposed changes in traffic networks either here or over there.

But I'm rambling now.. back to the main question:  if it's not too late now, what can I do to help ensure I have a productive summer and therefore have a better experience later on?  I've applied or are applying to a couple of things like REU's (research experiences for undergraduates) because I'm also kind of strongly considering going to graduate school, but there's still the chance that everything falls through and I spend the summer with a cloud over my head for 14 weeks.

I covered roughly the first half of Math 53 near the end of the second semester of my AP Calc BC class last year, so I'm familiar with some of the material. I'm aware that it will be covered faster over the summer, but that's not as much of a concern for me as the instructors and the exams.

I have a great job (at least the benefits are great) as a software engineer, but I can't shake the feeling that I just don't love it, but I can't think of what I'd actually like to do.  

I can't tell if it's the actual work of the job, or if it's the fact I am a young girl working with a bunch of older men that I can't possibly connect to.  There are also a few younger coworkers I'm friends with, but I literally don't know a single girl in my office (it's filled with older men and a few older women).  I also feel like because of how development is structured, most of my coworkers and I are just the minions of a few ""geniuses"" who literally tell us what to do, and most of them have been here for a decade or more so there is a lot of tribal knowledge and a huge learning curve.  I feel like my skills are going unused and that I'm actually getting worse at programming and forgetting things I learned in school, especially because there is more bug fixing (read, one line changes with extensive testing) than new development.  We also program primarily in Ada, which obviously isn't a hot skillset.  I yearn for a company with a less stuffy environment, that has more new work coming in and where I actually feel like I can be creative and actually ""own"" something.

I go through periods where I'm a little busy and it's not so bad, but sometimes I feel like I'm depressed, I don't feel like I'm good at my job and suffer from low self-esteem and lack of confidence in my abilities.  I am interested in web development (which is what led me to choose CS in the first place) and web applications, though I've only really worked in that area in an internship for a 7 month stint. When I even get time to browse job postings it seems like they all call for 5+ years of experience working in the area, so I wouldn't even know how to get that experience to even get an entry level job.   

I guess...does anyone have any advice about how I could even begin to build skillsets on my own to get out of my job and into web development?  Or has anyone ever felt this way?  I'm afraid of switching jobs just to find out that maybe programming is just not my cup of tea any more, but I also don't want to give up because I worry that it's just this specific job and environment that I don't thrive in."

So, for years before college, and all through college, everyone in the science and engineering industries were freaking out “There aren’t enough people going into science/engineering!” – “America needs more engineers, we won’t have enough” – “No one is going into Science/engineering. Will America fall behind technologically!?!?!1!!1?1!one”.  

Well. Guess what? I loved math, I loved science so I got my degree in Structural Engineering. I worked my ass off, studied, got an internship working 30+ hours a week. 18-22 credits a semester, I gave up so many things. And I did it! I graduated with my degree in Structural Engineering! I took the F.E. and passed! I was ready! … but guess what?   

That’s right. No jobs. Where did they go? No one could tell me. Were they coming back? “I don’t know” was the response. Well, wait, I was told for 8+ years these jobs were needed, in fact, it was a matter of national-fucking-security that I be some sort of scientist or engineer. And here I am, and there’s nothing! I have to work part time at fucking McDonalds and even then, I can’t afford my school loans. You tell me it’s because there’s just not enough money, no one is building, no one is investing. I call Bull Shit. I think people are hoarding money, and genuinely just don’t give two fucks about our economy or it’s direction.  

Now, I understand the economy sucks. But here’s the deal. It will come back, and when it does, you know what will happen? Your company is up shit creek with no paddle. Why? Because instead of INVESTING in younger engineers and training them, you sat on your stacks and whined that you were no longer making 40billion a year, only 10 billion. And that just wasn’t enough for the Jet AND the M3.   

So guess what. Fuck you. Fuck all of you and your stupid companies. I hope in the end, America becomes an intellectually and technologically bankrupt society for lack of caring and investing in those willing to sacrifice their time and money, for those that were willing to invest themselves into a part of society that clearly no one gives a fuck about.   

Have fun explaining to your grandchildren why there are no serviceable bridges left the country, and why there are no roads in the year 2030. **I’m out bitches!**  

**TL:DR** - Fuck every single last one of you.

If you'd be willing to read how I got to this point, and give me advice on how best to get out of this situation, I would be ever-grateful. Okay...

It's December 2007. I'm ending my third semester of graduate studies at Iowa State, studying Rhetoric and Professional Communication. I went into grad school right after finishing my undergrad, also at Iowa State, in Technical Communication Though only a TA, I am also teaching, on my own, two sections of Freshman composition, and have about 40 students. I am also working a second job, 10 hours a week, for an on-campus engineering organization as a ""Communication Specialist"" to make ends meet. I also am planning on doing a ""creative component"" in lieu of a thesis, relating to the Iowa caucus. Due to me biting off more than I can chew, and procrastination due to my already full schedule, the creative component winds up blowing up in my face.

I drift into a deep funk due to this, and after winter break, I can barely get myself to go to classes and do my teaching. I stop going to my ""communications specialist"" job, and then am to ashamed of myself to contact them saying I quit. As far as they know, I've fallen off the face of the earth. To this day I still feel bad about how I handled it, as I probably should. When suicidal thoughts start to enter my head, I get some counseling. I finish out the semester and, my TAing elegibility run out, become unemployed. I decide to take a couple months or so to rest and recuperate before looking for a job as a web designer/developer. About September 2008 I realize that while I've got the ""theoretical"" skills for my hopeful profession, I'm lacking a great grasp of the technical skills, such as javascript and even anything beyond basic HTML/CSS. I start working on improving this, but still find no job.

It's February 2009, and my mom (who's disabled) develops a severe case of pancreatitis which, with complications, almost kills here several times. She's in hospital about a month. I move home to help out, both with her, and with my brother and sister, then ages 10 and 12, who both have fairly severe Asperger's. Helping take care of the family puts my job hunt on hold for a while, and I spend time working 'round the house, and working on my web design skills. My car develops trouble and my dad, ever the handyman, says that he and I will work on it, instead of taking it to a mechanic. First, however, we work on building a wood shed, that is done about the time the first snows of winter come, making working on the car impossible until about March of 2010. Being wheel-less, I dial back the job hunt, thinking (in retrospect, rationalizing would be a more accurate description) that I can't commit to a job when I don't know if I'll be able to get to it. I do, however, try my hand at a bit of freelancing, and design precisely one website.

Once the car is working, I begin looking again, and get a couple interviews, but never hear back. In September, my Dad has a heart attack. We've been working on fixing up our house during the summer, and I find myself having to finish replacing a floor and a toilet on my own, with dad now just walking me through it, before Winter sets in. I also find myself helping take care of my dad for a while.

I now find myself looking for jobs, but not hearing back. I know that this long stretch of unemployment is hurting my job search, but I'm not sure what to do about it. I have a few letters of recommendation, from a professor and from a supervisor at an internship, but feel odd about listing them, as it's been years since I worked with those people. My dad was laid off a while back, and while his unemployment is keeping the family afloat, I know I'm a drain on my family's tight resources, and it's eating me up inside.

I know I've screwed myself, I'm just having a hard time figuring out how best to get past it. Any advice you can give me would be a godsend, but even if you just read through it, thank you for caring that much.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask them."

Instead of just waiting until such a time that I can, I'm going to try doing things for myself in the meantime, taking piano lessons, reading jazz fake books, and one of the things I want to do is get back into programming. 

I was an IT Intern for an electrical contracting company for about 8 months before being laid off after they closed some major contracts. My initial job was to pick up the slack, but after about a couple months of being there, they didn't have much else for me to do aside from maintaining SIM card phone lists (the company was T-Mobile at the time) and maintaining the IT office. So they put me on software analysis. First Microsoft Infopath, then a few others, and eventually they had me try out SharePoint. They wanted to use it for the company, so they set up a mock server, and I messed around in that. Once I had a good handle on that, I made some applications using VB.NET to expedite some command line functions for importing templates and other miscellaneous tasks for SharePoint. I know a fair bit of VB.NET, a tiny bit of C#.NET, but haven't used either in a couple years now, so what should I look into (re)learning, and how can I go about learning/using it?

TLDR: What programming language would be most beneficial for me to learn or at least look into with a small prior background with programming?

Edit: Well it seems that C#, Java, and Python are all strongly recommended, so what are the pros/cons of learning each?"

I'm not really expecting pity, I am an able and competent person. Thanks for reading, in advance. 

**tl;dr** I am a college graduate with nothing on the horizon. Seeking advice on the 20s, employment, staying positive for others and moving forward.

**le good**

I graduated nearly two years ago. I did pretty well at a growing state school and finished with a liberal arts degree over a 3.1/4.  I was often commended by professors in my field for talented writing and an engaging, intuitive sense of language. 

I did things in school. I was on a nationally competitive academic team. I did an internship at a non-profit associated with my university, which now serves as many of my talking points in interviews. I was a teaching assistant. I have volunteer experience with kids and adults in special demographics.  

I am eager and youthful. I have a cute smile. I sound professional. 

----
**zi bad** 

I am fairly positive, at this point in my life, that I am an undiagnosed sufferer of bipolar disorder. My mother is bipolar, her mother was worse.  For as long as I can remember I have had manic highs and lows, that flicker like a light-switch, triggered by interactions with others. Regardless, I haven't caved to the idea of medication because I am weary of the power of narcotics. Also, I don't have insurance, so I can't go talk to anyone, if that were covered. 

I have self-medicated since 16 with marijuana and drink irregularly but recklessly, when I do. I am heavily addicted to grass, I smoke as regularly as some cigarette smokers do, if able. 

I suppose I never convinced myself that functioning high all day was a poor reinforcer of living habits that might have netted me a job by now. 

While on topic substance (booze), I got hit by a car about two weeks after graduating college and am still, in some ways, physically recovering from it. I was drunk and the driver of the vehicle was, but the accident was my fault. 

I realize now that this accident has affected me in all sorts of ways, but the take home point is that it really threw me off balance. I didn't really even start looking for jobs until late in the fall of that year because of the injuries. I thought that some of the injuries were going to be permanent and this devastated me. 

Anywho, the injuries are much better, though if i ever hit my 80-90%+ I will report back with pics, detailing. 

So, I spent a while living on my own, hoarding what money I had left, smoking too much and applying for jobs. Then, I started to run low on money then out, then my folks supported me, then failed interviews, DEPRESSION, then JOB!! But, its a shitty job, and I fail to realize that ""any better than none"".

So the money runs back out, and I am forced to move home, beaten. A year out of school without a thing to show. 

Fast forward, hiking, sprained ankle, girlfriends, concerts, holidays, a few applications, hate living with folks, I finally get another job. 

Its another shitty job, and I have a contract labour position somewhere else. 

What can I do to keep going? Grad school was always 50/50, I never made a solid decision on field. And until I do, and at this point manage to get reimbursed or table my undergrad loans, I am not considering going back to school.

I have alienated people from school that call to check in on me because I am embarrassed, my best friends are all jollying on, I vent to my folks because I'm a joke and they still fawn over me, I feel myself slipping into my mid 30's with nothing. 

I don't know, have i just deluded myself into thinking that I deserve a solid 40k out of college too?  

Hey, for the anyone who connects with this, i'm here too, and *maybe* this is just reality, seats taken. Just get in where you can fit in and try not to push everyone else around you away^away^away^away^away

I've been programming for a while now and I think I'm a pretty decent programmer, insofar as I can come up with working code that does what I want it to do. 

I'm a junior in college, majoring in computer science, and I've been applying for internships for the summer. I said that I know Java on my resume because I have about 4 years of experience programming in Java, and I thought I did know Java really well. However, I keep getting slammed on questions about the back-end: basically, technical questions about what's going on behind-the-scenes. For example, one question that I wasn't able to answer was the difference between 

String x = ""abc""; and String x = new String(""abc"");

What are some good resources for learning about things like this? Most intro programming books just kind of cover ""how to do this in Java,"" which I pretty much know already. I guess I'm looking into learning how to write Java well, not just how to make it work, if that makes any sense. 

Thanks guys!"

I have been to numerous doctors who have told me a number of different things and prescribed a number of medications. These treatments have had some varying success. I am now 23 and in my final semester of college. I have worked my way through college as first an it tech for a department of my campus and then as a desktops system administration intern for an engineering company. My supervisors in both positions were very understanding of my condition and worked with me and did not mind me taking time off when my headaches were to bad to work. I like what I do now and feel like I am good at it but I am concerned that my headaches will prevent me from being able to keep steady employment. Currently I am having less headaches then I have ever had but still end up being out of commission 1-2 days every two weeks. When my headaches were at their worst I ended up taking a break from school for a semester because I was suffering 5 days out of 7. My wife and myself would really like to move once I am done with school and doing so will mean the end to any position I have with my currently employer (staying would not guarantee a position either). So my question is what sort of work should I be looking for that would be accepting of my limitations? If it helps making suggestions I am well versed in windows domain environments, vb and powershell scripting, preboot deployment and imaging of computers. I also have done a lot of patch and security maintenance and some antivirus administration. I like learning new things and work very hard and do good work when I am not unable to do it due to headaches.  "

I feel like my life could be much better, and I was given the opportunities, but I threw it away.

-----

I feel like I threw away opportunities for a romantic life. I am/can be relatively social/fun to be around, and am decently attractive/in-shape, but I've gone my whole life without a girlfriend. I feel like a complete loser for never even going on a date. I have no idea what it feels like to kiss, let alone hold hands with a girl, and this makes me feel incredibly sad and pathetic. I know I'm relatively young, but try talking to Freshman/Sophmores about your college experiences so far, and it's painful when they see you as someone that's already gone through college and experienced the next 4 years they are going to experience, but you've never even been on a date. I feel like middle school/high school/college are set-up nicely for getting into dating, but here I am with 0 experience about to enter the real world with people with experience (I feel like a complete loser--it'd be like a middle school boy on his first date with a mature 22 year-old woman)? I feel like there's no hope here; I messed up.

Even if I do somehow go on a date or am present with an opportunity for a first kiss, my mind is totally psyched-out as I've been wanting this all my life; and what a mess I will be when I have to deal with my first break-up...).

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away high school. Every lunch period I spent in the library. I feel like I had a decently enjoyable personality, but I was too shy to ever try to talk to or hang out with my ""friends"" outside of class. I also never went to a single dance in my life, so I feel like I really lost 4 important years of my life (people are always shocked when I tell them I've never been to a formal/prom). Don't tell me they were pointless if you went; it's easy to brush them off as nothing important when you actually went to them.

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away college. I had pretty solid grades to start out college (ended up in an honor society), but I *never* did anything outside required school-work, and my GPA slowly decreased. It's still solid, I guess, but the end-result is that I am graduating soon with no internship experience, no research experience, and no faculty member that could give me a letter of recommendation, and the job market is grim for an experience-less B.S. in EE (and I couldn't apply for Masters anywhere due to no experience and nobody to write letters of rec). 

Being in an honor society, I was surrounded by people that did the exact opposite of me and are so experienced and on top of things.  I feel like I threw away a great opportunity here. I don't know what I'm going to do after graduation (a strong part of me sees myself dead by graduation). I absolutely do not want to move back home.

-----

-----

I feel like I threw away a relationship with my family. There's a language barrier between me and my mom, so there was hardly any communication growing up beyond very simple things, and the barrier wasn't as bad with my dad, but a lack of interest resulting in no deep relationship there either (never ate dinner with them together, usually cooked my own food; never call home; when my dad does pick me up, the 90 minute car ride home usually only contains a grand total of 90 seconds worth of talking). 

They took a hands-off approach to parenting, and I always felt they were bad parents because of that. They would drive me crazy when they would make comparisons between me and my brother (2 years older &amp; worse off--also depressed, didn't go to college, over-weight, balding, little social life, lives at home, etc.); for example, on the rare occasion that my brother would get the motivation to walk (too out of shape to run) on the treadmill, they'd tell him to run like I do, he would get mad, and they would be clueless. I would try to explain to them that that is bad parenting, but the language barrier makes it impossible to explain the somewhat complicated reasons why what they did was stupid. The end result was frustration on my part. 

Similar episodes built-up over the years and I kept it all to myself--the end result was pretty much a total drop of communication once I entered college since I was fed up. I know a lot of people don't get in relationships until late, or aren't too successful professionally, but I feel like these people usually at least have a family they have a strong emotional connection with to fall back on...

-----

-----

I threw away the friendships I gained in college. I opened up to some people about my suicidal nature, but I've broken contact with them since I go nuts around them (one I had a crush on, the other I couldn't believe really, truly cared about me as much as I wanted to believe she did, so I blew up little indicators of a possible lack of affection into big fights with her). Haven't spoken to them in ~7 months.

I had a somewhat close group of friends, but they were all academic go-getters that didn't seem to have the problems I had (they had internships, research opportunities, significant others, actual relationships with family, etc.) and I grew bitter/jealous around them. So, now I have no social life.

-----

-----

It's hard not to feel weak or like a failure at life. My brother even told me he attempted suicide, but I find myself running from his problems as well and not doing the things I should be doing to help him (like regularly talk to him, or try to get him enrolled in a community college or something).  

I tried therapy, anti-depressants (Lexapro, Pristiq, and Wellbutrin), opening up to friends, and a support group, but I'm still here. I still can't fight off this urge to just give up and kill myself because I can't change the past and I don't see anything promising in the future. I know my suicide will affect certain people, but I can't feel miserable every day just so that I don't send a ripple through other people's lives. "

I've been working at a web startup for about 2 months now and the CEO told me that they'll be giving me an offer for a more ""permanent"" position (I can't work full time because I'm also going to school most of the week). 

I'm getting paid a $500 stipend and they're covering my travel charges (about $70 a month). My work includes front-end changes like CSS, HTML, JS code, some QA, and anything else I want to get involved in. I've learned a lot and the guys are fun to be around. I work about 15-25 hours a week. Some times I go in on weekends if I need to finish something up. I'm also always checking in online from home or on the go, so basically I'm working any time I'm not on reddit, at school, or on eating.

I was wondering what kind of an offer should I be looking for? I mean, even for a college student, $500 is pretty bad and there's places around here that pay more but because I know I have a chance to work my way up, grow as a programmer, and also just pick up business habits, I like the internship. 
When they offer me, should I be negotiating for something specific? Is there something I'm missing like the amount of pay, any perks, or anything else?

I know this might be very broad that I'm asking about but I'm sure some people who are programmers started out as interns and I want to know how you guys got into permanent or full-time positions."
fpzv0,5,2011-02-21,I was offered a paid internship and a year of employment after that if I lent my boss $5000. What does reddit think?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fpzv0/i_was_offered_a_paid_internship_and_a_year_of/,"Throwaway for identification and legal purposes. This is a complete shot in the dark, but any help with this decision helps, so I thought I'd give reddit a try.

So here's my story. I am a fourth year engineering student at a UC, and I've been interning at a small engineering company for more than a year now. And by small, I mean less than 5 people small. It's an engineering firm, and they are at a crossroads. The boss is about to lose his building because he is over $30,000 behind in rent. He has asked me and a couple other fellows at this company to borrow $5000 each in order to stay afloat for 3 months in order to sell some assets. These assets are worth about a total of more than $300,000, and would help him hire engineers and to help pursue venture capital. He received a letter of eviction a few weeks ago, but managed to go to court for an extension and he needs the money from us by this Friday. This is what he proposed:

In exchange for lending $5000, we would be offered a paid 3 month internship after we graduate in the Spring. Depending on when he gets his venture capital, we would start our full time position, and would be paid back the money we lent. He would set aside about $10000 worth of “valuable mechanical devices” in a storage in the event that nothing goes right, and the company tanks. We are also offered stock options, with the promise that this company would become the next Google of the industry that the company is in.

Here is where it gets really complicated. I’ve applied for the Air Force Officer’s Program, and I would know if I get accepted or not in June. If I were to accept this offer from the engineering company, I would have a guaranteed position in this company for a year and a quarter, if things go right. But I’d have to turn down the Air Force, which is something that I sort of want to do. However, I signed an agreement with them, stating that should I be accepted, I would have to join. My recruiter, however, said there was technically a way for me not to join if I were accepted. The reason I chose the Air Force was because I am sure I would get monster job offers once I get out. What engineering firm wouldn’t want a commissioned Air Force Officer to join their company, especially with engineering experience in the military?

So pretty much, I am having a tough time deciding to take this engineering firm’s offer or not. To me, it seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, because if this company really were to become the next big thing, I would be set for life. I would probably be able to retire very, very early. On the other hand, if I did not accept and this happened, I would be regretting it my whole life.

There are many factors I’ve thought of. It might sound like I am paying for a job, but the boss justified it by saying it is only lending, and that I would have been offered a position out of college anyways. The Air Force AND this offer seem like great opportunities, because in the Air Force, I would be gaining extremely valuable experience and skillsets. With this company, I could probably be a very rich man, given that it works out, or I could regret not joining the Air Force, given that it does NOT work out.

What do you guys think? Input of any kind is welcome. Suggestions, advice, stories, questions, etc etc.

EDIT: So far, everyone's been giving good advice. The consensus seems to not lend the money. Let me add some things. One of the employees there, who's been with the company for 10 years, is also a Vice President at another company. He makes commands a six figure salary, but said that he would give it all up and work full time with this company should it raise the venture capital. Another employee, a lawyer, works for the company without pay. He is an environment attorney with a good rep who works for FREE. Shouldn't this say a lot about the potential of the company? But reading through my comments, you can tell that I am biased towards the company. Please understand that I am passionate about green energy, and I really, REALLY want this company to make it. I am not sure if this changes anything, for the better or for worse. Hope this helps.

BTW thanks for the comments and keep them coming!!"

I'm aware some people may think of me as shallow for putting a priority on income, but I find one of my worst daydreams at the moment is getting into a job path that ends up with myself stuck in a culdesac.

In addition, does anyone recommend any sources of good UK job market information regarding IT jobs, salary estimations etc?

P.s. I'm particularly interested in network and system security, and UNIX over windows administration, although I am happy developing knowledge in both."
ftcdi,2,2011-02-26,What to expect from a follow up Systems Software Engineer Interview,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ftcdi/what_to_expect_from_a_follow_up_systems_software/,"I have a follow up interview for a entry level Systems Software Engineer position at a moderately large information solutions company.  The first interview was general interview questions (eg. Why this company? What do you want to be in 10 years? What programming experience do you have? etc.)  The position's desired skills include SQL, SAS, C#, SQL Servers, and .NET.  

I am currently studying Management of Information Systems with a minor in Computer Science at a state school.  I have had 2 internships in IT, but with little to no programming (help desk positions).  I graduate with my bachelors in June and the position will be a full time position once graduated.  

My question is does anyone have any advice or example questions (specific or general) that may be asked during this.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, really.  Thanks in advance, also if you need any additional information I will be happy to provide it."

I was recently given offers for summer internships at both Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank. The salaries are very similar, so the question is: which company is better to work for? The specific position title is Technology Analyst Intern. I would most likely be doing either application development (e.g. writing software tools for the analysts) or IT stuff. Your suggestions are appreciated."

What good engineering/computer science schools are nearby?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ftf9r/swiss_redditors_im_really_wanting_to_move_to/,"Specifically, I'm currently majoring in systems engineering with a focus on electrical engineering, mathematics, and minoring in computer science.

I would settle for computer science and math, though.  I do have experience in the workforce already, I've had an awesome engineering internship for a year, and I do a lot of programming there."
fuk43,1,2011-02-28,How to improve phone interview ?! [mechancal engineer/intern],[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/fuk43/how_to_improve_phone_interview_mechancal/,"So I am a sophomore mechanical engineering student and I just got my first opportunity at a mechanical engineering internship. The company (Cummins) wants to have a phone interview with me later this week. 

The Cummins interview process consists of three steps. The first step is a phone interview with a member of the recruiting team. The second step is a phone interview with a hiring manager about a specific job opportunity within their department. The third and final step is attending an Open House event at one of our locations to get better acquainted with our company and team.

Is this the kid of stuff they will be asking? why do you want this job; what do you know about our company; how are you experienced to work for us; what is your background; tell us something you did that was really great.

What are some things I can do to improve my phone interview? I know when I interviewed people for an organization I am a part of, what really impressed me is when they asked ME questions.

I'm currently in my first semester of community college as a 21 year old (went to med school in India, wasn't for me) and I was wondering if anyone had any advice relating to my academic path. 

I really want to be a part of the rise in popularity of soccer in the united states and would love a job with an MLS team, preferably the Chicago Fire since I'm a Chicago native. 

I have yet to pick a major because I want to wait and see which one will be the most useful for a job with a sports team. 

Should I go marketing? Should I go computer science? Should I go administration/management? Finance/Econ? I would love to be a part of the team operations but I'm pretty sure its the hardest to join.

I looked at some of the available internships but I cant really apply until I have some relevant classes under my belt. So maybe I'll be ready in about a year?

Interest wise I can do marketing as its a strong suite. Computer Science is what I'm on the path for but my math skills aren't too good. Management I guess is good but if I fail to get into sports, I wont be left with many other options with a management major. 

I'm planning on asking the college's soccer team's coach if I could apply for an internship with him for more experience too."
