Currently doing the masters internship at a top bioinformatics lab where we develop algorithms. I find this interesting but I have realized I am interested in working somewhere closer to the biomedical field. 

I'd like to work in a lab where I use computational tools to find answers to biomedical questions. But not necessarily only program algorithms, maybe something closer to visualize data and produce statistics. 

I have talked to another PI who is studying metastasis in breast cancer and needs a computational biologist in his mostly wet lab. 

Given my interests this is the type of place I want to go for sure. However, my question is whether it makes sense to move from an established dry lab (with a PI who has lots of papers and citations) to a relatively new wet lab with no other computational biologists other than them going by with user-friendly software.

My current PI is always busy and would have little time to actually advise me as he assumes we all work independently. The PI from the wet lab told me he needs someone with my profile but he would have to find someone else to supervise my computational work as he has no idea. But he has a medium size lab which makes him more accessible than the first one.

Any advice or things to consider? Should I do the PhD with my current PI or go for the second and work in what I like even though the PI won't be able to actually help me (is that good or bad or whatever?)?"

I'm a sophomore who declared CS last semester, and I am struggling big time. I did well in CS 50, CS 20, and my freshman math classes, and I did okay in CS 51. Last semester I didn't do very well in Stat 110 and CS 121 (both B- :() and had an awful time, but I at least thought that was to be expected I guess since they're known to be tough.

My ass is getting kicked this semester in CS 124 to the point where I think I will be in the C range by the end of the semester unless something dramatically changes. Moreover, I am fucking miserable, struggling to get even 5 hours of sleep most nights, eating as quickly as possible, no time for friends or activities, hygiene worsening, etc. I do work with people after trying to solve things myself, but my groups are usually similarly lost and I just get bad scores on everything. I wish I could say my problems were procrastination, distractions, poor work ethic, as that would be easier to solve. Just keeping up and maintaining these bare minimums so as to not outright fail is already slowly killing me from the inside.

It's not that I don't think I'm cut out for anything tech as a whole; I did well in a software eng internship last summer and have one for this summer. But I question whether I can handle the CS program here. I have realized just how badly I suck at math and abstract things compared to the math gods in these classes. I am just struggling so bad and don't know how I can maintain this lifestyle moving forward, and I'm so scared to talk about it with anyone. I don't even know if there is any other concentratoin I could even do at this point considering I've mainly taken CS courses (I like bio for example but that's probably out of the picture by now). I'm terrified that I'm just going to fail everything and get kicked out or something

Maybe I'm overthinking it and just need to get through things. Is CS just supposed to be very difficult here? I don't know, I'm hoping any of you wise seniors or grads can provide some advice for this chap who is having a very bad time :("

t3y5wr,2,2022-02-28,How can I do an efficient unit test of a library function with various types of arguments in C++?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/t3y5wr/how_can_i_do_an_efficient_unit_test_of_a_library/,"Background: I'm using the Unity test framework to write unit tests for custom library functions from the manufacturer of some hardware we're using.  I'm an intern and this is the first time I've done unit testing.

The function I'm trying to test takes in an unsigned int, pointers to several unsigned longs, pointers to two different chars, and a pointer to a void pointer (I don't why it wants a pointer to another pointer, but that's what the documentation says).  

I managed to write a test that just manually use a test assert on each argument after its passed by reference into the function and that works, but it seems ugly and inefficient, and I have several more of these tests to write, so I need to figure out a better way to do this.  

My thought was to put everything into some kind of data structure and use a loop to compare the values within the structure after they're passed through the function to an array of NULLs (as initialized everything to NULL at the start and I'm currently just testing if the function is modifying them at all).  

I tried various versions of using an array, a std array, and a vector, using std::variant to be able to use multiple data types in the same array/vector but I couldn't get any of them to work.  I did std::vector&lt;std::variant&lt;//list of each data type&gt;&gt; and similarly for vector and c style arrays but it kept complaining about my use of variant.  I did look up how to use variant by itself, but getting the values from it looked like it'd be just as messy as manually checking each argument.  I also considered using a tuple, as that was one of the other options that came up when I Googled “array containing multiple types C++"" but that looked like it'd be just as messy as manually testing each function argument.

I finally gave up on that approach and tried using a c-style array of void pointers (tried using std::array first but intellisense was being really weird and kept telling me I was using an incomplete type even if I did something as simple as std::array&lt;int,3&gt; x = {1, 2, 3}; I tried compiling it anyway since intellisense is often wrong, but then the compiler gave a similar error).  That seemed to work at first, but when I tried to do, e.g. TEST_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL(NULL, (DevInfoList*)[index value of relevant parameter]) but it kept complaining that “TEST_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL does not take 4 arguments” which makes zero sense, since I only input two arguments.
I also tried to do it using an array/vect of type DEVICE_LIST_INFO_NODE (which is a typedef struct defined in one of the library files, which contains all the same types as the function arguments)
but my coworker pointed out that'd just make an array of structs, not an array of the data types within the struct definition.  

I'm not really sure what I did wrong with any of the approaches, despite plenty of Googling.  I feel like I just don't know how to Google properly anymore, because lately I just can't seem to find anything useful to help me with troubleshooting."

Ultimately want to end up in B4,Current-Law-5591,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/t3zah9/which_offer_should_i_take_ultimately_want_to_end/,"I am a senior in college and will be graduating this May with a degree in finance. I changed my major to finance pretty late in the game— right before my senior year. Therefore, I don’t have much finance experience since my internships were catered towards market strategy and business development. I was really worried about finding a job in my field before/when I graduate. However, I went to a career fair at my campus and networked with a few companies, which resulted in interviews and ultimately full-time job offers upon graduation. I’ve narrowed my focus on jobs within the risk department, as that’s where I have most interest in as of right now (again, no actual experience to truly decide this, but just from speaking with others and my own research I’ve concluded this). I received two offers that I’m debating between. One is from FIS Global as a risk analyst, and it’s part of a development/rotational program where I’ll be learning, but also working as a full-time associate. The program is 2 years and then I’ll be able to decide which department of risk I want to fully commit to and most likely increase in my level of position. I received this offer a few weeks ago, and I did already accept it since I had a small window to submit my decision. 
A week after I signed my offer, I got the opportunity to interview with another firm that was of interest, which led to a full-time job offer. This other offer is from RSM as a risk consulting associate. It’s not necessarily a learning program, but it’s geared towards new grads. 

The location of the job for FIS is more ideal, but the location for RSM would get me out of my comfort zone. The salary offer is $8k higher for RSM, which is something else I’m taking into consideration. On the other hand, FIS will offer raises based on merit every 6 months in the program. Ultimately, my goal is to stay in a firm for a few years and try to transition into a Big 4. With all these considered, would the opportunity at FIS Global or RSM help position me better to get a job at a Big 4? From my initial thought I would think RSM, but I also really value the learning experience at FIS. However, if it’s an obvious answer that RSM would lead me to more exit opportunities (if it’s significantly more than FIS would), then I would choose RSM."

&gt;Dear Lawyer Dog,

&gt;Thank you so much for getting back to me! I got it after 7PM, and it was the first response I got to my message (attached).
&gt;I had to double-check the dictionary that you indeed said what you said:

&gt;**fact**  *(noun)* **\ ˈfakt  \**

&gt;I am glad we are aligned here. An accurate depiction would require the perspectives of the people that worked with me; I only have my side of the said depiction.

&gt;The purpose of my request was to make sure that we are on the same page regarding the particular points listed: i.e., that they actually occurred, and represent facts (rather than claims, allegations, assertions, etc). As for accuracy, I will do my best to include this statement from NotEvilCorp as a disclaimer whenever I share my recollection of my journey with NotEvilCorp.

&gt;I greatly appreciate that, having a full day to go over my letter, NotEvilCorp was not able to deny that any part of the my personnel records about myself below are factually correct. While I clearly indicated that lack of communication from CEO by 6PM today would be taken as an equivalent to the above, it is always good to have a confirmation in clear writing. 

&gt;When I write about my experiences at workplaces on social media, I am always worried that I could accidentally say something that's not factually correct. Having your feedback is invaluable for my peace of mind. Yet again, I am extremely thankful.

&gt;I am also glad that we all had a chance to resolve any potential disagreements on the below facts internally, today, December Nth, 2021, on my last day as an employee of the company. 

&gt;**PLEASE NOTE:** As my employment came to an end, I am going to take a week away from receiving any communications while I am moving to a new place. 

&gt;I'm glad you all had a chance to vet my perspective before I go offline.

&gt;Should something truly urgent come up, again, I'll make an exception for a Zoom call with CEO. 

&gt;Sayonara, and looking forward to what y'all make with the Fetaverse!

&gt;&gt;&gt;**Date:** Wed, Nth Dec 2021 09:28:10 -0800  

&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear HR Person, VP of HR, and CEO!  

&gt;&gt;&gt;**""Skip Manager singles out, fires Ukrainian Jew on the first day of Hannukah as Ukrainian conflict escalates""**   

&gt;&gt;&gt;There are many ways to describe my last day at NotEvilCorp, but this one was in on my mind as Skip Manager delivered me the news from the screen Monday morning. Appreciating irony is in our blood, you see. While this surely wasn't my top idea of why I was singled out, the way things aligned made me wonder out loud if that was the case. **""NotEvilCorp CEO does AMA for pesky questions, covertly fires employee who asks them, screws him out of stocks""** came to mind as well; I held my tongue. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;Sadly, HR Person, seemingly being oblivious to either of these, translated the irony into something akin to ""hostile work environment"" in her notes (which, according to my notes, was not how I put it; I don't speak legalese). Given the unreliability of HR Person's translation (and rich prior history of ""mistakes"" in our communication), I am supplementing what I told HR Person with this note to make sure we are all on the same page regarding my journey with NotEvilCorp. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;As we said in our team in the end of each week, it's time for a retrospective. While I'm still waiting for the technical post-mortem for the three-day outage a month ago, I am going to self-organize and write one for my journey with NotEvilCorp, as I'm waiting for my final paycheck to arrive.

&gt;&gt;&gt;Without further ado, here is the peculiar sequence of events that ended up with my termination yesterday morning, in five parts. I hope you will be able to take the long view of this chronology, as it's not short. Impatient readers may skip to **Part II: the Scandal**, though it's **Part III: The Cover-Up**  that deserves the most attention. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;**Disclaimer:** any implication of improper conduct on the part of NotEvilCorp is not intentional; part names are figurative. My goal is to state the facts as they happened. Please understand that English is not my native language, and I apologize in advance for any mis-speach that would indicate bad faith on the part of NotEvilCorp employees.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**[ACTION REQUIRED]**  
&gt;&gt;&gt;I ask all recipients to acknowledge the receipt of this email, to ensure clarity in this situation (HR Person, please make sure that VP of HR and CEP receive this).

&gt;&gt;&gt;Should anyone in NotEvilCorp have any concerns regarding the following account, I will be available to discuss these concerns with CEO until 6PM today. As HR Person indicated, my termination was processed on the leadership level; this is where any discussions regarding this letter should continue.

&gt;&gt;&gt;**PLEASE NOTE THAT IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM CEO BY 6PM TODAY, I WILL TAKE IT AS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT NOTEVILCORP HAS NO ISSUE WITH THE RECOLLECTION PRESENTED BELOW.**

&gt;&gt;&gt;I will similarly interpret the lack of any response to this email today as an acknowledgment of the correctness of its content.


&gt;&gt;&gt;#Part I: A Rough Start

&gt;&gt;&gt;1. My journey with NotEvilCorp started with being put on a PIP for ""poor execution"" on onboarding tasks, lack of input in team discussions (aka learning and listening), and being ""slow"" on the first assignment, code-clean up, - which I volunteered for as an opportunity to learn the system. That first assignment assignment was a low-priority, non-urgent task that did not modify the behavior of our software in any way that has been lingering for many months.

&gt;&gt;&gt;2. There was no written feedback from my manager prior to me being put on PIP that would indicate a problem with my performance. The closest was being asked if I'm aware of the expectations of a software engineer at my level, and being shown some sort of criteria for that over Zoom. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;3. Months later the criteria were rolled out as the ""Expectations Matrix"", similar to ""SWE Ladder"" in Google, and were applied to evaluate the performance of all employees retroactively.
My then-skip-leve told me to choose a good project to demonstrate my skillset. However, my PM, Anon PM, flat out refused to communicate with me about it. My manager was on leave at the time. The project was assigned to me by Josh within the first 10 minutes of Manager's return from the leave. Manager later told me that Anon PM was aware of my PIP status (in violation of company policy, according to HR Person).

&gt;&gt;&gt;4. The PIP project, MTT-375, was hardly a good fit for a new hire. It was a bug that previously, two experienced engineers (A and B) worked on for a good month, and failed. The bug was assets not showing up in NotEvilProduct Shared Session after passing moderation; A and B did a band-aid solution of fixing it for meshes, while textures, sounds, etc. still required a restart. Nobody in the team worked on it further, as it was outside of the scope of the team's reponsibility, and involved work in low-level codebase (systems and networking) that our team did not own, and very few people understood well. The code was a part of the Client, and so was shipped to every device that has NotEvilProduct on it. According to Manager, even the partial fix was sufficient to merit B a promotion to senior engineer (even though a critical component was written by A).
 
&gt;&gt;&gt;5. Furthermore, the project fell strictly outside my preferences and areas of special interest and expertise, for which I was hired (mathematics and computational geometry). At the same time, there were many projects available to our team which did utilize these skills (such as camera, rotation UX, splines, CSG tools, geometry modification, terrain operators, lights, etc). 
Upon asking Anon PM why he assigned me specifically to this project, Anon PM curtly told me to talk to Manager. Manager explained that since this was a difficult, unpleasant project that nobody on the team wanted to do, doing it would allow me to re-establish credibility with the team.

&gt;&gt;&gt;6. On top of the PIP project, I had some prior work assigned by Anon PM to complete, and looking at it more closely, I have uncovered a number of severe UI issues within our draggers and the transform tools. Since every NotEvilProduct user uses them, the impact was huge. I have filed tickets on those bugs, and, with Manager's awareness and consent, fixed them over the month of June, as our team agreed these were important to our users (each was affected), and I was following the principles that NotEvilCorp had when I joined: Respect the community, Self-organize, Own it, Get stuff done, Take the long view. I put the community first.

&gt;&gt;&gt;7. The corresponding tickets, MTT-651, MTT-620, MTT-509, MTT-621, MTT-628, MTT-652 were completed by the end of June, all of them being NotEvilProduct UX issues that our team was responsible for.  In spite of the significant amount of nontrivial work (according to my teammates, A and C) completed during this time under Manager's supervision, it was not counted as a part of the PIP. However, I got no negative feedback on my PIP either. The entirety of written feedback about the PIP project at that point was:
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; * 6/15: While engagement on smaller projects since the start of the PIP has been working, MTT-375 represents the first Level 3 project and the hope is that this project will be the starting point for demonstrating consistent Level 3 performance within the team 

&gt;&gt;&gt; * 6/18: With some small hiccups that make sense for the first bug bash, the result was as expected for the first bug bash on a project (a number of issues raised that need follow up). The primary opportunity is to speed up the rate of sharing progress (more bug bashes) so the current work can be wrapped up and MTT-375 (the Level 3 work) can become the primary focus as quickly as possible (hopefully mid-next week). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; * Completed preliminary work on dragger issues and now focused on the target for demonstrating Level 3 performance MTT-375.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. The end of PIP (mid-July) was approaching, and I had a lot of completed work. Without getting any negative feedback on the completed work, I was notified that I'll stay on PIP till August 20th. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. At the same time, NotEvilCorp was in the process of rolling out new retention period on Slack. As our team stood to lose years of technical information, I have been a vocal objector to the decision made for ""legal reasons"". In particular, I submitted a town hall question that pleaded the leadership to reconsider an irreversible loss of valuable data. The question got upvoted high enough that I got to ask that question during the town hall. The answer was not much more than ""sorry, no"". A lot of engineers felt upset, and in the aftermath, the rollout of new policies was postponed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. After July holidays, I spent a week of July doing the ""optional"" Hack Jam organized by my then-skip manager. Since I had been told that the goal of PIP was to ""re-establish credibility"", I put a week of time into it (as people on our team were encouraged to do), making Escheresque (solo work) and Espacially Weird (an extended version, collab with D) - possibly the only non-Euclidean geometry apps on NotEvilPlatform (triangles with 270 degrees, etc).
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 11. I have figured out a solution to MTT-375 by July 30th, and fixed the bug on August 12th, more than a week ahead of schedule, as was verified by a successful bug bash with the team that day. Nobody found any issues with the solution.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. In my solution, I was not able to rely on help of my teammates (as they got stuck themselves), nor Manager's (who was not familiar enough with that codebase himself). Nevertheless, I solved the bug in a general form, more than the ticket required - for all assets, not just textures and sounds and meshes. According to A and B who didn't reach this far, my solution was a more elegant, better one.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 13. In addition to all of the above, I had written up specs/project proposals for improving light guides, camera UX, and rotation UX, hoping to get to work on them, and ""given consistent engagement in team meetings (and assistance to junior colleagues)"" - quote from Manager. The code for the PIP project was complete and tested; pull request submitted, pending review. I was getting ready to hear the good news from Manager.

&gt;&gt;&gt;#Part II: The Scandal

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. It was Friday, the 13th of August. VP of HR and, IIRC, VP of Engineering were hosting a Q&amp;A about the new formal evaluation process that was rolled out mid-July (including the notorious ""expectation array""). Until the rollout, no formal criteria for evaluating performance were available; nor was there any systematic feedback loop between an employee and his manager. That changed mid-july, and we were required to fill out a self-assessment within two weeks, describing how the new expectations matrix applies to our previous cycle (before its rollout).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. I was directly affected by the evaluation criteria being applied retroactively, as the core value that NotEvilCorp used to have - **respect the user** - was no longer strictly present in the evaluation criteria for the software engineer of my level. The closest interpretation was holding the values of the team above your own, but the users weren't explicitly mentioned. My decision to do good by the users in June and prioritizing dragger UX work (that affects every NotEvilProduct user) over the share session bug was no longer appreciated with the new expectations, which were rolled out after I made the decision.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. I raised this concern at the Q&amp;A session; and while it took a bit to explain my concern, it was heard and understood by VP of HR pretty clearly. VP of HR said that this is something he agrees is a concern, and that he will reach out to me during the following week to discuss it (he didn't). Another member of the board felt unsatisfied with this response, and took the (virtual) mike to add that NotEvilCorp leadership needs a way to adjust the priorities of the company as it grows, which is why they rolled out the expectation array. My response was simple: next time you do something like that, **make sure it applies to the next cycle, and not to the current/previous one.** The response to that was an uncomfortable pause, followed by ""Fair point"". With plenty of time left in the Q&amp;A session and 50 people in attendance, the session was ended right then. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In about an hour, I dialed into my scheduled meeting with Manager, expecting to hear about the completion of my PIP. 

&gt;&gt;&gt;5. Instead, Manager opened with **""you do realize you have failed the PIP""**. In the kafkaesque dialog that followed, Manager tried to convince me that I was ""expected"" to understand that ""completing"" the PIP meant ""code in production"", something that usually takes two weeks after check-in. Even though my code was complete and tested, and even though I had a week left in the PIP, Manager insisted that it was the end. There were many provably false things that Manager told me that day:

&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. That B completed a ""similar"" project solo in 4 weeks (it was together with A, and they didn't finish)  
&gt;&gt;&gt;     2. That I took ""too long"" to finish it (counting the work on draggers as time spent working on MTT-375, that is)  
&gt;&gt;&gt;     3. That the requirements for completion were stated (they were not)   
&gt;&gt;&gt;     4. That negative feedback was continuously provided (see above: not a trace of it)   

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. At this point, things didn't seem fair, so I told Manager that we need to meet with **his** manager - Skip Manager - and discuss the issue, as clearly, what Manager was telling me had no connection to reality. Manager rejected the 3-way meeting, and said he'll talk to Skip himself. I scheduled my own meeting with Skip.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. After talking to Manager, I got back to putting the PIP bugfix through code review. While B didn't see anything wrong, he sasid he he doesn't feel qualified to approve the changes, as nobody on the team knows this code well, and breaking it would, in essence, break NotEvilPlatform, since the code was a part of the client, not just the NotEvilProduct.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. **Side note:** no, this was not the reason NotEvilCorp had a 3-day outage. My code did work properly.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. However, to ensure that, I solicited feedback from **#networking** and **#systems**. The pull request ended up with 100+comments on it, as 4+ engineers with strong opinions from different teams joined to participate, and didn't always agree on requested changes.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. Everything concerning prior work on MTT-375 has been verified by Francis in writing - see screenshot for 9/13.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 11. I got to talk to Skip Manager on Monday the 16th, and explained the situation. He said that this is concerning, and that he'll need to look into it. I suggested we three talk and resolve it right away; Skip said he will schedule a meeting (he never did).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. Tuesday was spent in code review. I got to talk to Manager again, and asked him again to tell me what exactly I was doing wrong. He could not provide an answer. I asked him what I could do in the remaining time to complete the PIP successfully, any concrete goal, however difficult. He said, **""just work harder""**. I scheduled a meeting with the HR.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 13. On Wednesday, I got to talk to HR Person. They raised a new reason for Manager to *potentially* be unhappy: that I had issues with prioritization, if not performance. Of course, there was no record of that, because it was never brought up. We jointly maintained a PIP log, so everything was clear as day; after looking at the log, and seeing the (lack of) feedback, HR Person got concerned and said she needs to look closer into it, and that she'll get back to me. Again, no concrete resolution was offered.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 14. It was remarkable that HR Person, who was repeatedly contacted about this, did not, in fact, examine the PIP log in any detail prior to that day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 15. I took the initiative, and scheduled a meeting on Friday called ""End of PIP review"". Neither Skip nor Manager accepted.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 16. I have also reached to A and B to go over the project, and to discuss good things to work on next. A, who has been effectively leading the team, agreed with my proposal to improve the rotation UX, and gave it a green light. I sent the proposal to Manager; it looked good to him, and he didn't object.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 17. I have successfully checked in the code before 1PM on Thursday, making the cutoff. The fix went into the corresponding release. I have successfully completed my PIP, but did not get any indication of that from anyone. However, I had the following:

&gt;&gt;&gt;    1.  A document that I signed regarding the PIP, that said that I have until August 20th to complete it;

&gt;&gt;&gt;    2.  Input from Manager that I have failed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 18. Thursday was the day when CEO had an open AMA session, which he traditionally opens with an invitation to **bring uncomfortable questions**. Since I was done with my work at that point, I was first in line to ask the same question I asked VP of HR et al.: **what's up with the retroactively applied expectations**, and what should I do if I **believe my job is on the line because of that?** *(Note to CEO: if you don't remember that well, reach out to many people in attendance that day; I had several people reach out to me after the Q&amp;A's I participated, it seemed to have an effect).** To my surprise, CEO didn't have an answer either. Sadly, CEO's response was so generic that it can be summed up in **0** (zero) words.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 19. However, shortly after the AMA, I got a frantic call from HR Person, who asked me why I'd do such a thing. I said, well, I literally don't know if I'd be employed the next day. HR Person said that an ""extension"" of the PIP is being considered to ""give me another chance"". I said that it is surprising, given that there is no reason for me to be on the PIP anymore in the first place. HR Person assured me that **""we will not fire you on Friday""**, which, delightfully, did not exclude the possibility of being fired on Monday.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 20. Manager and Anon PM reached out to me to talk about the ""next project"" (for the presumed ""next PIP""), and Anon PM flat out nixed everything me and A agreed I would work on as ""not a priority"". Instead, Anon PM said I should work on GodKnowsWhatService UI, which is ""just a few small tweaks"" to the NotEvilProduct that he expected to be done in a couple of weeks and that was urgent. (See the screenshot from 08/19 for exact phrasing). Given Anon's history of assigning me poorly specified projects on which other engineers have already failed, I expressed my opinion that perhaps it's not wise to assign an urgent project to someone who might not be employed at NotEvilCorp the next week, and that there was no pressure for them to have me commit to it before my PIP is over. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 21. Anon PM's response was not reasonable; he was trying to put words in my mouth that ""the type of stuff our team works is not appropriate for you"". When I reached out to him on Zoom, he was behaving erratically, speaking in raised tones about how I didn't report to him frequently enough on the status of MTT-375 (even though I had a daily report to Manager on that). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 22. This was not the first time Anon PM behaved in a bullying manner. When I joined NotEvilCorp, I wanted to create a good Toy Project (with NotEvilProduct) during my onboarding. This was a non-essential learning task, but I cared about it as an artist. Anon PM publicly humiliated me in front of the team during a team meeting when I said that I am not ready to demo the project. Anon PM said, ""then show us what you have"", and Manager didn't say a word. I obliged. Moreover, that was held against me as a reason to initiate the PIP less than 2 months after me starting at NotEvilCorp.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 23. While MTT-375 pertained to little on my resume (I have some networking experience, but no desire to extend it), the proposed ""GodKnowsWhatService UI"" project was completely unrelated to anything I've ever done, or anything that our team was supposed to do. So I added Manager to the chat so that he would be aware.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 24. I still got no written record even of the promise to not be fired the next day. By Thursday late night, **I have concluded that my employment is over***, and wrote a good-bye email to colleagues, because it was apparent that **I would not get a chance to do so otherwise**.

&gt;&gt;&gt;#Part III: The Cover-up

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. On Friday morning, VP of HR reaches out to me, inquiring about ""the email"", which he finds ""confusing"". **Note:** the good-bye email did not include him as a recepient. VP of HR finally arranges a Zoom call that day.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. During the Zoom call, VP of HR asks why I sent the email, and I explain the above, shortly. VP of HR tells me that **I got it all wrong**, and that my performance is **not an issue** anymore, and really, never has been; but the **goodbye email** was **a problem** that needed to be solved. I said that I will gladly solve the problem that NotEvilCorp has with my email after I get some assurance that **I am still an employee**, at least. VP of HR said, but we already gave you that assurance. HR Person told you yesterday. I said, first, that's not true, because **""we won't fire you tomorrow""** is **not** equivalent to **""you are not on probation anymore""**; and second, I got the notification about the PIP **in writing** and had to sign it; I would expect at least an email signifying the end of the PIP. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. So we stroke a deal: **an email for an email**.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. While **every single thing** I said in the good-by email (which was a subset of the above events) was true, VP of HR encouraged me to **lie** to my colleagues and assure them that my employment has never been in danger (though clearly, it has **not** been the case), and that it's just my fault for misunderstanding the situation, which I take full responsibility for. The contents of the ""apology"" email was discussed with HR Person and Skip Manager first (Skip gravely explained to me that ""damage was done"" and asked me to **""trust"" the words of the leadership** in the future - a trust that has been violated many times before and after that request). VP of HR personally went over the final draft of the ""apology"" and found it satisfactory. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. I sent out that email after NotEvilCorp did what was supposed to be done a week earlier: Manager congratulated me on **completing the PIP**, I got a confirmation via email that I'm off the hook, that I am reporting **directly to Skip Manager**, and that NotEvilCorp sees **no issues** with my perfromance. I assumed that I can finally start working on projects that I was hired to work on; specifically having camera and rotation tool UX in mind as the next one, and many others subsequently (see screenshots for my multiple proposals). Skip Manager gave an explicit promise that assignments will come from him,  and that I would report to him (again, asking for my trust).

&gt;&gt;&gt; #Part IV: The Dumpster Fire

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. Absolutely **none** of the promises made by Skip Manager were observed. The first thing that happened was that Anon PM assigned the GodKnowsWhatService UI project to me. Skip Manager responded with an OK. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Skip Manager said that I will report to him. That did not happen, I was reporting to Anon PM on this project. When, **weeks later**, Skip Manager got around to getting access to the Trello board for the project, he chided me for **not labeling my part** (that he ""assigned"" to me); **""How would I know which part is yours?"",** he said, as HR Person can verify.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. HR Person can verify that because Skip Manager **refused to hold 1:1 meetings with me**, and an HR person was present in **each** of our weekly ""1:1"" meetings (in actuality, **""2:1""**).

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Needless to say, refusal to speak to me without an HR person present, while simultaneously demanding my trust and obedience created an environment in which I have not been comfortable to perform well.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. To add insult to injury, I got to see my colleagues work on projects that I am imminently qualified for - and struggle. One such project was Mesh Simplification algorithm evaluation. I was teaching computational geometry as an undergraduate TA, and was a member of the working algorithms group for computational geometry in Undergrad. I have a PhD in Mathematics, after all. Not only this was not a new subject to me, it was a subject where I could write down several algorithms off the top of my head, and provide references for more advanced ones. I knew one professor working on that very thing personally. Yet I was assigned to work on drop-down lists and pop-up dialogues, in spite of asking for my expertise to be applied.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Of course, I took responsibility and helped out my colleague (Margarita) with gathering information on mesh simplification algorithms. This was taken adversarially, and marked down as being **""distracted""** from my assignment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. Skip Manager repeatedly **refused to communicate**, either in person or via Slack, leaving simple questions like ""would you please help me get in touch with the team responsible for ___"" unanswered for days.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. Meanwhile, the GodKnowsWhatService UI project turned out to **not** be ""a small tweak"", not by a long shot. After investing some time into it, I realized that the design proposal I was tasked with implementing was incomplete and incorrect. To put it short, I was set up for failure again by being told to implement a broken design on an unrealistically short timeline, without having any say in fixing the said design. Any time invested in understanding the problem was treated as a delay; any proposals to do things differently were ignored.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Skip Manager, finally, started getting more involved in the project, and put C on the effort to ""help"" me. C fully agreed that the entire design needs to be scrapped, but soldiered on implementing it nonetheless.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. I could not in good faith commit to shipping code that we all know is broken and worthless; so I attempted to get a focus group (I discussed this previously with Intern PM) to take a look. I also emailed VP of HR to raise the concern that we are about to commit to a broken design with long-lasting implications for no good reason (again, taking responsibility). VP of HR **thanked me**, and said he will **reach out to me** (never did, as is the tradition at that point). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 11. As I was writing these emails, Skip Manager notified me **by email** that I am being taken off the project. (**NOTE:** Literally **all** our communication up until this point has been on Slack or Zoom). He also responded to my focus group request email, and ordered to **stop talking to anyone** at the company about GodKnowsWhatService UI project.
 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. **Side note:** nobody on our team, nor the teams I reached to for context, have even heard of that project existing. Yet, I was told by Anon PM, it was a high-priority project with attention from the leadership.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 13. The reason d'etre of that project was a failed attempt to roll out new Feature in June. The users didn't like that their projects suddenly started to look differently without their consent. The new Feature update was rolled back; the plan was to re-release it after user-generated Content becomes available. The GodKnowsWhats were a makeshift solution to customize Feature. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 14. Releasing another broken feature like that would have been disastrous. I have detailed the concerns in the email to VP of HR.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 15. V took my place in the material variants project. The ""small tweak"" that was expected of me to be done in 2 weeks is **still** not complete (months later). When I talked to V on Monday, he hoped that this week would be the last one (just as he hoped nearly the prior week, and the week before that). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 16. In total, V and C have wasted **months** of engineering time because of the broken design. The project dragged out for so long because everybody acknowledged that the design was broken, but could not agree on what the right way to do things would be (something that I have, in the end, worked out - but was banned by Skip Manager from communicating). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 17. The requirements for the project have changed at least 5-6 times since V joined; that's to say, it was something new every week. 
To my knowledge, there has not been a single team on that project that *didn't* fall behind their timelines, before or after me joining.
However, I was **the only person reprimanded** for participating in this project, citing not delivering on time as the reason.

&gt;&gt;&gt; #Part V: The Trick

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. The aftermath of being taken off of the GodKnowsWhatService UI project was a change in the terms of my employment, which was made **contigent on ""soft skills"" like timeliness of communication** (see screenshot). In short, it was a ""**three strikes and you're out**"" kind of policy which was given to me after inquiring what the management can do to help me.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. Of course, the #1 thing that would ""help"" me would have been allowed to work on one of the many projects fitting my expertise that I was actually hired to do, could do most impact, and was interested in. Between splines, CSG UX, geometry modification tools, camera, terrain generation and modification tools, etc. etc. etc., there were plenty to go around.
Needless to say, no such project was assigned to me. Skip Manager assigned a slowdown bug to me; the next thing on the horizon was something to do with color pickers, and again, was an initiative of Anon PM.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. The point of the plan becomes evident in the last line: **""The failure to follow any of these requirements 3 or more times in a calendar month results in immediate employment termination"".** 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. One of the requirements was ""respond to **any** message from Skip Manager on **any** channel **within 15 minutes**"". As stated, it was possible to get fired the same day **within 45 minutes**. I asked this to be extended to an hour, **making my employment being on the line every 3 hours**.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5. Another requirement, which was **non-negotiable**, was providing a rough timeline for a new project **within two hours**. Some of our meetings take this much; making it impossible to fulfil. Of course, every change to any of the hastily produced estimates would require a manager's approval.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6. Needless to say, if being AFK for 3 hours merited termination, NotEvilCorp would have no employees. That framework is highly unusual for a software engineer with no on-call duties, and whose work is mostly individiual.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 7. My only request was for **feedback**: for Skip Manager to tell me if what I've done is a ""strike"" **right away**, so that I'd be aware of the count. This promise was, again, broken. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 8. What constitutes a strike, of course, had little to do with actually being **good** at my job in the long term (completing projects, solving problems, building better tools, helping out teammates, etc) - and was just about adhering to strict timelines and communicating in the very precise manner.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 9. Not only other employees were **not subject to such requirements**, these requirements all fall into category of things that are specifically more difficult to do for people with ADHD, which I have been open about as an ADHD advocate.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 10. This was coupled with a weekly meeting with the HR (hi again, HR Person!), something which **no other employee** was subject to.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 11. The environment took a toll on my health. My doctors have observed the following symptoms:

&gt;&gt;&gt;    1. High anxiety
&gt;&gt;&gt;    2. Heightened blood pressure 
&gt;&gt;&gt;    3. Heightened depression symptoms

&gt;&gt;&gt; 12. By Thursday the 11th, I had already had one ""strike"". My promise for the 11th was to report on a small bugfix, or submit a solution; I discussed it during our usual morning stand-up **during which Skip Manager was not present**. Skip considered it to be another strike, **but did not tell me**.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 13. I have seen a doctor on the 11th, and was not feeling well that day. I notified Skip Manager by Slack that I am not feeling well, and am taking the next day off, and his response amounted to *""Thanks for keeping me in the loop, get well soon""*. **No mention of strikes**. I ended up feeling sick through Thanksgiving (using the time to get an ECG, consultation on medication, etc). 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 14. My employment was terminated on Monday after Thanksgiving in a ""1:1"" with Skip Manager and HR Person; the cited reason being a mysterious count of 5 strikes (include a few on the days when I was out sick), without prior warning. As expected, **all access to NotEvilCorp systems has been cut off by the time the termination was announced**. HR Person stayed as Skip Manager promprtly dropped off the call.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 15. Crucially, when I inquired about **why** I was singled out for the **""three strikes""** plan, whereas any other employee would be put on a PIP (a NotEvilCorp-wide and industry-wide practice), I was told by HR Person that **""the plan WAS the PIP""**, in these exact words, and was reminded that we are an **at-will employment state**.

&gt;&gt;&gt;     1. **Note to HR person:** I know we have a history of denial, but I have good notes of that particular moment.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 16. Being put on a ""PIP"" without a clear goal or end date and with the option for termination within 3 hours is a possibility that I was certainly not aware of when I accepted the offer to join NotEvilCorp.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 17. I am most certainly aware that we are an ""at-will"" state. Therefore, if my skills were not a match for NotEvilCorp, NotEvilCorp had the option of letting me go literally **any time**. This, again, raises the question of **why this kabuki theater was played out.**

&gt;&gt;&gt; 18. When pressed about this, HR Person said that ""she is not comfortable talking to me"", that ""she will speak to the lawyers"" and that I ""should be getting emails"" from them (I didn't).

&gt;&gt;&gt;#Epilogue: A Pesky Question

&gt;&gt;&gt; 1. As a result of the termination, I became ineligible to receive my stock grant, since I was on a 1-year cliff.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2. While still employed I had an opportunity to ask about how new hires getting immediate vesting, but people like me being on a 1-year cliff was ""respecting the community"" in a Q&amp;A session, and what stops NotEvilCorp from changing the policy for existing employees to treat them respectfully. The provided answer was that ""it's complicated"", and that ""there are accounting implications"", which I accepted as a valid reason to postpone this part of compensation while I was employed.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 3. When I asked whom I could contact about that, that information was not provided at the Q&amp;A. The people organized that Q&amp;A, effectively, told me to get satisfied with the ""accounting implications"" answer, and moved on to the next question. When I asked VP of HR personally, he said that it was **not an option**. As a result, to my knowledge, I am not getting my stock award compensation. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; 4. Please note that every statement above is factual, and, to my best understanding, true. There is always a chance of an accidental error, but I will gladly provide my records that backs the above up if needs be. The margins of this email are too small to contain all the screenshots.

&gt;&gt;&gt; I hope that the above account will be helpful to you to avoid a similarly unpleasant scenario arising in the future. 

&gt;&gt;&gt; Should there be any concerns, I am available for a video call with CEO today until 6pm.

&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you for all the good memories, and best of luck building the Fetaverse!

&gt;&gt;&gt; Sincerely,

t419ab,54,2022-03-01,My first rejection of this cycle and seeing worse profiles getting admitted!!!,Kindly-Gate3544,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/t419ab/my_first_rejection_of_this_cycle_and_seeing_worse/,"I got rejected from SUNY-Buffalo for their MS CS program for Fall 22.

SUNY-Buffalo's program is ranked 61 on US News.

But what hurts more is seeing far worse profiles getting accepted and me not being in the top 600 applicants (their yearly intake), despite considering it a safe school for me. I have a very extensive research background, however, I wanted to complete my Masters before trying for a PhD. I've seen people with far worse profiles getting into Buffalo, and I don't get why I was rejected.

Can anyone point out what could be the reason for my rejection? 

A little about my profile:

* CGPA (8.1/10.0 \~ 3.5/4.0(acc to scholarlo)) from one of the better schools in India (IIITs)
* GRE 315 (150V, 165Q)
* TOEFL 107
* Internships:
   * worked with a PI who is also supervising my undergrad thesis (NLP); PI and his lab are based in Ireland. (July 2020- Nov 2021). He is also a professor at the National University of Ireland Galway.
   * Data Science Intern at a top telecommunication company in India (In their Corporate Strategy division)
* Papers: I have been writing and publishing papers on a regular basis for over 18 months. Published over 10 papers, with an additional 4-5 under review at top conferences (ACL, NAACL) and journals. After getting my first publication, I have achieved over 150 citations (Dec 2020). I am the first author in almost half of my papers.
* Recommenders: 
   * General Manager of the company I am interning atm.
   * The PI I worked with is the co-author in all of my papers.
   * Head of my unis CS Department, who is also my co-supervisor for my undergrad thesis.
   * A prof who has taught me for a couple of semesters.
* SOP is very research-oriented talks about how I got interested in NLP and why I need to pursue graduate studies; I got it proofread by multiple professors and PhD students who told me it's really good.

&amp;#x200B;

Until now, I thought my profile was competitive, one of the reasons I applied to tons of ambitious schools. I haven't heard back from any of these yet. The schools I applied to include:

* University of Minnesota Twin Cities (CS)
* NYU Courant (CS)
* NYU Tandon (CS)
* Stanford (CS)
* UCLA (CS)
* UCSD (CS)
* UC Davis (CS)
* Indiana University Bloomington (DS)
* Columbia (MS CS)
* UIUC (MS CS)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I am gonna get rejected by all these schools, considering I didn't even make it to my safe school. After getting rejected from a safe school, I am already discounting my chances in other schools. 

There are people with no publications with low CGPA getting accepted.

Should I consider reapplying for the next cycle, and if so, what else can I do to make up for my low CGPA? Because it looks like I tried all this cycle and still failed.

&amp;#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated."
t438b0,1,2022-03-01,Why do I [18F] absolutely love and loathe my boyfriend [19M] at the same time? Why do I feel disgusted and repulsed by him?,throwaway501971,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t438b0/why_do_i_18f_absolutely_love_and_loathe_my/,"I genuinely do not understand what's wrong with me. 

So, I've been dating this guy for 6 months. He was my close childhood friend before this, for three years, before we began dating. He's genuinely quite funny, charming, decently attractive, and kind. He treats me and his friends and family very well. 

However, at times I just feel like I hate him...for example, when he's upset because he does badly on a midterm or final, a wave of schadenfreude washes over me and then I feel like a terrible person. We're both compsci freshmen in college and academically, he's doing much worse than me. We're both applying for internships, and sometimes, I'll bring up that they usually look for applicants with a \~3.5+ GPA while his is hovering at a 3.1. I say this shit with the intention of making him feel worse about himself. 

Another thing I do - and even I can recognize how terrible of a person this makes me - is I'll intentionally cook and bake for him a lot. He's quite self-conscious of his weight, and has remarked that he feels he's gained weight. He hasn't gone on a diet or made an attempt to lose weight, but something I do is I'll bring him meals I cooked where I intentionally make them quite high-calorie, using more oil or sugar than necessary, etc. 

There are many examples where I have been said backhanded compliments and been passive aggressive. However, before this post gets too long, the last thing I'll mention is our sex life. We are both currently virgins and in the past, I have been raped by a family member when I was 14. Whenever we're intimate, I intentionally get myself drunk to the point of blacking out just to tolerate him kissing and touching me. All I can think about is how repulsed I am by him. I've even considered whether I am asexual, but I don't think so because I masturbate and get turned on by porn and attractive strangers. I've been trying to avoid having sex by exclusively hanging out with him outside, such as dates in public areas where we go back to our respective homes after. I've told him about my rape, and he says we can take it as slow as I'm comfortable with, even though he's made it extremely clear that he's incredibly horny and extremely eager to fuck. I'm shuddering with disgust as I type this.  

I loathe him and feel repulsed by him. But at the same time, when I'm together with him in person, I'm desperate to hold and hug him. I would be destroyed if he ended up with someone else. He's good. He's a good person, and I'm not. A large part of me, I think, feels that I don't deserve good. I want to break up with him, but I don't want to lose him. It's all so conflicting and confusing to me.

Now, let me share some things that may give you insight into my character. I've struggled with anorexia binge/purge subtype since I was 13. I have a host of body image issues, crippingly low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, and self-hatred even though objectively I look skinnyfit with a 16.5 BMI. I've been actively suicidal on and off since 16, which is also the age I began self-harming. I have one failed suicide attempt under my belt, and am planning another about one year from now. I'm a perfectionist and one less than perfect score on an assessment is all it takes to make me start cutting. He knows about my self-harm, but not the eating disorder. He's been supportive and caring throughout it. 

When I think about my feelings towards him, I have a hunch that my self-esteem is so low that I want to drag him down to my level. That I hate myself so much that seeing him confident and happy kills me.

I have been trying to apply to some internship positions for the past few months, but have hardly been receiving any OAs to begin with. And that is to be expected, as I have pretty much zero experience on my resume. In high school, I participated in research relating to both lab-based and computational chemistry, and it wasn't until I began to dabble into CS more in my senior year that I began to consider computer science for my major ( I had already taken AP CS by then and had basic experience coding ). 

Now I come to my main point. I was thinking about how I can improve my skill-set, my resume, etc. However, it's all just very overwhelming and I just don't know where to start. Within the computer science field, there are just so many different paths I can take, from front-end or back-end web development, data analysis, machine learning/ai, and so many other things that I probably don't even know about. I was wondering what you guys suggest I should do in my situation.

Right now, I only have intermediate knowledge in Data Structures and Algorithms (C++ and Java), and little experience with things like React js and Python. I want to get started with at least a couple of projects or contribute to open source projects not only for my resume but also because I really want to improve my skills. I don't feel confident in the slightest to be participating in things like hackathons and cs club activities because I have been feeling like I don't have enough knowledge, and that's been really bothering me.  

I really hope to end up in a career that is a bit engineering focussed, meaning I don't want to simply be coding front-end for a website or doing data analysis. I'd love to pursue a career, for example, writing code for the automotive or aerospace industry. Anything with an engineering application interests me. I understand beggars can't be choosers, but any suggestions on what path/fields within CS I should focus on learning for such a career would be great.

Sorry about this post being sort of all over the place, I am just really lost and feel like I am behind."

Here is the 113th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

t49dx1,6,2022-03-01,Profile evaluation - MS in Computer Science,randomac321,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/t49dx1/profile_evaluation_ms_in_computer_science/,"Hi everyone, I'm planning on applying to grad school this winter (incoming fall 2023) for a masters in computer science (emphasis in machine learning). I was hoping to get some feedback on my profile and also any recommendations on how I could strengthen my application.

Here's some info on me:

* Graduated in December 2020 cum laude from a top US public research institution (top 50 in US news, for what it's worth) with a double major in economics and computer science, minor in applied math.
* 3.8 overall GPA, 3.96 GPA for csci , 3.7 GPA for econ, 3.6 GPA for applied math
* 4 internships as an undergraduate, 3 research oriented (respectively in aerospace, applied math, and physics), one software dev (devops). Also did an undergraduate thesis that lightly involved machine learning.
* Have been working since then (1.25yrs) at a seed stage startup as a machine learning engineer. Strong emphasis on ML research. I read journal publications every day, build ML pipelines, etc, but more than that, the primary product of the company aims to help researchers in fast moving fields (e.g. biotech, machine learning) find relevant research quickly, so I'm constantly getting exposed to and thinking about new research.
* Can get four strong letters of rec, two from tenured professors that I did research with as an undergrad (aerospace and applied math professors from my internships above, and as a bonus the applied math professor was also on my thesis committee), one from an old coworker (ex-CTO of my company) currently pursuing his PhD at Oxford in machine learning, one from a professional researcher in optical physics (MIT and Stanford education).
* For demographic information, I'm a white male in my mid-20s

Overall I think I have a strong application, but there are a few things I'm concerned about:

* None of the research I did as an undergraduate actually relates to what I want to go to grad school for (machine learning, specifically natural language processing or reinforcement learning).
* I have one published paper (contributing author), but it's in a field completely unrelated to machine learning (aerospace). No other publications besides this.

Here's a list of schools that I'm considering applying to

Reach: CMU, Stanford, MIT, Oxford, Berkeley, University of Toronto, University of Montreal, GIT

Moderate: UCSD, Columbia, UT Austin, U Michigan, Umass Amherst

Safe: UCSB, CU Boulder, Boston University, UNH, Stony Brook



I'm curious what people's thoughts are on my school choices, am I being too ambitious?

Thanks in advance for reading this long post!"
t49h5o,1,2022-03-01,Am I overthinking?,Smiling_bishop,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t49h5o/am_i_overthinking/,So I’m a 20 y/o &amp; just finished school in 2020. I started a Bsc. Computer Sci on September but in January my dad lost his job. We got a lot of help from our family friends &amp; neighbors but it wasn’t enough to make ends meet. So I eventually had to take a semester off because my dad was the only breadwinner. Right now my dad got a job to translate some documents from a leasing company &amp; I’ve been helping him since he’s not that tec savvy in typing &amp; stuff. Recently I feel like he’s pushing his work onto me. It’s not just regular helping or anything but literally translating a whole 3-4 pages of legal documents (mind u I’ve never translated anything on my own even when I’m helping my dad) &amp; when I said I can’t he makes it feel like intentionally or not that I’m not doing my best to alleviate our family situation. If i flat out refuse he won’t force me to it but he’ll word it out like I’m being selfish &amp; he has to carry the family load alone. I’m not a very outgoing person even within the family i tend to stay in my room not because I’m overly sensitive or anything i like being alone &amp; my parents know it. That’s why I’m feeling conflicted because I feel like my dad who rarely speaks with me (which I don’t think is  bad) only sees me as a means of getting his work done or am i being a selfish son who’s throwing a tantrum about having to help his father. Since this is about my father I feel like If i ask advice about it with my mom I’ll get the same reaction as my dad &amp; I might alienate myself from the family. I’m currently looking to be an intern to a bank in my country but it’ll take awhile until i get a job. So what should i do? Should i just talk about it with my parents (I’m a bit afraid of it) or should i just stop overthinking things &amp; just for a lack of a better word endure my dad until i get the job?

Also a throwaway as I have not quit my current position and have some identifying info on my main.

Recent college graduate from midwest engineering school here. Like so many others, the pandemic screwed with my job search for a post-grad job and I didn't have many great options. Ended up moving out to the East Coast for a job I wasn't super passionate about, but allowed me to stay on the development path I was looking for. My partner found a job within the same area in order to avoid doing long distance. We knew these positions were temporary and initially discussed sticking it out for 3 years before moving. My job has went downhill quickly and I have found that it has both affected my mental state and development as a young engineer, as well as learning that my location will be downsized rapidly within the next 1-2 years. Because of this I talked to my partner and started a job search earlier than expected.

Prior to my senior year of college I was supposed to do an internship in the South with a company that I would classify as my dream job, but the internship was cancelled due to the pandemic and the company did not offer full-time positions the next year. Recently I was contacted about a new opening within the company - I applied and after a few interviews ended up getting an offer. Great pay, relocation bonus, full nine yards in the location where all the big players in the industry are located.

I want to take this job as it is exactly where I want to take my career, but I am having trouble rationalizing it with my personal life. The job is very far from family (18 hours) and the opposite of where my partner wants to end up, as they would like to return to the midwest. I am worried about uprooting my life again only a year after graduating, then risking my partner resenting me for the move as they are getting comfortable and enjoying their job. We have discussed the offer and my partner is on board with it as it is a big opportunity, but I know deep down they would rather I not take it as there is potential for it to be the wrong decision for both of us. I have applied places both local and back in the midwest but have no other offers yet - I feel I most likely will, but will have to make a decision on this offer before then.

If anyone has had a similar experience any advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm not necessarily looking for validation, but more looking for any real life scenarios of this turning out well or poorly. I have about a week to decide and have already discussed with family and friends to mixed opinions, so naturally asking strangers is the next best option."

I have a remote internship so don't really have a house in the US and will need to find somewhere to live. Looking for somewhere fun and/or is a prospective place I can work at. I would prefer somewhere relatively cheap, but not too concerned about the cost if the experience is gonna be better.

NYC, Miami: leaning towards one of these two since I am not sure if I will get another opportunity to live there in my 20s.

Seattle, Bay Area: Most tech companies are located there so maybe a better idea to try those out which will help me when deciding where to work full-time. 

Chicago: This is a really great balance between fun, cheap and prospective workplace (I am very interested in quant). 

Where my school is located: I can probably just sublet an apartment next to my school and not have to worry about moving and storing my stuff, but it is boring since I am used to it.

I had 3 years of research experience in college, 1 summer research internship at NYU and spent a year in a Harvard lab. No pubs, and 3.3 GPA. So..results were not surprising esp since I applied to all great neuro programs. 

Although the results were not what I had hoped for, I really want to use this year to work on my application for the next cycle. Currently, I am a lab tech II at the same Harvard lab. I am consolidating data slated for 2 publications (mid-impact journals - mid author) and working on a paper that will be submitted hopefully by June (Neuron, 2nd author). My PI is extremely supportive/ guiding me through my apps and by fall 2022 I will have another year of experience under my belt. I was wondering if any of you have other suggestions in terms of improving my application. Should I retake some classes? Should I reach out to PIs I am interested now?

I am a CS student, and I applied for an internship where I will be interviewed and asked to implement some algorithms and data structures in my code. I learned Algorithms and DS in university, but it was mostly theoretical with no code implementation, and I already forgot some of it.

My question is, where can I find good material to study this topic even further in detail, do you have any recommendations or links? I tried leetcode but I feel like I'm not confident enough to continue without having the base knowledge ""perfected"".

I found this udemy course, and I was wondering if it's worth it?

t4l1wn,1,2022-03-01,Why do I [18F] absolutely love and loathe my boyfriend [19M] at the same time? Why do I feel disgusted and repulsed by him?,advice_throwaway922,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t4l1wn/why_do_i_18f_absolutely_love_and_loathe_my/,"I genuinely do not understand what's wrong with me. 

So, I've been dating this guy for 6 months. He was my close childhood friend before this, for three years, before we began dating. He's genuinely quite funny, charming, decently attractive, and kind. He treats me and his friends and family very well. 

However, at times I just feel like I hate him...for example, when he's upset because he does badly on a midterm or final, a wave of schadenfreude washes over me and then I feel like a terrible person. We're both compsci freshmen in college and academically, he's doing much worse than me. We're both applying for internships, and sometimes, I'll bring up that they usually look for applicants with a \~3.5+ GPA while his is hovering at a 3.1. I say this shit with the intention of making him feel worse about himself. 

Another thing I do - and even I can recognize how terrible of a person this makes me - is I'll intentionally cook and bake for him a lot. He's quite self-conscious of his weight, and has remarked that he feels he's gained weight. He hasn't gone on a diet or made an attempt to lose weight, but something I do is I'll bring him meals I cooked where I intentionally make them quite high-calorie, using more oil or sugar than necessary, etc. 

There are many examples where I have been said backhanded compliments and been passive aggressive. However, before this post gets too long, the last thing I'll mention is our sex life. We are both currently virgins and in the past, I have been raped by a family member when I was 14. Whenever we're intimate, I intentionally get myself drunk to the point of blacking out just to tolerate him kissing and touching me. All I can think about is how repulsed I am by him. I've even considered whether I am asexual, but I don't think so because I masturbate and get turned on by porn and attractive strangers. I've been trying to avoid having sex by exclusively hanging out with him outside, such as dates in public areas where we go back to our respective homes after. I've told him about my rape, and he says we can take it as slow as I'm comfortable with, even though he's made it extremely clear that he's incredibly horny and extremely eager to fuck. I'm shuddering with disgust as I type this.  

I loathe him and feel repulsed by him. But at the same time, when I'm together with him in person, I'm desperate to hold and hug him. I would be destroyed if he ended up with someone else. He's good. He's a good person, and I'm not. A large part of me, I think, feels that I don't deserve good. I want to break up with him, but I don't want to lose him. It's all so conflicting and confusing to me.

Now, let me share some things that may give you insight into my character. I've struggled with anorexia binge/purge subtype since I was 13. I have a host of body image issues, crippingly low self-esteem, body dysmorphia, and self-hatred even though objectively I look skinnyfit with a 16.5 BMI. I've been actively suicidal on and off since 16, which is also the age I began self-harming. I have one failed suicide attempt under my belt, and am planning another about one year from now. I'm a perfectionist and one less than perfect score on an assessment is all it takes to make me start cutting. He knows about my self-harm, but not the eating disorder. He's been supportive and caring throughout it. 

When I think about my feelings towards him, I have a hunch that my self-esteem is so low that I want to drag him down to my level. That I hate myself so much that seeing him confident and happy kills me. 

Like I said, I'm a shitty person. 

I really want to hear your advice and thoughts, though. I do see a psychiatrist, but mainly for my eating disorder. I haven't told her any of this. I really really want to know - what's wrong with me, and what do you think I should do?"
t4mgja,7,2022-03-01,Tax Internship decision EY or KPMG,cactuspickled,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/t4mgja/tax_internship_decision_ey_or_kpmg/,"Hey all I have two internship opportunities for this summer, EY Tax Diversified Tax Group(DSG) and KPMG, State and Local Tax intern (SALT).

I’m in HCOL area. Compensation is exactly the same for both $34 per hour or $71k salary. 

Now, personally I’m interested in international tax and i feel obviously the SALT internship won’t give me experience in that. I understand EY DSG to be a little “taste” of everything in tax, including international tax. 

If I do the SALT internship with KPMG and i still want to do international tax after, will i be able to switch once i get a full time offer or will the stick me with the SALT group?

Also, i know EY been kind of dropping (pancake/waffle brain) the ball lately in terms of mid-year raises and bonuses, while KPMG is giving pretty solid bonuses/raises. Is this true or not? Should I take this into consideration?

Final thing is that in EYs offer letter they stipulated a sign-on bonus while KPMG did not. Do all big 4 sign on bonuses for interns or just EY?

Thanks"

t4r1qh,4,2022-03-01,Summer Classes and Internship??,zottiehottie,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/t4r1qh/summer_classes_and_internship/,"Hi fellow anteaters!

I am an econ major w accounting minor, trying to graduate spring 2023. I have a question about summer classes. I was planning to take 2 classes in summer session 1, and 2 classes in summer session 2. But now that I'm receiving interview invitations from firms, it is becoming apparent to me that if I get an offer for an accounting internship this summer, I don't know how doable my schedule will be with the summer classes.

Here are the details:

summer session 1:

MGMT 131A

ECON 15B

summer session 2:

MGMT 131B

ECON 100A

Should I cut it down to 1 class each session, and then make up for the skipped ones in the following quarters? I am leaning towards that idea. (FYI: I also don't know what the workload will look like for any of these classes during summer session (or even the internship workload lol) so anyone with that insight could prove very helpful!)

Thanks!"

This is the second year their rejecting me and that just hurt me so bad. I’m not really a good CS student because I’m very confused on what to do and where to start on projects and I don’t really blame them for rejecting me but I thought they would accept my application if I had a strong cover letter and resume:( I also found out today that I ADHD and there’s just a lot going on in my life.

Who knows, maybe we'll become best buddies trying to navigate this $hitstorm.

Currently I'm an ITS major and should be wrapping up with my junior year at the end of the semester. This is my second semester here after bouncing around from several local colleges. I had a rough transition here as having it result in a tanked GPA (2.0), and the feelings of absolute disappointment should reflect that. Fast forward to the start of this semester, I felt a new sense of motivation with it being a fresh start after winter break...but now after taking two accounting exams which I know I've failed; and with two math exams this week, which I have zero confidence in passing, I'm starting to feel very jaded with doing this. Going to class feels like a chore,  I'm bored to death sitting through lecture, and doing the assignments/exams are leaving me feeling emotionally drained. Hell, just trying to gather some shred of energy to study leaves me feeling ""why bother?""

Now with JSOM staff pressing us with applying for internships, I haven't bothered applying for any as I feel having a 2.0 is a turn-off.

Here's my situation without giving away too much about myself:

a) I chose UTD + ITS a bit out of a whim. My original life plan didn't come to fruition, I want to reinvent myself.

b) I'm about to reach my mid-twenties, been out of high school for five years, and still living with my parents. It would be nice to graduate + move on within 18 months.

c) Last semester, I did very well and enjoyed the actual ITSS classes. I chose ITS over CS is due to fewer math requirements. Math is my worst subject but overall, I've struggled with school my whole life.

That basically sums up my situation. I'm sick of college, I'm frustrated with my academic performance, and I feel out of place with my peers who are excelling. Some of you guys may suggest me taking time off from school or just retaking classes (if I fail any). The thing is I've been in college for four years already. I've already told my mom that if something prevents me from graduating by the end of 2023,  then I'll have absolutely NO interest in carrying on with this. At the same thought, I feel that the last four years would've been a waste with taking all these classes to end up without a degree...that's where I'm feeling torn. Even the suggestions of  changing majors are out of the picture for me, as what I practically stated in this post.

Take care, Friends! :)"

I am not willing to compromise on any of these areas. Given my plans, is there any advice you have to offer? Anything that you wish someone told you when you were a freshman?

Mostly but not only due to anxiety, I made a LOT of mistakes at my previous job. Worst of all, sometime I did the same mistake several times because I just couldn't control/rectify myself and retain informations properly.

It was a summer job in a financial establishment. It's easy. And yet I sucked so much two coworkers just got fed up and started hating me and I was told off at least once a day  (yep, that bad).  At my age (mid twenties) it's completly unexcusable. Worst than a toddler.

The good point is that it was only a two month job and I am doing way better at my current internship (so lessons mostly learned I guess?).

Bad point : I think I got PTSD over it. Even tought my current apprentiship is going well so far it destroyed my confidence and I can't help be still be depressed about that almost seven month later.

What can I do to feel better and let this feeling go? Any help and advice appreciated."

I am currently in process of applying for OMSCS and almost done with application and Statement of purpose. But there is something nagging me:  
I did my undergrad from top 5 Computer Science university know for rigourous academia and grading. During my first semester of Sophomore year, I did really bad on my courses which led me to be put on Academic Probation. But shortly after, I did good for rest of my undergrad and managed to get a overall GPA of &gt;3.0 upon graduation.  
Along with my graduation I also did reasearch with a well know professor and an internship along with teaching assistance. Right now I have about 1 year of experience working as professional software engineer. I have 3 recommendation letters from my professor, research coworker who was leading the reasearch project and my mentor from the company.

My questions:

1. Should I mention in my statement of purpose about the academic probation and the reasons behind it?
2. Do you guys think I have good chances of getting accepted for this program given I am applying almost during the deadline (i.e. March 10)?
3. Is there anything else I can do from my side to imporve my chances of getting in?

I really need your opinion as I keep thinking about this and it demotivates me to apply and I need some mental clarity.

Thanks in advance"

With my university break coming to a close and with 4 more left month i got another internship offer for 3 months from a well known finance start up in my country, offers great project i can dive on which I’m excited to learn about and a Forbes 30 under 30 direct report, not to mention a hefty salary. 

The main problem I’m facing is that i have been wanting to spend more time for myself which I haven’t been able to do with all of my internships, simple stuff like going to the gym more often, spending time with friends and my partner and even just reading more book. I haven’t had the chance to focus on this stuff with 4 months left if i do take this opportunity i will only have 1 month to do the things i want to do. 

Am i just giving bullshit reason to not do the internship? am i wrong for declining an opportunity to just sit on my ass doing nothing?  I’m afraid of regretting my decision"

I had an interview last week Wednesday for an intern position at a FAANG company, and was completely caught off-guard with the difficulty of the problem. I was given a leetcode hard for an interview that usually has medium and easy problems (My problem was using dynamic programming with the base case being a LC easy problem). I explained myself well, and gave a brute force solution as well as the pseudocode for the optimal DP solution. Throughout the entire interview, they seemed disappointed even as I made progress. The interviewer was cold and didn't even respond when I thanked him at the end, simply ending the call. I haven't heard back yet, but needless to say I don't feel good about my chances. I might just be imagining things, but it seems like when I've had immigrant Indian interviewers in the past they raise the bar for no reason and are only looking for their one solution to the problem. Kind of a rant, but I'm extremely frustrated that my many many hours of effort might have been tanked by someone with a bone to pick."

I'm currently a junior in CS and the last time I had any relative experience was high school, where I participated (and placed) in several hackathons and coding competitions. I believe that I'm lacking in things to put on my resume as it has been difficult for me to participate in events/orgs/side projects since my main focuses have been school and mental health.

However 2-3 years ago, it got to the point where I was having chronic migraines (&gt;15x per month) and I had to seek out accommodations. Since then, I have gotten a lot better about managing triggers and have had the opportunity to make my schedule less intensive. These changed have helped significantly, since now I only get a handful of migraines per month. Working online has also been a huge help since I have significantly more control over my environment when I work from home.

I'm really nervous heading into my internship year and fearing that the increased hours and in-person work will regress my migraines back to being chronic. Some of my trigger management I'm also worried will interfere with client work, such as using biofreeze that has a strong smell. For anyone who may be wondering, I have a good neurologist and am on multiple prescription medications. I have looked into treatments such as injections. It seems like my condition will only improve so much, especially when I'm living through an intensive and stressful period.

Does anyone else have similar concerns or experiences? How have you dealt with it, and what are your thoughts on managing symptoms in ways that might effect clients (e.g. having the room be colder than the client might like or using strong smelling biofreeze)."

I am older than my peers due to taking some years off (my original Uni department at a different school was a scam and I had to retake all my classes, and I had to work). I have no relevant work experience in the field. I am not expecting anything above entry level salary. I do, however, expect to get paid at all. 

I live in a city and I cannot move, and there are almost no entry level jobs available to even apply to. I have applied to anything that requires less than 5 years of experience. I had a job for 10 weeks from another company that didn't have the organization / availability to train as many new hires as they thought, so I was let go. 

Most places I can't get an interview, but the places I do get an interview with seem to have been lying about the job.   
One was a laboring job that was 10 hours a day 5 days a week, but usually requires 1-2 more hours a day and also usually requires weekends.   
One was not willing to pay me when I didn't have experience, so they offered me an unpaid internship.  
Many entry level require only 1-2 years experience, however 1-2 years of experience in multiple disciplines non of which overlap at all.   
Today I saw the most egregious posting of an entry level job requiring 10-15 years experience.   


How am I supposed to exist? Do I take on minimum wage jobs because my engineering degree is useless unless I am willing to work for free?? I can't work for free when I need to work a minimum wage job just to eat, while someone else pays rent, because I cannot afford rent with minimum wage. 

I just want reliable healthcare such that I won't expect to go bankrupt. I want to be able to eat. I eat out (cheaply) once a month, the rest of the time I eat at home. With pandemic pricing, a minimum wage job would be able to cover my and my partners food, with very little left over. Should we switch to nothing but rice and beans? Can I even afford fruits and vegetables? Should we turn off our heat? 

I am so very fortunate my partner can cover rent. But I cannot find a job, and I want to be a person too."

I'm taking my classes online because I take care of my folks here in the Bay Area and wondered what the job market was like. (I live in the East Bay Vallejo). I have been applying for summer internships, but I think I'll try to find regular work to save up and survive the following Fall and Spring semesters. 

I am starting to become unmotivated to finish college because I honestly don't believe I'm learning anything. Teachers assign assignments, and you pretty much teach yourself how to do them by watching videos online or going on youtube, stuff I've been doing most of my life already. The Professors even admit that a lot of the things I'm learning are outdated, and I probably won't end up using anything, which kills my motivation even more. 

I've been in school for a while now, getting six different associate degrees, and I recently decided to finish and get my bachelor's degree to put it on my resume. I'm still not sure what I want to do as a career, but I figure it would be tech-related because that's where the future is. I've worked in many different job fields such as construction, handyman work, airstream remodels/sprinter van conversions, photography, videography, service industry, CNC woodworking, 3d printing, phone repair, etc. Pretty much a jack of all trades still trying to find my niche.

Does anyone have any advice on how to stay the course with college or if it's even worth finishing? And what the job market might look like for CIS degrees?

I'm turning 28 this month, but I feel like I'm not getting any younger."

So I'm going to school in Ottawa, Canada and graduating from undergrad CS in April. I interned with a local startup last summer and had a wonderful experience, the work was very interesting and the people / work environment was awesome. Just today I received a full-time job offer letter over email from them (full-stack software developer position starting in May, 63.7k CAD base salary, run-of-the-mill benefits, working hours and in-person vs remote is flexible &amp; up to me) which I am super thrilled about.

I plan to accept the offer, but I'm unsure of whether negotiating for a slightly higher salary is worth it even though it seems like a good idea at face value. Obviously I would love more compensation (who wouldn't!) but some factors are holding me back:

\- (unique (?) to my personal circumstances) They have been truly awesome to me, taking a chance on me with my internship last year, which was my first one. I aspire to be a competitive athlete in biathlon and they kindly agreed to sponsor me for $750 this year to help cover some of my travel expenses, and are offering flexible work hours to accommodate this. Since it's a small startup, I also got the chance to know everyone at the company VERY well and I'm on very friendly terms with all the employees, including the higher-ups who sent me the offer. Is it worth risking being on good terms with everyone just for a potential few extra k? Also,

\- I don't currently have any other job offers for leverage, nor do I anticipate receiving any in the short term

\- This is my very first full-time offer/position and if I'm being completely honest, I don't know what I'm worth at this point (is 63.7k CAD good??)

\- I have never needed to formally negotiate for anything before (would it be done over email since they sent the offer that way, should I offer to call them, etc)

\- The fear that they will rescind the offer (unlikely) or have a long-term tainted view of me after giving what they think is a fair offer

\- The fear that if I were to ask for a higher salary and get it, that my performance 6 months / 1 year down the line may not reflect this higher salary and make them question my worth

Maybe I'm overthinking this and just anxious about heading off into the ""real world"", but I really want to make the best informed decision here since it could have an impact on my entire future career. Please let me know your thoughts on the situation, I would be grateful a million times over for your help and perspective! I'm really looking forward to jumping into industry :)"

I'll provide some background--
I'm 26(f) and recently graduated from a university in December of 2020, it was during the height of the pandemic, so it was a pretty underwhelming feeling despite the fact that it was supposed to be one of the most profound moments in my life, anyways... I graduated with a BS in human services with a concentration in mental health counseling, it wasn't until a couple of years into my degree that I realized that I'd have to enroll into grad school if I'd ever want to make some real money and do something that I was interested in. 

I'd also just gotten together with the love of my life and hopefully future husband in March of 2020 and officially moved in in February of 2021 (although I was always at his place prior to that so it was like I had been living with him for much longer). After I graduated and finished my internship, I was unemployed and trying desperately to find somewhere to work to be able to contribute to our home, my boyfriend was the one who was paying pretty much everything, I'd try to help financially any way I could, but it wasn't really a whole lot. I knew that I had to find something soon so I could stop feeling like a financial burden. He has never made me feel bad or guilty for doing that and has supported me through my tough times, however, I still feel guilty for having to rely so heavily on him. After countless resumes and applications being sent in, and after several emails declining me, I'd finally found something in early July 2021. 

Fast forward to now, I am still at this job as a Lasik technician, I essentially preform testing on patients to determine their candidacy for the Lasik procedure, I talk to them about finances, I'm in charge of scheduling appointments, working in the operating room etc. etc...

I'm finally getting to the point where I'm hating my job, I've always struggled with depression and anxiety as a person, but this position has caused it to worsen significantly. The job itself isn't horrible but compared to most of my coworkers; I'm being moved around from center to center much more often, am having to work more late days than others, my schedule gets changed around every single week, and I'm having to pick up the slack even more now that one of my coworkers just quit without any notice. 

And to top it off, it's becoming a trend that our leadership team has been treating us like children rather than grown adults when they talk to us in a very passive aggressive way and has been showing little to no compassion when it comes to our concerns, this also goes for the higher ups as well who expect perfection from us while also never acknowledging if they've done something wrong. I've also made it clear to them that I have a disability and have a really bad knee so I can't be in the operating room as much as some of my other coworkers, there are screws in my knee and standing on concrete for 10 hours a day sometimes without even a break for lunch really messes it up and incapacitates me for the whole next day.

I recently brought this up to my leadership team and the higher ups saying that the favoritism is rampant, there are employees who get to pick and choose which center they're at every day because they live close by, they get to sit up at the front desk and do little to no work, and never have any questions asked if they need to leave early/get sick.  

I've had just enough of this job and want to quit desperately, my boyfriend is 100% on board with me leaving saying that the job makes me miserable and that he's sad seeing me this way, and while I agree, there are still a few things holding me back.

The job pays a decent amount because of the monthly bonuses we receive (although the company is always trying to take them from us for any little reason), I had a free Lasik procedure here with the understanding that if I left before a year was up, then I'd have to pay my procedure back at a pro-rated rate, I don't have another job lined up currently, and I do not want to be a financial burden on my boyfriend again. 

I'm so insanely torn because I'm feeling my mental health just plummeting, I'm not happy anymore and I'm downright tired, my boyfriend is my absolute rock and has no issues taking care of me, but I just feel like I cannot do that to him again. I'm also weary of the money I'm going to have to pay back to this company if I do quit, and I'm also afraid that it's going to take me a long time to find somewhere that'll hire me that pays as much as this place does. Please help? I'm so sorry that this was a long post. Thank you all in advance. 

Tl;dr- My job is killing my mental health and I am underappreciated; I want to quit but I don't want to be a burden on my partner even though he says I won't be and don't want to owe my job money. I'm not sure what my passions are anymore if I do quit and want to find a new job."

That is the one excuse I keep hearing about why people need to be back in the office is that ""our new intern missed knowledge because he was on boarded remotely and didn't get to have those in person knowledge discussions.""  


My answer to that is that the company needs to make a better on boarding process.  I've brought 5 technician team members into our company who were all far away from me, and yet they got up to speed and productive in no time.  Sure some one needed to let them in the door and show them around the office, but that is what we have a receptionist for...."

t5g57m,62,2022-03-02,"Am I ""Wasting"" My M7 MBA If I Go Into Tech Sales?",imp30302,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/t5g57m/am_i_wasting_my_m7_mba_if_i_go_into_tech_sales/,"Hey! 

So I'm a 2nd year at a full-time M7 MBA program with prior experience in T2 consulting and a summer internship in IB. I did not enjoy my internship experience, so I was re-recruiting for finance and strategy roles within tech, but over the past several months, I came to learn of the role of ""tech sales,"" and I think that it is actually a good fit for me and my personality. Despite my somewhat analytical background, I am a people person, do enjoy utilizing soft skills and EQ, love being in a high stakes environment, and am floored with how much money successful sales people can make (often similar or more than MBB consulting and IB outside partner levels, which is essentially sales) with much fewer work hours on average. It seems in tech firms, top salespeople, especially those with no commission limits, make the most out of any function outside of the C-suite. 

I have a colleague from my non-prestigious undergrad in the field and she makes $300-400k a year (although she has told me non-successful salespeople make much less and has been honest about the stress of a constant quota and the grunt-work hustling). But to me, to be honest, talking to people all day sounds way more ""fun"" and meaningful than doing some excel modeling or building PPT slides. So even though the role is primarily soft-skills based, I think it's a good fit. Sales is often one of the main pipeline roles into the CEO position at major firms, and I'm potentially interested in entrepreneurship in the future, for which sales skills are essential. I am an athlete, and I do have a natural competitive drive that I didn't get to exercise in my prior roles. 

The problem I have run into however, is that several of my peers have expressed some skepticism about the idea (although plenty have been supportive). At my school, I can't think of anyone else wanting to specifically do sales post-MBA, and we had a few salespeople come into the program who wanted to pivot into PM or consulting or something else. Sales is not viewed as a top or desirable post-MBA function despite the potential very high pay with good work-life balance because it's not viewed as analytical (which somehow makes jobs more ""legit"" in the eyes of MBAs), it has variable and unpredictable income, the quota is stressful, and it is not a pedigreed or ""prestigious"" function which MBAs value. 

I've been told a career in sales would be a waste of my MBA education (but to be honest, who at an MBA prioritizes academics haha), and that you don't need an MBA at all to go into sales: many successful tech sales people often only have bachelor's degrees, with some sales rock stars not even having a college degree. (Although it seems some top companies do look at UG ""prestige"" or ""reputation"" for hiring entry-level salespeople out of college, but that doesn't matter at all once you're in the field and experience + success trumps all). 

I've been told to do something like strategy&amp;ops or finance first, which is a ""legitimate"" or ""traditional"" post-MBA exit for some time, and then transition into sales if I really wanted to, as going into sales directly meant it would be very difficult to pivot directly into a more traditional post-MBA job later if I wanted to later (I don't think I will). But I still view my classes as helpful: in B2B SaaS sales, when you're selling business tools to corporate clients, understanding fundamental business concepts like finance, accounting, etc., will make your conversations much more meaningful as you can understand and relate to their business pain points your software could solve. And the MBA will give me a network of people in important companies I could hit up to sell things to, so it's not a waste in my view in that sense. And if I want to go into sales leadership or management, my view is that having an MBA would only be a plus. 

I know I didn't need the MBA for this, and in sales, experience matters above all else. But at the same time, I didn't know about this function at all until recently, and I think it is what will make me the happiest to pursue, even if it's not a traditional post-MBA exit. And from the interviews I've done for tech sales roles, the comp plan (base + commission if I hit my quota) seems VERY GOOD.

What do you think? Would be doing sales after my ""prestigious M7 MBA"" be a waste of my degree?"
t5gj5j,1,2022-03-02,I have a decision to make..,LethalMentalDeficit,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/t5gj5j/i_have_a_decision_to_make/,"# Context

 I am a 23M dropped out not too long ago just a year before i would've graduated, currently working part time 20hrs a week in a min wage job. I made 5 figures in crypto this year, which covered alot of student debt, however I since deleted all my crypto exchange accounts and turned off notifications for all crypto stuff as I didnt see it as a good way to focus my time.

I now value my time alot and don't want to work more than 40hrs/week because last time it left me resenting work and feeling depressed for a long time.

I now realize how important friendships are. I don't think I am very social but at my work I find myself talking to people and socializing more than working because I enjoy it so much. It was because of covid that I found this out and I no longer see my friends that often because we all live like an hour away from each other however we do talk in groupchats everyday.

I live at home and my family bought a breed of dog (7months old) that needs intense exercise (2hr walks) and lots of stimulation all day, for which I am primary provider of and if I am not here he wont get the exercise he needs and I carry that guilt with me all day which makes me feel like shit.

I have a gf who is finding lots of success in her career and shes going to be moving in her own house soon, which I could be moving into as well but I just don't have enough monthly income to justify it, however I really want to move in with her and get my life going.

I guess i have always been a very ambitious person I have started a few side businesses that have worked a bit and failed or I just gave up on it because I didn't find it worth while anymore, but that leads me to why I am here today.

# Decisions Decisions.....

I need to make a decision.... and to me this decision feels very important in the trajectory of my life, so i guess i am looking for second opinions.

**Option 1**, I have the option to become a certified Trainer and then apply to some jobs at gyms around here however the demanding schedule of a trainer requires you to be available 5am-7pm. As much as I like fitness and how I have been successful with gf friends and family and helping them get to their goals idk if I want to have my schedule that occupied. This would be good because I know I would do well and likely move up in company very fast plus I would have the monthly income to move in with gf and I would be able to socialize everyday. Negatively, I could be taking the short term opportunity here and maybe if I waited a little longer one of the opportunities below would've lined up, plus I would also not have any time to take care of my dog.

**Option 2**, I currently am running ads to sign up clients so I can train them in my area, however that also takes a bunch of time and mental stamina and money. The benefit of this is if I can get it off the ground before I run out of money it could be very rewarding, however it will take alot of time to get it to the place where I earn enough to move out with gf. This feels very isolating to me, as I wouldn't have any coworkers to socialize with for a while. 

**My third option** is more outlandish and involves me not getting paid at all except I would meet cool people and those connections could possibly rocket launch my career.

I want to cold email a few people I find really interesting and find a creative way that I could help them save time with their tasks and they don't pay me anything they just show me how they work and what they do, like an unpaid intern. Once again this will take at least a few months and I wont make any money right away and nothing is guaranteed, however I could make important friendships along the way. This would be amazing for socializing because I have so many questions and I am genuinely eager to learn from a select few individuals that I admire and it seems like alot of fun, however its definetly a weird one to explain to family at holiday dinners though.

&amp;#x200B;

Idk why but for the first time in my life I feel like taking any hourly job for me personally is a sellout and I will regret it. As easy as it is to get a job, and how nice it would be to make decent enough income to move out right away and how nice it would be to have a lot of coworkers around to talk to, it kinda makes me feel sad even thinking about it."

My advisor stressed to me not to take any internship that isn’t paid, and as I’ve been searching I’ve found that a paid internship is extremely rare. Any internship I’ve found in the work I’m especially interested in requires relocation WITHOUT providing housing, 40 hours per week minimum, and no hourly or stipend pay. How can this be legal? It’s not idle desk work either it’s physical labor and specialized lab and field work skills. It’s so discouraging because to get any experience in my field I need to somehow pay for a place to live plus gas and food just to work for free full time. I just needed to rant about it because who is actually doing these internships? It’s certainly not the students who pay for their own school and come from poor backgrounds already. 

The funniest (not funny just morbidly amusing) part is I found an internship that requires the intern to pay THEM $1500 in order to do unpaid work for them. 

Especially in STEM, companies, labs, etc know they can get away with this because internships are a requirement for us to get into graduate school or any job in the fields.

Today while I was researching about one of my subjects I came across the head tutor's LinkedIn profile and checked it out curiosity. It was filled with internships at multiple top companies, awards and scholarships, and she's only like a couple years ahead of me in terms of progression. Made me feel like a loser, and adding to my anxiety about job hunting once I finish uni, made me feel even more hopeless.

Sometimes I wonder if I chose the wrong field to pursue. Maybe cs isn't my thing, but it's kind of late now. Not sure what I'm trying to get out of this post, guess I just wanted somewhere to vent."

which in May will be one year, it was prolonged from December to May end date. 
I have asked my manager if I should start applying elsewhere (internally in the company or outside the company) or maybe there’s an opportunity for me in the team as an engineer.
The signals I’ve been receiving from him have been quite positive, we talk very straight forward with each other, on several occasions he has complimented my work and in other occasions has made me feel as if he sees me already part of the team, with phrases such as “when you will do this, that.. for a project”
He told me he needed to talk with someone regarding my future and then would talk with me again. Basically I’m unable to apply in the company for other positions because I’m waiting from him to give me a response and also outside, somehow I feel like betraying the trust I’ve earned and I don’t want to be seen with a bad eye. Any suggestions? Like, if he cannot keep me in his team why would he give me false hopes by saying things about the future, when I would be starting to work fulltime with different contract and why would he engage me in long term things? Why does he need to talk to someone? May it be because he needs to see if he can have another opening in the team?
Please provide your feedback, appreciate much!!"

The main problem I’m facing is that i have been wanting to spend more time for myself which I haven’t been able to do with all of my internships, simple stuff like going to the gym more often, spending time with friends and my partner and even just reading more book. I haven’t had the chance to focus on this stuff with 4 months left if i do take this opportunity i will only have 1 month to do the things i want to do. 

Am i just giving bullshit reason to not do the internship? am i wrong for declining an opportunity to just sit on my ass doing nothing?  I’m afraid of regretting my decision"

So I am currently a Master's student who transitioned into CS. Like everyone else, I have been applying for Summer 2022 internships. I have managed to receive an offer from a smaller company. The pay is relatively modest at $20/hour. This will be my first Software Engineering experience so I am looking forward to it.

I was wondering though, should I try to get something better? Will something like this be a good experience when I do full-time recruiting next year? I am still applying to places and seeing what happens. I feel like as someone with no previous experience I should be happy to even receive an offer. Any insight would be very appreciated!"

In fact I feel like sometimes the classes that are really hard are even easier to get an A because of the curve so if you know your stuffy or don’t have to be so careful with every little detail. 
I know I’m the type with bad handwriting, and do 3*5=8 on a exam, or forget to submit a file of a hw assignment, etc. I even tell my bosses in internships - I play thing fast and loose, I’m good for R&amp;D and probably not so good in a production environment.

I am in a Computer Science Engineer School and have started developing 2D games using Unity on my free time (I'm still learning), and I wonder if I should keep going or switch to GameMaker2. I currently don't have much interest in developing 3D games but it might change over time

A school friend who has made 2 Internships in Unity developing VR projects told me that Unity is bad for 2D, like he didn't like developing 2D games in Unity and that Unity wasn't very good at handling 2D games

GameMaker2 is MADE for 2D game development, so maybe it is more suitable for developing 2D games, but I also want to use the game engine that will be the most valuable in a resume, since I want to make my last internship in game development, and I want to become a game developer.

&amp;#x200B;

So basically my questions are:

1. Is Unity still good for 2D games ?
2. Is GameMaker as valuable as Unity on a resume ?
3. Should I switch from Unity to GameMaker, or another engine ?

I would like to ask for some advice as to how feasible this is. To give a summary of what I've done so far:

- I have done an analytics internship where we had to collect, structure, and do data manipulation to develop a recommendation system.
- I have done an R&amp;D-focused internship where I was exposed to NLP, DL, and MLOps. 
- I have done Image processing + DL research to help an NGO (using an existing architecture and training it using a novel dataset which we have created based on their use case).
- Currently, I'm doing my thesis on a cross between Bioinformatics and DL.
- Some experience in backend development.

As for my issues, I am not that confident in my stats and linear algebra skills as our uni doesn't offer a DS track for CS students. I also don't have any major experience in data engineering (e.g. building ETL pipelines, using Spark, Hadoop, etc.) . 

I'm aware that the job market is quite saturated with applicants and that some companies prefer MS/PhD applicants or those with a heavy math/stats background. With these factors, what are my chances in getting a job as a Data Scientist or in other DS-related jobs? What do companies expect from new DS hires? Are there other career paths for fresh grads which can improve my chance in landing a DS-related job?

I recently interned at a well known tech company; post the internship, HR told me that they want to make me a full time offer. During that conversation, HR hinted that locations would be an option and I asked for a different location that has more growth opportunities, they said they'd discuss it with their manager and let me know (internal mobility is quite common and infact encouraged, even for interns!) 
Other interns have been offered different locations, even without any leverage.

I also informed my manager about this and he was quite supportive of my decision. A few days after the conversation, the manager informed me that there's a policy that doesn't allow interns to switch locations as it would lead to all interns choosing better locations, ""defeating the purpose of the internship"". 

I currently have one other offer at a much smaller startup for half the TC, a verbal offer from a governmental organization (they have a hiring freeze because of security reasons, however it is confirmed, because the team I'm interviewing for is managed by my mentor) and interviews lined up for a couple of other big tech companies.
I've really enjoyed my time at the company and definitely want to work there, probably not in the same team now.

So I have a few questions about what I can do in this scenario - 
* Should I use the verbal offer to negotiate and should I tell them that the offer is yet to be put on paper. How much of the details should I disclose?
* Can I use the interviews as leverage to negotiate? How do I do so?
* If they don't budge, I would want to take the offer and use that to negotiate a better offer at a different company, however, HR would want me to sign the offer. Can I renege after signing the offer? Is this something I should do?
* What else can I do in this situation, do you have any suggestions for me?

Last semester, I took several classes without an online option, but this semester I opted for mostly asynchronous classes in order to accommodate my internship schedule. I technically have one in person class, but the professor streams the lectures online.


I started out going to that class in person, but as the semester has gone on I've opted to stay home to save time/gas. But now I spend almost 24/7 in my house (internship is also remote), and when there are events on campus that I'm interested in, it's such a struggle to get myself to actually go.


I've had major fears about getting an in person job after graduation because of my comfort in ""existing"" in my home and getting work done without the feeling of other people watching/judging me, a fear that heavily impacted me while doing an in person internship last summer.


I am going into the tech field so there is a decent possibility I'll be able to find a remote position, but I also feel like taking such a position will inhibit growth.


I'm definitely lucky in that I do well with remote work, as it has enabled me to accomplish a lot during the pandemic. But I also fear that I am missing out in important opportunities, especially when I graduate and my friends will start their careers many different areas."

I have got into a few schools in early rounds and still waiting for UCs and a few T20s I have applied to. As of now, I am contemplating between these three colleges: Northeastern, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and University of Florida.

**Northeastern:** 

Pros: I love the location as I always wanted to be in a bigger city and Boston seems to be a perfect place to me. CS program seems to be good even though not that highly ranked by US News. The most significant advantage as an international student who wants to work in the US after degree completion seems to be its structured Co-op program which would almost guarantee me job experience along with my degree. 

Cons: Coming from a warm climate, I don’t know how I would cope with the cold weather. Northeastern is the most expensive of my choices at around $78K.

**University of Wisconsin-Madison**

Pros: Highly ranked CS program (US News rank 18 for CS). Good social life. Though Madison is not Boston, it still seems way better than Gainesville. Much cheaper than Northeastern at $57K

Cons: It seems that upper-level CS classes are difficult to register, and many people have trouble graduating on time. Not sure about the availability of internships for international students. Too cold. Colder than Boston.

**University of Florida**

Pros: Highest-ranked among my three choices. Typical US college experience with lots of school spirit. Warm climate. Cheapest of my options at $44K

Cons: Not a well-known CS program. Not much to do in Gainesville as compared to Boston and Madison. Not sure about the availability of internships for international students.

My parents would be paying from their savings without taking any debt for all three choices, so cost is not a deterrent. Though if I choose a cheaper college, the saved money can go to their retirement fund."

For context:

* I want to go into either cyber security or AI.
* International student (Southeast Asian)
* I have never done AP, so I don't care if one of the university accept more AP credits.

I wish to get a well rounded experience. Here are the things I take into consideration: Academics/Fundings/Co-ops &amp; Internships Opportunity/CS Career Search/Social Life/Location/Peers/Learning Environment.

From my understanding, UIUC is a typical state university. You will meet a more diverse student body. In contrast GT is very STEM focus. So you will meet an overall tech savvier students. In addition, there will probably be more funding for CS per undergrad student at GT.

For a learning environment, I don’t want to be in a toxic / harshly competitive environment. I rather much prefer a healthy competitive environment where students collaborate and help each other better themselves. From some researching, GT seems to have a very good learning environment/culture. Every students work together and professors are willing to make their students successful. How does this compare to UIUC?

Both are superb in CS in general (their rankings are pretty similar, GT has a slight edge). However, GT seems to have fantastic Learning Communities, Undergraduate Research/Creative Projects, Co-ops/Internships. (No ranking for UIUC, so I assume they are not on the top list. Correct me if I’m wrong.) I want to take part in project/research, so which will offer better opportunities?  Which universty is more well-known or has better prestige in the CS industry?

For the university location:

UIUC

1. Rural
2. Better campus town = Better college life?
3. Safer? (A big factor for my family)

Georgia Tech

1. Urban
2. Atlanta is a growing hub for top tech companies = More opportunities in Atlanta?
3. Higher crime rate? Will this affect college life? This post kinda made me worry as I don't have any prior experience with gun laws and crime in US metro cities.

I know prestige doesn't matter as much in CS compared to PPE (for example) but if it shows employers the course is rigorous and produces good graduates, the unis reputation will be well received in the job market (E.g Employers from London going to Edinburgh because they know Uni of Edinburgh is good). 

But mainly I'm looking for the one which has good industry connections. 




**flexibility with making grades**

-My firm asks for ABC, in the event I don't get that which has a fair chance of happening and I end up getting ABE, which do you reckon would be more flexible? 

Ik CS is very oversubscribed, however as this is for a foundation year I'm hoping it will be less so.


Edit: it's the University of Sheffield,m not Sheffield Hallam. I chose the foundation year as it allows me to go into engineering too (which I like as I know I want to do something stem but I don't want to commit too early). Ik it's possible to switch for RHUL but sheffield has more certainty about the post foundation year options"

While I possess a very faint exposure to ESG (internship exp) but I'm interested in taking this forward.
Imo it's a very narrow domain, but growing and only limited orgs are present here, eg: MSCI, S&amp;P Global, Bloomberg, Morningstar, ISS ESG, PWC, etc.

What should be an ideal roadmap for someone like me coming from computer science background to pursue sustainability domain. (new grad) ?
Is CFA or MBA must?"

t5z5qg,1,2022-03-03,I lied to my parents for 2 years. What should I do to make things better?,OpenDoubt423,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t5z5qg/i_lied_to_my_parents_for_2_years_what_should_i_do/,"Back in February 2020 I started to get my Computer Science degree in College. 6 months after that, I got an internship. 6 months after that, I got a full time position. 6 months after that, I switched jobs and now I make about R$ 150.000 (Brazil’s currency), which places me in the 2 or 3% of richness in Brazil.

The problem is that the more I worked, the less I studied. Last semester I took only one class and barely attended the classes, so I got the university’s notice that I was gonna be “expelled” from there, due to lack of participation. College is not a priority for me because I am actually loving my job, which is way cooler, has awesome people, perks, great money, etc. 

The problem is that my parents value education too much. When I told them that I was “expelled” from college, they told me I lied to them because every time I was asked how it was going, I’d answer with “oh, it’s ok, it’s great, everything is going well”.... when in fact nothing was going well.

I didn’t tell them about the situation sooner because it feels like my worth is equal to my grades. But when it escalated, I decided to finally open up about the truth and it went pretty bad, with my mom saying that we were never a family, that she failed me completely, didn’t give me proper morals and education, that the only thing I should do with my life would be go to college, and then if after that I wanted to do drugs, it would be fine, that it doesn’t matter how much money I make or if I invent a fucking flying car, that these things are worth nothing if every time I’m gonna fill out a form, I only put “High School” in the education section. 

What can I do to make the situation better?"

I have a few years of sysadmin and end user support experience so the recommendation makes sense, but it's not where I want to end up. I don't graduate until Dec '23 so I still have time for another internship. Has anyone here interned somewhere and been able to return to that company to intern or as a new grad hire in a different position than you originally interned for?

I'm thinking worst case it doesn't really give me SWE experience, and best case I get to know people in the office and get invited back after I've got another year of studying under my belt.

Any similar experiences here?"

For what we know, I’ve had this pretty much all my life but it’s really become a problem since starting university. I’m finishing up year 2, but my friends and original timeline would have allowed me to graduate this year. It’s hard seeing everyone graduate and leave from my year even though I took last year off. It’s been so hard making friends at uoft since coming back from taking a year off.

I’m in a pretty tough program and have an amazing internship lined up for this summer that I’m having a hard time letting go of. I’ve constantly had to drop things over and over in my life and it’s really shattered at my confidence. I don’t think I’m able to go through this competitive internship given the severity of my illness. This has just been such a frustrating lifelong struggle of mine that always takes so much away from me.

I’m so demotivated with school and even at a reduced course load I’m finding it such a challenge to get my term work done and exams written. I have 2 over the next couple of days and I just can’t seem to get myself to work because my symptoms are so bad. I do have accommodations.

I’m getting better at putting myself first and knowing that it’s not the end of the world if I have to drop another course but I just want to get this degree done so badly because it’s taking me so damn long. 

I’m fortunate to now have a diagnosis because I’ve always been hard on myself to not be able to keep up with others but it’s so hard seeing other people manage so easily and be healthy. The internship I landed this summer was a dream come true and I can’t even believe that it might be ripped away from me again from this illness I’ve been dealing with my whole life.

Feeling defeated."

One year now after graduating, I’ve been looking to get into IT, I’ve had a brief internship in high school but besides that no It experience what so ever only education. 

I’ve been somewhat looking for jobs but nothing too aggressive, and I had an interview with a big corporate company supporting military operations as well for a network communications engineer role. The phone interview went rather okay, they told me about how they use Cisco equipment a lot and I nailed all net and sec+ related questions but they omitted all the Cisco ones since they know I have no experience with cisco what so ever. After the interview they told me that they liked what I had to say (the professional fluff blah blah) and that they would be contacting me by next week of their decision. 

I haven’t heard back from them in 2-3 weeks. 

I’ve been progressing at that point looking at other places and found a small business that was interested in my resume for a pc help desk tier 1 job; they reached out to me I had a phone interview, and then an in person interview. I would say both of these went very well and based on what I was told there are lots of opportunities to grow. I see myself enjoying the work environment there but I would be starting off help desk which I never did but tried to avoid since it is super entry level. At the end of the night they sent me an email saying they really enjoyed my interview and how they want me to send them a simple video demonstrating some abilities like resetting a password etc. and that after that a job offer is very near (the recruiter for that company added that)

Now to my big problem, the morning after the first company I applied for that never got back to me had a recruiter reach out to me saying that she wants to give me an offer from that corporate company and that they would like to hire me. It amazes me that a month later they decide to contact me when the dude on the phone interview said next week…i called and was told the offer would be $29/hr full time which is way more than the tech support help desk job would ever give me. Based on my area I would be expecting between $14-17 from that small business per hour. 

I really enjoyed the small business interview and the work environment but At almost half the pay and a much more entry level title I am conflicted on going with that, I would be spending a long time trying to get where I want to be to even get close to the same job offer that the other company just gave me…

I told the big company asking if I could have until Monday or Tuesday the latest to hear back from if I want to accept it, they said absolutely no problem and that’s where I am today. 

Based on my experience, I feel like I would be joining the corporate job and work hard to try and stay alive, vs the entry level job where I would need to work hard to get anywhere. 

I also feel more secure with the small business job as it is entry level vs the corporate one where my skills would absolutely be put to the test, but if I manage to succeed in it and thrive, I’d say I would be 2-4 years ahead in development 

What would you do?"

t61yim,2,2022-03-03,The snake eating its own tail,kat_aklysm,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t61yim/the_snake_eating_its_own_tail/,"I have been working at my current job since october 1st 2021, so less than half a year. And I am already so done with the company it is unreal.

I am working in local journalism, but in my country, there is one huge company that publishes over 100 small, local newspapers, I don't live in a big country, so that's basically as local as you can get. As you can assume, working in journalism is all about connections and networking. You want the mayor of the town to talk to you comfortably, you want the police to take time to give you statements, and most importantly for this company, you need businesses to advertise since it's entirely ad-financed.

Well, this company has an insane turnover rate. barely anyone makes it more than a year, especially in my region. And it is just simply embarassing, people all the time tell me that our staff changes all the time. Of course it's also simply stupid, the company hires people with 0 experience (well, no one else would apply for a wage like that), they then have to constantly teach the new kids everything from scratch, they have to invest a ton of time and resources, and then the people leave, just when it probably starts to pay of. It is ridiculous, and it is stupid. Often, simply no one knows what's going on because simply no one has a real clue due to (perfectly understandable) lack of experience.

I am technically supposed to lead the team of 4 journalists (+ me) that works in my greater region (it's kind of complicated but technically i am supposed to be the leading editor though the translation doesn't work well), technically, I was immediately hired for a position that does have a fair bit of responsibility with 0 experience leading anything (and for a wage that I shouldn't have more responsibility than an intern - it literally is in the range of better-ish internships). I didn't know this at the time of applying. 

Just yesterday I worked my ass of, I was at an important event, produced a video, all by my self, then rushed home, edited it until 10 pm so I could publish asap, and that's after also not really not working all day, starting at 8, with maybe 2 hours break total. Not all days are like this of course or I wouldn't have any sanity left at all at this point, but on most, I work long hours. I am salaried, so work for free whenever I work more than 40 hours, and I can't take time off to make up for it, or my co-workers (who are in the same position as I) would have to make up for it. 

So the company keeps driving people into burn out, or they get off the sinking ships to the competitors - so the company has to keep training new people, who have to network again from scratch, and are likely gonna be gone a year or two later. They are literally killing themselves. They don't have enough resources for existing staff, because they have to keep hiring, training, hiring, training, and so on. 

I mean, and it's not just the grunts, the upper ranks fluctuate a lot as well. My current manager started after me (again, I haven't even worked here for half a year)

If they bit the bullet and invested into expanding to a point where the staff doesn't have to kill themselves working, raised salaries to a point where you would stay longer than just for the training and focused on building up staff so they are happy as long-term emplyees, then the problem would fix itself.   
The job itself is absolutely amazing and I genuinely love it (I would not stay up until 10 pm if I didn't, I couldn't), I love the experiences, my team is amazingly dedicated (especially given the circumstances), I think I could grow into a real asset for the company, but under these circumstances, I'm not going to.    
The company is killing itself. It is going to collapse, they can't keep this going, or even the few remaining loyal people are going to quit as well. 

But the most interesting thing is, we had an internal workshop thing where we got to talk to people from all over the country, in small, private groups, about how we as employees view the future of our company, and literally everyone, in different divisions, is experiencing the same. So it's not only my small, local region's team affected by this, it is the case everywhere. 

I'm thrilled to see where this all leads, I know I might not be able to find a job  that easily afterwards, but I am just really looking forward to seeing the whole ship burn down."

t62byq,1,2022-03-03,Master's degree or bootcamp?,supaSlick3,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/t62byq/masters_degree_or_bootcamp/,"Hi guys, I (mid 20s male) got a BS in Chem Eng about 3 years ago. Since graduating I've been working mostly in the industrial automation field w PLCs and DCSs, but am not super happy or fulfilled. The work isn't particularly interesting to me, and the significant travel to industrial sites has become a major turn off for me.

Alternatively, I took a couple of computer science courses (basics like CS1/CS2 w Python/Java) in the later years of undergrad out of pure curiosity, and I enjoyed them - to the point where I didn't mind spending hours on the homework(s) or projects to figure things out. I'm not totally sure what direction I want to move in the next step of my career at this point, but I'm leaning towards pursuing more education in the CS landscape. I find myself feeling jealous of people whenever they talk about their jobs in tech and kind of dream of a similar role (and maybe this will sound absurd to people in tech haha) - but because of that, my gut feel is that this is the direction I should go.

With that said, I think the next step is pursuing further education. In my inexperienced eyes, I see two possible paths - either apply to a Master's program, or a coding bootcamp. A Master's program is a bit more of a commitment, from both a time and money sense, while a bootcamp is cheaper, and faster (although I'm sure pretty relentless and fast paced). I feel like at this point, its a bit premature to assume this is what I want to do, and to apply to a Master's program and spend $50-100K on a degree. Could anyone provide advice or resources on what they would recommend or what research they would conduct prior to making a decision? I've thought about trying to get an internship in the field before I commit to further education but I think that would be difficult to land w no experience or degree. And on top of all this, I don't yet know what subdivision of CS I would like to specialize in (Data Science, Web Dev, UX/UI,  or perhaps (somewhat non CS) Software Eng). Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated, thanks!"
t62j0m,5,2022-03-03,"Workplace culture described as ""'tiger by the tail' chaotic""",snapnshred,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t62j0m/workplace_culture_described_as_tiger_by_the_tail/,"I'm doing interviews for internships (a 5-week internship is required to complete my tech program at school). A lot of internships turn into fulltime positions for students almost immediately, so I've been mindful of where I apply. I interviewed with a place today that is notoriously slow in their communications with incoming employees but tout themselves as an ever-expanding company. I researched the company beforehand to see what kind of work they do and expected them to get into more detail in the interview. They didn't, everything they told me was readable on their website which is already kind of vague. 

I asked them about their work culture. I've spent the last ten years working in very chaotic and unstructured environments, and I don't want to get involved in another place that is constantly chaotic with no leadership. When I posed this question, one of the people conducting the interview (there were three) said ""we're laid back but we're busy. I'd describe it as good chaotic, like 'having a tiger by the tail' kind of chaotic."" 

I've never heard such an awkward description of a workplace culture before. When I looked up what ""having a tiger by the tail"" meant I found definitions like ""harnessing a powerful force only for it to turn on you"" etc. Having the company describe themselves this way has left a weird feeling in my gut. It's weird, right?

I was offered an internship with a different company that feels much more inviting. I guess I'm hoping that I'm not being dismissive of the place I interviewed with today just because they said something off-putting."

t63w68,2,2022-03-03,Am I an asshole?,LilUziVert2000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/t63w68/am_i_an_asshole/,"My ex (21F) and I (21M) broke up about 6 months ago and have for the most part finally gone no contact for the time being. For context We had been dating for around 4 years and have been friends for around 7 years and things somewhat just ended out of nowhere from my personal perspective. We had always had a good relationship with each other, there were some ups and downs like any relationship but for the most part the relationship was always healthy.

There was a slight amount of change through dealing with COVID-19 and her parents being very controlling and not letting her out of the house for an extended period. During this time period we would facetime and do other activities to ensure we could still spend “quality time” together. During this time frame her and I discussed looking for an apartment together in 2021 because her college did not offer on campus housing. During this time, I did not have a well-paying job and was stuck in a rut of being a 20-year-old spending most of his time in college and hanging out with friends.

I had agreed to searching for an apartment even though I knew the move in date was around a year out and understood that there would be plenty of time for me to save money and get “my stuff” in order before this major change would occur in my life. My ex would always talk about how I needed to get a better job and save up a portion of money to ensure that I could pay for my portion of the apartment, it's also important to note that her parents were going to pay for their half, so she did not need to worry. I just simply did not have that option and have always had to figure things out for myself and could not rely on other people to help me with much of anything.

When this decision was made to move in with each other I tried to do exactly what I was encouraged to do. I landed a “High-Paying” job within the next couple of months and did my best to explain that with me making more money it would require me to work longer hours and not be free as often, this was okay with her during that time.

We spent the next couple of months extremely happy from my point of view, even though I wasn’t around as much or had as much free time. We both knew that each other were busy with college and work and with her living about an hour away for school. But we always did our best by doing things such as facetiming and such during this time period.

Through this higher paying job, I was also able to purchase a new car because my old one was almost destroyed. I got a lot of backlash from my ex and her family because I was supposed to be saving up for money for the apartment. I tried to explain that the car was something that was extremely important for me to have and paid for the car in cash to ensure there wouldn’t be any car payments. It's important to note that car was just a 2017 Honda Civic, nothing that was over the top.

We finally reached a point where it was time to start actively looking for an apartment and I for the most part let my ex look for whatever made her happy when it came to an apartment. Her family and her decided to go with an apartment that would cost a total of $1,600 a month or $800 a month per person. The apartment was beautiful and was currently being built, I showed my concerns about this apartment and how the place was expensive and would be hard for me to maintain a livable lifestyle with the apartment. They were upset with me, and I finally caved into getting the apartment and just told myself that I would make it happen.

With the conformation of this apartment being secured, I had to make lifestyle changes again. I was able to get a raise at work and do some other things with my personal finance to ensure that I would be able to have back up money for the apartment, while also still putting money aside for retirement and such.

We had signed the lease for the apartment in June even though we would not be moving into the apartment until September. I was not a huge fan of this because I did not enjoy spending $800 a month on a place I currently wasn’t living, but I shrugged it off because it my ex happy.

Once the apartment was in our names with a co-sign from her mother, we slowly started to move things in throughout the summer. There was nothing major that we both had for the apartment and would be starting out fresh. My ex insisted that we bought all new furniture for the apartment. I gave her access to my Wayfair account and let her pick out the furniture for the apartment. At this point in time, she had to save money for college and was not able to pay for much of anything, which resulted in me being the person to pay for the apartment items.

I ended up spending around 20k after everything was said in done when it came to getting the apartment ready to move into. The apartment was entirely decked out with everything you could have imagined, 75-inch TV, 55-inch Tv, 50 Inch Tv, soundbars and subwoofers for each Tv, new couch, new bed, Alexa’s in every room and everything else you could imagine when you think of a “high-end” apartment.

I spent the summer building all the furniture and setting up the apartment on my days off. I had been working 5 days a week at this point and working roughly 60 hours a week, which caused me to not have a lot of free time. But I ensured on my days off that I would spend building and setting up the apartment so it would be ready by the time my ex needed to move in (Late August).

Even though that everything seemed to be going well there were also some personal issues that I was dealing with at the time. My mom and dad had become rocky and had somewhat separated for the time being, which took a tool on my mental health. Which I tried to explain to my ex but was often given the cold shoulder.

My ex and I had some issues towards the later months in the summer because I was often extremely busy with work and the apartment and still trying to spend time with my parents (to try and fix their marriage), while also spending time with my ex.

There were a few cases we would have some arguments about certain things. I personally didn’t like how whenever we both went to the apartment, I was always the one setting and building everything while she would hang out and play on her phone. There were also some arguments about how we couldn’t afford to go to dinner every night or go the bar every night because of trying to save money. There were also some arguments because I tried to explain to my ex that I couldn’t continue to purchase her new clothes and jewelry every week because it was taking a toll on my bank account. I somewhat tried to put my foot down and explain that we couldn’t be spending as much as we were, this did not go over well.

One of the biggest arguments we had was when my ex invited two of her male friends over the apartment for an entire week before I was able to move in. Her two friends I knew, not extremely well but on a surface level. These friends went to school with her and needed a place to stay because their apartment wasn’t ready to move into. She told them they could stay at the apartment for the week with her without asking me for any thoughts or input. I wasn’t extremely upset but this but tried to explain that it was not just “her” apartment and it was also mine and some communication would be nice.

I than learned that my ex’s sister would also be spending time at the apartment every week because her sister went to school in the area. This was going to mean that her sister would be staying at the apartment two – three nights and week. I was once again not informed about this, and it was just thrown at me and I wasn’t able to have a say in the situation at all.

I didn’t mind these two situations at all, but I increasingly felt like I was the one who was supposed to somewhat sponsor these people. Consistently sleeping on my bed, eating my food and doing a variety of other things that was costing me money, without ever getting anything in return.

Once the week came that her friends were going to stay over, I was told that I wouldn’t be allowed to go to the apartment during that time period. This was due to her and her friends being there for school and would have lots of homework to get done and needed to focus on school. With me getting out of work late it would have been an inconvenience for me to show up at late hours and wake everyone up.

I wasn’t okay with the situation at hand but couldn’t do much of anything rather than suck it up and deal with the situation at hand. I did have some weak points during this week where I would double text or call during the day to ensure things were alright because their seemed to be a slight change in tone towards me. 

Once the week was over, my ex came back to her parents’ house and met up with me and broke up with me. Her reasoning was that school was going to be a lot and that we were taking different paths (since I had already graduated). I was heartbroken, but she offered words of kindness explain that we just needed a few weeks apart to refocus and then once things settled down, we could pick up where we left off.

Being in somewhat of a panic state, I believed these words of kindness offered to me. We had always agreed that no matter what happened we would together stick out the entire lease and still live with each other.

I gave her some space for a little while and continued to carry on with what I had to do for the next couple weeks I chose to stay with my parents during this time period. I later found out a few weeks later that my ex and her mom had tried to remove me off the lease without my permission. When I confronted them about this, I was informed that her sister had moved into the apartment, and I would no longer be living there and had to find other living arrangements. I refused to sign off the lease until I was able to quickly find something out.

I would make trips to the apartment to slowly gather some of my smaller personal items during my free time. During this time period I was still working 5 days a week and had just finished up an internship and would be starting my MBA. I didn’t have access to a truck, so I would pack up my smaller items in my car for the time being.

My ex became increasingly upset that I was taking smaller items such as my lamps, phone chargers, Alexa’s. Some of it was understandable because there were a few things I took out of being petty, such as the Tv remote and the trash can. We were still on somewhat good terms, and I was trying to do almost anything I could to bring her back into my life, even though deep down I knew that it was never going to work.

There were a few cases that my ex would allow me to come to the apartment to hangout if I brought certain items back to the apartment, which stupid me thought it was a good idea. I would go down and bring back items that I had already taken, and I would often spend the night. I would also still buy her whatever she wanted because I was so jaded during this time period.

During some point throughout the whole situation, I finally realized that I was being used and finally put my foot down. I went and grabbed some stuff without asking permission first, which caused me to get blocked on all forms of social media. This caused me to not be able to get in contact with my ex to figure out more dates to grab stuff. Even though there was never a good time for me to grab stuff from the apartment.

I was also being forced by her to still pay my portion of the rent even though I wasn’t living there. I was told once I signed off the lease, I wouldn’t have to pay rent anymore, but I couldn’t sign off because I couldn’t grab my stuff from the apartment.

Eventually I was able to get in contact with her family (Mother and Father) and try to figure things out. We all met up and sat down together at her parents’ house to talk and try to find a solution to the problem at hand. 

I explained that it did not seem fair to me that I had to give up my apartment without getting anything in return. I made efforts to get my point across that I had spent the last year of my life working towards this apartment, put 20k worth of items in the apartment, graduated a year early to move into the apartment along with all the other efforts I had made towards the apartment

I told them that I would sign off the apartment if I was able to get some money back for the rent I had paid. I had paid an extra 4k in rent while I was no longer living there, because my ex forced me to. They agreed to pay the amount and would write me a check within the coming weeks.

At this point I thought the situation was finally over. But my ex texted me and told me that if I was going to black mail her family into giving me 4k that she would never want to see me or speak to me again and would tell everyone how shitty of a person I was. This scared me because I didn’t want to come across as a person that was stealing money from another family, I just wanted to get the money I had paid for no reason back.

I never went over to grab the check up until the other week, I had given it a around a month to see if there would be any change. Once I stopped buying everything and finally put my foot down there was no more sense of friendship their anymore, no more casual conversation or hanging out.

Once I finally was able to come to terms with the situation and wrap my head around it, I went over to grab my check from her family. I texted my ex to tell her that I had gotten the check and would be grabbing everything out of the apartment that was mine once winter was a little warmer, I never got a text back, but it felt good for the situation to be over.

But still daily I constantly think about if I am a bad person or an asshole because of what I did. The situation and words that were thrown at me cause me to question my worth and makes me feel sick to my stomach because of how much of an asshole I have been towards someone that I had once loved with everything in my body. I still don’t really know if the made the right decision or not, or whether I am generally a good person for how I handled the situation. My friends say that I did the right thing, but they are going to offer an opinion full of basis due to them being close with me. ATA?"

I have pretty decent grades for my current school (4.0/4.3 GPA, rank #1) but I feel like I don't have many other strong EC's to make my application stand out, so are there any other CS extracurriculars I should try doing?

I want to get an internship to accumulate some experience but I'm not really sure how. I also see lots of people doing research with professors, research papers, and non-profits but they feel artificial, and I have no clue how to start. There's also a bunch of other contests like SciOly and DECA but I feel like I'll be starting too late and won't get anywhere.

Thank you in advance!"

The problem is, quite literally I'm just a LC monkey. I have ~300 questions solved but when it comes to writing real code for a huge code base with tests and everything, I just can't.

I don't think my problem solving skills are bad, I think I have a decent level of coding for smaller scale things (I can do all my programming assignments in school easily, I have a dozen or so projects on my GitHub but none are huge with tests and stuff), but last summer I did an internship with Amazon and didn't receive a return intern offer (tbh my manger and I did not get along and I really disliked what I was working on), so I'm just worried about the same thing happening with Facebook, especially because now I'm looking for a new grad return offer.

tldr: scared of upcoming FB internship, trying to get a new grad return offer, but last summer I couldn't even get a return intern offer from Amazon. How to code, how to get a return offer?"
t68g4g,5,2022-03-03,I can't do this internship anymore. I don't know what else to do. Advice?,Speedster012,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/t68g4g/i_cant_do_this_internship_anymore_i_dont_know/,"I know I talk about school in this post, but this feels that it should be its own post. 

So, I'm in my final year of getting my Master's in Professional Counseling. I need to get 600 hours of service, and so far, I'm at 452. But at my internship place, it's horrible. First off, I had a supervisor who was the definition of ""toxic positivity"" AND got fired (she has no filter). Secondly, I work with kids, which was never my intended demographic (college students/people 18-30ish) and I do not have the patience for them. She basically told me that this is not the right field for me early in the game and misinterpreted everything I said so that it sounded like my fault. For example: If I can't work with kids, how else am I supposed to deal with other clients? 

My program director said that I could get my hours and leave because she doesn't want me to be at a place where I feel ""miserable""; however, due to the staff changes, she wants me to stay. I'm good with the new standee (he's nice) and my LPC supervisor, but I still can't stand my workplace. I teach psychoeducation 7 times a week, and I'm struggling dealing with rowdy elementary school kids who hurl insults and throw things while I'm trying to teach the lesson. I also can't be the authoritarian disciplinarian either, but at the same time, I can't just let things go passively by and let kids kick each other.

Not to mention, I'm so indecisive about my actions. I've been told to take the initiative and become more assertive, because sometimes it's things that I should know what to do. And when I do, I get called out for it, because of one minor misstep. That's one of the reasons why I wasn't able to get to do individual therapy again. Mainly because of some slip-ups in mock sessions, how I interact in the office (""robotic""), taking praise as immediate go-sign to ask for more, etc. And with this, I feel that I'm going to get nothing done. 

When I tell them I don't want to do class anymore, I fear that I'm going to be called out. Not to mention, I'm at the bottom of the totem pole. Even though I can provide services, because there's nothing much for me to do, especially during this time, I'm a fucking office temp, and often I sit in my office doing nothing at all. I feel that I'm not getting enough from this internship experience. Sure, I ""could"" have tried for another place, but there wasn't enough time, and this is the only place out of 5 that accepted me. I'm good with hours, but it's the *quality* of work done in those hours. Another thing is the fear of not getting a good evaluation, which is necessary to get more work in the future. Not to mention, my program director is going to be one approving me for graduation, *not* my LPC supervisor--that's so embarrassing. 

Sometimes, I get jealous of my cohorts, because they're having the time of their lives, while I'm here doing nothing. I'm stressed the fuck out, I'm starting to have flare-ups of anxiety, and I seem so hopeless about the future. I don't know if I want to be an LADC anymore. I hate this place so much; I want to be free. I can't take 2 more months of this shit. 

What the hell am I supposed to do?"
t69fso,5,2022-03-03,"Waiting to hear results on my neuropsych evaluation, but nervous that I didn't represent my symptoms well enough.",katlc,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/t69fso/waiting_to_hear_results_on_my_neuropsych/,"About 2 or 3 weeks ago I did a neuropsych evaluation to try and get tested and diagnosed for ADHD, and I have an appointment on the 9th to hear the results, but the appointments had left a bad taste in my mouth as I worry that I didn't explain my issues enough to them. I'm a 23 years old female with no diagnosis history, and freshly graduated with my Bachelors as of December, and I get the feeling that the professionals I spoke with weren't taking my issues seriously because of all that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I first did an interview with the psychiatrist who was to refer me to their psychologist that preformed the exam. When I first sat down, the first thing they asked was if I was a student. I said I just graduated from university, and the lady instantly said, ""So you're here for ADHD, but you were able to graduate college?"". Yes, I graduated college. But it took me several major switches, failing entire semesters, threats of academic probation, and forcing myself to step back from relationships and fun hobbies to remove any source of distraction from my environment. I didn't even know what ADHD even was until last year when my roommate and best friend had sat me down and expressed that she thinks I may have ADHD (she has it, and was diagnosed since she was a child). By that point, I was working on finishing out my 4th year already and only had one more year to go. 

&amp;#x200B;

I did my best to explain my symptoms to the psychiatrist, and also to the psychologist I later saw who interviewed me before starting the 6 hour long test (which wasn't done by him, it was done by his assistant), but the feedback they gave to my described symptoms were mostly ""Well, everyone occasionally feels X way"" or ""It's work/school, nobody is interested in it either and would struggle to be motivated"". I was fighting to hold back my tears the entire time and I felt like I did a horrible job trying to explain the severity they affected my school life, my work life, my personal relationships, my finances, and even my mental well-being. Of course, I left my giant journal full of symptoms and notes at my house that is two hours away, so I was trying my best to remember everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

Did anyone else feel this way as well when they were waiting on results? I'm really scared that I went through this entire long, difficult, and costly process just to be told I don't have ADHD because I suck at communicating my issues. While it would probably be good if I truly didn't have it, it would also mean that I'm even farther from getting help and fixing my life/preventing future issues. School has been tough for me ever since I can remember, my relationship and friendships feel like they're on the cusp of failing, my finances are in the garbage, and I'm so horribly unmotivated and unfocused at work that I fear that I'll get fired or never moved to full-time (still considered an intern). I fear for my future so much, that I wont be able to handle full-time employment in my chosen field (computer science), or that I'll become a bad wife and a bad parent once I get married to my fiancé and we start having children, etc. I'd seriously appreciate any similar thoughts or stories or reassurances or reasonings, and thank you for listening to my vents.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**; I don't think I represented myself well enough to the psychiatrist &amp; psychologist I saw, or that I was able to perform well enough on their tests, and worry that I won't get diagnosed. Every facet of my life is suffering from symptoms shown in those with ADHD. I'm scared I wont get diagnosed, and that I really am just this way after all."

Baby therapist here (intern) and I have had a rough day that I can’t seem to let go of. I had my first real “fight” with a client’s caregiver. My teen client previously disclosed occasionally using pot to me and their caregiver recently found out they have been and that I hadn’t told them. The caregiver said some very strong things to me today that have made me feel terrible and like I am not working in my client’s best interest. 

I explained that I can’t just disclose what the client says (outside of self harm or plan to harm others, of course) but that didn’t really sway the guardian. Per her, I should have told her the first time the client said anything about using pot. I did counsel the client on the consequences and possible outcomes but according to the caregiver, I should have specifically told her she “could be expelled and taken away by CPS.”

The client’s caregiver said that I withheld information about the client “self harming” by using pot and that I obviously do not care about her getting addicted to drugs, expelled, arrested, or throwing her life away. She told me I don’t know what I’m doing and that I am hurting her family. She talked to my supervisor who just sort of agreed with her (and suggested that I report to her after every session and she should have the client drug tested weekly) to calm her down and then talked to me, telling me that I did the right thing, but now I’m the bad guy in the eyes of the caregiver. 

My client and I are still seeing each other for now but the caregiver is threatening to take away the client’s individual therapy if I don’t “start doing my job”. I am so confused and lost. Am I missing something here? How should I handle this moving forward?

Any insight would be appreciated, if possible."

I'm an undergraduate at my college for computer science, I had done a class in high school and found it really fun and enjoyable.  I am still finding it good to test myself and try to learn more about the subject and try to get better at it. Unfortunately I still am struggling in these classes, and feel inadequate. At my college it feels like I'm surrounded by people that understand whatever we learn instantly, while I can take much longer to try and understand the same material. Up until now I have taken 2 Java courses and am currently learning about data structures and algorithms.   


As I head into junior year, I feel as though I really haven't done much, and it's a bit stressful. I want to apply to these internships and co-ops my college has been advertising, but I feel like I haven't learned much as a whole about Java, not to mention several other factors..  
\-I've only taken two courses on a single language  
\-Not a great GPA  
\-No prior experience  
\-Lacking compared to peers  


I recognize that I have really nothing about me that a company would want, and want to turn it around. I feel as though even if I were to get my degree, nobody would want me. I've heard making a project over summer can be good, but has anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice?   


TLDR: I suck at what I do and have no experience, any advice for what I can do to improve?"

I have an opportunity for an online teaching/tutoring position and I think I really want it. I would make almost double what I am making now and would be able to work remotely. 

I think a big part of my apprehension is I want to take the job in part to use as a catalyst into the next season of my life. I am unhappy at my current job (it is the highest, high control environment I have ever experienced) and I want to move back to my hometown (where this job is technically located if you were to go in to the school I would be working for) due to not really liking the city I moved to two years ago (I moved here for a job out of college I got during an internship). It has been a great growing experience, but I have found that I don’t have the same support system/community out here as I do in the city I grew up in and I really want to adopt, but don’t feel like I have the support in my current city to do that successfully. Relations with my adult brother (we live together) have also become pretty strained and I’m hoping some distance can allow us to mend some of that. 

So I think it’s the correct move, but I think I get scared around change - like am I trying to escape something or is this actually a really great opportunity to pursue what I want and find a little more flourishing? I would obviously give both my current job and my brother long enough notice so that I put either of them out with a transition.

“maybe it’s because you’re a woman, so you don’t understand how men work : we don’t use emotions”. 

i was so stunned that i didn’t even reply, at first i thought i heard wrong but he kept on going about how men are more logical and maybe i should try to control my emotions and whatnot. what hurt me the most was that not a single person in the meeting said anything to him. unfortunately neither the company nor my country enforce discriminatory behavior laws *cough*asia*cough* so i couldn’t do anything. 

they offered me a full-time position after my internship ended. i am now happily working for one of their main competitors’ company.

Now that she's all grown up and ready to explore the world, her mother encouraged her to go study abroad and start an independent life. Every child's wish✨

But little did she know that the house would be too vacant and voiceless with her gone as if it's lost its life. Ever since Shanaya has left, her mother has been experiencing emotions of sadness and loss, she's encountering Empty Nest Syndrome(ENS), it isn't a clinical diagnosis. 

Signs to note for ENS:-

•Frustrated due to lack of control

•Facing marital stress

•A loss of purpose with the child gone

•Anxious about children and how they are doing

•Emotional distress


Even though you want your child to experience and explore the world on their terms, the experience of letting go could be painful. It might be difficult to face that no one at home requires care or attention. Missing your children's companionship and not being able to take part in their daily lives are all a part of ENS.

It may be tough but you could cope with it by:-

•Identifying new roles you could take.

•Trying to reconnect with yourself and your partner, try to understand yourself and them better.

•Taking on those new challenges that you've always wanted to try but couldn't.

•Resisting the urge to check on your kids too much, let them grow as independent adults.


It could be a very scary phase of various emotions, it'll eventually be alright once accustomed to reality. But if it's too overwhelming, feel life has lost its meaning or your anxiety/depression worsening, do approach professionals.

I'm feeling depressed lately because it's really hard to get my foot into data analyst role. Currently unemployed and in government's program like an integration course where I'm learning local language in order to received social benefit. I've applied countless of job applications with most likely 2 answers: rejection and hear nothing at all. None of this get me to at least an interview invitation. I've applied for junior, trainee, even unpaid internship.  
Graduated 2 years ago from master degree in Global Innovation Management (basically like International Business with entrepreneurship minor) and I have bachelor degree in Marketing Communication. I think I have a solid business acumen based on my education background and previous job as store manager, built portfolio on GitHub and created personal webpage, constantly updating my LinkedIn too. Learnt SQL, excel, python, R, tableau. Well, pyhton, R and Tableau is not in advance level yet, but I think I have quite ok understanding.  
I'm lost and helpless cause i dont know what to do. I know that finding a job is a long journey but the more i see the rejection email, the more i feel demotivated and depressed. It's really taking a toll on me, not only mental health but also physical. Didnt get my period for the last 4 months due to stress and burned out. I'm female, 30 y.o and no, I'm not pregnant. Went to see doctor, they said its due to stress and I have ask help from therapist (which I cannot afford atm). The integration program will be finish by May, so I have the urge to get a job before then, cause I think I'm not entitled anymore for basic unemployment benefit. I tried to remain positive but it's really heard to keep the positive momentum floating when everyday I see rejections email over and over again. Started to doubting myself and self-blaming that i'm so bad and stupid :(

So, for those of you who have experienced this before and came out to the other side, or for those who're in the same boat like I do right now, could you please gimme advice how to overcome this? what did you do to keep motivated and positive? what advice and tips can you give me and others how to get into data analyst or similar roles?

I changed my major to a STEM field in undergrad, and worked extremely hard and managed to keep a high GPA in both my community college and uni years. However, my last year in uni was marred by the pandemic. I had to P/NP an entire semester due to mental health, and the internship I had lined up never materialised. So in the end, all I had going for me was a high GPA but literally NO internships or professional experiences. And because I changed majors so abruptly, I’m lacking a lot of the technical skills I actually needed for the field.

I spent 6 months writing my statement of purpose, trying to put an emphasis on my curiosity and low income background (and how I struggled through school). I applied to a whole bunch of schools because I figured with my experience I wouldn’t get anywhere. 

I hear back from a pretty good program that I got a full ride. And now a lot of the weight is sitting on me. I was looking at Gradcafe at some of the other people in my program that got accepted. And they have years in the field, a whole bunch of technical knowledge, have gotten other degrees. So basically way more qualified than me. The school assigned me a faculty mentor who is top in his field. He reached out to me this morning about his background (highly skilled, many years in the field) and I just fucking blanked. I’m so fucking scared. Part of me wants to say no to the university because I feel like I have somehow deceived the admissions committee. I’m afraid I’m going to go to the school, and they will realise they made a mistake, that I wasn’t as amazing as they thought. And that full ride has some pretty heavy implications. They’re expecting a lot from me. They’re expecting that I know everything, that I’m outstanding, that I will excel at my field. I’m none of those. 

I know it’s stupid to not take a full ride. But oh my gosh, there is some sense of guilt that’s eating me alive. I think I took someone else’s spot, and I’m terrified of being “found out” even though I didn’t lie in my apps…. Not sure how to go forward. I have no money, no support from parents, so the only way for me to not go into mountains of debt would be this option. There’s this huge possibility that I can lift myself out of my lack-of-money hole by getting this free education. But the expeditions to perform, to be expected to match my peers in order to keep that scholarship. It’s terrifying."
t6ngot,6,2022-03-04,Fired via text message,EmmelieSironae,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/t6ngot/fired_via_text_message/,"I've been lurking here for a bit but thanks to FB memories, I've been reminded of a job I had last year that was pretty shit. I'm 29F living in Australia and have a fairly extensive work history, and at the time I was looking for work after my internship had finished months prior. I should also mention that I have diagnosed Aspergers syndrome and high functioning Autism which can make me a little awkward socially but doesn't usually impair me besides the occasional anxiety. I have a personal employment case manager, which is someone who keeps in touch with me and can assist communicating with employers on my behalf. She is very hands off and does not get involved with my week to week unless I have a massive issue I'm unable to resolve myself. 

In January last year (2021), I saw a part-time job listing at a local post office. The owners, a husband and wife, had not long bought the business and had inherited a senior staff member that stayed on after the previous owners sold the business. This staff member had been with the company for 10+ years so needless to say that she was very good at her job. Even with her and the two owners working, they still needed extra help so were looking for someone to help them out. 

So here's where I come in. I applied for the job and that day got a call back, and they seemed to like me based off my resume alone so we had a phone interview.

They seemed impressed enough with me and asked if I would do a trial the following week. I told them that was fine and we made the date. I got a call a few days later from the hospital with an appointment time I had been waiting ages for and it fell on the trial day. I had to take his appointment, and then contacted the job to let them know that we would have to change the trial day as I had an emergency appt I could not miss. We changed the day, and that was it, or so I thought. A few days later, out of nowhere the trial was cancelled via text and I was confused, but didn't think much of it and considered it not meant to be. I went to my appointment, but when I was finished I had the idea to call the job back up and ask why the trial had been cancelled and if there was a chance we could book another. I really did just want to work, so I was a little desperate at this point. 

The owner set up a new trial day which was the next day and I went and did my trial. During the trial they asked me more questions that were kind of personal and not relevant to the job, but seeing as it had been a few months since I worked and I needed money, I answered them. Questions like ""do you have kids?"" ""Are you planning on having kids?"" Were ones that really stuck a chord with me, but I guess in their mind they wanted to know if I was worth it because taking care of kids can get in the way of someone working. I'm childfree and plan to never have children, but why is that their business to ask me? 

Trial went well and they took a chance on me and I started the next week. The first week was okay, but it was apparent that my bosses had never trained anyone before and had insanely high expectations that borded on unrealistic, to the point where they would pull me up for every tiny mistake I made when I was shown something just once and left on my own. My bosses would also mention that I was a little strange, how it was weird I didn't like to make eye contact, was soft spoken and sometimes talked fast when I was excited. I explained to them I had aspergers syndrome, but they didn't know what that was, and I told them it was a form of autism, to which they still drew blanks. Honestly they didn't seem to know what that was, and I don't know if it was because of the culture they were raised in - they were foreigners - or they just never encountered an autistic person before. I was asked if my disability would effect my work and I told them that honestly no it shouldn't. 

After that, they seemed to act very differently toward me, and got even more pushy and picky when I made the smallest mistake. I had to get my employment case manager in to speak with them and explain my aspergers to them because the way they treated me was effecting my mental health negatively to the point I wasn't able to avocate for myself anymore. 

At some point during my time there, I was messaged by a friend that told me she had just found out one of our mutual online friends had died months prior but none of us knew because sometimes friends just disappear from the internet for a bit due to being busy. This really did effect me since this friend was such a lovely person and to know that I would never speak to her again made me emotional. I went to work the next day and casually mentioned in a conversation to my bosses about  my friend, and that it was so sad that she was gone and I didn't even know how she left us. My boss gave me the side eye and asked ""will this effect your work performance?"" And I was taken aback that she'd so coldly ask that to me after I had opened up about something emotional and personal. A mistake, I realised. I told her no, and got back to my work.

After that, things just got worse, they expected me to be as good as the senior worker (who had 10 years over me) in the space of five weeks. They would keep saying ""you've been here x weeks. You should know things and be better now"". I honestly was picking up things very well, I think. For every 10 things I did right, I might have made one small thing wrong and that was what they focused on. 

They told my case worker that they were apparently okay with me but I read between the lines by how they were treating me. Come week 7, on a Saturday morning, I get a text message saying they did not think I was a good fit and that I was relieved of my position. At that point I didn't care because I was already thinking of leaving on my own so they did me a favor. My case worker was shocked, as she had told me various times that they seemed happy with me but I honestly think that was wishful thinking on her part. 

My mental health improved drastically after that point and I started looking for another job. It took about a month and a half to land myself another job, this time in the field I wanted and had a degree in. I'm still in the new job, a year on, and that itself had its own challenges, but it was far better than that damn post office. 

I should also mention that I told my bosses when I started that I was fighting for my super annuation from a previous job, that illegally did not pay their workers super despite it being the law. I was owed thousands and to this day am still fighting for it. The company has since shut down - at the time it wasn't though. They were amazed that a company would screw over their people like that and told me that they paid super and on time. Come end of financial year, I noticed the post office still hadn't paid me the one contribution they owed. It had been months since I worked there but still they needed to pay it as required by the law. I had to chase them up, but finally they paid... after the date they were meant to. Ironic huh?"

I have a lot of other interests as well, and so many things I want to try out even if they tend to have lower wages, many things from working in a bakery to becoming a park ranger.

Because she didn't have a credit history, she applied for a ""secured"" credit card (TD) for a $1000. This was to help her build credit score.

She did not work during this time (she was a student, and then had an internship which paid next to nothing) and still pursuing work.

We went to a TD branch hoping to get a new credit card, and get her $1000 back. The banker told her that since she's not employed, it's very likely her credit card application will be rejected.

Now since she does not work, I've been supporting her, and e-transfering to her so she can pay certain bills with her card, to build the credit score.

I could also issue her a card from my account, and then she can cancel the secured card and get her money back, but then she would stop building credit score.

What should we do in this case? Is there a better option for her than keeping this money locked?"

I have almost no idea how Cloud Computing works, I have worked on many tasks so far and I've learned the process that goes: Creating the task/feature/bug description (Jira Stories), make and push changes in code (Python, Pycharm, Git, sometimes bash), test these changes (Using postman, Iris? run bootstrap in AWS?), run the automated tests or builds until they pass (Cucumber BDDs, Jenkins) and then raise PR and deploy? 

I am more familiar with this process now but I find it hard to understand the big picture, from my understanding we launch VMs that follow multiple steps for provisioning and each one of the tasks I'm given has the purpose of making the VM pass that certain step, but I don't understand the concept, what do we launch VMs for? and how does that relate to API's? What are OPCX and VPCX? What does our client do with these VMs? Is this all taught in a Computer Science Major? 

Maybe these are all questions that depend on the project, and in that case my question is are there any resource/advice you guys could share with me in order to understand all of this and feel more comfortable/knowledgeable at my job? I'd appreciate any recommendations.

...Few years and a global pandemic that CERTAINLY delayed my desire to move out of a well-paying job later, I am here at 28 still working as a 3D artist. Which don't get me wrong is a fantastic job but it's not what I *want* to work in. I have way more fun programming than drawing (I'm weird, I know). So I've been looking into where to go from here and...I don't even know where to start to get back into getting a programming job. 

How would I even get the experience for it since every job (even entry level) requires experience at this point?

I feel relatively confident in Javascript, C# and SQL - I wouldn't say I'm confident enough to design a database by myself because I'm not sure I'm up to date with security protocols, but I could query/update one no problem and I'm looking into it. I *think* I'd like to maybe get into either web dev or some Java/C# developer focused thing since those are my ""favorite"" languages to work in but I have a passing knowledge of most things and still remember object oriented programming, documenting my code and all that.

But yeah I don't know how I should ""get up to speed"" with things nowadays nor how I would go about actually getting a job since I've been in a different industry for way too long and never really got started in the industry I went to school for."

t6x8yj,3,2022-03-04,I think I truly suck at the Job Search thing- Starting to feel demoralized and dejected,arsenalfan13,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t6x8yj/i_think_i_truly_suck_at_the_job_search_thing/,"I've been applying to 12+ jobs each week since the start of February as I am currently not in university this semester due to getting denied for multiple private loans and a poor academic performance in the previous semesters despite improving last semester. So for now, I've been applying to warehouse, admin, and other mundane job positions to keep me afloat financially for my basic expenses until I return back to University. I even held out hope for two positions (scanner &amp; a remote data entry position) that I had on standby but one of them fell through after the position closed today. This was for a full-time scanner position which only paid $16/hr. I still have the data entry position which pays $20/hr that I might hear from next week after my initial interview this week. (Even that is not guaranteed).

But as the month progresses, I'm starting to feel like I'm running in circles. I've also applied for jobs within my actual dream career in Private Equity Commercial Real Estate but have thus far gotten 3 interviews for an internship and none for a full-time position. I haven't heard from Internship A, Internship B is onsite with a local company and Internship C is remote. I got through the final stages at Internship B &amp; C and am still waiting to hear back from them after interviewing during the final stages a week ago. I'm starting to think Internship B &amp; C are leading me on and it's not real. It's been a 98% rejection rate so far but that might be understandable since I don't have a Bachelor's degree yet and 95% of jobs within the CRE industry require a Bachelor's or higher (including 3-5 years of related experience despite knowing the majority of applicants just got out of college). But again, it does concern me as someone with two semesters left until graduation and the right skills needed for the positions I apply for. I can't seem to score an interview for a full-time position with any firm for shit despite having completed an internship with an esteemed CRE program in Summer 2021.

Honestly, I'm afraid that I might be stuck in the eventual hamster wheel of crappy retail &amp; warehouse jobs after I graduate (My liberal arts degree doesn't help either plus it's too late for me to switch majors into a sector that is closely related to my CRE path) that I've worked for almost a decade now despite being in my late 20s, thus contributing to my depression in the past and lack of direction in my life. This would be the ultimate kicker and prove to me that I am not good enough for the industry I'm trying to break into despite trying my best to make as many connections and spending hundreds of dollars attending networking events (I even at one point attended one overseas in London back in 2019) &amp; managed to get someone to vouch for an internship with a Commercial Real Estate firm there only for that to fall through and realize that I was being lead on the whole entire time.

I'm also starting to get frustrated with the entire search in general and I do truly think it is starting to become a waste of time applying for shit jobs like Micky D's (only to still get rejected) that I'll need to hold me over financially until I get back into school for the next semester (Fall 22). Also, I heard today that the job market is stronger with more payroll jobs added than at almost anytime in history. But it still feels like my efforts are all for naught right now.

I also don't use the same resume for the crappy and CRE jobs/internships. I use one for the crappy jobs and another one tailored to the CRE jobs/internships.

Not only that but it does feel a bit annoying to still apply for these crappy jobs knowing I still haven't made any progress in my professional life yet, especially at my age. It's becoming demoralizing, demotivating and a waste of time on my part. I feel like I'm ready to give in the towel because honestly putting in this much effort to apply for $15/hour jobs is a joke.

Maybe I'm not being patient enough or applying to enough jobs but honestly, I'm really starting to have some negative thoughts about my position in life. It's not getting to the darkest point yet but it is starting to get there and my self-esteem is kind of dying off a bit the further I go into my job search. I don't want to get back to the ""darkest point"" because I have already felt it."
t6xjgo,3,2022-03-04,I feel like I'm learning nothing at Uni. Should I try learning more on my own? Or am I just impatient?,CantChangeThis,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t6xjgo/i_feel_like_im_learning_nothing_at_uni_should_i/,"Hey [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscarrerquestions/)!

I'll be starting my 4th semester of University this spring, and I feel like I've basically learned nothing about CS compared to everyone else. So far the only language we've worked with in school is Python and even then I've really only learned up to programming with classes. The biggest project I've done so far is a simple Flappy Bird program that me and a team made by manipulating a simple Asteroids template given to us.

So basically, do I need to start trying to learn more outside of school? and if so where would I even start? I really want to try to get an internship as soon as possible since writing code is basically the most interesting skill I've ever started learning, but I feel like I'm way behind the curve. I don't even know where I would start with a personal project or anything that would impress anybody. It just seems like a super tall mountain to climb, and I was hoping college would get me there quicker, but so far it's been going pretty slow.

But who knows maybe it's just the 80-20 Rule, where 80% of my learning will come in the last 20% of school. What're your thoughts? Thanks!"

t6yzd7,0,2022-03-04,First rejection notice received from my job search! Not discouraged - Happy to be making progress/steps towards my search for my first full time job.,RosK062307,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/t6yzd7/first_rejection_notice_received_from_my_job/,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here as a lurker for the past few months!

I am a soon to be graduate with a B.S. in Chemistry and I made the discovery that I didn't actually want to work with chemicals much and certainly not in academia from a previous internship and my current position as a research assistant at my university. My boss is abusive and the work environment is toxic but I can't quit as it's required by my degree to work there for the next two months until I graduate, which gives me 1 year of work experience as a research assistant, and another 6 months I did for unpaid internship/research earlier in my degree. 

I have a friend in tech who told me that data analytics might be up my alley. I looked into it and sure enough it sounds like a good fit for me. I am much more passionate about statistics than chemistry, with a math minor to prove it and I have 3 years experience with R. I also have been learning python during the last few months (though it's similar to R so I'm picking it up quickly) and I've been learning SQL. 

I always felt really scared to apply for jobs and until now I haven't really had to interview much beyond a grocery store that was desperate for a night crew stocker and hired me after 1 interview. About a month ago I went to a career fair and I interviewed with two companies and while it didn't seem like it would work out, one company was still impressed by me and I got some experience with answering difficult questions about my work history (i.e. what projects in the lab have you worked on). While those questions will change as I interview for different roles, being asked things like that in a position where my livelihood is on the line has always made me a nervous wreck. After that experience, however, it made me realize that it would be difficult to find someone who stresses me out more than my current boss. So since then I've been building up the courage to work up my skills more and send out applications with my newly rebuffed resume (with advice from my tech friend) and a cover letter I tweak for each company. I don't have the unpaid internship on there but I assumed since it wasn't an official job that it isn't relevant. 

I'm currently taking a mathematical modelling and simulation course and decided that applying to entry level data scientist jobs also makes sense. So I set out on indeed and applied to at least 3 jobs a day. I didn't manage to apply every day and I haven't been doing this for very long, but I got my first rejection notice today from one of the data scientist roles I applied for. Even though it's a rejection notice I feel kinda relieved because at least I've been acknowledged. I've had about 5 years of work experience with part time work (with 1 year of relevant experience as noted earlier) and I've always been a full time student (except for part time now, but I am learning more coding languages and applying for jobs with that time and writing my capstone), even working two jobs and going to two schools at one point. 

After taking the analytics test on indeed and getting a good score, my confidence was boosted because I didn't feel like I actually know enough for any of these positions, though I know this is a lie because while some of the ones I'm applying for require more than I have to give, others are completely at my level, and taking a shot in the dark to apply gives me a doorway to a better start if the interviewer decided I was the right fit and I adapted/learned quickly how to do the things I don't know how. My friend was going to give me a referral into his company, but I missed the boat by looking into it too late as they already have enough college grads signed up, but I've made peace with this knowing that they may have more positions open in the future and that I just wasn't in the right mental state when those positions were available. It's still difficult though as I made the mistake of telling a couple people close to me about the job and they keep asking me about it now, which hurts to admit that it was completely my fault. I've been working on all of the personal reasons that have been holding me back and I'm moving forward, not backwards now. That's the important part so that's what I'm choosing to focus on.

Bottom line, it's been a process trying to find enough self worth and confidence in myself to search and act on the means to live a better life. I've lived in poverty for all 25 years of my life and for the first time I think I have a decent chance at getting out. I don't know how realistic it is but I'm trying for remote jobs paying ~78-98k and I'm just going to apply until I run out of positions and hope something sticks by the time I graduate. I have some savings as a buffer but if I can get something before I graduate in two months and my current position ends that would relieve so much of the anxiety and stress I am currently carrying. I know I could be grinding even harder but I'm really trying to do this at a sustainable rate since it has me so stressed.


Wish me luck guys. I know I'll need it but I think I have a fighting chance. If things don't go my way, I'll try asking for less. I just know from this sub to ask for the range and to aim for the higher end because they will talk me down. If y'all have any advice that might help feel free to pitch a reply but no worries either way. I check this sub a lot so I'm sure I wouldn't miss something from the other posts. Good luck to everyone else! Keep fighting. (:"

* Technical Documentation Team
* Cloud Engineering Team
* User Interface Technical Management Team
* Web Development Team

I was hoping to get into the Engineering or the Web Development team as I am a CS major, however, on my acceptance e-mail, it states the following:

* Label/Business Unit: Global Technology
* Department: IT Client Services
* Work Model: Hybrid
* Manager: Deskside Support Technician

I've been looking for a job for this Summer 2022, and have done a few interviews with solid companies (some mid-size Vancouver startups, SAP Vancouver), and did an interview at a small startup and received an offer. Nothing stood out to me as amazing about this company, but also no big red flags (at least ones I know of). However, the pay is very low compared to what co-ops with experience make, according to my school co-op program. I don't want to get too specific, but it's actually less than what I made at my first co-op which in itself was pretty average. This is an **8 month internship**, so it really adds up. 

It's getting quite late in the term. I have no other prospects right now and there just aren't many jobs open to apply to(about 5 in the last two weeks). My interview with SAP was 3.5 weeks ago and I never heard back, although I did apply to that position as soon as the job was posted, but I'm not sure if that's hopeless by now. I was rejected after all my other interviews.

I know it's better than nothing, but 8 months is quite some time to commit. I'd also be willing to just take summer classes or just take a break from school/work and try again next fall for internships if I end up striking out.

What would you do in this position? Would you accept a low ball offer? Possibly try to negotiate? Risk it and keep applying?"

However, they are unable to offer me a full time position after graduation, but were able to set me up with a full time position at their sister mill. Unfortunately, their sister mill is located in the middle of nowhere, several hours from my and my fiance’s family and where I would like to live long term. But, there would be no shortage of learning experiences there in all aspects of electrical engineering in an industrial setting. On the other hand, I also might have a position available to me at another large industrial company in the area I’d like to be in, but it’s strictly the power distribution side of things, with a lot of project management, and no controls. On one hand, I really want the experience from the mill job, but on the other hand there would still be valuable experiences from the other job, and I worry that moving would have a negative impact on the me and my fiancé’s happiness. Long term I’d really like to end up back at the paper-mill I interned at when a full time position becomes available. What should I do? Will going into a position that deals exclusively in power distribution tank my chances of going into a position later that also has plc and drive programming? Any advice is appreciated."

From a really young age I learned to never tell my parents about failures, mistakes, fears, doubts, or anything that's even slightly bad because I've always left feeling worse. I've really come off as this perfect, respectful, and untroublesome kid which is not authentic at all. I try to avoid disappointing them at all costs because it makes me extremely anxious and they will literally hold onto things for literally years. 

Probably the first real time I truly disappointed them was during college when I decided I did not want to go into healthcare. They told me I was making the biggest mistake of my life, that there is no job I could get in the future that would be better than being a doctor/dentist, and that it was a shame that my friends (who did decide to pursue these careers) would grow up to be so much more successful and wealthier than me. It made me feel really horrible and 4 years later they still make hurtful comments about it almost weekly. I'm now a rising senior working an internship in big tech and I'm hopeful to return and be completely independent as a new grad. Whenever I tell them about my accomplishments in my tech career they are never impressed and sometimes will even tell me its still not as good as being a doctor.

And the worst part is I'm about to disappoint them again. I've been dating an amazing guy for 2.5 years now. He is caring, a great communicator, smart, loyal and ... Indian. My parents have expressed blatant racism towards Indians my whole life, I actually think my mom will cry when I tell her. I have already been putting up with their disappointment and hurtful comments about my career, and I don't want to give them another reason to insult me. I can't imagine my life without him, but thinking long term, it would be heartbreaking to see my parents not love their grandchildren or have this lifelong animosity towards me. 

The thing is is that I know this is stupid and they should be proud of me and grateful that I am healthy, educated, and successful in what I wanted to pursue. They should also just be happy that my boyfriend treats me right (because that's sadly not all that common) and isn't a bum. A lot of my friends have told me I shouldn't care about their opinion because its ridiculous and I shouldn't feel like disappointing my parents is the end of the world. Which is true I guess but it really doesn't feel that way. I also know this is like not an original problem (this is a tale as old as time lol) but what I want is to be able to tell my parents things about my life without flinching, feeling overwhelming anxiety or caring so much about their ridiculous opinions."

For the sake of not losing anything by attending, I got up, got dressed and went there.

I’ve done some coursera and udemy short courses on game design and development too, when I was first getting into tech.

This year i’ll be finishing both my bachelor’s in communication and media and the training program i’ve mentioned and i’m at a loss at what to do next.

Some of the options i’ve screened are:
1. Master’s in software engineering
2. Master’s in computer-human interaction
3. Bachelor’s in computer science
4. Technician’s in systems development and analysis (mostly to know more than just apple platforms)
5. MBA in digital businesses
6. MBA in software engineering
7. Shorter courses (recommendations encouraged)
8. Focus on work

My current goal is to reach a senior developer / software engineer position and I love the product  and business part of things.

Could you share with me some of your thoughts and experiences on those tracks and what you’d think would help me reach my goal faster?

Thank you very much! This sub has been a great help to me in the recent years."

She is also developmentally delayed (not sure how so though, and don't want to offend her by asking). I have had a mutual friend who has known her and her family for many years confirm that she has developmental delays of some sort. I have tried being super compassionate, kind and empathetic to her with this in mind. She is SUPER nice.

Nice to the point where I am suspicious its just an act of manipulation to get out of having to do anything or taking any real kind of responsibility. I have been told by this mutual friend that she has been ""infantilized"" by her parents her whole life.

The problem is, she NEVER cleans, except for when I specifically ask her to certain tasks. I am miffed. It seems like she has this unspoken expectation that others will do things for her. I work a part time job (lots of physical labor), grad school part time, and have an internship that requires a lot of mental and emotional labor. I need help cleaning! I can't be expected to do it all the time. I have been very politely assertive and direct about my need for help around the apartment, and she complies (on paper) but then doesn't follow through with the chore. I end up doing all that needs to be done around the apartment. She has said ""I don't see a need to clean,"" which is because things are clean, because I clean.

I (33, F) have suggested we sit down and figure out a system that works for us, but she has said no to this idea. Then, I said ""maybe you can do the garbage one week, and then I can do it the next, and so fourth"" which she agreed to but, she doesn't carry it out and I am the one who ends up doing it. Then I suggested, yesterday, that we just write down what we do and when ""so that things are fair for both of us,"" which I have posted on the fridge. I hope this works.

She has also asked me to tell her every time something needs to be done. But, respectfully, I'm not going to tell her what to do, and when. I'm not a parent, and am certainly not a parent to an adult.

I would move, but I can't afford or accommodate that right now. We both have separate leases. I just have to learn to make this situation work but I'm losing my patience. Her excessive niceness exacerbates the situation and makes me feel like jerk. I just want her to take some accountability and responsibility. I think it's ok to expect more form someone who seems capable of doing all other life tasks.

I swear I'm a considerate person, just frustrated, confused and lost for answers."
t7ism6,0,2022-03-05,International Student Looking for Some Advice!,toolazytothinktaken,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/t7ism6/international_student_looking_for_some_advice/,"Hello, hope you are all having a wonderful day/night. I am an international student who applied to the UK and was looking for some advice. My family has always wanted for me to study aboard but recently, given just how expensive things are... I am beginning to question it all. So I am just trying to figure stuff out and hopefully, make the right decision.

Currently, I have an offer from Bristol, and I am still waiting on: UCL, Edinburgh, and Warwick (rejected from Oxford). I am looking to study CS and Mathematics and wish to go on to a grad school but there is a good chance I will be forced to go into the industry since my family is expecting me to earn asap (ik, not quite healthy but...). Essentially, I am trying to figure out if it really is worth going to the UK (I have also applied to the US but my options aren't looking that great, though I have yet to hear from a few universities so fingers crossed). If nothing works out, I can always stay in my home country, but my options here aren't exactly glamorous. The only real benefit is how cheap it will be. We have the funds to make going to the UK a possibility, but it is still quite a lot and I am starting to feel guilty. 

Here are some questions that I had:

\- How do you think these universities will prepare me for graduate school? I understand that it is what I make it to be, but I am just trying to gather some opinions. I have heard all these universities have excellent academics, so if I work hard, would I be able to get into a top grad school (not just in UK but also the US since I want to get my masters there)?

\- As mentioned, I might just have to go into the industry right after undergrad. From what I have gathered, these universities are well respected by employers (in the UK) but would the fact that I am an international student make things harder? I mean, I suppose it is dumb to ask if it is harder for internationals but I have had people tell me it is near impossible to get a job right after university and am better off going to the US (I don't know how much I believe this but it doesn't seem any better in the US, though I could definitely be wrong). Also, is the 2-year work permit really making things better?

\- Internships? Is it very competitive? Do I have any chance of landing any my first/second year? I will be coming in with some coding experience (obviously, not comparable to a high level) but I am hoping to get up to the mark during my first year.

\- Are part-time jobs very difficult to get? I will certainly be needing a part-time job to help with my costs of living.

\- I hear undergrad research isn't exactly a thing... is this going to be a bad thing? I am keen on getting started and don't mind volunteering (though it really helps out if I get paid but my understanding is that is rare)

\- Is it better to get the integrated masters thing? Or, am I better off finishing 3 years and then getting a master's?

\- Overall, would you recommend the UK (both in terms of university stuff and just social life) for international students? Keep in mind, on paper, my options in the UK are significantly better than those at home. My sister is completely against me staying... She has completed her undergrad recently from a private uni here at home, and I am really not impressed by what they have going on even though it is the best option I have if I decide to stay.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you, if you have read this far. It's quite daunting right now as things are getting more serious. My family has high expectations and wants me to get into the most ""prestigious"" university. Partly so it can help me if I have to leave the UK and return home (actually, right now I have no intentions of staying in the UK but things can change I guess). But, that isn't so easy and I find myself struggling a lot. If it matters, I really love the look and feel of Edinburgh, but 4th-year expenses make me worry. I will also apologize in advance in case I have said something ignorant. Thank you once again"

# TLDR;

I have an interview with them next week. My mom was actually hired by them a month ago and she really likes her team. They say I'm not selling a product, but I definitely am. It's an insurance company--it makes me slightly uncomfortable that they don't even use that word on their website. You are what you are, you know? I'll be calling patients who are very ill, apparently they are referred to us by their provider or whomever, and if they want to sign up--they can schedule their first visit with an NP. So they are already clients of the insurance company, but the idea is to ""Keep patients out of the ER"". It keeps their bills lower, they get regular check ins with an NP and avoid last minute emergency visits.

My mind says, ""Insurance company doesn't want to pay for expensive ER visits."" In addition, I've been reading about the many lawsuits against them, one of which involved taking away ER visits with some preventative care program, without informing their clients properly--so people thought their insurance covered it when it didn't.

The other part of me is saying: You have a good relationship with your mom, it will be good to work together, its WFH, gas prices are high and you won't have to drive. They pay for a portion of your school and you can move up/sideways in the company and potentially network with people in health care if you want to go into psychology/counseling. The team on your level is who you'll be working with, so you don't need to worry about lawsuits higher up.

I guess I'm hoping that one of you who reads this will have a similar situation/or have worked for a for-profit insurance company and can tell me it'll all be OK.

\---More information---

I graduated in 2017 with a degree in Anthropology and minor in Asian Studies, I had interest in working for an Asian American organization in my 20s. Later I became interested in higher education, wanting to become a Student Advisor. I originally went to college for Chemistry and decided I cared more about people, humanities--it was interesting. Chemistry was fun but I thought it'd be mundane. I also did know what I'd do with it unless I went into Pre-Med which would have extended my time in undergrad--things I did not have time/money for. Primarily, though, it was me being an ethical college student.

I didn't want to work for an industry ridden with corruption. One of my first papers was a comparison on Japanese healthcare vs United States healthcare, this was back in 2011. I was appalled and angry. I switched my major in 2012/13.

I never went into the Asian org thing because I couldn't find a job I was interested in, it required more schooling for learning Japanese language, many of the people had studied abroad, and I was asked to do another internship. It was very niche, I wasn't competitive, and I started to loose interest because I felt like I'd learned everything I could possibly know about it.

I became interested in Student Advising because I wanted to help kids like me who didn't have money to mess around in college, first gen students who needed more guidance. Not someone to tell you what classes to sign up for. I found out that I wasn't competitive in my area (Washington DC) because it was very wealthy, and most advisors had Masters degrees. The requirement was only Bachelors but I was told by several professors, administrators, and advisors while networking that this was the case. I tried for jobs in Admin at schools but never heard anything back. I've stopped applying because I now because admin jobs in higher ed are hard to come by and after all the scams about schools came out---I'm not feeling to grand about working for one of them. I'm a handful, with my morals and values, I know. 

I spent my 20s serving, I had to pay the bills. You know how it goes. Before the pandemic I landed a job in a middle school, tutoring part time. I thought of teaching, but don't really like kids and never wanted to teach. The pandemic happened and I landed a job at a pet hospital, after working there for 2 years I realized--again--it wasn't for me. The company was already poorly reviewed, didn't matter what office you worked for. Some are better than others, but its clear the structure is poor and there's really no where to move unless you get into vet medicine.

I'm interested in research, behavioral studies, psychology, counseling, etc. I want to be ethical about my career choices, but I'm 30 now and I'm broke for my age. I want to have the fulfilling career, but it seems like it's not really in the cards for me. I'm tired of it taking 5+ years to do something that it takes 1 year for the average person to do, like save money for a car/retirement/home. I want to be the strong humanitarian, but I'm literally suffering from it. It just feels like I lost the game of life by giving into working for/contributing to a company/people that are advocating for something that is hurting us. I feel like I've been living in a fantasy world or that I was destined to be poor lol. Unfortunately I need money and I'm kind over being in survival mode."
t7k92c,24,2022-03-05,I have a lot of flakey friends in my life. How do I find more reliable honest types?,Confident_Air8895,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/t7k92c/i_have_a_lot_of_flakey_friends_in_my_life_how_do/,"I planned a girl’s night for tonight and made a bunch of food for it today. Even bought a game to play. No one’s coming. I’m currently sitting on the floor with my dog trying not to cry. Out of the six people I invited, 2 were busy and couldn’t come (understandable), 2 were sick just hours before, 1 ghosted, and the other just bailed for other plans. My husband’s out of town and texted me to have fun tonight. I’m too embarrassed to tell him that nobody’s coming. 

I’ve always given these people the benefit of the doubt and felt sorry for them because I can see why they’re so noncommittal and the toxic patterns they’re entrenched in. The other part of me just wonders-what’s wrong with me? 

I had an abusive upbringing and have done tons of healing work over the last 5 years. I’m so grateful for therapy. 

As I was discovering myself I learned I’m fairly extroverted and am happiest when I have lots of plans to look forward to. 

I’ve been on Bumble BFF for a few months now and have been dealing with a variety of flakey types. Some I’ll meet up with and have a great time, they’ll even say they want to get together again. Then they’ll ghost me. 

Others will talk nonstop about themselves, while bragging that they’re introverted, and I end up exhausted by the time they leave. They seem nice, but they have this immature self absorbed vibe to them like they just want to monologue and enjoy having someone listen. They don’t even notice that I’m zoned out or obviously bored. 

Or they trauma dump on me, completely out of nowhere, and leave feeling so much better because they’ve handed all of their baggage to me. 

Yesterday I gently confronted two of these friends who regularly left my texts on read and bailed on plans we’d made, and one said “I’m just so overwhelmed with work, friends, and family, I read your text but I put it aside to do other things. I want to be friends but I don’t have time right now, hope you understand”. If you don’t have time for friends why join an app to make them..?

I went out for lunch with another friend from my grad program and she showed up 30 minutes late and said “Just expect me to be late to everything”. Um. No. She was also an hour and a half late to a Friendsgiving I hosted before. 

Then there’s another who ignores my text and tells me outright she read it and decided not to answer it, shrugs and says “I’m just a bad texter” yet her face is in her phone 99% of the time we’re together while she talks nonstop about herself. I always get from her “I’m just sooo busy!”. I told her that my time is important too and in response she says “I agree! My brothers in town, going to cancel tonight!”. 

Then there’s the others who are sick the hour before we’re supposed to meet-which could be possible but given their history I’m skeptical. 

A lot of them have an “it’s all about me” mentality and don’t seem to even consider that I’m a person with my own life going on too. I’m a married graduate student working two different volunteer jobs to get a good internship. 

Is this all that’s out there? Am I just too nice and people think they can treat me however they want to? Do I just seem like I don’t deserve basic respect? Wtf?"

t7l4m5,2,2022-03-05,Looking for advice,Cjivory,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t7l4m5/looking_for_advice/,"Hey everyone, been lurking on this sub for a while and appreciate all the posts in here that have really helped me in figuring out how I want to get where I want to get to in terms of a career as a software engineer/developer. 

With all that being said I just graduated in December 2021 and I have finally gotten a offer for a Software Developer position this past Friday! 

The reason I am making this post though is because I recently found out that this Software Developer position is a rebranded position within the company, it was originally a more DevOps position with a little bit of development work(using Powershell for scripting and automation basically)from what I am hearing from a friend who works in the company. 

My question for anybody who sees this post is will I be pigeonholing myself if I take this position because my goal is to be a Software Engineer. 

Now in the interviews with the manager for the team I will be on, the manager mentioned that there would be a possibility that I could in the future choose to work on my own projects every once in a while. 

Now as for me I graduated with an IT degree and not a CS degree and I have just been working on little side projects and brushing up on programming languages during my last semester and the past couple of months, thankfully where I live the companies here don’t ask leetcode questions and the interviews are not technically heavy interviews so I am very lucky to actually have gotten an offer for this position. Which is why I think I should take it and even if it does turn out to be more of a DevOps position I feel it will still be a very good experience for me because I literally have no sort of experience or internships in software engineering or development only IT help desk internships unfortunately. 

So my game plan I’m thinking of is if it does turn out to be more of a DevOps position I will just do a few side projects on my own time that will hopefully help me to keep my development skills up to par and then I’ll be taking a data structures and algorithms class so I can get up to par with leetcode questions and then go through the cracking the coding interview book as well all within a span of a year to a year and a half. I don’t plan on staying at this position for long either so that’s why I mentioned that timespan.

Please let me know what you guys think of this situation and my plan. Any and all advice is appreciated, thank you all in advance! 🙏"

There was never one point in my life that I have ever accepted anything less than exclusivity. I may have voiced considerations of more open relationships to him in the past, but I **always** close the conversation with firm rejection of the idea to leave no ambiguity. He knows this about me better than anyone. And now he pulls this in my face.

I don't know if I'm more heartbroken or more furious. Either way I know I have to walk away from him and not a minute late.

I'm disappointed in myself for letting such an opportunity slide, but am also upset with the hiring process. One student at my school cheated in his Intro. to Algorithms class and had to retake it after the professor gave him the chance to withdraw from the class manually. He received an offer to intern for Amazon this summer (very unfair). On top of that, I hear other people share their experiences and  how their interviewers were very chill and gave easy coding questions / questions they've done before. It's not right that someone who prepared much less than someone who's been working much harder receive a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity due to RNG being a notable factor.

I am not happy with how hiring is done after having grinded my ass off academically and on Leetcode-style questions for the past 1.5 years. I'm not sure what to do at this point and I feel like I just want to drop everything and do nothing for the rest of the year.

Some of my fellow admits have international CS olympiad medals, research at t10 universities, FIRST robotics, the list goes on and on.

I also completed Stanford online's CS50 course on edX, which if you've gone through, you'll realize how ridiculously easy it is. I genuinely am stumped as to what got me in. I wrote my activity essay about failing to jailbreak my iPhone in the sixth grade. And I wrote this another essay about human centered AI to safen refineries such as the one my dads works in.

I’ve done software engineering internships and side jobs up until this past year and decided I didn’t want to do that when I graduated. 

Then I got a job with my university as a student researcher with our critical infrastructure cyber protection program doing data analyst work 

Also am a lead researcher on a meteorology and disaster preparedness program for my school, mostly responsible for learning new technology and teaching it and overseeing project etc

My uni decided to come out with a safety app last year and around this time I was hearing about product management but all the APM/RPM applications were closed. Long story short, I somehow convinced the supervising prof to let me be a product manager instead of lead engineer and based off of job descriptions I read for technical PM’s at Oracle I did the same for my school 

Also since 2018 I’ve had a small tutoring/homework assignment business that I run, I have a small note taking app I built for it for my clients but that’s about it.


I’ve applied with all the usual suspects and maybe it’s because I’m a new graduate or something, but I haven’t been getting much luck. Any help is appreciated!

Btw, posting in other subs so if you see it somewhere else don’t worry it’s not spam or anything"

The director terminated my contract immediately. Made up a pretty poor excuse and my school have to get involved. 

My mom was the most mad especially, given that she have to receive a call from them. It does not help that she has always hated my poor sleeping habits and my constant lateness.

The next few days were bad, as I shut myself in the room and basically did nothing but try to accept the fact that it was my fault. My friends all accompanied me on the phone as they lived pretty far away from me. 

On the third day, I had an anxiety attack and almost harmed myself. My friend who was educated about mental illnesses told me that it was an attack and said I need help. 

I developed anxiety issues because of school due to my grades dropping, and was constantly stressed and overthinking in my school environment. This incident have to get the school involved and hence triggered the attack. 

I don’t know if I really deserve the harsh consequences and my anxiety to worsen. I don’t know what to do and I don’t know how to move on.

The placement officer answered everything (the usual do DSA yada yada) except the question I asked. They clearly didn't know what sysadmin is and that certifications are needed and not DSA. So I don't have any hope with my college placements anyways. So here I am lol. 

As for my skills, I am well-versed with \*nix overall. I run Arch Linux currently but have experience with Gentoo, LFS and other exotic distributions as well as Fedora (cuz RHEL) and Ubuntu. I am currently preparing for Comptia's Linux+ certification and will attempt it after this semester. I plan on taking an internship in 7th semester in sysadmin side and then a job in the same later on. I will also work on Red Hat certifications after this getting Linux+.

I don't know if I should go for it or not. I'm in the final year of my undergrad in econ.

Reasons why I'm confused about this program:

1. I'll be an international student in the US so getting a job could be difficult as a fresher and also the ROI
2. The program is fairly new so can't assess it's creditability.
3. I'll be giving up a job in EY as an analyst(Transfer Pricing) in India to pursue this program.
4. It's a one year accelerated program (FALL-SPRING) so I won't have time to do any internship or part-time job and get some experience.

Reasons why I want to go for this program:

1. I don't have all the required mathematics prereqs to pursue MS Stats or MS Data Science.
2. The job that I have rn is an entry level job and the opportunity cost is low.
3. It's an interdisciplinary course and I have a lot of flexibility to choose my courses.
4. Getting some scholarship which will reduce the cost of attendance.
5. Will be done with masters now instead of applying after 2-3 years.

So am 25(M) and i have an amalgam of experience, finished my C.S bachelors (2015 - 2019) and worked at an internship for 6 months.During this time i tried for GRE as well and scored 320, thought i might go for my MS in CS.

But had to cancel that to help my father with his manufacturing business, it was time of COVID 19's first wave. So helped him start a new business all over. (You can even say that i was the cofounder of the business.)

After a whole year working and helping him, left to work at a startup for around a year (always wanted to have an experience in the tech industry, there i build an android app and handled the backend of the company, the app manages the HR section of the company eg: payroll to attendance, handling promotions to verticals of the company, all done by me) but after gaining an incredible experience realised i REALLY liked doing business and joined my father's business again(making more money was a factor too). 

Now the conundrum is, manufacturing industry is a drag, you need to be really good with business skills to make it happen in this day an age, so am thinking about applying for an MBA, but am really scared whether i will get an opportunity at a good school or not for following reasons:

1. They are really expensive. I don't have enough for my family to invest both in my education + factory's growth.
Only 1 is possible.
2. My life experience is not according to many people, who are straight forward with their life goals, moving from bachelors to masters to an MBA. I have been all over the place.
3. I have experience in computer science and not finance or accounting.

So i would like some guidance, in how to approach for my MBA and names of good institutions in US who would recognise my hardships and efforts + miscellaneous experience of my life.

Do i have any chance for a good MBA or not?"

So as you guys may know, there is this really good free deep learning website/book at d2l.ai. I'm interested in the PyTorch version. 


However, upon looking through the code I realized the book uses it's own d2l library, which is of course built on basic PyTorch modules. 


My question then is, is it still worth taking the time to go through this book? For example, I'm primarily interested in the  NLP portions of the book, in particular chapters like chapter 10: Attention Mechanisms. 


In that chapter, the implementation of the transformer is done from scratch, but using their own d2l library. My concern is how it would map over to using PyTorch directly, to say, build a transformer using PyTorch modules like nn.Transformer and nn.TransformerEncoder.


I will be doing a data science internship in the future and will likely involve use of PyTorch for NLP tasks. As such, I was concerned about the mental mapping between d2l library and just plain PyTorch for NLP tasks. 

Was wondering if anyone had gone through the PyTorch version of the book and had anything to say about this. Is this a non-issue?


Thank you!"

In my field people in great colleges had 2-3 great internships, maybe a paper or two published and a CGPA in the 8-9 range (because quite a lot of humanities programs usually don’t give a perfect 10).

But it seems like every CS applicant to the US has published 5 papers, authored two books, worked 3 jobs and saved several countries from war and in the comments people are like ‘you should try for a bit moderate list of unis bro’ like omg. How does that even happen? So the people at CMU (which I think is the best of CS?) must have won a Nobel prize or something because I cannot imagine how anyone can be ‘better’ than others when all of you have done like 50 incredible things."

(Just venting),gnotaur,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/t85ht2/i_just_had_my_dream_job_in_it_slip_though_my/,"So I finished a state funded 6 month intensive course as a Systems Administrator that was hard as hell to get through! 

8 hours every day classes on seriously hard topics in my forth language (german,I also speek greek albanian and english) 

And I landed a 2 part internship at a company that is just 8 minutes away on foot from my home! Now the company is amazing! the facilities are top notch and everyone who worked there seemed really cool and happy! I could see myself working there for many years to come! 

So after the first part of the internship (2 weeks) I'm told in person by the manager that they would be super excited to have me as part of their helpdesk team and I don't even need to do the second part of my internship! they are offering me a job! and in 2 years (or sooner if there was a vacancy) I was promised that if I did good I would be promoted to systems administrator (or cloud administrator) I even shook hands with the C.E.O of the company and they promised that as long as I ""don't fuck things up"" then it's definitely going to happen! 

Fast forward to a week later and I get an Email from HR that says 

 

&gt;(managers name) told me that they had a great time with you last week and they would be more than happy if you joined them at the helpdesk.  
&gt;  
&gt;Therefore, I would like to invite you to a short HR discussion with myself via MS Teams in order to talk about your salary and contractual matters on (date) – would that date and time be convenient for you?

So I have a teams call with the HR where we discussed what my payment is going to be how many vacation days I'm going to get the hours etc.. And everything seemed ideal and she AGAIN told me how happy they are for me to be a part of their team and they are looking forward to having me and that I can start working from may 2nd..

AT THIS POINT I AM SO HAPPY! I landed the job of my dreams everyone who I told, told me that I'm super lucky as that company is one of the best ones in my city and I'm honestly feeling invincible and so exited to start this new chapter in my life!

Then last week I get an email that said 

&gt;We have decided about the next steps in our process and unfortunately, we need to inform you that you have not been shortlisted for the positions.  
&gt;  
&gt;We interviewed a number of very qualified candidates for these specific positions and decided to proceed with other applicants, who more closely fit our needs at this time.  
&gt;  
&gt;**It has been a hard decision and we really regret that we cannot provide you with a positive feedback. However, (managers name) was still impressed with you, and as promised, we will of course offer you to do the second internship here at (company name)**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Could you please tell me again when you will come and visit us for the second time?**

So for the past 2-3 days my disappointment is immeasurable as I honestly thought I had the job in the pocket! 

I just wanted to share this with someone because it's really ruined my week! and now the worst part is I have to go there again and finish my internship and I'm really dreading and feeling anxious about what their going to tell me or how it's going to go from now on but most of all I'm disappointed because I was so close to the waters but didn't get to drink (Greek phrase)

then I send them a message saying 

 

&gt;I am very disappointed and saddened to hear that as both you and (managers name) had previously told me that I was getting the job and you would be happy to have me as part of your team. I was really happy and looking forward to start working in your team.  
&gt;  
&gt;But I am still happy to hear that I can finish my intership with you at least! My intership dates are (dates)

and their answer was

&gt;As I also told you during our talk, we will keep you application in evidence(never said anything about that in our talk) as there are always strong fluctuations in our helpdesk team, and we will of course contact you again as soon as there is a new position to be filled!

thanks for reading through my long post and letting me vent out I really needed to share this!"

I was part of some amazing projects like Cassini/Huygens or Rosetta/Philae, and worked for 6 months as an intern at the European Space Agency. My main focus: asteroids, comets and cosmic dust. So... the small stuff in space!

In industry I miss giving seminars and the educational atmosphere in general. And it would also be a pity to not to share my knowledge with space and coding interested people. So that's how the series was created.

After recording some ""basic astrophysics fundament videos"" it is time to work on some larger projects. And the first one is an ML project to e.g., classify so called asteroid reflectance spectra using Support Vector Machines and Neural Networks. For now, the SVM part is online and keras will be added soon. Also, there will be an Autoencoder part!

I am looking forward to feedback, comments and ideas. Feel free to take a look at

I recently been talking to recruiters and people in the Cybersecurity field at Kpmg and EY. It seems they don’t usually accept Sophomore interns since they usually want to give you a full time offer after the internship. Even people at RSM said the same thing. My question is is there anyone that received an internship offer from the Big4 as a sophomore, more specifically in the Cybersecurity field. Thank you!"

Likewise, other than my resume, what should I bring or do to make myself attractive to a potential employer for an internship/job? I would definitely go into business if it meant I can learn the tradecraft of it as well as learning the needs of company cyber wise. I understand that business offers a lot of opportunities as well and that as a freshman, this is an opportunity for me to get an internship even though I’m not a junior.

March is here. Many of my MS data science applications should be soon rejected/accepted. I feel I have a good chance of getting accepted at Michigan State. In case I get it, should I accept the offer?

Pros- 

MSU is big name.

The program is going to be a collab of engineering, maths and statistics departments which means access  to the resources of both amazing depts.

Cons-

Its a new program. Fall 2022 is gonna be the first batch.

I dont know how to interpret the newness of this program. Does it hurt the job prospects after the degree? Does it help?

I dont know what to think. I dont have much work-ex in data science, so it is gonna be tough for me to find internships and jobs to begin with. Would MSU help or harm?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

t8dsfe,1,2022-03-06,possible rebranding after mistake.,AngelTrash_27,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/t8dsfe/possible_rebranding_after_mistake/,"i an artist. and i love making art. it helps me calm down. sometimes, yes i do make n*fw art. or even horror themed art. but i had blocked everyone i know personally (except close friends) so they don’t see my work on both insta and twitter. 

i’m doing and internship as an educational assistant in a kindergarten class, and one of the kid’s (let’s call her I) birthday was over the weekend. and she liked my little pony, so i made her some art of fluttershy. only thing was, i needed to printed it. so, i asked my mum (she works at staples in the print shop) if she could print it off for me. and i sent her the photo. 

as a force of habit i put my signature on it. and a bit too but so it was still able to read. now, i dint think there would be anything wrong. until i remembered i asked my mum. 

now, yes, she does give me freedoms to do things. (i’m coming to the end of my teens so yes i live with her still) and she started asking a bunch of questions. 

turns out, she can just look me up on google and see the stuff i didn’t want her to see. because i wanted my art as a privacy thing. now i asked her way she wanted to see what i posted and she only did the stupid repeated herself thing. 

it bugs me because i didn’t get a straight answer so, i left it off there. not wanting to get into an argument. 

but this thing. god it bugs me. i don’t want my mum seeing my n*fw. that’s my main worry. because then, i’m going to get yelled at and by god i’m not good with that. (i have really fucking bad anxiety and i cry easily)

i don’t know what to do. yes it was my mistake but, this stuff is one of the many that helps with my mental health and everything and- i don’t want to throw it all away just because of this. this is ducking bullshit. and i fucking hate this. 

i’m so overwhelmed my head is running so many laps and mentally pacing. i don’t know what to do."
t8dzg5,1,2022-03-06,"Imposter Syndrome, or do I really not know what I'm doing?",shermanator6594,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/t8dzg5/imposter_syndrome_or_do_i_really_not_know_what_im/,"I am unfortunately on the job market for the first time since I graduated college 3 years ago.

The coding challenge and the technical part of the interviewing process give me the feeling that I have NO IDEA what I'm doing all of a sudden.

When I graduated, I got lucky and landed an internship with the owner of a company who overheard me talking about how hard it was to get an internship.  I had no idea any of the stack being used (Ruby on Rails, MongoDB, Haml, Coffeescript, Redis.. etc...), but I learned it on the job. I did well enough that when I graduated he moved me to full time at another startup that he co-founded.  From there I worked directly under him (He was the VP of Engineering) and I was promoted from a JR Developer to a Full Stack Engineer.

Now that I'm interviewing places, I have no idea how to translate what I've done over the last few years into a technical description.  I can explain in basic terms:

My responsibilities were:

* Discussing with my boss customer requests and how to implement them.  This was a team effort, and we would go back and forth on ideas until we had a plan we both agreed on.
* Developing the Models, Views and Controllers according to the plans we came up with
* Presenting to the company what we were working on, and how it was coming
* Writing Test Cases
* Fixing Bugs
* Writing data migrations
* Completing projects of all sizes, usually on my own unless it was an EPIC which I would discuss with the boss how to tackle and divide the tasks up.
* Writing tickets for features and bugs
* Mentoring interns
* Helping onboard new hires
* Code Reviews
* Helping QA test the site

According to my boss I excelled at my position, to the point where he even had me lead the dev team while he was on an extended leave.

However I have two issues.

I have no idea how any of this fits into the technical description of the job listings.

And while I can develop comfortably in our environment, some of the coding tasks I've been given to do on my own have left me feeling like I know nothing about development.

For example, one of the tasks had to do with managing Sessions with secure tokens, which I've done very little of, and what I did do used the JWT gem which wasn't in my environment for the coding task.

Another task asked me to implement an API for repositories with PUT, GET, and DELETE api calls, and while CRUD operations were a large part of my job and I could do them in my sleep in my work MVC environment, I was expected to do this in Vanilla Ruby with no extra dependencies, and I had NO CLUE where to even start.

So my question is what is going on, am I really a developer, or was I just good at faking it?

TLDR:  I excelled in my job, but now I have no clue what I'm doing in interviews, or on coding challenges.  What gives?"

I currently just started applying for some internships / technical roles, and I’m stuck on how to approach some of these CodeSignals &amp; interviews I’ve received with nearby local companies. 

At this current moment, I’m not confident in my technical skills, at all. I’m currently taking data structures, but I’ve also only just started leetcode this past week. I’m fairly confident that when attempting to do my first CodeSignal, I’m gonna embarrass myself. Is it worth attempting whatever OA I may be getting? I don’t want to ruin my Codesignal score or anything either, as I heard all your attempts are counted when it comes to your overall score? 

I’m not worried about getting a rejection, I’m just concerned about giving a bad impression to some of these companies, and just looking completely lost, as these are local companies in my area that I want to work for full time eventually. 

Note - I have a plan in place to really grind leetcode these next few months, apply to codepath technical interview prep course, etc. and be ready for hiring season this fall. However, I’m just concerned about interviews right now for summer internships, and if i should go through with them as I’m nowhere ready currently.

Honestly, this has probably haunted me more than it should have, especially after reading the guidance on ""Explain, IN DETAIL, a poor undergraduate GPA"". I'm also reading through other SOP submissions on this sub and feeling as though I may have gone too narrative.

Would appreciate any and all feedback. Trying to hit the March 10 deadline for Fall '22 admission.

\--

In 2016 I graduated from &lt;University&gt;with a Bachelor of Science in Audio Engineering Technology paired with a Minor in Computer Science. Since graduating from college, I have made a career in computer science and am employed as a mid-tier engineer. Computer science is not just my industry of employment, it has developed into a true passion. I envision my career taking me to positions of leadership and decision-making, I want to develop software that positively impacts people, and wherever I go I want to ensure that my efforts lift up those around me. I see the rigorous study required for the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech and the degree it will confer as the next step to broaden my understanding of computer science and progress me further in my career.

I entered college with high aspirations of a life in the music industry, and from the moment I set foot on &lt;University&gt;’s campus I pursued that goal with all my being. By the end of my sophomore year my band had recorded an album, played shows throughout the &lt;Region&gt;, and even held preliminary talks to tour regionally in support of a large band. My hard work felt as though it was paying off, but when the band broke up these achievements quickly faded. I was left with bad study habits and my GPA reflected that effort. Turning my GPA around later in school proved difficult. I found myself struggling to understand the more difficult higher-level courses which relied on material I skirted in previous semesters. I have since had to teach myself things I failed to learn in my undergraduate courses. 

During my time as an undergraduate, I held two web development internship positions. Both of my positions were with advertising companies who focused on developing and maintaining WordPress sites for their clients as the primary deliverable. While I hadn’t necessarily excelled in my computer science minor course studies, these internship settings encouraged me to strongly consider pursuing a role in the field. After a summer full of interviews in 2016, I was offered my first job in October by a company called &lt;Company&gt;.

&lt;Company&gt; was launching a SaaS product and would need someone to provide technical support. Just as the software was new, this position was the first of its kind granting me the opportunity to define the parameters of my responsibility. I was the voice of customer support, an active contributor to the codebase, and a supporting member of the traveling sales team. In an exceedingly fast-paced two years, we saw enormous growth in the number of end users on our software, our team expanded from four to twelve members, and our codebase grew as well. The head of engineering moved me behind the keyboard full-time where I became an active participant helping to handle many of the problems tech startups face. Some of the challenges included development of a zero-downtime deploy pipeline, managing granular permissions for networks of users and their organizations, creating highly configurable data collection forms, means to compare data collected by those forms, and onboarding enterprise user bases at scale. When I did finally leave &lt;Company&gt;, I had true full-stack development experience under my belt accompanied by a smattering of soft skills. Now, almost six years after my first day and two jobs later, I still find myself referencing those problems and solutions, but from the lens of a slightly more seasoned software engineer. 

My first computer science job was formative in ways I could not have predicted. The experience guided me towards my core passion which is utilizing computer science as a means to help others. The next step in what will be a career-long journey of personal growth is for me to deepen my understanding of how computing systems are built. In spite of a lackluster undergraduate GPA, I have a proven track record of pursuing my goals relentlessly, and I have no doubt that I will succeed in graduate level coursework. I am drawn to Georgia Tech’s motto of “progress and service” and the successful reputation of the OMSCS program. I see the opportunity to study in the OMSCS program as not just being a step in my growth, but the next formative learning experience that will refine my understanding of computer science and propel me to greater successes. It is for these reasons that I hope to be considered for admission to the OMSCS program and I hope to be a member of the Georgia Tech community."

So, I am currently in my third year of a BSc in computer science, but quite honestly, I really haven't paid much attention to class.  I study at quite a sub par college, and I felt like I would learn more if I struck out on my own, which I did. Unfortunately, this also means finding my own path.  
I quickly picked up html, CSS and JavaScript, using Brad Traversy's courses(thank god for him) which I got pretty good at. I started freelancing on Upwork, and somehow started making a killing. I've been on the platform for only about 5-6 months, but have already made about 4k and still have quite a few clients and jobs waiting. I also started working on Shopify development, Wordpress, Wix, the whole lot.  
Recently, I got cocky and decided to apply for an internship, and got seriously burned during the interview. Turns out, I severely ignored everything in class, and most interview questions were from courses in class. I then started feeling depressed, because I might have been wasting my time on skills that won't help in the long run at all. I actually now feel like what I do know might even make me ineligible for the ""web developer"" title I've been using. I only excel at those 3 languages and Googling.  
I feel like what I do know is not really useful in the real world, but only as a small freelancer. My ultimate goal is to become a full fledged software developer. At this point, what path do you guys think I should take?  
Should I keep learning frameworks like React, Angular and backend languages like PHP?  
Or instead should I focus on ""real"" languages like Java, and C#  
Most of you probably say, ""Go with what you like etc...""  
But let's be honest, I've only got about a year left before I graduate, and I don't want to end up wasting what little time I have left learning another language that would only really be useful to me as a freelancer.  
What language would you prioritize learning if you were in my shoes?  
Thanks a lot for taking the time to read such a huge post."
t8let7,11,2022-03-07,Adobe vs Apple SWE Internship,newbjork,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/t8let7/adobe_vs_apple_swe_internship/,"Yes, I know Apple is part of FAANG but hear me out on my situation first. Also note that this will be my last internship so I'm looking forward to getting a return offer from them.

Apple

Team: Internal Tools Team

* $45/hr, Cupertino
* 2 interns, 2 engineers, in late 20s
* most likely going to be in-person or hybrid internship since Apple is big on privacy
* Return offer is like 70% chance since their expectations are very high but doable if I majorly kiss ass
* New grad return offer tc (bay area): 160k-175k
* Tech stack: Not sure but I know it's web based team with a front-end and back-end engineer. Was told they use JavaScript and React though

Adobe

Team: Adobe Analytics Cloud

* $51/hr, based in Utah but flexible on letting me work from any office (Bay Area, LA, Seattle, etc.)
* 1 intern (just me), 3 engineers, older with families and generally super chill and nice people
* Completely remote internship with $8k bonus for whatever I need
* Return offer is almost guaranteed and their expectations aren't too high
* New grad return offer tc (bay area): 170k-190k
* Tech stack: Full stack dev, Java, Scala, React, Kubernates, Kafka, APIs...
* Pro: My team seems to really like me, specifically my engineering director. I feel like since their expectations are a little lower I could shine here and possibly get promoted faster(?) if I put in around the same effort as I would at Apple.

Benefits comparison: [https://www.levels.fyi/benefits/?companies=Apple,Adobe](https://www.levels.fyi/benefits/?companies=Apple,Adobe)

Benefits breakdown:

* Both have great ESPP with Adobe's allowing 25% of base salary contribution and Apple's 15%
* Adobe gives Free lunch and dinner, Apple does not (it says dinner but that's only for HWE and after 7PM)
* Adobe allows remote work, Apple will go in person in April
* Other than that, around the same benefits

So my dilemma is that in all honesty, I'm tired of grinding and I kind of want to cruise. However, since I got Apple I finally felt this spark that I ""made it."" A lot of people keep telling me that I should go for Apple because it's part of a FAANG, that it will help open doors for me in the future, and because it's really hard to get a job at Apple. However, I feel like the same applies for Adobe. You don't see many SWEs at Adobe, it's a software first company (Apple is a hardware first), pay is better, and you work remotely.

At Apple, I feel like if I worked there I'd be walking on eggshells most days. My manager seems really nice but I don't work with them directly. At Adobe my team seems very warm and welcoming. I have a good relationship with the director of my group and my direct engineer is an older man who seems nice and laid back. Additionally, my Adobe director said they're very open to letting me wear many hats and that if by the end of the internship I want to pursue, for example, Product Management they'd fully support me. Apparently they had helped the last intern transition into a PM role after realizing they didn't like coding.

Overall, I don't know if I'm letting my feelings get in the way of my career decisions. I feel like with Adobe I could have a chill summer and a return offer. However, with Apple I feel like I'll be grinding again for a return offer but the outcome is having FAANG on my resume and standing out more to recruiters. Apple seems like the obvious route for my career but Adobe just seems safer. Am I being stupid? I can't tell if I'm considering the ""easier route"" of interning with Adobe because I'm burnt out or if it's truly the better offer.

Please help a homie out I'm pulling my hair out :("

I am 24 yo computer science grad with 1 year of experience and a couple of internships. I've been working at this company based out of England for the past 1 year. The pay is pretty OKAY (not too good, not bad) and the office environment is pretty descent tbh, everyone is understanding and helpful, not too much workload/pressure. I've read people here go on about how miserable and toxic their work places are and the overtimes. That's not the case with me. I have a pretty descent job environment. The work/task can be quite challenging sometimes (since M a fresher) but overall my seniors are quite helpful and I don't get too strict deadlines.

The problem is: I am growing sick of it. I don't know why I just find things very boring and redundant. My typical tasks include API development and sometimes front end as well. Not too long ago I was very passionate about building cool projects and learning new things. I don't know why/how job has sucked out the passion in me.  Earlier I would find time to learn new technologies and work on side project. Now watching the computer screen is the last thing I feel like doing in my free time.

I've always been interested in computing, so I'm planning on applying for a Master's (Conversion) in Computer Science as a next step after I graduate. I had orignally planned to do my Bachelor's in CS in the first place, but I changed my mind about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any suggestions for how I can get ready for the course, and improve my chances of employment afterwards, while I'm still completing my current degree? I'm in Second Year so I have another 2 1/2 years. So far my practical coding experience has mainly been statistical modelling with R and Python, more scripting than programming really. I'm also familiar with HTML, CSS, and JS at a more basic level. I'm planning to do the CS50 course when I have a little more time after my summer exams.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I could get an internship (even unpaid) for next summer so I can gain some practical experience to help me land a job after the Master's? (Or maybe I'm thinking too far ahead.)

I signed a contract a few months back stating I'd be here until May.

5 months after signing the contract (the company and landlord were recommended to me by a 3rd party who had arranged my accomodations and internship), I asked if I could shorten it until the end of April, since they make you pay for the full month, and I'll be leaving the 21st of April. 

However, they refused claiming that I had to find someone to take over the contract and room I live in. They've however let my friend (who is also my roommate) shorten it, as well as a different roommate who was supposed to stay longer shorten it to 1 month because she was leaving to Portugal.

I've been too scared to complain since they tend to keep our deposit if we do, which was 300 euros.

I live in a small apartment with 6 others. We've had a record of having 8 roommates, despite only having 1 bathroom with 1 toilet and shower, and 1 kitchen. There are no En suite rooms and only 4 bedrooms in total, which all aren't too big either.

Can I sue them for this? Any legal advice?"

With that being said, I have worked for a couple small family owned companies before with great experience in one, but one of them I was an intern, so-to-speak, and when work got slow I was dropped.  I can’t afford that to happen now that my wife stays home and we have a child.

Since graduating I've been working mostly in the industrial automation field w PLCs and DCSs, but am not super happy or fulfilled. The work isn't particularly interesting, and the significant travel to industrial sites has become a major turn off for me.

Alternatively, I took a couple of computer science courses (basics like CS1/CS2 w Python/Java) in the later years of undergrad out of pure curiosity, and I enjoyed them - to the point where I didn't mind spending hours on the homework(s) or projects to figure things out. I'm not totally sure what direction I want to move in the next step of my career at this point, but I'm leaning towards pursuing more education in the CS landscape. I find myself feeling jealous of people whenever they talk about their jobs in tech and kind of dream of a similar role (and maybe this will sound absurd to people in tech haha) - but because of that, my gut feel is that this is the direction I should go.

With that said, I think the next step is pursuing further education. In my inexperienced eyes, I see a few possible paths - either apply to a Master's program, or a coding bootcamp. A Master's program is a bit more of a commitment, from both a time and money sense, while a bootcamp is cheaper, and faster (although I'm sure pretty relentless and fast paced). I feel like at this point, its a bit premature to assume this is what I want to do, and to apply to a Master's program and spend $50-100K on a degree. Could anyone provide advice or resources on what they would recommend or what research they would conduct prior to making a decision? I've thought about trying to get an internship in the field before I commit to further education but I think that would be difficult to land w no experience or degree. And on top of all this, I don't yet know what subdivision of CS I would like to specialize in (Data Science, Web Dev, UX/UI, or perhaps (somewhat non CS) Software Eng). Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated, thanks!"

t8uisz,1,2022-03-07,Help on applying,hamb0ne35,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/t8uisz/help_on_applying/,"Hello,

Been thinking of trying to get an IT audit position at pwc, I’m having a bit of a tough time deciding what to do though. I have 2 years of experience in business valuation and forensic accounting at a small firm I’ve been at since I was a junior in college, so some of the time is as an intern and some as a full time associate (8 months). 

My issue is that I seem to fall between the lines of someone who would have to apply to an entry level position which I’m not so sure I want to do since it has such defined starting period that are months or years in the future. 

Could anyone shed some light on what my pathway would have to be?"
t8vuiy,0,2022-03-07,Should I accept a grad school admit if I can’t find a job?,Terminatorns19,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/t8vuiy/should_i_accept_a_grad_school_admit_if_i_cant/,"Hey y’all. So I graduated from a really good undergrad engineering program about 2 years ago. I’ve been trying (and failing) to find an engineering job since then. Really, any job since then, and I actually now have 1 non-STEM job offer on the table and I might have at least 1 lab tech interview coming up. I know it’s my fault, just gonna get that out of the way. I’ve botched the whole job search, and I probably botched a lot of things in college.

But I decided to apply to grad schools for this fall, and to my surprise, I got in to USC’s Astronautical Engineering MS. It’s a great program and I’m really excited, but obviously expensive as hell. I applied by the scholarship deadline, so I’m hoping I’ll get some funding from that, but of course I can’t guarantee it. I would defer admission, but USC doesn’t offer that. Instead, I’d “update my application” to a new semester and risk not getting in again.

My calculus is this: I basically have a 2-year gap on my resume. Ideally, I could fill that with a job or get an engineering job now to make up for that. But having a 2-year gap makes it even harder to find a job, whereas with grad school I already have an admit. My biggest fear is that I go to USC, do everything right this time - get involved in clubs, leadership, internships, better grades, everything - and it still doesn’t make a difference. But I don’t really know how else to get myself out of this rut.

I’m willing to do whatever it takes to pay for school, don’t get me wrong. And I’ll do whatever it takes to get into an engineering job, provided that I know I’m actually going *somewhere*. I just need to know if going back to school is the better option at this point.

I have some time to decide, so I’m looking for *any* jobs at this point to at least help save up before I potentially go. Any thoughts?"

I’m a freshman in engineering and I slacked off this semester bad. I’m doing CS and I don’t thinks possible for me to pass my intro to data structures class at this point, which is leading me to consider taking a W. How bad does this look? Do employers care if I have a W for internships and such? I’m incredibly disappointed in myself as I was on the deans list the previous semester and now I’m failing a class."

I made it past the first video interview stage and have been scheduled a 45 minute final(?) interview with the hiring team.

t8wxel,1,2022-03-07,how do i plot a career path after a internship as a product analyst in the enterprise cybersecurity division at a major financial firm,dwaynewade635246,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/t8wxel/how_do_i_plot_a_career_path_after_a_internship_as/,"HI everyone, so I was able to secure a role as a product analyst intern within the enterprise cybersecurity division of a major financial firm. The interviewer made it known that I would be working specifically with doing systems analysis of cloud utilization. So now I'm just trying to figure out how best to use this as a springboard to careers like cloud engineer, devops engineer, cloud solution architect, solution engineer, or even security engineer. I'm a junior and am currently going through my networking course and planning on getting my ccna at the end of the semester and then I may either try for the cissp over the summer or the aws certified cloud practicioner cert. I'm also going through codepath's ios course so I'm going to have an app on the app store before the summer and then im gonna deploy it on aws as my summer project. Anything else you guys recommend?"
t8xf9b,3,2022-03-07,How to find a job that I'd actually like?,some_dummy_account,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/t8xf9b/how_to_find_a_job_that_id_actually_like/,"So before I get to the question, I'd figure that some background is necessary. 

I have a bachelors in biology and currently working on a masters in teaching, and I've realized that I absolutely hate being a teacher. (In fact, the main reason I went down this path was because I thought I was going to get married, which just shows how dumb it can be to make decisions out of love.) And before I decided to work on this degree, when I was finishing my bachelors, I realized that I absolutely hated research. In fact, the only reason I picked biology was because my parents suggested it. I didn't really care to study anything. So really it was an option of self-preservation, not interest. 

My greatest fear ever is that I'll be forced to stay in a job for the rest of my life that I won't even tolerate but hate, and that I'll waste a significant chunk of my life for forty years doing something I never cared about in the first place. And while I've been doing my internship, I've come to understand just how much time I'd lose at home for my hobbies, to the point where I could only nourish one or not even any, all to make a steady paycheck. I don't see that as thriving. But when I told my dad my concerns, he gave me the reply of, ""that's what you do in a profession."" I should add that my dad was a high school teacher for thirty years, and I had committed a grave error in thinking I could ever follow in his footsteps. Furthermore, I've had the misfortune of growing up in a family that nurtured the ""college or McDonalds"" dichotomy. 

Now education-wise, I can afford to do one more degree. I was thinking of doing a masters in biology, but I don't know exactly what I would do with it. It's nothing to me but an empty motion that would buy me more time to think what I would actually want to do. But I'm scared that all that would happen is that I'll just get my degree and I'll still feel like I have to commit to something, only to regret having made the choice. 

If it's worth anything, my hobbies right now are playing chess, learning a second language (German,) and playing violin/piano. 

I want to be able to contribute to society, but I have the misfortune of having a reward system that isn't really conducive to what would be conventional.

How should I go about this problem? I understand that a career decision is multi-faceted, but I appreciate any attempt to help me with this."

Both are OOS and cost is not a factor.

UW CS: Very close to my home state, and has an amazing Human-Computer Interaction program and major- which I am looking into double majoring with CS. Also I would probably assimilate pretty easily since I’m already from the PNW. However, I have heard things about the culture being cutthroat. 

UT Turing CS: Like the small and collaborative community of Turing Scholars, and also the internship opportunities and research connections that come with Turing. But there isn’t a Human-Computer Interaction major or that much work being done on it at UT, which is kinda a turn-off for me since that's the field I want to go into."

The infrastructure intern is at a small oil and gas software company. Seems like I would be mainly IT support 1 duties with some exposure to cloud/networking/security. This position wouldn't be remote.

The business analyst intern is at a very large government org. I'm currently in this role and have been doing it for a year. I got extended after my internship. It's project-focused but not super technical. Mainly creating project documents and acting as a coordinator. This position is fully remote.

Both roles have the potential to turn into full time jobs after I graduate. 

Just a few questions:

1. Is it better to diversify my experience as an intern or to just stay at the same role.
2. What has better earning potential and career stability, BA or Infrastructure specialist?
3. Based on the provided info, which one would you take?"

On the other hand Cisco is offering a Product Management internship where I am still awaiting further details about the location and other things. Given that Amazon is a much bigger name than Cisco, I am sure I will have a better shot during full-time recruitment. But Cisco is offering the haloed Product Management Internship title which is attractive in its own way.

TLDR:

I’m in the process of finishing up an undergrad in applied analytics but I’m looking for deeper skill sets in Data Engineering in a few specific areas.

Need recommendations for courses or certifications to learn data engineering, AWS and google cloud deployment. I have reviewed most of the links in the data engineering wiki that this thread has here. https://dataengineering.wiki/Learning+Resources. I was trying to find some sort of a group involvement setting rather than just isolated learning in front of my own keyboard by myself.


Full version:
I’m in the process of finishing up an undergrad in applied analytics with a 3.77GPA but I’m looking for deeper skill sets in Data Engineering in a few specific areas.

A bit of context about my skill level:
I spent 12 years in mechanical design/engineering then moved into finance because I loved analysis of data and finance was pretty easy for me. My schedule right now I am a full-time tutor, working on a start up but I only have classes two days a week so I have a fairly open schedule.

My computational stats Professor is brilliant as he has 25 years of experience in consulting and has a masters in bio stats from Berkeley and is in the process of finishing up a PhD. His coursework is very challenging but it feels like we’re doing real world stuff with everything from farming, pharma drug trials, analyzing social media to carpeting company marketing analytics

My data analytics professor has a masters from UC Davis in stats. I have two more semesters worth of courses with her and her emphasis: Build the same model in two different programming languages and be able to defend your reasons in a weekly discussion. Where we are encouraged to politely criticize and break down the other persons model if you can find a way to make it more efficient or that allows for upgrades

My Python is mostly self taught so it needs some engineering polish.

My algebra is pretty good but most of the models I’ve built are stuff from NLP textbooks and financial analysis models converted to python.

The main focus of what I have built and really enjoy is deploying Natural Language Processing, Financial Analysis, and implementing financial analysis to Fidelity/Vanguard/BlackRock trading.

I need to learn deeper skills for deploying models to AWS/Docker/Kubernetes using Python.

The other is taking requirements from a coworker who is say an MBA or marketing and understanding what they currently have to look forward at an AWS or google cloud solution with python/sql/spark/data bricks or Apache toolsets implementing that model.

I know this is a lot  of ground to cover but right now I’m seeing like free which is usually the lowest quality courses, to $1,500 to $6,500 for a micro masters that cover these areas.

0. As far as internships I’ve had one where I built a semi automated machine learning model for classifying gene expression and regulation. I worked as a student intern with archive data that was 200 years old. Then Covid hit and I couldn’t find a job last summer so I rebuilt and updated a financial analysis tool that automates the analysis of 35 stock markets of data, five different of instruments and customized analysis. So what used to take back office analysts a few weeks by hand is now done in like two minutes in python.

1. Will graduate in December with an undergrad in applied analytics.

2. I’m in the process of finishing up an online certificate at Stanford for SQL, SQL is still my biggest weakness and I have to constantly brush up on it because it’s counterintuitive to the way I think.

3. I’m considering getting an AWS Certification Cloud Practitioner. https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=sec&amp;sec=rmg&amp;d=3 then taking this AWS course/certification https://www.udemy.com/course/data-engineering-using-aws-analytics-services/

AWS has four levels foundational, associate,  professional and specialty, does anybody here actually have these and can give recommendations?

4. I am considering taking this MIT data engineering certification. cloudfront.net/brochures/mit-data-science-machine-learning-program-brochure.pdf

5. The university of Texas has a cloud computing certification looks like it has potential with hands on keyboard time in AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure… which I know Azure is 85% garbage but it’s still good to have that experience https://d9jmtjs5r4cgq.cloudfront.net/brochures/pgp-cloud-computing-brochure-utexas.pdf

t93tgz,2,2022-03-07,Do I go to graduate school or enter the workforce?,jetbits,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/t93tgz/do_i_go_to_graduate_school_or_enter_the_workforce/,"I **am a 22 year old computer engineering student who is about to graduate in May.**

I went into college as an open-option engineering major and eventually settled on computer engineering due to my interests in computers and tech. I've always been sort of lazy, *(found out I had ADHD in college)* and struggled making big decisions, so naturally, I have always deferred them until they make themselves, or I absolutely have to.

Recently, an opportunity to go to graduate school threw itself at me, after a friend who is in the masters program recommended me to his professor  who was looking for a research student. Long story short, after never planning to get my Masters, I spent the last 3 weeks applying and I now have a 99.9% chance of being able to get my masters in Electrical Engineering, while doing a paid research position for \~20 hours a week. My tuition would be remised and I believe the stipend would amount to around 30k a year.

I feel like this is an opportunity that is almost too good for me to refuse, but I am hesitant because school can be hard on me &amp; my body *(sleeping, managing ADHD, etc)*. I've applied to the school, and as I indicated, the professor really wants me for his research *(p2p cryptography related),* and I am basically guaranteed to get in with my grades &amp; recs.

I also want to mention that I failed to get an internship over junior year *(during covid)* and I feel that I am weaker position for the job market than some of peers *(although I have good capstone project experience)*. But it is extremely tempting to work as some of them have been able to land 75k-95k starting.

I am not sure if I want to pursue a career in the defense industry like some of my peers have, as this would require moving to northern New Jersey *(I live by the Jersey shore, and I kind of want to live at home for a little bit)*

Ultimately, I think I want to pursue a career in Big Tech or tech consulting, and I have always had the goal of starting my own company one day. Although I'm really not excited about more EE coursework that comes with the masters, I think that the professors background in cybersecurity and my subsequent research in cryptography might help me if I chose to pursue a job in cybersecurity/financial tech or at a big tech company.

**I also want to make a lot of $$$**. My GF grew up in a tough situation and I want to be able to give her the life she wants, and its also really important to me I take care of my parents. 

And with the rapid inflation happening, I would hope the salaries would adjust within 2 years, I just don't know if it's worth the risk of entering the workforce in 2 years, when the economic and political climate could be even worse than now. *(I hear that entering the workforce in a bad economy is bad for career earnings).* Also, there is the opportunity cost of missing two years of a \~60-80k salary, but some could be made up by the stipend.

I'm thinking my skillset might be better suited towards software/cybersecurity. I really just want something that is not monotonous and suits my ADHD personality, and am totally lost on whether I should pursue grad school or not, all my professors say yes, as long as you aren't paying, but I am unsure. 

My sister just moved out to the Bay Area and has told me how much computer engineers can make with just an undergraduate degree, so CA is not off the table. 

Any advice would be wholeheartedly appreciated."

Prior to the consultant job, I worked as a part-time intern at a different heavy equipment company than the one I'm currently at for nearly 2 years, year-round. 

I was hired as a consultant for my background in coding, data analysis, and modeling. When I started the job, it quickly became apparent that it wasn't a good fit. About a month in, I started looking for new roles. I used NO skills that I learned in school or my previous internship, and only copy and pasted in excel a few times a week. I am not exaggerating in the slightest, I really am not sure why they hired me in the first place. After 6 months I received a call back from my current company, and left the consulting job after 8 months.

I'm updating my resume, not because I'm already looking for something new, but because I want to have it just in case. Do I bother listing the consulting job? Would it look bad if I left this off and the employer found out from a background check?

But I'm so afraid that they might not like me.

I have terrible social anxiety and also ""high functioning"" depression, am relatively young compared to everyone else (22F), and also one of the only POC in this organization. I'm always nervous because everyone else ""gets"" each other whereas I have to either lie or explain.  I'm also SO awkward - I watched as one of my supervisors visibly cringe when I tried to have a conversation with her boss. I'm terrible at social cues or making jokes, and it seems that it's not appropriate for me to make jokes about my work whereas my superiors can make jokes about theirs so I'm just not sure what to talk about.

I'm also worried about being the egotistic, bratty new intern - I don't ask for help until I've tried everything since I'm not sure if I'm bothering people. I think my supervisor hinted that I was being egotistical today, by saying that there was no place for ego in a workplace. I've been thinking I was doing okay so far since I've asked and they said I was doing fine - but again, I'm not sure if my supervisors were cool with me today.

I'm worried I always come off as someone who is depressed and stuck in self pity all the time (which is honestly true) but I really need to NOT be that way at work so that I can do my best and get references in the future.

I've tried smiling all the time and not talking at all about my personal life - except for the fun parts. Today I admitted I had something going on recently and that was awkward and I stuttered through that because I'm a terrible liar. I kept nodding to show I was listening during conversations but everyone keeps thinking I'm saying ""yes"" so I've stopped doing that.

**I'm going to an in person party with the rest of my organization next week with my boss and I'm so nervous. I don't know what I should do or act at all. Any advice?**

**How does an ideal intern act? How should I act going on in my internship? Do you have any tips on making this whole thing easier?**"

I want to know that with this profile i am getting admission in some of universities of usa in master in cs programme.

Is it worth to risk money because I have less experience in working in IT. I have done internship for 6 months. I have spent my time in this process of going for education to Canada but now I am not liking because I am getting pg diploma which is same as I had study in past studies. That's why I was thinking of going to masters for usa or uk. I have wasted my year so i cannot do mca now in India because I will not getting in good colleges here.

I want to be successful as software engineer in future. I am practicing dsa and development thoroughly. It seems risky to go in usa as there is risk of not getting job and loosing  money.  In uk, they say it is tough to get a job as uk recruiters do not prefer international students. 

I really want to work in big tech companies like FAANG. I thought masters will help grow to get education and get a job. Even if i work hard no one will hire bca graduate in top tech companies.

What should I do ?

I’m so glad to have found this community. I’m currently in my second semester of working on my master’s for a type of creative arts therapy. I started fieldwork in January and I love it. I asked the coordinator for a psych placement and she set me up with a psychiatric hospital located not too far from me. 

My initial interest in the psych setting has turned into a burning passion. I was nervous going into it, as my undergraduate degree has nothing to do with therapy/counseling/psychology, so this is my first hands-on experience with clients. On my first day, the nerves went away. I felt so comfortable, loved talking to patients and being a listening ear, and we run several group sessions throughout the day which revolve around activities that the patients absolutely love, so my supervisor and I get a lot of “thank you”s and comments after the session telling us how helpful the activity was. This feedback reaffirms my gratitude to be working toward a career in this field. It’s good to feel like you’re doing something positive for someone.

This population in this facility is quite acute. A majority of our patients are there due to a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and many are admitted due to going off of their meds. I also live in the general vicinity of a very populated city, so many of the patients come from there. Many are homeless and/or on top of their disorder have dealt with a lot of trauma or general hardship. It’s a place where there’s never really a dull day—I’m sure many of you have been in similar settings. From day one I was very comfortable there. Even when patients are violent or threatening to the nurses or one another or are psychotic and saying unsettling things, I don’t mind. My fieldwork has been a deeply educative experience and I’ve connected with many wonderful people for whom I wish nothing but the best.

As I mentioned, I love psych. The type of therapy I’m doing has many applications with many populations that are very different from one another, but now that I have experienced psych and have connected so deeply to this area, I want to continue with it. I have a summer fieldwork placement in a more neurological area which I’m super excited for and I know will be a wonderful experience, but I’m looking for internship placements primarily in psych, preferably more acute facilities. My top choice that I’ve applied for is actually a prison where I would get a mixture of forensic psych and general correctional experience. So a bit different than where I’m at now but still certainly not the most fun and happy kind of place.

The big challenge and the reason I’m posting here is that every time I’m at my site, I learn more and more about the systems that have failed these patients and the challenges that they endure every day. In the short time that I’ve been there I’ve already seen a few patients discharged only to come back again just a few weeks later. I was aware that this would be the case with some patients, but I was surprised at how quickly I saw them again. My countertransference isn’t as severe as it once was, at least. In my first few weeks I felt very attached to every patient that I met, but the more that I met over time this issue went away. But on days when I am not at the site I think of things that happened that week or particular patients and I end up thinking myself into a total funk. My approach so far has aligned pretty firmly with humanism and on the plus side, I’ve never struggled with empathy or respect toward my clients. It comes naturally. Empathy is a big strength for me as a therapist, but it feels so heavy at times. My experience so far has really reshaped the way that I think about people and life and mental disorders. I’m more of a mental health advocate than ever. But it’s pretty damn hard to keep my own feelings in check.

My program is wonderful. My class is very tight knit and my professors are kind and supportive. We get a lot of time in class each week to talk about how things are going, and when I went on a spiel about this matter my professors validated what I am experiencing but cautioned me against letting my empathy, a powerful therapeutic tool, turn into sympathy, which isn’t very productive and can be kind of patronizing. I see a counselor of my own every few weeks and talked about this with her as well, to which she expressed a similar sentiment, cautioning against sympathy. 

I’m now more aware of it and can recognize when my thoughts and feelings are going in a direction that isn’t helpful to me and my developing practice. But I’m still not totally sure -how- to prevent my empathy from turning into sympathy. If you have been in this boat and overcome it, what helped you? General self care or something more specific? I’m sure it gets better over time, but was time alone enough for you or did you have to take specific steps to work on this as well? I want to stay in psych and I love this population, but I know I need to do some work on myself going forward to better manage my own reactions to the setting. I realize that to a degree, these feelings will remain, as it’s hard to avoid any sort of reaction when meeting patients in difficult situations. Most psych facilities are not happy places. I feel like I need to get this under control though. Thankfully I’m very good at maintaining my professionalism when I’m around patients so that is not really my concern, but I think it’s affecting my therapist self in the opposite way. I fear coming off as unprofessional so much that as a result, I think I come off as overly professional and there is actually more room for more authenticity.

Wow, I wrote a lot! Thank you if you read all of this, and thanks in advance to any who respond."

Despite NTU’s CS curriculum having been revamped recently, it seems that there are still a lot of strong opinions against NTU CS surprisingly. However, I really do not believe NTU CS to be that much inferior to NUS CS as people describe it to be, unless there are other factors such as better internship opportunities for NUS Computing students, or NUS having a grading system that would benefit students more.

1. Are internship opportunities for computing students better in NUS than NTU? Apparently internship could be more important than grades, because companies want somebody who can actually work?

2. I have heard of computing students in NUS going to silicon valley to work and do start ups, but what about NTU? Do these experiences that NUS offer put computing students in NTU at a huge disadvantage?

3. Other than the calibre of students, what could be the reasons as to why NTU CS has a lower average starting pay? (I’m not overly bothered about starting pay, but I’m I just want to find out as much as possible if NTU CS is really inferior to NUS CS)

4. Is NUS’s grading system more beneficial to students than NTU’s? Could anyone describe the grading system in NUS(eg. like how students can SU their mods in NUS). What about NTU?

5. If let’s say I were to ABA in order to get into NUS, what is considered as a good portfolio, in order to stand a good chance in getting through?"

I hope these finals weeks aren't too tough on you all. I need some advise about my graduation decision.

I am an international student in the Masters Computer Science program. Spring 2022 will be my 5th quarter at UCSD and is also when I was initially planning on graduating. I was doing research at UCSD in my entire first year (including summer so i didn't do an internship) and aiming to get into a PhD program. However, I think that is not going to happen and I am now searching for jobs (and it seems to be very late now?). 

I think at UCSD we can finish our degree in atmost 6 quarters. This means I can postpone my graduation till Fall 2022 and this should allow me to do an internship during the summer (CPT) which would help me get some work experience. Also, I've heard internships pay a decent amount and it should help me manage my tuition and rent for the Fall Quarter. Moreover, I think landing an internship should be easier than a full-time role.

I am a bit confused if I should extend my graduation and go with this internship route or if it's better to still graduate in Spring and somehow find a job?

Thanks for reading :)

Edit: How tough is it to find a job with a start date in December/January? I think most university programs end in March to June so that's when most full time jobs start."

Everyone here, as 7+ years of full Development. The period of the internship ranges from January to May. 

I'm having a blast learning everything but lately things went sour (I don't understand why) but it has to do something to having a mentor working with me and not having enough time to do other tasks, so my mentor and the team im in are very PISSED at me and mad.

Also might add, I had to learn react and typescript on my own within a month before starting. So things are a little but mininum acceptable level. 

The internship director (person in charge of controlling how my internship goes) told me the company has many nationality and the person that been most sour with me has had terrible reviews before and it's mostly likely due to their culture (é.g. I was told that in their country I would have been fired) 

I got bad reviews from my team and mentor to the point I was crying on my meeting. 
I feel like it has to do with my gender (i am the only woman in the development), my level of knowledge or the general culture of the company. 
I'm considering giving up my education and just go back to my old job. 
 
Bare in mind, I have an AP, I have about 7 months of software development for web based applications, barely backend or just notions really.

I'm a self-taught developer who has been studying for almost 2 years now. I focused on studying the fundamentals and getting familiar with different languages and platforms, and I loved the theoretical stuff behind everything. In a nutshell, I was studying more CS than just web development. 

Long story short, I have been interviewing for an internship as a ""MEARN Developer"" at this place. I went through 2 interviews at a reputable institute for this stuff, and then my final interview was at the place where I'll be getting the internship. During this interview, I met someone from the software team (didn't tell me which team, but now I guess it's DevOps) and the other person was from Talent Acquisition. The interview went well and I talked about the different things I learnt, the projects I worked on, the areas I'm interested in, and those that I'd like to strengthen. After the interview, the Talent Acquisition lead walked out with me and told me that he wants me for hiring and will take my resume to the team, but he needs to check with the institute that I applied through first then he'll reach out.

He called today, and we'll be meeting in 3 hours from now, but for a DevOps role. Through the call, he talked as if I don't know what DevOps is, so I know he isn't expecting that I'm an expert. I told him that I have a ""general overview"" of what it is, the 7 lifecycle stages, the methods, etc. And he said, as if surprised, ""Well, good, you even know about it!""

I don't know how they want to hire me for DevOps, if they're not expecting much from me? I'm a developer, and I've been in this because I love programming (actually writing programs, any programs), and I'm in love with Computers, basically. As far as I know about DevOps, the coding part isn't the main part of the job, and that's what's concerning me. And my knowledge in DevOps is theoretical, apart from the few tools I worked with in my personal project. I'm going to the interview anyway, and I'm glad someone appreciates my skills and passion for the field, but I wanted to take someone's input because the whole thing is a little bit weird. Thanks you for reading this far!"
t9dx2p,4,2022-03-08,Spanish new grad looking for jobs in Germany (Computer Graphics/Artificial Intelligence/Robotics),Due-Issue-6451,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/t9dx2p/spanish_new_grad_looking_for_jobs_in_germany/,"Hello! Thanks for stopping by at this post!

I'm a Spanish university student, and I would love to spend some time working in Germany when I graduate. I believe it would be an awesome experience, but I want to ask for some opinions about this topic on a Reddit thread.

A little bit of background, I'm currently studying for two undergraduate degrees at university. A Degree in Computer Engineering and a second Degree in Artificial Intelligence + Data Science. My university is not world-renowned, but it holds some relative prestige within my country (It's in the top 6-8 universities out of 88 universities within my country. 601-800 in the world). I also have to mention that before enrolling on my current studies, I coursed and completed three years out of four of another Degree in Computer Science in Computer Graphics. (Here degrees last 4 years)

I will be graduating at 24 years old. I have work experience of 2 years as a research assistant at my university in the fields of AI and Robotics. I also worked for 6 months at an internship in Data Science at a local company. In terms of languages, I speak fluent English and Spanish. Also, a bit of French and Japanese too. However, my german speaking abilities are still **quite** rough (I would love to improve it!). I believe (reading other comments online) that certain Software Development positions do not require it (while some others certainly do).

So I wanted to know my chances of getting hired by a German Company!

So, let me ask some specific questions...

1. Also, as said earlier, my main Fields of ""expertise"" are Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics. Are there good job prospects for those fields in Germany? Would it be easy for a foreigner to get into any of them?
2. How about the salary? Does it pay well?
3. How is the work culture for foreigners in Germany?
4. How is the quality of life for Software Engineering in Germany?
5. Do German Employers care from which university you come from? What would they think of an undergraduate from a university like mine? (I assume they will do some background check on it).
6. How could I improve my resume in the Eyes of German recruiters? Is there anything they particularly like?

Thanks a lot guys!"

After 20 years as a stay-at-home parent/housewife, I went back to school a few years ago and started taking classes at the local community college. I just completed a network admin certificate. 

My goal is to try to get back into contract IT technical writing and/or find a help desk or another IT support role that is remote or at least has flexible hours.

Since the network admin certificate isn't worth much, I've thought about continuing to complete the  associate's degree. That would require only 4 more courses and an internship. 

However, given that I'm new to IT and still lacking foundation skills like PowerShell and bash scripting, SQL, publishing and graphics tools, etc., I'm wondering whether I just should skip the AAS and instead take individual classes. Going this route would give me more skills in my toolbox as well as keywords on my resume.

Anybody want to comment or offer suggestions? Thanks!"

In my experience it provides more access to internships and mentoring as well as networking opportunities. Also look for cyber related clubs or groups associated with your school. There are also CTFs and hackathons specific for students. These can provide skills building, networking and was to better connect with other students or peers. 

As a student you may be entitled to reduced or reimbursable fees to conferences, certs or other programs. The library my have free accounts to other online learning platforms. 

Use any school specific social media platforms to connect with fellow students and faculty. I know for me in doing an online program, the connections thru Slack or class boards helps make the experience more fulfilling and less like just watching Youtube. These connections may also help you in finding opportunities. 

I know that being in school is already hectic, but hopefully you can find some extra benefits from your education to insure your success in cyber. 
Good luck."

I go to a large T50 state school. Respectively, my GPA was 3.8 and 3.5 for each season (rough online semesters with COVID, but I figured a 3.5 shouldn't be low enough to warrant immediate rejections for most places anyway), for the current season I had a prior internship at a well-funded SaaS startup, a few thousand lines of open-source contributions, and 2 publications in CS-adjacent fields.

I've had my resume edited by my mentors at that internship (ex-FAANG) as well as people in my research group. I ended up with a total of &lt;10 first-round interviews, and ultimately one offer.

Comparing this to my success with referrals/""networking"":

Across 12 referrals, I received first-round interviews for all but 2. I ended up ""only"" getting 2 offers, but they were at much better companies compared to the singular cold-application success, and still is a MUCH higher rate of success.

I don't understand why people still suggest putting any time into cold applying, especially when almost everyone can at least get a referral to somewhere like Amazon if they go to a decently large school."

&amp;#x200B;

I am nearly 26 years old and I graduated in 2019 with a Computer Science degree. I am located in Canada. While doing my degree, I had internships working in QA roles. I got hired in a developer role right after graduation. I worked in that position for a little under two years. To be candid, I did not make the most of my time there and I did the bare minimum that was required for the role. Consequently, I feel like I didn't learn as much as I could or should have. I primarily worked in java and worked on fixing bugs in an a large software project. The work itself was okay, I take full responsibility for not taking my job as seriously as I should have. I moved across the country and found a new job working as a Technical Support Engineer. I have been in my current position for 7 months so far and I can say I thoroughly do not enjoy it. My main issue with my current role is the lack of direction and documentation on the issues we receive from customers. I have learned that I do not enjoy interacting with customers. In hindsight, I feel a bit regretful about taking a job which was not development work, but I was in need of a job so I could support myself in a new city.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking it might be time to start applying for new jobs. My problem is that I simply feel like I don't know anything. I often see it suggested that people in this field work on personal projects and build up a portfolio. I am willing to do this but I feel it's hard to find the time while also working full-time. I could dedicate some time to studying / practicing coding daily, but I worry that I would need a long time before I would have anything meaningful to show. I feel I am in an awkward spot where I am familiar with a lot of coding concepts given my work experience and my degree, so I am far from a beginner. But also, I am rusty and there are large gaps in my knowledge, so I don't feel like I have the ability to build anything meaningful presently. I don't know where I should go to learn more and practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I know that I put myself in this position to begin with and I accept that, but I'm just looking for advice on the best way to get myself back on track to a developer job for my situation. Should I commit to building up my development experience and force myself to stick with my current job that I loathe for the intervening months until I can land another dev job? Are there any alternatives? Should I just try to get a job with my current work experience? Any input is welcome, thanks in advance."

**LAPTOP QUESTIONNAIRE**

**hi, so I'm fairly new to the world of computers and programming. I used to be a creative type, worked in marketing, but recently found myself in an internship as a jr full stack dev and I'm really enjoying it. only problem is, my current laptop is NOT holding up to the job. it's a refurbished thinkpad I got I wanna say a year ago(?) but can't really remember, for about 500 bucks CAD. it's worked ok for when I was just watching netflix and sending emails, but since I started the new job it has been basically breaking down on me. the battery is completely dead and will die in an hour if I'm watching netflix, and if I'm doing any actual work it will die in minutes if it isn't plugged in. the laptop itself is slow and lags heavily, which causes problems whether I'm coding, googling, using zoom, or even just watching videos. the trackpad also completely sucks, it's painfully unresponsive and constantly causes problems when I'm trying to click on something or right-click on something, it always manages to do the opposite, if it responds at all. the screen is pixelated and dark, and the speakers are utter shit. despite me shitting on it, this laptop has been fantastic value for the price, but it's no longer suited for my needs and I desperately need a new one before this one craps out on me completely while I'm starting a new job. only problem is, I know nothing about laptops and I don't know what the best laptop for me is, and since they're expensive, I figured I would ask this community of smart and knowledgeable people for some recommendations to help start my search in the right direction :) thanks so much in advance!**

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**  
 I don't have an explicit budget, I'm not sure what a good price for a good laptop is, vs overpaying, vs not spending enough for the quality I'm looking for. I'm willing to pay for quality, but I'm also pretty young (22) and coming from an arts field so I don't have buckets of money to drop for the World's Greatest Laptop. I genuinely don't know what a good budget range is for what I'm looking for, although I'm sure it will be expensive, definitely want as cheap as possible.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**  
 I currently have a refurb and it's breaking after about a year of use, so I think I want something new. but if you can recommend a high-quality refurb/used, I would be open to it, especially if that makes it cheaper
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**  
 battery life is one of the most important things for me right now. I currently have a laptop with a dying battery that won't stay charged for more than 1hr. it is so annoying and inconvenient, I am constantly panic-scrambling for a charger during zoom meetings and it breaks my focus to constantly be running up and down stairs and scrambling for a charger when I'm in the middle of something.  2-in-1 would be cool, but it's not necessary. performance and build quality should be high, obviously.
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**  
 not super important, obviously the lighter the better, as I know someone who had an alienware laptop and she could not take it anywhere bc it was just painfully thick and heavy. But, I would much rather have enough ports, a really strong battery, top computing power, and a durable piece of hardware, than a super light or thin machine. also, those really thin ones freak me out, I always feel like they'll break if I look at them wrong or something. I am not a gentle person by any means, so I need something durable enough to take a few bumps and keep going. the thinkpad has actually been really fantastic for that since it's made out of plastic.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**   
 n/a
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**   
 yes, I use a wide variety of CAD software, and also do a lot of programming. for CAD, I use fusion360 and OpenSCAD, for coding, I use VSCode and a fuckton of plugins and packages that tend to make my current laptop lag heavily. I'm not much of a gamer but I definitely want to reduce lag as my current laptop lags heavily, even just when opening a firefox page, and it's so annoying.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**  
 I'm not much of a gamer
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable  build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good  input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**   
Keyboard:  I have a strong preference for the thinkpad keyboards, mostly because I just don't know enough about laptops to know any other brands that have such strong and comfortable keyboards with the quality and haptic feedback that I'm looking for. I really really really like the haptic feedback, and the thinkpad ones are just so comfortable. plus that little red mini-cursor is awesome, too. that's not a requirement if there's a better brand, but I'm definitely looking for a keyboard similar to the one on my current T460. 
* track pad: the only problem with the thinkpad I have is that the touch pad is the worst. it's not sensitive and it's constantly giving me the wrong clicks, or I need to click it like five times for it to respond. so I would like a more responsive trackpad. 
* build quality: obviously I want something built well. bonus points if it's repairable (aggressively scowling at apple)
* touch screen: I would like to have a touch screen, but it's not necessary by any means. but it's always nice, as I really like how interactive it is to just touch things with my fingers, especially on a laptop since I hate using trackpads.
* optical drive: I don't know what that is, so I'll assume I don't need it. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable will correct me if I'm wrong.
* fingerprint reader: don't care. that would be cool ofc, but it's definitely not a need
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**  
 I definitely need SSD and a decent graphics card, but for all the rest of the innards I have absolutely no idea what to look for, so some recs there would also be amazing if those aren't already being taken into consideration. thank you so much for your help!"

There are a lot of factors in this story but I don't know anyone in the industry so I could use some help.

I am a 2020 graduate of a public top-100 university, B.S. in CS, B.A. in Math. My GPA was only a couple hairs above 3.00 because I actually switched into CS after doing poorly as an engineering student. I worked as a TA for a couple CS courses, was part of a research team in the CS department, and won a school hackathon, so it wasn't all bad there for me.

I never received a summer internship in undergrad, which was incredibly demoralizing, but maybe to be expected as my family lives in the middle of nowhere and has no connections. It damaged my confidence severely as I watched my peers get internships with huge companies, some even at FAANG. I distanced myself from them out of embarrassment and only have a few people from my program I could reasonably connect with.

Graduating into the pandemic was horrifying and I ran into yet again the same story of not being able to secure work. By January 2021, I basically gave up on applications after hundreds of rejection letters and decided to work on some projects to bolster my resume, namely a portfolio website and some CS blog posts. I re-entered the job market and the only job offer I was given was for shares in a niche company that was likely never going public. I needed money desperately and couldn't accept those terms.

By June 2021, I had gone all-in on grad school as an alternative, to try and gain more experience and build a network that I missed out on in undergrad, but I didn't get into any schools, either, which crushed me.

Now I am facing a number of scary financial hurdles coming up: the loan un-freeze, state governments calling to collect for unemployment benefits from the early pandemic, a depleting savings account, and my partner about to start grad school as well, losing an income stream for us as she quits her job. I am still applying to jobs, getting minor interest from employers before getting dropped for more qualified candidates.

I feel like damaged goods. My confidence is completely shot and I truthfully don't even know what I should be spending my time on. Should I try to pick up new skills? Should I refocus my efforts on grad school applications? Should I contribute to open-source projects to make up for my lack of work experience? I feel shut out from this industry and I don't feel like I deserve this. I want to turn this around, but I can't grasp what I should prioritize at this stage.

What should I do?"

I am unsure on which one I should take. The ConocoPhillips offer is in a different city and I’ve never lived away from my parents. 

The pay for both is the same but with WSP I would be working long hours, which I enjoy working, resulting in probably double the net money.

However with the ConocoPhillips the role is very Project Management oriented, and gaining experience in that area could really be useful for my career because I plan on going into project management. 

Also with WSP I will be in a more senior position, and will mainly be in charge of myself, which a really nice pro.

I understand during co-op terms you should get as much varied experience as possible, and this is why I am unsure on what to do. Also moving to a different city would probably effect my relationship with my girlfriend, currently we’re semi long distance, as in I am not able to see her very often in person cause she lives far from me. But if I take the ConocoPhillips offer we’ll be fully long distance and I won’t be able to see her at all. 

I genuinely don’t know what to do, I would appreciate some opinions."

I’m not sure if I should commute as well now that I’ve been placed in a more financially difficult situation or if I should  still stick to living on campus. 

If I were to commute I would have to take a bus to NYC and then take the train at NY Penn which when I tried before took about 2 hrs one way, meaning I would take 4hrs total. (There is a train that departs from Secaucus which is better, but getting a ride there isn’t possible and ubering there costs $20 one way) Honestly, if there’s anyone who commuted from Bergen county to Rutgers via car I would be more than glad to pay half the toll, the gas it takes to get here, and half the semester parking permit but I assume that it that would be super rare to find someone from Bergen county who commutes via car. 
My parents say that the $300 unlimited monthly student pass (bus &amp; rail) seem worth over the $8-10k housing, but when telling others my situation, they strongly suggested I take out a loan no matter what and work in the summer to earn the extra funds.
But taking a loan out is something that I’ve been avoiding to the extent that I went against attending rutgers and would’ve chosen any other school at a slightly lower academic ranking because of the financial aid that I was offered. And even if I do take out loans, it would probably only cover half the housing since parent plus loans aren’t an option for me. Although I haven’t found a summer internship yet, it would also mean I wouldn’t have the time to fully devote my time to it.

**
Financially, my parents help pay for housing and the meal plan because my grants cover everything else.
I also work 7hrs/week for work-study which is enough to cover my potential commuting costs meaning I wouldn’t have any financial losses.
**

Current Options:

Commuting (public transportation)—$300/month ($2,700/9 months)

Housing—$8k-10k/9 months

1. Has anyone tried commuting 3-4 hrs? 
2. Do you prefer saving the money over time or time over money to the extent of taking out loans? 
3. What seems to be the better option?"
t9p1ix,2,2022-03-08,[Visa Issues] From no OPT to H1B - how hard is it?,lilililyyue,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/t9p1ix/visa_issues_from_no_opt_to_h1b_how_hard_is_it/,"Hi all,

Not sure if this is the correct place to pose my questions since my situation might be a bit unusual, but I am truly grateful for everyone who reads my post or offer any solution, if possible. 

**In a nutshell, my question is - how willingly is an employer to sponsor a MBA candidate who does not have an OPT after graduation? I am talking about big IB/consulting where I get a return offer from summer internship. Or, how hard is it to get a big IB/consulting firm to sponsor you if you simply apply and switch job?**

Details begin here -&gt;

I am on a G4 diplomatic visa now since I work for an international organization (G4 is kind of the special H1B for us). I am looking for career change and would like to go for a MBA program to switch to IBD/PE/HF work. However, I already used my OPT from my previous master program, so I couldn't get another OPT after graduation (possible a wrong move I know, but I need to deal with what I have now:(....)

Now, in my case, getting into a M7 MBA program shouldn't be too difficult, but the visa thing really got me anxious af. I think along the line, my best shot of staying in the U.S. is that I could still use my CPT for summer internships and such, get a return offer, and directly ask my employer to sponsor H1B and enter the lottery. However, this alone sounds like a very risky way to go about it, let alone I think less employers - even the big IB or consulting firms - are less willing to sponsor you, esp when you do not have OPT as a backup plan.

I am wondering if any of you has been in a similar situation before - no OPT and directly ask for H1B sponsorship. I have reached out to MBA program admission and ask if there are similar cases, and I am still waiting for responses. 

Given that the reason of going to MBA is to secure the job, I do not want to waste time/money if the visa thing is a dead end at the beginning, so I also want to know how hard it is to directly ask for H1B if I simply apply, interview, and get the offer at IB or consulting (presumably harder, but I at least I want to ask in case this applies to a broader audience who may know the answer).

Final words -&gt;

Many thanks for anyone who finishes reading. If you are going through a anxious H1B lottery or worry about visa issues, I would hope my case at least offers you some comfort, given that you are already in the process but I am nowhere close to it.

Have a good one:)"

I am about 2/3 years complete towards my Bach's in software development, and so far my experience with the school has been.... sub-par. I am currently in the process of applying/interviewing for a few internships, one including a popular FAANG company, and looking at the coding assessments I have come to realize that I have been taught HORRIBLY. 

No, I am not making this an excuse to say I am not taking the time to learn, I mean the majority of my classes have been quite literally ""Copy and paste this code to see how it works in the console"" followed by ""just look at the code and study it"". I am not actually being taught step by step how to create certain things, such as various data structures/algorithms. I have had every class available when it comes to data structures/algorithms, I have a 4.0, but I still couldn't even complete many/all of these sample coding assessments that I am seeing. 

I guess what I am getting at is, should I save my money and look to be taught elsewhere, whether it's a bootcamp or a different university, or should I just gamble with what I have and try to finish this school? It is getting to the point where it is drastically affecting my mental health, and my bank account is definitely starting to suffer. And if there are any current DeVry students or alumni, what has your opinion been of the school and teaching methods?"

I go to a state school that's not very well know outside of California. I'm graduating in spring of 2022 (this semester) and have around a 3.1 GPA in Computer Science. For the last 7 months, I've been an devops intern for a small company and have a job lined up for after school. I have a decent amount of extracurriculars, side projects, and have done particularly well in my later semesters. The thing is, I want to explore my options (Potentially a job at a well know tech based company) and am looking for advice on the best way to do that.

My first question is, how can I actually get interviews with large tech companies. I'm not necessarily  just looking for FAANG or a Unicorn, but older tech companies like IBM, Intel, or any company who's product is tech based and well know. (Basically looking for the fastest way to get a name brand on my resume early on in my career). I've only applied to about 5 internships in the past and have gotten 3 interviews but they weren't as competitive as I'd image a well-know tech product based company would be. I don't want to waste too much time and am trying to look for the best things to do or put on my resume to at least give me the chance to talk to them. My side projects were mostly in Django, I have quite a few work based projects (know Kubernetes, Ansible, Azure/AWS), but was also curious if I should work on learning React/Next, Node, or other popular tools. Was also wondering if certs would help in this?

Second, I wanted to know the best way to study for these interviews. I'm aware of tools like leetcode/hacker rank, have been reading cracking the coding, and have been researching the behavioral side of the process as well. Is there anything else I might want to be aware of? Possibly reaching out directly to recruiters/current employees of these companies? Especially since FAANG isn't my top priority? Thank you!"

As a 22 years old young human being, I can't live as I want. And I'm one of the lucky ones as living with a middle class family.

Prices on EVERYTHING changes so fast and even the supermarket workers can't keep up. Oil is running out of stock. Imagine buying an 1L olive for 90 dollars. The deal is not buying oil etc. I's about buying any basic need. Cheese is a luxury right now.

Getting out for eat is a luxury. Even fast food restaurants are have crazy high prices. One big mac menu is 53 turkish liras. Imagine having burger, fries and a drink for 53 dollars. Taking a coffee from a coffee shop is luxury. Having a simple americano costs 20₺ (turkish liras symbol is ₺) I don't even want to talk about the aromatized coffee prices I literally can't have them.

I don't even want to start with the technology products prices. Getting a simple smartphone is consedering as a luxury. Old people always like ''You say the life is too expensive but you're using smartphone.'' like what? Young people always arguing with the old people in the streets who's supporting government.

I worked along the summer for intern salary (in 2021 it was 750 turkish liras) for 6 days and 10 hours at a touristic state and I kept watching the foreigners having the life in 2 hours that I can't have for 22 years. Since the turkish liras value is so much low for dollar (15$ = 1₺), euro(1€ = 16₺) and sterlin (1£ = 20₺)

My only lux is having cola zero and that's it. I want to live, travel, see, know, taste. I just want to start my business by saling cupcakes but I can't afford to make them regulary. We just paid 500₺ for the electric bill as 3 membered family living in a apartment. Businesses as restaurants, beauty salons can't afford the bills and hartal. Imagine you have to pay 800-1000 dollars to fill your car full.

And if you say one bad thing about that spesific person who ''runs'' this country, you basically going to jail. Welcome to free minded Turkey :)

I just want to afford my vitamin pills. I just want to buy a simple sock without thinking 10 times on it. I just want to live like the other young. I just want to scream so loud. I can't. I feel so empty. I have no will to live. I feel rotten. I just cried at the market by looking at a peanutbutter jar's price. I don't feel ok. I barely can afford a therapist and already feel much more stressed by paying every session. I don't know what to do, how to live..."

My previous experience was at a very small firm where tax season was definitely busy but nothing like it is here. Don't get me wrong, I am more than grateful to have the chance to intern here, but I feel like I bit off more than I can chew.

Every week we have these meetings where all the interns basically explain what work they are doing for the week. At the beginning of the term everyone else had much more work than I did so I thought I was getting left behind. From that point I basically took everything that was offered to me, no matter what. 

This past meeting everyone else had normal hours and normal workloads and they were saying how they would even be open to taking more work. Then when it was my turn and I explained how Im working these insane hours, everyone else was saying how their situation is the opposite of mine.

At this point in March, I am hitting 10-11 hour days every weekday as well as around 5 hours on both Saturday and Sunday. This is probably nothing to the rest of you, but coming from somewhere where the most I had to work was maybe 50 hours a week, this is insane. I don't even feel like I'm learning anything because its just constant deadline after deadline and in order to meet them I am putting out subpar work.

In February when I was not overwhelmed I was constantly praised on how well I am doing, but now I feel like I am letting my teams down when I put out subpar work. In the beginning I felt that I was actually learning and was super happy with where I was. But now its the opposite.

For the first time in my life I am feeling anxious. All I think about all day is how I am going to meet deadlines at work. It could be the weekend, after work, etc. you name it, im worrying about work.

There is light at the end of the tunnel because for the end of March, I am put on a team where I will be doing the same kind of work I did at my old internships, so I am confident in my skills in that.

So I guess my question is should I bring this up with my coach, or should I just stick it out?

Not getting in the second time made me realize that maybe CS wasn't my thing and the counselor recommended me to take philosophy or the humanities instead to get my act together (about to be suspended but I petitioned).

t9x8f1,10,2022-03-08,Kicked out of my Student Teacher placement with less than two months to go,lovelybb00,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/t9x8f1/kicked_out_of_my_student_teacher_placement_with/,"Hello everyone, today I found out that I was getting taken out of my placement at an elementary school. I knew that it wasn’t going too well but I didn’t know that my CT (cooperating teacher) wouldn’t want me to come back 9 weeks into the program. I was shocked. Me and my CT are very different, her previous intern was exactly like her so they got along well. She is very preppy and strict about many things, she doesn’t like people who are different than her and I can tell. She even complained about how quiet I was around her when I first met her. 
That being said, my CT first complained about me not talking to her enough, which is odd because when I did try to talk to her she only gave me a one word response or didn’t try to continue the conversation so naturally I tried not to bother her but tried my best to make random conversations. My supervisor told me I should suck up to her, buy her things that she likes, yet before my placement my supervisor told us to not be too friendly with our supervisor as we are not “ best friends” 
Then, my CT complained I overstepped directions which I had no clue that I was doing this. She claimed that she told a student to do something and I told the student to do something opposite and it upset her that I did that. But keep in mind, it was my full day of teaching and the CT was told not to intervene. So ofc I gave the directions but I also didn’t know she had already given the student directions. I asked my CT to explain when I actually did that, but she did not give me a time of when I did despite me asking to help myself grow. 

My supervisor says that I teach too slow and that my teaching isn’t confident enough. So I sped things up, and became more confident despite the negative vibes I kept getting. 
During the meeting they said that I only amplified my teaching when my supervisor was observing me but it’s odd because my CT gave me high marks and praise during her observation of me, and another professor watched me and gave me high praise too. How does that make sense? Why is my supervisor saying I’m doing a bad job and why does my CT agree when my CT gave me high praise on her formal observation? My supervisor tried to talk to the substitute “paraprofessional” who is in the class with me at certain times, but the paraprofessional said that I was too stern however the paraprofessional is hardly ever in the room and the para is still a college student who is filling in for another paraprofessional, another teacher told me not to talk to this paraprofessional too much because the she was on probation for making other teachers upset and for being on her phone too much, so that meant no one like me should associate with her but yet my supervisor was taking notes from her about me. Me being too stern was taken to heart because I would never want to be the “mean teacher” and I’ve always been sweet to my students so I backed off but then I was told that I wasn’t stern enough???

I want to mention that I am a senior and this is my last semester, I have never had a problem with a previous CT and they all said I was a nice girl who taught well. I never had low marks regarding myself or my teaching so tell me, is this fair? Does this make sense? 
I have no idea what to do because I don’t have money to do another semester since I’m on financial aid and loans. I had planned things for after graduation such as job opportunities and now I can’t do them because my school won’t allow me to go to another placement since there is only two months left. Can someone give me advice? I feel so alone. I loved those kids and I never even got to say goodbye. One of the supervisors told me that I should join disability services and blamed my anxiety on the way I taught but again I never had these problems in my other placements because of my anxiety AND the only reason my anxiety would flare up is when my supervisor was around or when my CT would stare me down during a lesson because I knew that she was giving me negative looks every time."

So I have applied for a job at a supermarket that is full time permanent the company is called Tesco. If I get the job I will be working 30hrs a week and will get 13£ an hour but may need to work overtime.

I would also like to work an internship doing something like software development since I have a degree in computer science and most internships are 8-12 weeks. Also most internships don’t pay or pay way below 13£ an hour 

My problem is I want to save money for my masters accommodation, but if I work at Tesco I don’t think I’d be able to juggle an internship and Tesco at the same time, my options are to not work at Tesco and to find another part time job like 16hrs a week and with a pay of £10 an hour, or to not do an internship and to build up an art portfolio when I’m at home since I do want to be a 3D artist more than a programmer. 

So which one should I do Tesco or another part time job?"

I am a J3 who recently received my results. I am applying for the Information Systems with Business Administration double degree programme in NUS. (Another option is the Concurrent Degree Programme in IS with CMU for engineering and technology innovation management) 

Some queries :

1. Any seniors are willing to share and summarise what we learn in IS/Biz? Is it too stressful or taxing? 
2. Are there many internships available for the students? 
3. What are the career prospects for students from this DDP?  (I am thinking of specialising in Fintech)
4. What does the ""including Accountancy"" refer to? 
5. Any seniors in the Concurrent Degree?  How did you ace the interview?  Is the degree worth it? What are the career prospects? (Pay also). What is the career progression like? 
6. Are there mid term scholarships with banks such as OCBC?
7. Are there scholarships for PRs within the faculty?  I am a PR so I cannot get NUS Merit or Global Merit. How competitive are the PR scholarships? I received 90rp and 6-2 for Os, do I stand a chance?  Portfolio is average (some research projects, some leadership positions, some online courses, one entrepreneurship I started on my own, some programmes etc)

I have a very calm demeanor and have a hard time expressing urgency with my voice when I am in a mental health crisis. 

I keep missing my counselor appointments and I am in NEED of help because I have had non-stop panic attacks since Saturday and unable to function or think. I need psychiatric care. I don’t want to kill myself but if I continue feeling like this and fail this quarter I might have to. 

I can barely breathe. Where can I go? I have stared at my laptop since 11am and it is 8pm now and have done NOTHING. I just want to feel normal again. I don’t even know what I’m feeling. I take medication but out of nowhere I am not ok. Looking at my emails makes me anxious. Every time I get a notification about a research or internship opportunity I want to kill myself. I don’t know why. 

Basically, I need someone to admit me. I am very very unwell. I don’t know where to go that will take me seriously but I can’t live like this. I don’t want to die I want to feel better. I need emergency support. I can’t function on my own anymore I am giving up. I called the national suicide hotline last night and didn’t get the help I needed. I am very very sick and having very disorganized thoughts and experiencing hallucinations. I am afraid I am going to turn into a severe schizophrenic. 

Please I need resources in Davis. I feel like an absolute failure to my professors"

So in December I completely rebuilt my PC from the ground up and just kept my GPU. My old PC was 
Corsair iCUE 220T RGB Airflow Case
Ryzen 7 3700x
ASUS TUF X570 Gaming WiFi
16GB (2x8) 3000mhz Crucial Ballistix RAM
1TB Gen3 ADATA M.2 SSD
MSI Ventus 3x 3070
Corsair CX750 750w Gold rated PSU
120MM AIO from CyberPowerPC

I went from that and got the following components.
Corsair 4000D Airflow

ASUS TUF GAMING Z690 PLUS WIFI
32GB (2x16) Corsair Vengeance Pro RGB RAM at 3200mhz

MSI Ventus 3x 3070 (same gpu of course)
Corsair RM850x 850w Gold Rated PSU
Corsair 240mm Elite Capellix AIO

My main games are Valorant, Rocket League, and some COD Vanguard and Apex here and there, but primarily Valorant and Rocket League. This worked fine for a couple weeks. Then, my PC just shuts off in the middle of a Valorant or Rocket League game. SUPER light games considering the hardware I have. My PC will shut off, the fans will start spinning like it’s trying to come back on, but it’ll fail. Sometimes it’ll manage to boot up to windows, only to shut off again in 30 seconds to a couple minutes later.

The next day and following couple weeks, it was fine. Then it began again. I took it to a local computer repair store (I know the negative connotation that has, but I used to intern there and I know they’re good people and know what they’re talking about). I just did not have the patience or willpower to figure it out myself.

They could NOT simulate the problem whatsoever. They stress tested the hell out of it, temps were fine, played the games I was playing, tested the PSU, no issues whatsoever. So I picked it back up, and it was fine for a couple weeks, until now. 

My theory is it’s a surge protector or outlet issue. The room my setup is in, has an outlet that does not work at all, so I plugged my surge protector into a different one and that was fine for the old build and the new build for some time. I have my PC, one monitor, two Philips hue light bars, and a phone charger plugged into the surge protector. However, whenever my PC shuts down on its own, the monitor and light bars stay on. So could it still be a surge protector/outlet issue? 

I think it is but I’m just looking for answers. It would make sense, since my new build requires more power. i5-12600k with a TDP of 110-150w TDP (source: google) vs the Ryzen 7 3700x with a TDP of 65w, more RAM, 850w PSU vs the 750w PSU, etc, and the local store I brought it to didn’t have any issue. The only thing giving me doubt about it being a power issue and not a PC component issue is because the monitor and Philips hue light bars staying on.

Please, please help. Thank you"

Any pointers to help me prepare? 
Am I on the right track?

I would appreciate all your inputs."
ta4roz,0,2022-03-09,Lecturer or SWE as a career,sksenweb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ta4roz/lecturer_or_swe_as_a_career/,"So, I am in my last year of BSc in CSE life and working as a Teaching Assistant for the last two semesters.  
I am also working as an SWE intern (Web-Backend) part-time. I also have another experience as an SWE intern in another company.

Basically, I have a somewhat decent CGPA of 3.7 out of 4 along with a rich GitHub profile with a high amount of personal projects. And, based on what I have been hearing from the University Authorities, they will likely try to offer me a contractual lecturer job after my graduation regardless of matching the maximum CGPA criteria because I have been doing some major contributions to their Remote Based learning management system and the feedback from the students of my teaching is great, so far. 

So, I am really confused about future career opportunities as a faculty. You know, you have to do a Ph.D. for promotion, research, etc which requires excessive effort, time, and money, the salary is also very poor depending on funding. On the other hand, promotion is not something once-in-a-moon opportunity in the SWE field. My current workplace also offered me a full-time position (SWE L3) after graduation if I want. 

Just like many Others, honestly, I want to do an internship at any FAANG company. But, I am literally like 10% confident about getting a job there. Although I am familiar enough with DSA, Competitive Programming, solving leetcode problems requires a high amount of time for me. 

On the other hand, I do have practical knowledge a lot, especially in Linux, Python, Python Automation, OOP, Web-Scraping, Django, Flask, React, TS, etc. You may don't believe it but, I also built a custom Linux Based OS and created some applications for it from scratch. CLI and GUI application development, Modifying Operating systems, automation are the areas where I shine. But, you know, FAANG companies do not hire seeing projects like this. They want two LC Mediums completed in one hour.  


So, can you please suggest me to choose a career path, or show me the opportunities I can get from my experience and/or skill? The priority should be the workplace environment and salary."

So I have applied for a job at a supermarket that is full time permanent the company is called Tesco. If I get the job I will be working 30hrs a week and will get 13£ an hour but may need to work overtime.

I would also like to work an internship doing something like software development since I have a degree in computer science and most internships are 8-12 weeks. Also most internships don’t pay or pay way below 13£ an hour 

My problem is I want to save money for my masters accommodation, but if I work at Tesco I don’t think I’d be able to juggle an internship and Tesco at the same time, my options are to not work at Tesco and to find another part time job like 16hrs a week and with a pay of £10 an hour, or to not do an internship and to build up an art portfolio when I’m at home since I do want to be a 3D artist more than a programmer. 

So which one should I do Tesco or another part time job?"

taabdq,2,2022-03-09,Going through the motions,dogmama5,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/taabdq/going_through_the_motions/,"I'm sorry if this is kinda long. I guess this is my last-ditch cry for help. I'm 25, and somewhere along the way I lost myself. I lost the ability to feel passionate about anything, I lost the feeling of security I used to feel around my family and people I considered close friends, and I lost my sense of identity and purpose in this world. The part of me who accomplished being a first generation college student, had reputable internships, thrived in the social spotlight, and was everyone's golden child feels so far removed from who I am today and I cannot bear to live in my world today. I am living with bipolar disorder 2. They say it is typically onset in your 20s, and that's exactly what seemed to happen to me. One day passed to the next, and I grew more and more depressed, feeling like I was watching myself live my life from a corner of the room. In 2019 I attempted suicide, and I was put inpatient in a psychiatric hospital for the first time. The trauma from this period of my life still corners me in my small moments of peace. For those of you who may have lived the grippy-sock life, you know that being in an adult ward, they do not typically separate the violent, dangerous patients from the patients who are overcome with depression. The things I witnessed in a place that claimed to be keeping me safe are memories that still cause me nightmares today. But the most traumatic part of it all was the way the support system I thought I had disintegrated out from under me during my time of need. My dad, who had always had anger issues growing up, now takes several xanaxes just to leave the house, couldn't bare to look me in the eyes the day I was admitted. I remember vividly as my stepmom, who promised that my family would visit me every day, visited one time and told me that I was ""breaking my dad's heart"" by being suicidal and that I was being ""narcissistic"" by ""only thinking of myself"" and when I told her I didn't feel safe there, she told me I was being dramatic. That day, she told my close friends and the rest of my family not to visit me ever. During my time at the hospital I was put on antipsychotic drugs that I thought were the remedy to all my problems. I went back to work for a while, and I felt okay, but nowhere near who I used to be. I no longer felt capable of feeling passion for anything I did. I eventually went back to the hospital in 2020. After a month-long stay, I was out in the world again. I attend therapy once per week religiously and stay on medication. However, this past year has taught me that maybe what I have been working so hard to fix in myself is unfixable. And one more day of going through the motions is going to put me in the ground. I suffered severe suicidal breaks and stopped performing at work, I eventually couldn't pay my rent, and I got evicted. I moved home, an hour and a half away from all of my friends. I got very sick with pneumonia and bronchitus. I found out a car I got in 2020 was a lemon and it died on me on the highway and almost killed me. I am now carless. I am in so much debt. And today I just had a performance review with my manager who told me I'm a ""needs improvement"" case. I guess I just feel like why did this happen to me? I know I shouldn't think that way, but I see other people my age thriving, and I am stuck in perpetual mental illness and have to fight each day to live my life. I no longer feel attached to the world like I once did, I no longer really feel alive. And if I no longer feel alive, then what's the point of living anymore. I never signed up to live with chronic mental illness. I don't have a family support system and I only have two close friends who hear way too often about me feeling this way and I don't want to burden them. So I am turning to this group of strangers. Please help me. Please tell me it gets better. Lie to me. Tell me how to change this thought pattern. Because I am so close to ending my life for good."
taaihx,3,2022-03-09,Graduating early,ecalosimoan,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/taaihx/graduating_early/,"So I'm having a bit of a dilemma. 

I'm currently a sophomore and have been thinking about graduating a year early for a while. I've honestly had enough of the ""college experience"" and would rather save myself the time and money, and my mental health has been really affected by school things since I've come here. I planned out the rest of my classes and it would all work out (I talked with my advisor a bit about this too and we planned out the rest of my schedule if I chose to go this route).

What I'm scared about is maybe I'm ruining my job prospects? I'd be losing a summer where I could have an internship and another year could help me raise my GPA (I have around a 3.4 right now). For context, I'm currently an Econ major and Stat minor. If I chose to stay for another year, I could double major instead of just minoring in Stat. Would this make that much of a difference when I start applying for jobs?

I just want some opinions because I'm very lost and don't want to end up making a decision I'll regret."

tac5m7,1,2022-03-09,Do companies pursue legal action for bond?,akshrv,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tac5m7/do_companies_pursue_legal_action_for_bond/,"Hi everyone, so I am working in a tech startup for almost a year and a half (9 months as intern , 6 months as full time) and i am severely burnt out. I am the only one managing the team and also looking after the juniors who have recently joined and the company is also unsatisfied as i am not able to get the deliverables done in time and now I have decided that I should just quit. I don't have another job lined up as i just want to get out of this situation, though I am looking out for opportunities.

I have signed a bond (training cost) for 1.5 years, and i read that these kind of agreements are valid in india.. so I wanted to know if I don't pay the amount, do companies usually take legal action?"
tackxo,2,2022-03-09,Advice for giving guidance to younger sibling,gpzj94,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tackxo/advice_for_giving_guidance_to_younger_sibling/,"Hello all,

I have a sibling 10 years younger than I (no other siblings) who just graduated from college last May. Our parents are of no real guidance for life/career moves, so I have been the one she has relied on for advice in the past. I'm at a point of frustration and need some help before making a mistake and ending up too blunt.

First off, my sibling has asked for advice and guidance in these times. I have read enough stories on here about older siblings giving younger siblings unsolicited advice and causing tension. I have tried to remain very aware of this to try to stay in my lane. Even now, I'm being asked for advice, but I'm on the verge of frustration and concern that I feel things are going to go really bad if I don't get involved more. I'd hate to see them in an unbearable spot if it could just be corrected now.  


My frustration is that they have graduated almost a year ago and do not have a job. They are being a bit picky, don't want to move out of the city, don't want to consider other career paths, etc. They have put social activities and sports above finding a career throughout their college years. Poor planning caused them to miss good internship opportunities. They also realized they had taken on student debts they forgot about in a large sum. Mental health/depression is a problem in my family, so I try to tread lightly with that in mind, but I have tried everything to give confidence boosts about getting a job that it's just not working. 

&amp;#x200B;

The latest is that I was told they were feeling overwhelmed with finding a job, trying to get information together such as student loan details (interest rates, minimum payments, etc). Being told they didn't finish a job application I sent over because they ran out of time and had to leave (they do have a part time hostess job so I assume it's for that, and I have tried to push to see if she could just turn that into a full time job or get some extra hours in another position like a waitress, but seems they do not want to make a career of this so here we are).  I have some time management links I want to send, but how do I really make them see that this overwhelmed feeling they are having is really due to all the other poor choices in priorities?  


How do I have a coming to jesus talk with my sibling that they need to be less picky about a job, find something, know they aren't stuck in 1 job but they just need to start making a living so they don't keep digging themselves into more debt? How blunt do I be, or do I just let them make their own choices at this point and  pray for the best?"

I know how we feel about unpaid internships but is it better than not having one?"

tacz80,20,2022-03-09,Is master's degree really not worth it?,heofizzy,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/tacz80/is_masters_degree_really_not_worth_it/,"I recently had an SWE internship at a large well known company and all of very senior members in office were against the idea of doing a masters degree in computer science, some of seniors didn't even have a bachelors degree and were very proud of that. Generally, where I go or whatever I read on the internet, it looks like that the sentiment of doing a master's in CS is a waste of time for most people.

In my case, I have been coding since childhood and I have been working as a freelance web dev for a couple of years. Few years into my current, totaly unrelated to CS degree, I realized that I just wasted my time with it and I want to work as software engineer, but having no formal CS education seems to be a slight disadvantage for me. I am now finishing up my bachelor's degree and I am considering enrolling to a master's degree in CS, however I am not sure if this might be another mistake and instead of wasting another two years I should simply go and get any kind of SWE related job.

For those who did a master's in CS, what was it that you liked the most about it and would you do it again?"
tad5bo,1,2022-03-09,Master of Science vs. Professional Master's: which one is more valuable in the CS industry?,Tenceto,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tad5bo/master_of_science_vs_professional_masters_which/," I have been working in Machine Learning for almost 5 years now, but I have earned a scholarship to pursue a Master's degree in the US (I'm from South America), and therefore I have decided that I could take this chance to start studying again. I have been admitted to two Master's programs at the same university, both in Computer Science:

* Professional Master's, in which courses must be taken, there is no thesis and there is the possibility to do summer internships in actual companies.
* Master of Science, which consists of taking some courses (a few less than in the Professional Master's), working in research at the university (there are no internships in companies) and graduating with a thesis.

Apart from the differences in duration, price and any others you can think of, there is just one thing that I'm wondering: **which one is considered to have more value in the industry (i.e. outside academia)?**

Some people have told me that the Professional Master's is better, because the internships are the most important thing in the CV and the fact that someone has a couple of past positions in some important companies can have a huge impact on recruiters in the future. However, others have told me that the internships carried out at company X are of value just within that company, because they're not such a big deal (they just represent 4 months of work on a specific and probably small project and that's it, and I already have a lot of work experience, though not in US or Europe), while the thesis and any papers that one publishes while carrying out a Master of Science are way more important to be able to compete for cool CS positions in the industry.

I want to make it clear that I'm not planning to follow an academic career after graduation (i.e. I'm not interested in pursuing a PhD), so the impact on the industry's labor market is the thing that matters the most to me."

tadsh7,2,2022-03-09,Pursue Masters in CS at DigiPen?,abar23,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/tadsh7/pursue_masters_in_cs_at_digipen/,"Hi everyone.

I was recently accepted into the masters program at DigiPen. I am excited that I have been accepted, but not sure if this is the right move if I want to pursue a career in game dev. I am mainly hesitant due to the conflicting opinions regarding whether an MS in CS is worth the time and money investment. I see a good chunk of this community suggesting that working on demos/game projects on my own time would be more advantageous and tends to look better since it shows personal passion and motivation to learn on your own. On the other hand, DigiPen would ensure that you have a decent portfolio of projects due to their graphics and game project courses, but this would be at expense of paying tuition and Redmond living costs. I'm uncertain if I should pursue the degree or take a year off to pursue game dev full time.

Just to give a little background on myself. I graduated with BS in CS from a state university. During my undergraduate studies I developed a few ganes using MonoGame and Unity, learned the programmable pipeline for OpenGL, and worked on research for applying VR in the medical space. Upon graduating, I accepted a job in banking technology to gain professional experience and build up finances for grad school. In my spare time, I have been working on learning C/C++, developing a game/rendering engine, and learning a bit of blender to understand 3D modeling workflows used by artists, but it can be hard to maintain motivation when spending 40 to 60 hours a week at a job.

Here are some questions I have for the community:

1. For those who attended the DigiPen graduate program.

How was the program? Was it worth the financial investment?

Did the coursework help you gain the skills necessary to land a job in the industry?

Does DigiPen do a good job of assisting students when it comes to making industry connections or getting interview opportunities?

How long did it take to land a job in the industry after graduation? Why did employees gravitate towards hiring yourself?

2. For those currently working in the industry.

If you were looking to hire someone for an entry to mid level generalist or gameplay programmer, would you prefer someone who is self taught or has a post graduate degree? Assuming that both candidates have decent portfolios.

If your team needed a graphics/rendering engineer, does higher education play a bigger role when deciding on a candidate since this is a specialized position?

What did you do to get your foot into the door at a studio?

Is it worthwhile to go back to school in order to open up internship opportunities in the industry?

I apologize if any of the above questions have been answered on other threads. Wanted to throw these out there to get people's perspective in today's job market. For anyone outside of those two groups, please feel free to respond. I appreciate any responses!


TL:DR - Not sure if a masters degree from DigiPen is worth the financial investment based upon other threads. Would it be better to pursue game dev full time for a year to focus on demos and game projects instead of gaining the degree?"

taemiw,1,2022-03-09,CS50 Web: What am I capable of afterwards and can I take without having done CS50x?,Justafa02,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/taemiw/cs50_web_what_am_i_capable_of_afterwards_and_can/,"Hi!

I am currently studying CS at University. I have very little experience in programming (except that I am learning Java at University) so I thought that it might be a cool thing to do the CS50 Web certificate to land my first cool internship. At the same time I am currently a working student at a headhunter firm and also kind of looking after their wordpress webpage. Imo the website is really bad (it looks nice but that's pretty much it). Today we once again had problems with the page so I told my boss that I am currently thinking about taking a web development course (CS50 Web) and afterwards I'll make a better website for them.

She told me that they are willing to pay it for me under the condition that I will create a cool website for them afterwards.

So there are two main things that I am currently asking myself:

1. What will I be capable of after taking the course? (Will I be able to create a cool website for them?)
2. Should I do CS50x before or is it enough that I am a CS student?

If some of you already took the course and would like to share their experiences with me I'd be really thankful! I am also not sure if it will be too much for me considering my job at the firm (10h/week) and my studies (40-50h/week) so I'd love to hear your opinions!

Thanks for reading!"

2. Live Oak Bank in North Carolina, Is near where I live so I would be able to go in office if I choose to do so.

My dilemma is that they are both paying the same so that isn't were I cant make a decision from. I'm just not sure in terms of outlook in my fulltime career if its wiser to go with a bank software development for a internship or retail software development. Additionally, I'm also not sure if being able to go in person will make a difference in my internship experience has I have not had one before. Any help on trying to make a decision is appreciated, I have no idea which one to choose and need to make a decision by the end of the week.   
Thank yall in advance!"

I just received an OA for an internship and I will be tested on the following. 

* Coding - You can use whichever programming language you'd like!
* Databases - You'll use database queries and SQL for this one. 
* Rest API's - You'll be solving Rest API's using algos!

I more or less understand what's expected of me from the coding and database section. I'm not sure what to expect from the Rest API section. When I go to the HackerRank website I don't see any practice tests or resources for this topic. This is something I have minimal experience with and I'm not sure how to practice.

Is there a next step I could be taking to help round out my skills and increase my desirability? I'm so frustrated at this point because I haven't even managed to get an interview for any internships which literally have zero prerequisites outside of being in or having finished school...

Its becoming really hard to keep motivated (lost count of how many ""sorry you're not the right fit"" emails I've had to read)  but cybersecurity is my passion and the field I have always wanted to work in.

Career switcher + new grad here that is in the fortunate position of two offers to choose from, looking for advice on how to maximize my experience - an ideal scenario for me is a remote/near-my-home role in SoCal to stay near support system and family with room for growth/mentorship.

Received two offers:

1. Bay Area tech company return offer from a 6-month internship - good mentorship, modern tech, mandatory in-office, requires relocation
2. Remote role in defense industry- a mix of older/new tech, not as great on mentorship, end up earning more compared to Offer 1, fully remote

I noticed yesterday that Company 1 is now offering remote roles for the next step-up in my position (1-5 YOE) while the new grad role I'd be entering is in-office only. I did try to request being remote at the time of negotiation with Company 1 with no success. I have signed both offers since the start dates are far enough apart to try Company 2 for a couple of weeks and leave for Company 1 should there not be a fit.

Questions:  
\- Aside from relocation and 10% less money in-pocket after taxes/projected expenses, Offer 1 provides a better career-starting experience. Am I jeopardizing my relationship with company 1 by essentially asking for remote again, citing the availability of remote roles (although they are a level-up and may not be a direct comparison) + having Offer 2 in hand? Is there a way to achieve my ideal scenario of having this career experience + working remotely?

\- What would be some career consequences, good or bad, to consider by taking remote 2? Admittedly, working in defense doesn't appeal to me and I will treat this role as a stepping stone (with supplemental LC effort and personal learning) to get into other industries/opportunities. By then, if circumstances change, I will be more inclined to relocate as well.

Your perspective or advice is appreciated, thank you ahead of time!"
tahtuj,3,2022-03-09,What do I say to my managers if work makes my anxiety unbearable but I do not want to lose my job?,anon_sendhelp,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/tahtuj/what_do_i_say_to_my_managers_if_work_makes_my/,"I am currently an intern at a wonderful company who told me they plan on hiring me full time when the internship ends the end of April.

Before I applied for this internship, I was next in line for a partial hospital program for my eating disorder (honestly the least of my concerns — I'm also dealing with a divorce from a mentally abusive relationship, severe anxiety, uncontrollable depressive states, suicidal ideation, symptoms of BPD, the list goes on). But I decided to apply for the internship anyway even though I anticipated it being more than I could handle. Of course, I did not do the mental health program I was supposed to because that would've interfered with my work schedule. I also stopped therapy (it got stagnant/hopeless) so I wasn't eligible for the program anymore. I was doing so well in the internship, so much so they offered me the FT position, until something unbeknownst to me triggered me to come out of my dissociated state earlier this week.

I had to call out of work last minute twice this week, and explained to my managers today that I am dealing with some personal things and have been trying to not let it impact my ability to work. They were so understanding, and I am meeting with one of them later this week to discuss my situation.

I'm currently trying to find a new mental health provider and am going back on Zoloft (even though I feel like it's pointless).

So besides those things...I am looking for any advice on how to communicate what's going on with my manager/what exactly to say/how I might be able to alleviate some of the issues that make working feel impossible certain days. I want to be able to work and to be able to accept the FT position. Until something triggered me into this depressive state, I was really enjoying this job, and the people I work with are amazing and so accepting of mental health issues. (But of course I can't just be calling out every other day last minute). I also need to make money to survive, obviously, and this job would provide that security. Some days I feel fine and chipper, some days like today, merely existing feels excruciatingly painful and impossible and it feels as though I have no control over it day to day. I feel like I've backed myself into a corner with yet another horrible life decision. If I'm working and feeling this way, the anxiety is unbearable and it puts me in an extremely dark place. If I'm not working and my mental health is slightly better, I am extremely stressed out financially and cannot support myself and feel like a waste of life.

Any advice on what to say to my manager/has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Thank you."

Was accepted in R1, my group knew I was applying, generally supportive, they know I've been accepted to a few programs and will be leaving, although not an official date, other than 'sometime in July'.

My annoyance: In general, my direct Manager and both of my Directors have directly hinted at a promotion for me in the past, not in response to leaving for an MBA, but in an acknowledgment for growth and work done. It felt a little like, and I'm feeling confirmed in this now, that it was mostly a carrot being dangled so that I didn't leave the company early. Several people have been promoted in the past 12-18 months, my coworkers (and most of the leadership team from what I gather) at my level hold me in high-regard, I'm regularly leading 2-3 projects at once, often with people that have been promoted 'over me'.

Yearly reviews/raises/bonus's were just handed out - bonus is fine, raise it sh\*t, no promo, and almost no actionable feedback - its all, impressed with x,y,z, appreciate the initiative on firm initiatives, etc.

Should I just take my bonus and go find another job before my program (I can't quite afford to stop working yet), tell my manager or VP (who I have a good relationship with) howI'm feeling? Is there a right/wrong way to discuss if so?

If I started applying for roles that would be interesting post MBA, do I tell them I'm likely out after 4 months (PM is probably primary goal and I dont have PM experience so doubtful I'd find a good permanent role pre-MBA) or is it possible to look for more of an internship? 

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading, and I appreciate any advice you've got in advance."

I worked a job that I absolutely hated and was miserable everyday, but when I look back I can see all the things that I personally did wrong. I was stressed because I thought my boss and I were unclear about things but I could have communicated better. I was so afraid to say I didn't know something and didn't understand after things were explained to me. I did group projects and one member of our team did basically nothing the entire year. I got so frustrated and bent out of shape that I was going to do his work to make deadlines, basically all the time, that I became extremely stressed out and was almost trying to bully him into doing work.
When everything is online and your conversations are recorded you can overthink everything. I kept feeling like posting on the shared group where the whole team could read was bad. I couldn't read context of a room because I didn't know everyone and was an intern. But it's mainly that I was stressed out 24/7 worrying about other people's behavior than my own - - because I expected I would share responsibility for their actions.

So I think I do that in a lot of areas of my life, where I start controlling people forcefully because I want a party to turn out well or roommates to all get along and I think I've lost a lot of relationships and friendships by trying to police hanging out into something predictable and safe for myself. So 1. I've been a raging asshole for no reason and 2. I've been stressed out extremely badly about things I have no control over.

I don't know what to do about this. I don't know what to do about either of these things and I feel exhausted and like crying.

'Let it go' isn't a thing because I'm just trying to avoid these terrible situations that have happened before and force a peaceful existence."

I'm ecstatic, got offered stocks and bonuses which take my total compensation above 100k. Location: Austin, TX. 

Look, I just want to say hang in there. Apply to roles, work on projects, take on leadership roles, etc. Your classes are important and will help you have a great foundation but engineers really prove themselves by taking that education and putting it to practical use. Don't sell yourself short, it is possible and you can do it. Some advice I have for y'all:

  
1) Try and take classes that have projects. Some of the best classes I took were project-based classes merely cause I got to talk about it in much detail during interviews. I also was able to take an Engineering for non-profits class which essentially mirrored an internship experience.

2)   Apply to internships. I know a lot of us are working and juggling multiple responsibilities while taking classes and applying, interviewing, and getting internships may be difficult. But dive deep into the process, it will be worth it. Engineering internships will usually pay a lot more than part-time jobs and will tremendously help get interviews during your job hunt for full-time roles. Also, look into engineering orgs and work on meaningful projects!

3) Know your timelines. While internships and co-ops are posted throughout the year, some major companies follow a timeline and those roles fill up as early as Fall for roles starting in the summer. Applying early will increase opportunities and increase your chances of success. 

4) If you are applying a lot but not getting interviews, you probably need some more experience/projects. Focus on those. 

5) Note down the questions you get asked in technical interviews. I had a question bank of general technical questions I used to get asked and they would be asked in almost every interview. This significantly helped and decreased prep time for each interview. For behavioral interviews, have 5-6 stories from projects/experiences that you can use. 

Good luck!"

I have a career question that I am struggling to answer. I received a job offer that will increase my total comp by 45-70%. However, that is not the role I want to have my career in. My current role and the offered role, in back-office/financial operations, are merely temporary, until I find an internship/job as an investment analyst/front office. I am applying for these and I expect it will take me 6-12 months to obtain the desired roles. I also can’t stay in my current role as it is being moved to Glasgow and I must stay in London as I start my part-time masters in October at LSE. Now here is my dilemma, should I stay in the role or take the new role. Here are my options:

Option A – Move to Glasgow for six months until October. During that time, apply aggressively and hope to get front-office roles and internships end of September. Chances of me getting something in the front office by October are under 30% or lower.

Option B – Take the new job and continue to apply for front office roles. Meanwhile, enjoy the pay rise.

Option A Pros

· Good Team – I like my current teammates. I get on very well with them.

· Comfortable role – I have been doing this role for 9/10 months thus I am good at it. I have a good work-life balance and, rarely do I work beyond 1700. This means my evenings are free to apply for front-office job roles.

Option A Cons

· Low Compensation - (£33K gross)

· Move to Glasgow – this will incur moving costs and additional costs to attend the interviews/networking session in London.

· Only six months to apply for front office roles – There is no guarantee that I will get my desired front office role in London by October. If I don’t and have to stay in Glasgow, then I am quite frankly screwed. There is no way I can continue my studies from Glasgow as it is too far to commute.

Option B Pros

· High Compensation - (£48 - £56K gross) Money was not the reason that I looked for a new job. However, the opportunity to increase pay by 45-70% is quite tempting and hard to give up.

· Stay in London – This is the main reason I looked for a new job. Staying in London will allow me to attend networking sessions/trade fairs more frequently and attend interviews easily. This will also give me more time to apply for the front office roles. As I am staying in London, I don’t have to have a front office role by October ( chances of which are slim anyway) thus I have more breathing space.

Option B Cons

· Team – there is no guarantee I will like my new team and get on with them as I do with my current team.

· Work/life balance – New role may not have a good work-life balance. Unlike my current 9-5 hours I work now, I could end up working 8-8. Working long hours will affect my study and reduce the time I have to apply for front office roles.

Anyone got a bit of sound advice as to what shall I do. I am conflicted. On one hand, I want to stay in my current role but the pay and opportunity to stay in London is hard to ignore. Any advice from you folks would be much appreciated"
tanffb,2,2022-03-09,Next steps after dev mentorship,geezycee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tanffb/next_steps_after_dev_mentorship/,"For some background, I'm an American in my 30s and have completed around 2/3rds of a Computer Engineering degree (slowly finishing it online; 1 class/semester). For the last year and a bit I've been working in technical support for a \~1500 employee software company.

Through the company's mentorship program, I was matched with a mentor who's a Senior Mac SWE based in the Eastern Europe office. It's a 3 month mentorship with the possibility to extend and we're about a month in.

Things are going well. My mentor is sharp, organized and has put a lot of time in. I have no question that he wants to see me succeed.

On our 2nd meeting, after only a few days of me reviewing Swift, we did a leetcode easy together. I was able to do a less efficient solution that ran immediately, but due to my unfamiliarity with the language, my mentor had to drive while I gave the pseudo-code for an efficient solution. \[I was shaky on syntax, specifically the syntax for dictionaries which were needed to not run nested for loops.\]

Later my mentor commented that my technical skills were ""impressive"", that I did well to solve the leetcode on the spot, and that he was interviewing candidates for a Mac SWE internship that lacked solid technical skills. He's also said it should take me around 6 months to a year to get a Junior role.

I feel that my main encumbrance is the amount of time and mental energy I spend on my technical support job. There's a constantly overflowing queue of work; never a single moment of down time. I live in a state of mild stress and often feel mentally fatigued after work. \[For that reason, I get up 2-3 hours earlier to work on my mentorship when I'm fresh.\]

While on a call today, I asked if he thought I should apply for the Mac SWE internship. He said I'd be a good candidate, however, the team is in Eastern Europe and the 7 hour time difference would make it implausible. We looked at the internal job listings in the company for positions in America and there was nothing that would be a good fit.

He light-heartedly said that I could move to Europe. I took this as a joke at the time, but now I'm considering it might have had some truth behind it. My mentor himself moved from a neighboring country and what seems to be the majority of the staff there are not locals, rather from other parts of Europe, India/Pakistan, Africa.. however, no Americans to my knowledge.

I'm feeling increasingly burned out from technical support. I think I'm capable of six more months at the most. That being said, I don't want to quit without having another job/internship lined up and have a preference to stay within the company. So, I feel the fuse is somewhat short for me to make sense of everything.

I'm looking for thoughts on next steps: should I stay the course and see if my mentor extends or is able to find something internal for me? If that doesn't work out, what next?

Is there anything I should be doing right now in addition to the mentorship? Should I explore the extreme option of moving to another continent for an internship (if they'll even take me)? Something else?"
tangjf,9,2022-03-09,Why should I be a team player?,itsaimmersyall,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/tangjf/why_should_i_be_a_team_player/,"Shockingly, I had full support from my admin today. It was my coworkers who disrespected me. I honestly just need to get today out of my head so enjoy this rant. 

My kids had the opportunity to learn from some volunteers today. I was so excited and they were excited too. Last night, I get an email saying three volunteers had to cancel and to prepare a split list and to accept some kids into your room if need be. 

As a team player, I said absolutely and told them how many I would welcome into my classroom. 

Fast forward to today, the organizer comes in my room and apologizes because my volunteer was a no call/no show and we’ll have to split my kids. 

I went ahead and messaged my coworkers letting them know that a split was going to happen and wanted to know how many they could take. Plus, because my kids were split I told them I will be rotating around the different classrooms helping out with all the kids and doing tasks for other teachers if they needed me to. Like making copies, or watching the students while they stepped out, I even had to change some kind of toner in a printer (incorrectly at first I admit), and even offered to make coffee for them! Like full on intern mode!

Immediately, I get push back. They were refusing to accept my kids. 

Let me remind you, they were not teaching at all today!!!! We had volunteers! My kids just needed a desk to sit in!!! The teachers had to do nothing!!!! Literally an entire day to plan and catch up on other work!! And they were refusing??? Who the heck! 

So I get upset because my kids were about to lose out on this opportunity. And of course, I had a plan B on what would happen if my volunteers did not show up and graciously offered to go with this plan B. But the organizer and my principal were both insistent that my students receive this instruction. So they pushed forward with the split. 

Now I take full accountability for advocating for my kids to have this opportunity because I didn’t want to do my plan B which was boring and I knew they wouldn’t be engaged in. Plus this opportunity was so much fun and engaging!!! I didn’t want them to miss out!!

I started to take my kids around to their classrooms, and I get pulled into an empty classroom by another teacher. She yells at me telling me that I put this whole floor in a rift because of this and any other teacher would have just sucked it up and held their class the entire day. 

First off, ma’am, I didn’t put the floor into a rift. You and your lack of being a team player is what put the floor into a rift. You started this drama, I was following orders. Again, you are creating your own negative weather, I was following orders and advocating for my kids. 

2, how ducking dare you. This one teacher in particular I have helped so much this year. I’ve assisted her with technology issues cause she’s a little unfamiliar, and even put together a ducking white board for her!!! And you refuse to help me out in this one moment??? (Side note, while I was in her room. I made her kid’s work packets for tomorrow because she is taking the whole day off. And I will not complain or push back when her students are placed into my room.)

At the end of the day, when I gathered all my kids and heard their stories, I am not sorry for advocating for them. It proved that they deserved this opportunity and were glad they got it. (Also, a big f-you to the teacher who tried to take this opportunity away from my kids.)

To end this rant, why should I be a team player? Because I am a good person. Point blank. I am a good person and want to continue to be one. We are in the middle of a pandemic and a teacher shortage.

This week I'm taking A+ hardware class and I'm lucky enough (yay for being an intern at the school!) to be getting a donated to the school dell. However, this bad boy for some reason has an i5 in it. Our homework for the class has been to build a pc on a certain budget, adding parts as we learn about them in great detail.

I've been building AMD all week and have found some ridiculous deals on ryzen 7. I'm going to slowly start building out framework for solid home machine (gaming ofc, but also legit learning advanced IT work like multiboxing virtual machines, networking infrastructure and cyber security). 

Question is, where should I start? I'm thinking basics like case, fans, RAM, lights (cus bling bling), maybe finding a deal on a GPU. But then I'm going to have to decide on AMD or intel. Obv this PC is intel and i5 is pretty damn good for a starter PC - but that would mean I would have to buy an ITX, and I'm liking the AMD ryzen and ATX boards.

Thoughts? 

P.S. I won the first 2 days of competition, and almost def going to win day 3 as I did this build based on the teacher specs and $1500 budget: [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/z9xtgb](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/z9xtgb) . /flex

 My bestfriend [F21] of almost 12 years came to visit me for the weekend. We had a wonderful time the three of us and on her last night in the city we went to a bar and got drunk, then we wanted to go to a club but I was really tired and said I wanted to go home so the three of us went home.
 My bestfriend started crying because she wanted to go out on her last night. So my boyfriend went with her to the club. When i woke up at 5am I went to my living room and they were having sex on the couch.

I told my bestfriend to grab her bags and get the hell out of my house and told my boyfriend to explained it to me. He was totally hammered and just crying. For like three hours he cried saying sorry and that he didnt what had happened. He grabbed his things and went home. Two hours later he came to my house, sober, and explained that he didnt remember coming home last night, didnt remember being with her because he had a total blackout. I know that it is his case that when he drinks too much he doesn't remember anything.

He totally regrets it and is ready to work out and recover the relationship. He is giving me space and my mum came to accompany me in this time.

I don't know if I should forgive him or not. I don't know what is best for me. I do want to be with him, we both see ourselves getting married in the future.

I worked as a civil engineer for a few years, and in the lockdown I decided to learn IT. I signed up for an IT traineeship, which lasted a year, where I also gained a CompTIA A+ certificate. In my free time I'm also learning Python.

The thing is, I am a mum, and while the nursery was closed during lockdown, I looked after my child. I was getting up at 4am to study in peace. I gained a certificate and started to look for a job. Mostly I get calls for jobs which require medium experience, even though in my CV I did not state that. I clearly wrote what I learned in a year and that I'm looking for a start position in IT. I had a few interviews and after that I did not receive any answer or feedback. It's been 3 weeks since I started to look for a job. I noticed that there are very few jobs which require no previous experience. I also applied for an internship, but I guess I'm too old for that. I'm 32 and living in the UK. Money is not an issue, I would accept a lower salary in return to experience. I am a foreigner, but my English is very good, I have an American accent. I worked many years in international companies in Europe on responsible positions. 

I was even thinking of asking for feedback, but I know that in the interviews I did not have required experience, and I feel that would be a desperate move since they didn't even care to send that they chose somebody else. I always try to show I really do have passion for IT and I usually pick up things very fast. 

I just feel a bit down, and thinking is it really that hard to enter the IT world or is it me? All I can hear is how desperately IT professionals are needed.  I would just like to start! I really enjoy learning new softwares and I think I would thrive in a new job.  I'm a pleasant person, and also hardworking which is proven in my CV. But was is a problem then?

He has been admitted to two Master's programs at the same university, both in Computer Science:

\- Professional Master's, in which courses must be taken, there is no thesis but there is the possibility to do summer internships in actual companies.

\- Master of Science, which consists of taking some courses (a few less than in the Professional Master's), working in research at the university and graduating with a thesis, BUT with no internships.

Apart from the differences in duration, price and any others, he has one essential question: which one is considered to have more value in the industry (i.e. outside academia), given he already has work experience?

Some people told me that the Professional Master's is better, because the internships are the most important thing in the CV and the fact that someone has a couple of past positions in some important companies can have a huge impact on recruiters in the future. However, others have told me that the internships carried out at company X are of value just within that company, because they're not such a big deal (they just represent 4 months of work on a specific and probably small project and that's it, and this guy already has a lot of work experience, though not in US or Europe), while the thesis and any papers that one publishes while carrying out a Master of Science are way more important to be able to compete for cool CS positions in the industry.

tawlff,2,2022-03-10,Advice on a loss of motivation/passion about your major and the decision to change majors.,LeisureTea,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tawlff/advice_on_a_loss_of_motivationpassion_about_your/,"(I feel like this is going to be quite a densely-written post, so I apologize if anything I say seems extremely confusing.)

Hello! I’m a 20-year-old physics major about to complete my third year of the undergraduate program. I enjoy physics and mathematics as a field; however, after all these months, I sort of feel like I’m wasting my time with this major, and I have been thinking about switching majors to something that I feel like I am now slightly more passionate about (spoilers: it’s Linguistics and/or Anthropology). However, I feel like if I do decide to switch majors, I think I would be wasting all the valuable time and money my family and I have spent in order to secure a better future for myself. I don’t want to be viewed as a waste, but at the same time, I do not really see any good future for me if I continue with physics.

I am Half-American and Half-Filipino, and have been living in the Philippines throughout almost my entire life before college. I moved to the States during my last year of high school and graduated high school here; my family and I moved to the States (which was easy for me and my family due to our citizenship, so we took the chance) as we felt that we would have a better life there, especially with regards to our education.

As far as I can remember, I’ve always had a strong passion for science, and I sort of realized that I had a very deep passion for physics at the age range of 12 to 14 (roughly). I feel like I’ve basically modeled myself to be prepared for all the physics and mathematics I would be doing in my future career. I want(ed) to be a professor at a university and do theoretical physics research at the same time. However, I am beginning to think that this was a totally misguided passion that I should have realized sooner. However, I believe after the fall semester of my first year of college here, I started feeling a lack of motivation and passion for physics; I was not as curious and as eager to learn about things like particle physics and the nature of our universe at a *femtoscopic* scale. I sort of disregarded this as a depressive or stressed phase of my life, but this has been going on for more than two years already. I’m suspecting that I either have ADHD or I’m just extremely lazy, but this, along with the pandemic, has greatly amplified this lack of passion. I’ve been thinking about walking to a therapist about this, but as I feel like this heavily ties in with changing majors, I wasn’t sure if a therapist or my academic counselor would be the right person to approach first.

Linguistics has also been an extremely big passion of mine which started since I was a grade 8 or 9 student I believe. To this day, I deeply enjoy learning about the structure of language, and I also enjoy learning about how this ties with culture and society—I love reading about societal and political issues in some communities and how such may be solved, the history of different cultures and groups of people, and maybe I have this subconscious desire to help such communities? I also love writing and discussing/presenting on such topics to other people. However, I always disregarded this as a hobby or just something I liked to talk about because it’s fun; I never really saw a future of me studying such things—until now. I talk about linguistics every single day and I feel like I have been avoiding physics discussions for quite some time—in fact, the classes I look forward to attending every week are the two electives I’m taking, General Linguistics and Political Geography.

However, changing my major would mean that my family and I would be wasting 3-years worth of college tuition and 3-years in general, plus all those years in the Philippines where I could have been using my time wisely on programs related to linguistics and anthropology. I have not taken physics internships yet as I feel like I haven’t learned or absorbed a lot of physics material throughout my college life, and I haven’t been talking to a lot of my physics professors since I am afraid they would realize I am not apt for this field. I am much more comfortable discussing with professors and students in the field of Humanities.

I think I’m also extremely afraid of my parents’ reaction to this. They brought us here to have a better life and worked their asses off so that we would pursue our dreams comfortably and smoothly, and they have spent a lot of money to support us; I slightly feel like they would be greatly ashamed of my desire to try out something new, but I believe that changing my major would mean I have wasted months of their hard work to support me.

As I also still love physics, I am afraid of letting go of this passion; I have spent my high school and college life devoting all my focus toward this field, and I feel like shifting my studies to something else would mean all these years have been practically worthless.

And so I come here to seek advice. Should I talk to both a therapist (might be a stretch) and my academic counselor about this? If you have changed your major to something entirely different, what was your experience like with your parents? Are there feasible ways to regain my passion and motivation to study physics? What are your overall thoughts on my situation?

(Thank you for reading this post if you’ve gone this far. I apologize for the extremely long post, but I am sort of insecure on who to turn to and who to open up to regarding my issue; that’s why I decided to share this here anonymously. If you need a better explanation for something in my post, I'd happily expound it further to you.)"

Only small companies recruit at those and most of the time they'll just thank you for your time and tell you to try applying on their website.

They are all senior software developer roles.  full stack development,  all hybrid or fully remote it seems.

* *Learning outcome*: scripting, web-scraping, drawing business insights from data using Excel PivotTable
* *Impact*: automated manual processes to save 100’s of hours; presented analysis that directly influenced CEO’s decision making; invented new marketing metrics that became part of weekly marketing report

I personally prefer this new approach because I am able to include more relevant information in an impactful way (I only have 4 lines for this internship because I have 3 other relevant internships). I hope it can help me stand out more from the crowd.

However, at the same time, everyone has blind spots, so I'd like to hear what you think!"

I will give you two versions of my bullet points for my first internship at a small company.

The current, more traditional approach is:

* Used Python Selenium to scrape and clean over 100K+ rows of supply chain data from a web database, saving the company more than 100’s of hours
* Utilized scraped data to analyze competitors, industry, and growth opportunities using Excel PivotTable, providing business insights such as industry trends and competitors’ growth for the CEO

tb49zw,2,2022-03-10,SOC Analyst apprenticeship vs support role with twice the pay,AmicableHooman,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tb49zw/soc_analyst_apprenticeship_vs_support_role_with/,"I may have to choose between the following:

Option A. 

Desktop Engineer or ""Helpdesk"" role paying $65k to $70k a year, one of which would be fully remote, the other is remote only partially. 

Option B. 

SOC Analyst internship for 1 year, but it only pays $15 per hour at the start then a slight raise after 6 months. I would however be able to work overtime. Potential to obtain full time position with the same company. 

Doing the math, the other jobs are TWICE the apprenticeship's pay. Pay is important to me, however, I feel like the apprenticeship could potentially allow for me to eventually get a job paying that $60k-$70k salary, and work in the cyber security industry which has been a goal of mine for a while. I would be financially sound (not necessarily as comfortable)but I'd have to dial back some of my spending. 

I'm struggling on this decision because obtaining a cyber job without cyber job experience has been challenge, despite having the CompTIA Trifecta/4 years of support roles. 

How realistic is my expectation of getting a job after the apprenticeship, and have any of you acquired certs while in a support role and moved onto cyber jobs?  What choice would you make?"

I recently was talking to a friend that’s a programmer and that got me interested in it. I’m an Electrican and I just recently got married so sometimes it gets difficult to find time to study but I do try to at least alittle when I can. But I think if I could find something like an internship that could help. Thank you in advance

I am a junior but literally ~1.5 semesters behind in my major, will be graduating Dec 2023. My qualifications are equivalent to that of the average sophomore engineering student and possibly even less. 

One thing that stood out to me was that a majority of engineering intern positions have 100+ applicants within hours.

I really don’t want to waste my time applying to positions like these, so are there any other beneficial things from LinkedIn I could use to ultimately benefit my career? 

I think it’s unhealthy for me to make the wrong assumption right off the bat so I’m curious to see if there are genuine opportunities for a student like me, specifically."

tb6zlo,68,2022-03-10,UBC or Stanford as a CS major (both full pay),ComprehensiveFee6100,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tb6zlo/ubc_or_stanford_as_a_cs_major_both_full_pay/,"Hi I’m asking for input as I’m trying to decide if the additional cost to Stanford would be worth it. My other option would be the University of British Columbia. Thanks for your time!

TL;DR is Stanford worth an additional 200k?

Some info about me
- Canadian citizen 
- Planning to major in CS + interested in startups
- Family can foot the bill given that I pay most of the difference back when I enter the workforce
- no plans to go to grad school 

UBC
Pros
- boils down to about 200k cheaper
- fewer concerns about student visas and business incorporation
- more familiar environment as a Canadian 

Cons
- I entered through UBC Arts so I am not guaranteed to graduate with a CS major (I’d have to maintain a given GPA and fulfill requirements)
- the environment and student life is a bit large, impersonal, and not really my preference
- no guaranteed housing after first year and Vancouver housing is extremely expensive so this could boil down to unforeseen costs
- fewer opportunities for CS and especially startups though Vancouver still has a decent startup economy
- I may regret not taking the opportunity to go to Stanford 


Stanford
Pros
- I’m able to take any major I wish and therefore I’m pretty much guaranteed to be able to graduate with CS as my major 
- there are a lot of opportunities for CS and startups—best in the world opportunities that could be hard to replicate anywhere else 
- I really like the culture there for the most part, alongside the small class sizes 
- I think going here would allow me to feasibly graduate with rather good job offers with salaries that can eventually pay back loans 
- the weather LOLOL (though UBC has decent weather too)


Cons
- expensive and would put a dent monetarily, meaning I may have to spend time focusing on my career for a few years rather than “settle down”
- it may be hard for me to do exchange programs or other forms of student exploration if I’m primarily concerned about money (though I plan on getting internships and being involved in student life, clubs, orgs)
- the Bay Area can result in expensive living costs 


Thanks!"

The salary for both are about the same, so that isn't a factor. Furthermore, both are remote.

At Ford, I'll be able to collaborate as a SWE in the following spaces: Connected vehicles, autonomous vehicles, ford pass, sync, and Fintech.

At Optum, however, I may not even be placed in a software engineering position as they have multiple tracks they can place you such as Data science, data analytics, infrastructure, product management, security, etc.

So, what do you guys think is the better position?

I knew she was going through some issues with her career but didn't realise the extent of it. For background she was trying to pass CA exams and had already attempted it 3-4 times but had failed. It clearly bothered her but she avoided the topic so I gave her the space

She took a gap year after graduation to try an internship in fashion designing which I was supportive of but hated it and left it which I was supportive of too. She then took a job at as an accountant for a hospital chain but left within a year due to lack of growth and decided to do CFA which is an equally difficult course. I expressed my concerns due to her past experience but she accused of me demotivating her so I kept quiet. She cleared level 1 after 2 attempts and found herself a job but then quit abruptly. Failed level 2 and found new job which she quit abruptly again. Found another job worked for a year but quit now to try for level 2 again

In these past 4-5 years she has gained a lot of weight due to unhealthy eating habits. She said she plans to quit CFA now and will try to get an MBA degree from Canada and expects me to relocate there with her. I would be fine with it but given her past record I don't know what will happen. Her parents are trying to get her married to some NRI but she has rejected it. 

She is clearly struggling with depression and she knows it but refuses to talk about it and therapy is not an option because this is India. Whenever I try to bring up any topic I get accused of being critical and unsupportive. Help me on how to bring these issues up without offending her?"

tbadhu,2,2022-03-10,I've got my Sec+ and working towards my CCNA. Am I too old for an internship?,Nightcrawler227,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tbadhu/ive_got_my_sec_and_working_towards_my_ccna_am_i/,"I'm 38 and looking to break into IT field. Either security or networking. Both are interesting to me. My question is an I too old to apply for internships? I have a college degree, but have been graduated for a while. I just started researching internships and just thought I'd ask if I'm eating my time going this route or if it's even worth it. I have zero IT experience and thought that and internship would be a great way to get things started. 

I love this community page. Thanks everyone for all of your input!"
tbat4o,0,2022-03-10,How do I negotiate a salary in this odd situation? 7 months go by and everything has changed.,PyroMan314,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tbat4o/how_do_i_negotiate_a_salary_in_this_odd_situation/,"Hey all, I have a bit of a dilemma.

**About me:**

* **I have 2 tech degrees (Cyber Security), recently graduated.** Very high GPA.
* **I got an internship and job offer at a classified 3-letter agency, but sadly covid and other life factors ruined it**, I was not able to complete the security clearance because of this, not allowing me even to start the internship. They offered me a job anyways as long as I could finish the security clearance. They wanted me to move to a different base than we had agreed on and I couldn't do it. This whole process wasted 2 years of my workability as I was not allowed to apply for other positions at this time.
* **I have done a lot of HackTheBox and TryHackMe over the past few years.** I know my stuff relatively well given my lack of 'paid' experience.
* **I do however have club experience. I was a part of a cyber security club (3 years) that partnered with many big Fortune 500 companies.** We did real-life simulations, work, and learned from these experts in the field, but it was all unpaid. I still count this as job experience as it is relevant to my abilities. I even was told by my other recruiters I should count this as work experience, so I do.
* I have a lot of programming experience as a bonus too for someone in the cyber field.
* I take care of a big family, and I have pretty high bills, lots of rent(3 different rents), and medical bills. I'm also recently married! I'm pretty young. I have a kid on the way. **This is why I am here asking for help, I am very nervous and need to make sure I can provide for everyone in my life.**

**Here's the dilemma:**

* **Seven months ago**, I was told (by a recruiter) to apply for a job (Security Analyst) at this company and that they would start salary negotiations at 70k and could go up if needed. They also said they would pay me $2000 in relocation fees.
* **Currently, I am in Texas, they want me to move to Florida. The rent in this area has gone up 52%**. 7 months ago, I could buy a 3 bedroom apartment for 1500 on the beach, in a safe area. Now I can get a studio for $2400... Rent has gone up so much since we had last talked about salary.
* **On top of that, inflation has raised 8%, so I would assume the offer should too given it was 7 months ago.** I know it's pretty typical for 10% raises in tech right now given the inflation. 
* **The average salary for a Security Analyst in Flordia is 84k-100k depending on your reference. At this company, the salary range on glassdoor for this position is 71k-103k (this range has moved up since all these inflation and rent hikes for the area)**. 
* **I love this company and the people involved**, which is why I have stuck around for so long to try and get this job. I am dedicated to them. I had to go through the interview process, which took me a while given some other circumstances. And now I am finally at the end of it and I will be negotiating salary soon. I just want to ensure I am paid fairly and competitively for my position and for my family.
* **I would be moving to Florida for them!** They would be my only priority, I will work my ass off and give them my all. 

**How do I bring this all up? Their offer is so outdated and I hope they don't give me the same figures as before. I have a kid on the way too. How much do I ask for? What do you guys think? How do I navigate this situation and get the most out of it, all while being fair?**

Sorry for the long read, I really could use some help.

*TLDR: A job offer from 7 months ago is outdated due to rent hikes and inflation, how do I navigate this when I negotiate salary?*"

tbdwug,69,2022-03-10,Finally got a SWE job after a career switch at the age of 28,keeperclone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tbdwug/finally_got_a_swe_job_after_a_career_switch_at/,"I would like to thank the reddit community which really supported me emotionally as well as provided pretty much all the resources/information I needed to switch from a 5-year civil servant career (joined via a management trainee programme) into a software engineer in crypto-related tech firm. Although my previous salary before the switch was 70k and the entry software engineer role is offering me 62k (all values in USD, although I am located in HK), I am quite satisfied given my limited experience (also SWE in HK is generally not as treasured as in the US and Europe).

I am going to share a bit of my experience/opinion here in case you are someone who wants to do something similar, (if you disagree, please feel free to comment!!!):

\*\* Bootcamp vs MSc in CS \*\*

All knowledge and skills you need to land a job is available online for free or you can study via books. I picked MSc in CS over bootcamps because I find bootcamps are NOT value to money - I think if someone wants to do a bootcamp, I think why not just learn them yourself via books. On the other hand, a MSc degree gives you a lot of edge during CV screening in job applications especially from the HR side. So if you can afford it, study an MSc in CS.

\*\* How to get an interview -&gt; Importance of Projects \*\*

Since I am a career-switcher, I will not have any internship experience which means a good portfolio of projects are a MUST. In my experience, after I graduated with the MSc degree, I get much higher interview rate AFTER I build an impressive large scale project. When you build your project, try to find a book to guide you through it and when you build it, you should try to figure out the design pattern as well as try to build the project following with lots of unit testing. This is something that I did not do in my earlier projects! Sharing your design patterns and let them know you did unit testing will help you in your interview!

\*\* How to get through interviews \*\*

This is the part I had the most difficult parts, I had been asked System Design questions, Data Structure &amp; Algorithm (DS&amp;A) questions (and Probability, Maths &amp; Quant Finance) questions. They are really hard!!! Since the master degree may not cover these knowledge which is usually taught in Bachelor's, you have to make sure you train yourself up with design patterns and DS&amp;A. 

\*\* Leetcode \*\*

First, you should find a book or YouTube videos that cover topics by topics. ie. linked list, DFS. After you learned them, you should do leetcode questions BY TOPIC. This made a huge difference to me as by doing questions BY TOPIC, it allows you to see the pattern much easier. Also you should do Leetcode every day 1-2 questions at least 2 months prior your job applications.

\*\* Manage Expectations \*\*

Most salary you see in this subreddit is mainly covering US salaries. However, salaries NOT in the US is very different (significantly lower). 

\*\* Programming Language \*\*

I think you must learn two languages. Python is a MUST regardless which path you want to go to from SWE, web development, Quant or Data Science. You then need to pick your second language. For web dev is obviously JavaScript. But for the rest, I would strongly recommend C++. Learning C++ helped me understanding DS&amp;A significantly better and with a knowledge of C++, I found it possible to land job interviews that require C#, Java etc. Also C++ forces you to learn about computer architecture which is really useful! If you are doing an MSc in CS, learn both of the languages before you start.

\*\* Job App Stats \*\*

Total No. of Applications: 91

No. of rejections from CV screening: 18

No. of Interviews (unique to role): 19 

This shows my CV enables me to land approximately 51% of the interviews.

Application still pending: 37

Ongoing interviews: 9

Total Offers: 2

I got my first offer immediately after my graduation but the offer was not good. My latest offer is received 4.5 months after the end of my degree.

I wrote a lot and I probably should stop now. Feel free to comment to ask questions or you can PM too\~"

I was scrolling on Twitter and found some of my favorite companies hiring (both long-term and Intern) positions and while looking over the applications, I realized I don't know where to get the required experience/education.

I definitely plan on going to college eventually but I'm still working on getting money and would love to see if there are any smaller classes or videos I can learn from to help give me a head start. It doesn't need to be a big class like How to Animate 101 but learning things like computer programs that help with designing or composition work.

As I have never gotten the chance to visit campus in person, nor do I have anybody around me that attended UIUC to talk to, I will ask a good amount of questions, so please bear with me. 

The big question I've been pondering on for a while is the location. I am aware UIUC is in a college town, one of the best in the nation even. However, I was wondering if students ever grow tired of the college-bubble type atmosphere. Do students often visit Chicago, or is it a little too far with too little time? For the Grainger students, are the local internship opportunities solid? Do big tech companies from the west go and recruit for students often?

I was also curious what the process was like for those who entered as an undeclared engineering student, as that was what I got admitted for. For those who did the same, did you eventually get into your desired majors after your first year? How common is it for somebody to be undeclared at Grainger?

I am thinking either Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering, but not completely sure yet on which. Do a lot of the classes in CE and EE overlap at UIUC, and do CE students also take a handful of CS classes as well?

I heard midterms are going on right now, so I really appreciate the people who take their time to answer my unimportant questions lol"

tbnhbg,3,2022-03-11,On the edge of burnout,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/tbnhbg/on_the_edge_of_burnout/,"Hi guys! 

I wanted to share with you my  journey for the past 2 years of what I wanted to do with my career and how it turned out to not be what I wanted this leading to a lack of inspiration and motivation for me. 

Long story short I work in hospitality, in michelin star restaurants. I did a 1 year total internship in Spain during university and during the 2020 pandemic I finished my BA. In 2021 august I left my home country for the second time alone in London this time. I started very strong. All gas no breaks as they say. I was working hard, training bjj on my days off, lifting weights, visiting London, going to football games and even got a promotion in the first 6 months. As this may sound and look good at first after a few months after december I started to feel burnt out. Working 12-13 hour shift with 5-6 hours sleep in between shifts. With the promotion I got more money but it came with more hours worked. I work an average of 55-60 hours a week and also commuting for 45 mins each way. During working here I was also treated as a door mat a lot of the times. The managers saw that I am pushing and doing a very good job therefore I was the only one being asked to do favours like stay some OT or can you come earlier today at work the manager texting me at 7:30 am before that working 13 hours the day before. Don't know how I ended up here but I ended up just working and getting home absolutely dead tired. On my off days I have no motivation to go and workout or go to a bjj class. I ended up abusing weed smoking almost everyday. I stay home as well all day doing nothing because I am just to dead tired from these long shifts. The upside is that I am able to save some money but at what cost? My sleep is almost non existent (I put my alarm at 9:30 am and wake up at 7 and can't go back to sleep this while going to sleep at 2 am), I am losing a lot of weight because my appetite is very low I bearly eat anything all day. I feel very stuck and don't know what to do. My first decision would be to just quit and go back to my home country. But I don't know if I will regret this decision. 

I really don't know what to do and feel stuck. What do you guys suggest? Because by every week passed I just don't want more and more to not work in this field and in this country. I tried to also have a romantic life by going out on dates but every time we couldn't find common ground on our date time to meet. Or we would go on 1-2 dates but it would stop there. I had a shroom trip a week ago to help me lift my mood and have a bit of clarity in the way my emotions and thoughts flow through me. But after 2 days I was right back in the 13 hours grind shift. 

What do you guys suggest I do or how do you see this situation from an outside perspective? I feel it is not worth it to grind away my time, health, sleep and personal life for the £. On one side I win better money on the other side I have sacrificed my personal life, health and sleep for it. I also thought that I am wining like a wanker and always find excuses to my situation and try to claim responsibility. This would mean me continuing to work this job and forcing myself through this lack of sleep and lack of motivation to push through and go to train bjj, lift weight and go have a romantic life while working 60 hour weeks with 3 x  13 hours shifts and 2 x 10 hour shifts a week but inevitably this will lead to burnout. Or here as well maybe I'm just wining like a wanker should just shut the f up and keep moving forward. This is what most people tell me. ""Hey just shut up and work! When I was your age I would work 25 hours a day 366 days a year!"" That's literally what people tell me when I ask for support. (I'm 24 btw).

 

Don't know what to do right now and I became desperate. The thing is if I quit for my wellbeing and go back to my home country my mind/ego views this as a major failure and this automatically make me suffer even more because I was the one who wanted to come to london and work this job not knowing in what I'm getting into. 

 

Sorry for the long post guys. Any response is welcomed! Thanks!"

I’ve not had a technical interview before so I was quite nervous! 

Luckily the questions were ok, the first one required me to implement FizzBuzz which I did very quickly. The second one required me to write a program that checked whether when given two words, if one word was a permutation of the other. Unfortunately the method I’d thought out in my head didn’t work out as intended, so I panicked a bit and tried something off-the-cuff. In the end my function was close to completion but not 100% working. It was a bit frustrating as this is something I’d could easily implement outside of an interview setting.

I then had to answer some questions about OOP, which was fine. Then I had a general behavioural/my past experience round with the UX designer which went great! He even said he thought I was a good fit for the role. 

So I’m keeping my fingers crossed! I really, really want this internship. I just hope the guy that did the technical round with me goes easy on me for making mistakes and blanking due to me being nervous.

I gotta admit, reading these success stories on self-taught developers really kept me going on days when it was tough. Ty Reddit &lt; 3.

I’m in my mid 20’s. I have a degree from social sciences. Was actually starting to build a really nice career, but then made a complete U-turn in life. Quit my job and went full-time study mode.

So, I started the journey in the beginning of January 2021. I went from knowing absolutely nothing about programming to today, 11th March 2022- the day when I landed a junior developer role.

I did code a lot. Probably 3/4 of my journey it was 7 days a week, 6-12 hours a day.

**Timeline**

1-9 months: watched/solved tutorials for five months, practiced 4 months doing personal projects. For the first three months I learned Java, then switched to frontend.

10-12 months: managed to land a front-end internship thanks to my portfolio. It was unpaid. Did everything and more at that place. Was humble &amp; asked constantly for more work. Found out later that it was not good place for interns. Declined politely the exit interview.

13-14 months: started applying again, landed an interview at a very hot place out here in my country. Spent easily (actually learned) over 50 hours on take-home task. Had to basically learn backend (frameworks, bases etc) for that, because my only knowledge was that I knew some plain Java.

Got really good feedback. Proceeded to further rounds and ended up getting the job.

**Mind/Emotions**

For me, it was a total roller coaster. It went from being completely hopeless, not having the finest idea what needs to be done in order to complete some X problem to brighter days when the belief started to grow day by day to a point, where it was not  ‘if’ I’m gonna do it but ‘when’.

**Resources/tutorials**

In my personal experience they do not matter In the end. Yes, there are some which are better, but-  if you do not practice these skills, which you supposedly ‘gained’, you won’t know sh\*t. I was stuck in the tutorial hell for five months.

Learn by expressing aka Googling your thoughts/problems is the way to go, not to watch a video and rewrite the code you see.

* Java - [MOOC](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)
* HTML, CSS - used YouTube mostly.
* JS - [Brad Traversy’s Modern Javascript](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/)
* React - [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). It was 5 hours long the time I did it.

**Conclusion**

There are going to be days when you feel more than completely overwhelmed. Maybe you won’t get a certain topic for month(s)- but that’s the exact time when you grow the most. Embrace the struggle, you’ll get past the impossible to grasp type days.

Set a strict goal.  For me it was to become a developer and land a job, plain and simple. And the best thing is that to this day I REALLY like programming, especially the challenging times.

&amp;#x200B;

You either want it or not. And if you quit, let me tell you- you are not dumb, you just decided to give up. That's all.

I’m hella excited. This is just the beginning, ladies and gentlemen.

If you have any questions, i would love to answer them."

They have a test for me to complete due on the 17th and I get to choose from a variety of languages what to complete the test on. I learned on Turing but they don’t have that, so the next easiest one is either python 2 or PHP."

tbvywx,1,2022-03-11,Collague accuses me of using drugs during work,pfffrt2000,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tbvywx/collague_accuses_me_of_using_drugs_during_work/,"I am a 21(f) student social work in The Netherlands and I’ve been working at a medical shelter for undocumented refugees in Amsterdam for about 4 weeks now. The shelter I am working for is my internship and I have to work here till end of May. 

Last week I had a conversation with a collague of mine. He’s an older male (44) and we were talking about many different topics. I was telling him how I was feeling about my future (after getting a bachelor) and how I don’t really know what to do after I finish this studies. I also told him about partying during the weekends and how I sometimes use party dr*gs, I was talking about molly and how I know this can affect your dopamine and serotonin. I was also telling him about me wanting to seeing a therapist for a long time regarding my future and more life topics.

This monday I was working and another collague of mine f(25-28yrs old?) tells me that I have something white in my nose. I wipe it and then she tells me again that it’s there. After a couple hours (I think) she tells me wants to talk me for a bit. She proceeds to take me apart in a small office and asks me what that supposedly white stuff on my nose was, I tell her that I have a cold and have a runny nose. (It’s happened before that I had dried snot like a toddler on my nose, so I didn’t think about this issue deeply)

Then on Thursday (the same week) this same collague f(25-28 yrs) tells me she wants to have a short conversation with me. During this conversation she proceeds to tell me that “we both know, that this wasn’t from a runny nose, and this really was a white powder” and how she talked to our male collague and he had been saying that he is worried about me. 

She then tells me she has experience in addiction treatment. In this moment I feel very sick and start crying heavily because of this accusation. I tell her that i recreationally use drgs, but would never use it during the week or at work or school and how I’d never would but my career in danger like that.

She then says “we can’t have staffmembers walking around with white powder on their nose with our clients, what must our clients think?” 

After this emotional and heavy conversation, she told me she’d speak to her manager and would call me back the same day. And I get sent home. I then get a call and my female collague tells me that it’s best to have a discussion with my teacher involved.

Later that day I have a conversation with my teacher and the collague f(25-28) accusing me. My teachers asks my collague if she has seen other odd behaviours and my collague can’t really think of one. My collague says I’m dreamy but it must be a character trait, my teacher responds with that isn’t how people act when they are on drugs. 

Then we get to the conclusion that we dismiss this issue. My collague f(25-28) finishes the conversation by saying “even if it was true then I assume it won’t happen in the future” and I tell her that this won’t happen because it never happened in the first place and I’d never do something like this.

I am very distraught and I feel kind of unsafe now. It triggered my anxiety and I woke up last night, because of this issue. 

Any advice that you could give me?"
tbx4y8,4,2022-03-11,What skills should a sophomore applying for internships have?,clinical27,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tbx4y8/what_skills_should_a_sophomore_applying_for/,"I did not even attempt to try for an internship this summer since I'm working my job and I'm doing summer classes, but I'd love to try and get an internship between sophomore and junior year. 

I'll preface by saying I'm a community college student, so if this is an issue or vice versa (could help me), I'd love to hear why.

I have taken an intro to CS class, and right now I'm taking a DSA class and a computer organization class, and this Fall I'll be taking discrete math. So 4 CS classes in total before I transfer.

Aside from that what are some good things I should do? I figure try and make one or two decent side projects that show I'm passionate about CS.

I am not looking to land some FAANG crazy shit, I'd just like to do something over the summer that isn't a basic part-time job. How hard is it to get internships at lesser known, small companies and whatnot? Do I have a shot if I'm not grinding LCs and a beast at coding? I know most internships are geared towards juniors."

I don't want to have to juggle teaching myself both python and java, but I really have no choice, and I can't help but feel like I'm way behind especially since I want an internship by next summer"
tbymvv,10,2022-03-11,TIFU by falling in love with a close friend of mine,GraylyFever,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/tbymvv/tifu_by_falling_in_love_with_a_close_friend_of/,"Okay, so on December 2021, I (20M) started talking more to this old friend of mine (21F, let's call her B) that I used to see every day back in high school and who has kinda been in my life for the past 4 years, but we weren't really close friends back then or anything so we didn't talk much at all and even though she has always been super attractive that wasn't enough for me to be interested in her.

So we started talking due to me getting close to her bestie a few months earlier (21F, let's call her C) and it was pretty normal at first. Me and B discussed about some personal matters that were affecting both mine and her lives, we talked about geek stuff (cus I found out she's kind of a geek like me), things like that. After that started, all three of us went to watch the Spider-Man movie in theaters and afterwards we had dinner and talked A LOT. And I mean, things were going great after that, all three of us even went on a video call to watch movies and talk a bit a few times, and as a guy who doesn't have many girl-friends it was awesome to be able to hang out with them. Plus, B is kinda great. She's intelligent, has amazing virtues, is very talkative, but something about her just really says it all, you know?

Yeah, so now comes the part of why I decided to come here. About one month after me and B started talking, I realised I had developed this kind of... affection... to her. Not really like ""being in love"" but more like I wanted to ask her out just to see how she'd react, I don't know, I just wasn't IN LOVE. And so C's birthday came and she had a gathering so I decided to stay last to talk to her about it since she's B's best friend and maybe could lend me a hand on the matter. It was a good conversation, I mean she didn't really react to it the way I thought she would, she was pretty okay about it, but she told me to wait until I'm certain before I invite B to go out since, well, a lot has happened to B regarding the dating/falling in love subject. And I did know that. For an instance, one of my former close friends actually almost had something going on with her, they both liked each other and both admitted that but then he did something (I don't know what exactly) and it ended really really bad before it even began and it was the reason why B started seeing a therapist in the first place. And I tell you, from what she told me in our conversations, at that time she was doing BAD, dude. Her mind was absolutely wrecked. And I mean, this happened almost 1 year and a half ago and B is only starting to set her life straight now, going back to college, going to driving school, putting herself out there really.

Anyways, C's birthday was in the middle of January. From February on, me and B kept in touch and now we stay in a video call sometimes to watch this tv show C doesn’t like but we also talk for a considerable amount of time before and after that, which is nice. We talk about a lot of subjects and, the thing is, I've never been with a girl, like... in any way. And I told her that and she gave me advice on how to date and all. She's the only girl-friend I've had who actually told me some things in order to help me out. She told me about a lot of experiences she'd had with guys asking her out and all, which didn't surprise me since even though she's more of a closed person, she is really attractive (as I said before).

So it's March now, and my ""affection"" to her has grown to ""being (madly) in love"" with her. Nice job. And I'm just really really frustrated because I do not know what to do. I don't want to break her again and I'm just afraid that this is what's gonna happen if another close friend of hers (me, in that case) shares his feelings with her. Right now I'm 20 and I have to focus on my life. I've never had a job or anything, I'm bascially a financial dead-weight for my parents right now and I have sooo many academic issues I need to deal with along with trying to get an internship and personal matters but I cannot focus on any of this because I just think of B and how much I wanna tell her how I feel. But at the same time I'm afraid I'm gonna lose her to someone else and that fear is becoming true. Yesterday she posted in her Instagram cf stories that she went to a soccer game and her crush from college was there and they kind of exchanged looks from afar and that she liked it. I read that at 2AM and it was going to be the last thing I did right before shutting my eyes but after that I started getting really intense and afraid of losing her and it took me like 2 hours to sleep. And now I'm here.

I mean, I really wanna talk to her about it even if she doesn't feel the same, I just need to get it out of my chest. But I also have the feeling that we'll lose everything we built to this point as friends, things between me and C might get weird as well since they're best friends and again what if B has a meltdown again. 

I seriously don't know what to do. If you have any advice/different view of the problem, please share. I hope I've been able to provide as many details as possible.

TL;DR: fell in love with a very close friend of mine. She might not take it well if I tell her though but I really want to"

x58 msi pro e (last freshly coocked batch)
24 Gb of ddr3 RAM clocked at 1517 Mhz (dont ask^^)
Intel Xeon e5649 i7 @ 3.8 Ghz 
GTX 1060 MSI Gaming 6GB 
The rest is sound, airflow, some HDD some SSD

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes...? What a strange thing to ask^^ But I´m certain I havent understood them all.


So I bought myself an 1080p odyssey g3 144hz monitor, for kinda cheap. 180 euro. 

Beforehand I was still gaming on a monitor meant for work. Sorry meant for the intern you despise. 22"", but a quick 20 euro replacement that stayed somehow. 

In a rush of life given hurry, my brain told me to start looking for a monitor in the ballpark of 200 euro. At first it had to be a 1440p Monitor, just because i could still game on 1080p, right? Or so I thought. The ""inter upscaling technologie"", needed for it to function properly was added in the next generation of cards. Bummer, but for 200 (lets just say ""bucks"" from now on my german fingers are driving me nuts typing this in a sleepy but rather alert state of mind) that was a dream anyways.

Here comes the villain of the story. Odyssey g3. Bingo! I knew the bad reviews of some customers, just wanted to try it out and give it back, just because of how bad it´ll probably be. Turns out that was a mistake. It´s very much to my liking, sturdy and adjustable (back and neck problems) a bit bigger (like in texas) and I fell in love with the 144hz. A bit of ghosting, not that bad. But the smearing....

For the life of me I can´t live with the smearing. Gaming is cool until you first see it. Juggle a red icon around, boom watercooler painting. With a broken heart (that will break once I have to ship it back in 10 days) I have to ship it back.

Please tell me, in this see of misinformation and overpriced garbage, there is a light burning somewhere? My SO is looking at me like I´m a puppy that got it´s waggy tail hurt, or something similar. 

With afore mentioned puppy eyes I got myself a budget of around 250 bucks. I would even say 300, but my rig being an antique that still runs the iron man every day, I don´t really want to invest too much in 1080p. A GPU is out of the question. Even investing in a monitor is, but just because of my rig personally and me not having won the lotto, yet. 

But since going back will drive me nuts in the not so distant future, there has to be a good alternative, right? I do game mostly on it and my expections are mostly tied to my newly aquired ""standards"", yes I heard somwhere that people had those. I know I have to make compromises. But is it really either painting with water coolers, or have no saturation at all?

I am open to opinions and suggestions, andecdotal advice. Since i can now paint, I will paint it accordingly.

Man, I DO write some weird sentences somtimes, sorry bout that!

Tldr: 1080p 144hz Alternative for my Odyssey g3. 250 bucks   or more, less is better. I can't see through all these different alternatives without loosing my crip on reality. I can build PCs, but I can't find a monitor, what's wrong."

I picked up Python and did some general stuff, now decided to do a data science course, and I guess I am at a point where I want to decide... What should I learn with Python? Data science? Web development (backend? frontend?).

My initial impression is that data science would probably be the only ""specialization"" that would be somewhat useful for my current academic interests as well but would it be harder to get a job in it vs software development, web design etc.? 

I'll take any advice I can get. Thank you."

On a whim I applied to the 1 year combined BS/MS program at my school and looks like (knock on wood) that I'll get in. 

I also did applications for **New Grad** positions this cycle, and I got offers from some pretty big names, but my main considerations are Meta and Two Sigma. I already talked to both recruiters and they said they would be able to convert the full time offers to internship offers if I stayed for the MS program. 

I understand that from a career progression perspective, doing the MS is pretty much useless. However, I like learning and I like being with my friends, all of whom are either doing the MS or just taking all 4 years to graduate. 

So, I think my *childish* (that's almost how I see it) desire is to do the 1 year masters. Convert 2S or Meta to internship and then pop off and get return offer. 

One of my parental figures says that doing the 1 yr masters is useless and can only hurt me (thinks chances that job opportunities for new grads might be significantly worse cause oversaturation of new grads &amp; war might get economy to shit). 

1. I just wanna hear some thoughts about whether I should indulge this desire or be a responsible adult and go to work. (Take MS or go full time?)
2. In terms of Meta and Two Sigma, which one and why? (My thought is 2S cause Meta stock going down and I kinda wanna try Fintech).

I know most ppl on here are TC fiends, but I'm just thinking about my general satisfaction with life and college. Most of my college experience was online and I like in person + friends lol.

TLDR; Have great offers for new grad (meta and 2 sigma), but kinda wanna stay in BS/MS program for 1 year (still graduating in 4) for fun. Should I?"

 I interviewed for a job with the two open positions on the relevant team. I was a top-two finalist but was initially rejected for the first spot for a more experienced internal hire. I was a new grad, but they liked me enough to call me back for the second available position but told me they did not have the budget to onboard me as a salaried full time for at least a couple months. They suggested I join them as an ""intern"" so they could pay me under their internship program, and they would convert me after a couple moths as budget kicked in.

I was trained, treated, and spoken to like the full-time third member of the team and my workflow and job assignment did not change from the ""intern"" period to the full time period. Of course, they said that conversion would give us both optionality (and allow us to understand if we liked each other), but I knew what was really going on. 

My question: I stayed at the company for 9 months (2 months as an ""intern""), I have since moved on. Considering the context behind my intern title, is it acceptable to merge the experiences on my resume under the full time title (which just dropped the intern part, i.e. Analyst intern to Analyst)? 

I wrote all the bullet points on my resume as an ""intern"", again, because nothing changed and it was more a probationary period than anything. I never interviewed to be an intern.

I am wondering if I should still try to go for summer internships this summer? Looking around, the highest intern pay per hour for any sort of data science/dev work in NZ (from what I have heard from friends) is about $30 per hour which is about my current salary.

I am interested in data science and quant trading. Currently I think the only way I can get paid higher is if I get a quant trading internship in australia, however, I doubt a part-time role can be secured their unlike my current company.

However, money aside, does it make sense to stay at one company at such a pivotal stage of my career or should I perhaps jump around and try other roles and/or companies even if I take a slight pay cut?

My current position is really independent  and I feel that I could do with more guidance but I guess I get to do more 'meaningful' projects than bigger companies.

I’ve been working with my company since May 2021. When I took the job there were things I liked about it (pay raise, increased responsibility, values and missions aligned with mine). I knew it wasn’t quite what I wanted, but it seemed ok, and I desperately needed to escape my last job.

So… I wanna leave. It’s really not the kind of work I wanna do long term, and the commute is bad. 2x a week, it’s an hour and 40 mins each way by train. The other days, it’s about an hour and 15. I’d decided to quit in July (I’m supervising an intern who will be leaving then and want to stay for her, and also not leave my team in a bind). I was going to give my boss a few months notice, b/c why not, and also because my position is hard to hire for. I wasn’t quite sure what I’d tell my boss, honestly, I knew that she’d have a hard time accepting it and keep trying to find a way to make things work, and make things even more uncomfortable. 

A few weeks ago, my sister, who lives across the country, announces she’s pregnant. I miss my family, I miss home, and wanna spend time with baby. So, my plan became to tell my boss that I’m quitting so I have more freedom to go back and forth to see my family (I think this will be path of least resistance, I work at a hospital, my job can be done remotely, but it’s really best in person. Also, it will be hard for her to argue about me missing my family). My sister said I could start telling ppl about the pregnancy in April, so I planned to give my notice then. 

NOW: my sister has said I can announce the pregnancy now. AND I just found out that one of my coworkers is quitting. There are only three people in my department (There are supposed to be five but we’re short staffed). My coworker wants to stay, but her job is being phased out and the company couldn’t find an acceptable alternative for her. Fortunately, she’s been made an offer at another company, and it’s fully remote.
So, I’m guessing I should just give my notice now? I doubt my coworker will want my position because it requires more travel than hers.  But sigh I dunno.

tcf3d2,1,2022-03-12,Any particular advice for International Students finding their first jobs in finance?,ContributionWhole850,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tcf3d2/any_particular_advice_for_international_students/,"TLDR; I am a high school student looking for advice on how to navigate the hurdles of visa sponsorship when I graduate in order to find a full time job in finance, in any English-speaking country.

Hello, I am actually still in high school, but am planning to pursue my undergraduate education outside my home country. I have consulted my parents, friends, school career counselor, etc on this same matter but also thought about getting perhaps a different insight from reddit.

I recognise the fact that wherever I go, visa sponsorship will always be in a pertinent issue and I have to always need to try and prove myself on how I am worth all the time, money and effort to be sponsored. But as I will be a fresh graduate, I don't really know what I can do to distinguish myself from work-authorised local applicants and more experienced and qualified candidates from abroad. And it may be a greedy thing to ask for, especially being an international student who originally came to that country only for education. But my home country is rife with corruption at every level and job opportunities so scare, so I look abroad. I want to minimise the impact that visa sponsorship has on my career growth and progression, even though it is still unavoidable.

I would like to pursue a career in finance instead of areas like software engineering or computer science, which will simply make things difficult for me to not get an education in high demand technical fields. But I would rather work hard for a field that I have a passion in, rather than the money in something that I do not like. I am aware that I am still a high school student and things will still change, but I want to take action from now on itself.

So as I am still in a position to decide on where and what to study, I would like to obtain any valuable information or insights that can give me the greatest opportunities to pursue the career I want to. Finance is a broad field, so I am still narrowing it down. Apart from general advice such as going to target schools, getting finance-based internships and joining similar clubs, networking, do you have advice for international students in particular? How can we distinguish ourselves as appealing candidates? For the sake of work experience, should we get unpaid internships? What kind of major should we choose to maximise our opportunities? If you once were an international student, I would love to hear your advice as well!

Also, there is no one specific country that I am looking for. Although, advice relating to anglosphere (English-speaking) countries should be the most relevant to my situation, but I am still open to learning other cultures and languages as well, if it helps.

Thank you for your time!"

tciond,135,2022-03-12,I'm a senior in high school and have a technical phone assessment with Dropbox in a week for a full-time position. Looking for feedback on my 7-day study plan.,theSummit12,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tciond/im_a_senior_in_high_school_and_have_a_technical/,"Edit: I can't believe it but I got an internship offer from Coinbase! 

First off, I am not trying to brag. I understand I am very lucky to be in this situation. I apologize if this comes off as arrogant, but I really am looking for advice. 

I got a coding assessment from Coinbase, but it turns out it is for a full-time position (this is a problem because I am going to college next year). I thought why not do it and maybe if I get through the interviews they will let me just be an intern. So, I studied DS&amp;A and LC for the past week in preparation for the Hackerrank assessment. I completed it today and passed all the test cases.

Last week, a recruiter from Dropbox reached out to me on Linkedin saying I was a great fit for a position she is trying to fill. I had my phone screen today, and she said she would move me forward in the interview process. However, I learned that this is also a full-time role. I explained to her that I will be in college next year, and she said that I could still go through the interviews and that if I passed I wouldn't have to take them again when I re-apply for the internships for next summer. My phone technical interview is next Friday.

Now I know what ur thinking “how tf is this possible”?. I have a lot of experience but honestly I have no idea either. Maybe the recruiter just didn’t realize I’m in high school and now she’s gonna ghost me? Or maybe not? Idk 

I've decided I will spend next week (which is my spring break) grinding Leetcode and DSA. Right now I can solve most easy LC problems but not any medium ones without some help or peeking the answer.

Here is my 7 day study plan: 

# One Week Study Plan

## Every Day

- [ ]  Watch youtube video on each topic (if none, read EPI chapter)
- [ ]  Watch youtubers solve problems with that topic
- [ ]  Do leetcode problems on that topic
- [ ]  Complete previous probelems I couldn’t solve on my own"

Recently i received offers from atlassian and sofi and was curious which offer would be better for me in the long run. My two main priorities are resume value for new grad recruiting and new grad salary if i were to return full time! 

PLEASE comment if you have any insight!!

Atlassian ($53/hr, $3000 stipend):
San francisco, CA

Pros:
- big company name value
- extremely good work life balance, flexible schedules, flexible work locations (SF, NY, Remote)
- very high intern to full time conversion rate
- lots of benefits
-$180k-220k new grad salary
- 4.3 rating on blind (one of the highest)

Cons: 
- some people on blind say that the pay can be less competitive, but could be outdated
- only $3000 housing stipend?? 

SoFi ($50/hr, $5000 stipend)
San Francisco, CA

Pros:
- potential to grow huge as its relatively new (the biggest factor for me to consider)
- very good intern to full time conversation 
- $190k+ new grad salary
- probably more fast paced thus learning more (?)

Cons:
- not much information on the internship program here
- lots of mixed reviews
- low blind rating
- not as known as a brand name

You guys can do this!,Phat_Huz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/tcn2ms/just_got_an_internship_you_guys_can_do_this/,"Whats up guys, I'm a mechanical engineering major in their fifth and last year and to say that this major has been hard would be an understatement. After three failed classes, numerous mental breakdowns and countless hours of studying and feeling like I would never finish my degree Im seeing the light at the end of the tunnel! I just accepted an internship for a manufacturing engineering position this summer. In addition, this morning I was also notified that I made it to the second and final interview round of an aerospace engineering internship and I also secured an interview for another company later this week.

In total, Ive sent out 20 applications, have gotten officially rejected from three, obtained three total interviews and am waiting to hear from the rest. 

My GPA is around 3.13/4 and in all honesty, Ive never been the best academically and I chose not to pursue an emphasis. However, I have a few tips that I believe really helped with securing my internship. 

* Use the engineering resume subreddit. This was more helpful than any meeting with career coaches that I ever had. Just make sure you review the resources the subreddit provides in regards to formatting as well as the STAR method for your experience descriptions. 
* Once you'r resume it built, spend some time creating a good LinkedIn profile. Theres lots of job positions on there and sometimes people will even reach out to you. 
* Lastly, ""cold calling"" people on LinkedIn has been great in my experience. Find a company you'r interested in working for or one that you applied to and message someone in the department that you'r applying to for a 15 minute phone call to talk ABOUT THE COMPANY. Don't get on the call and say ""I applied to this position, can you put in a good word for me"", bur rather ask about their experience at the company, how the work environment is and general company info. This will give you way more to talk about in the interview than just going to the company webpage to find out about them. Sometimes, if you'r lucky the person who you called will mention you to the hiring manager and will specifically ask that they interview you. Half the battle is securing an interview. 

Thats all I got. For any of you struggling, just know everything will pay off as long as you keep trying and don't give up!"

*Below is the research abstract I was able to send to the admission office:*

**Abstract**

The AAA+ ATPase, p97, also referred to as VCP, belongs to the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA) family, which is essential for various processes such as DNA replication, the regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and more. Furthermore, p97 plays a role as the key regulator of protein homeostasis, which involves an extensive network of pathways that regulates the conformational stability of proteins and significantly affects cellular growth and survival. Because of its role in protein homeostasis, many researchers have been pursuing p97 as an ideal targeted protein for developing anti-cancer agents. Recent efforts in studying p97 have resulted in the discovery of several potential inhibitors, including Dibenzylquinazolines, Alkylsulfanyl-1,2,3-triazoles, Tetrahydrocarbazoles, Pyrazolo\[3,4-d\]pyrimidines, and NMS-859. Although many compounds have been identified as potential candidates for protein inhibition, drug-resistant mutations in cancer cells have imposed a challenge upon targeted cancer therapy.

Virtual screening has become an increasingly essential tool in assisting lead discovery due to its cost-effectiveness and efficiency. In contrast to traditional experimental methods of drug discovery, virtual screening is a set of computational techniques which analyzes collections of compounds in search of potential candidates. In this study, we identified potential p97 inhibitors from the National Cancer Institute collection of current FDA-approved anticancer drug-like compounds. By using molecular docking technique, our goal is to discover a potent small molecule inhibitor of p97 with drug-like properties to allow for the clinical development of targeting this key regulator of protein homeostasis as a promising approach in cancer treatment.

**Essay Topics:**

1. How losing my grandmother to cancer inspired me to start a charity supporting the lives affected by cancer as it brought comfort to me by doing what I could no longer do for my grandmother, and the impact of being the founder of Cancer Relief Foundation has on my life and personal growth.
2. As the founder of Cancer Relief, I firsthand saw the childhood of many young children getting stolen by the word ""cancer"", and many unfortunately ran out of treatment. I wrote about how this has sparked my passion for medicine and research, and that led me to obtaining an internship at a biomedical cancer research lab at CalTech where I work with a postdoctoral on a research on the potential inhibitors of p97 protein.
3. My migrant heritage and my gratitude for my immigrant parents and the life that they have gifted me."

tcptle,1,2022-03-12,concerning big changes are coming to my first service desk job,kenjitamurako,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tcptle/concerning_big_changes_are_coming_to_my_first/,"I'm in my first help desk job and it's for a company that calls itself ""like a startup"".  They never had an official help desk before and are building it out as they're a growing company of fewer than 250 employees.  The company itself has existed in some form since 1935 but were bought out and branched into a different market while maintaining their legacy operations that no longer see any new business.

I am A+, Net+, Sec+ certified and have been with them for about seven months now as a level 1.  The first few months I felt like I learned a lot but it was incredibly stressful as there were little actual training resources.  In recent months it has felt like I'm learning little of value on the job but it's still incredibly stressful as they're preparing for big changes.

They've decided they want to expand the operations of the service desk to include single point of contact, 24/7 incident response management, and have the service desk personnel be on-call to support these changes.

We currently have an intern, a level 1, level 2, and a coordinator and that's the entire service desk.

We've already had single point of contact implemented and it was with the implementation of a user-portal where anyone can submit one of two types of tickets:  An incident and a request.  It then falls to the service desk to evaluate the priority of any incident and get it routed to the correct project in Jira.  They implemented these changes without testing the portal itself as they don't have a test environment for Jira and it has left us with a time-consuming manual ticket routing process that is still going to be changing.

Their plan for on-call seems to be to just roll out pager duty alerts for any call or high priority labelled ticket that comes in after hours with our current members and hire more personnel as needed if it turns out to be overwhelming.  The companies internal documentation isn't very good so the ""hire more personnel"" part doesn't alleviate my concerns because in practice it's going to just be an increase in my workload to train while still trying to keep up with the increased workload from these changes.

What really worries me is the incident response part though.  We've been increasingly seeing our services becoming unusable for extended periods of time and this incident response plan is in response to that.  

One of our major internal services was down for seven hours just a few days ago and it turned out it was because the main process in the container was no longer running, it took them that long to identify it.

The week before last almost all of our internal services were down for a couple of days and operations were completely crippled.  A third party service we rely on was having problems and it turns out that the developers have added so little resiliency that even functionality that shouldn't rely on that service was failing because API calls to the service were timing out.

We're still being told by that third party service provider they're not certain what caused the outage.  A quick google search of them brought up mentions from some reviewers that mention these kind of outages have been common for them.

For the incident response portion it will include alerting all parties involved as well as asking them for details of the incident to put together company-wide statements that we'll need to have approved by several others before they can be released.  It will then be the responsibility of the service desk to reach out every half hour during the incident to all involved parties for possible updates.

The communication about compensation for these changes has been as negative as the changes themselves.  There's been no mention of a base pay raise for the increased responsibilities and the on-call work itself is going to be 1/12 your base pay an hour for being on-call and time and a half for the work done while on-call.  The compensation talks are still being managed by the service desk coordinator and the other day he joked ""Don't worry I'll be sure you're getting paid for this and that it's not pro-bono"".

Should I just go ahead and start looking for another job?  I had wanted to hit the one year mark at least for my resume before looking for a place where I would feel like I could learn more IT focused skills on the job.  Right now all of my on the job learning is focused on learning the internal layout of the company for single point of contact and incident management and it's depressing because most of what I learn is specific to this company and also feels like it was something tacked onto my other responsibilities with little actual benefit to me."
tcqdzv,1,2022-03-12,What is the best way to break into the tech industry?,NonFuiNonCuro,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tcqdzv/what_is_the_best_way_to_break_into_the_tech/,"Prior to college, I learned a small amount of programming and I had considered pursuing a degree in Computer Science. However, my parents talked me in to majoring in Mechanical Engineering (the degree my dad has). Their argument essentially being that you can always teach yourself to program and get a job in tech; but you can't teach yourself to design a bridge and then be hired to design a bridge. 

During my sophomore year in college I landed a M.E. co-op (three semester internship which alternates between school and work), where I basically spent the entirety of the first semester writing scripts/programs to automate various tasks. I considered switching majors again at that point, but I was advised that doing so would probably cost me my co-op. My scholarship had been postponed the previous semester, but I was told that postponement was subject to review if the co-op wasn't successfully completed. I also would not be eligible to apply for any other internships through the University \[they made a big deal about this when we were going through the process of signing up\]. I ultimately completed my co-op and even caught the attention of one of my company's VPs, who invited me to the HQ for a special project. 

Then 2nd semester junior year I found a part time (20 hours a week) consulting job with a local company that I could work through the University's ""Productivity Center"". I set them up an electron application to help them manipulate data which I parsed from AutoCAD drawings and store it to an SQL database (which I also setup). I did however wind up losing my scholarship that semester, as my passion for Mechanical Engineering hit rock bottom (passing grades, but not by much). 

Early into my senior year, the company I had originally done my co-op with reached out to me about a job as a project manager. They told me they thought I could do some really great things at their company and they would love for me to continue my programming projects there. It has been 3 years and that didn't happen. Anytime I would have time between managing projects to work on making improvements, my managers just took that to mean I needed more projects to manage. At this point the project load is crushing me beyond work hours and I haven't been able to do any programming on work time for over a year.

Now I want to finally break into the world of tech, I am really tired of having to work a job on top of learning everything I needed to know to program. However, I am finding my experience is utterly useless to most tech companies, I can't even get an interview for a single junior level positions (applied for over 100). For mid/senior level positions I have had some luck landing interviews, but I typically make it through 3-4 interviews (successfully completing their assignment/tests) before they decide I need experience in the tech world. They are always super nice and tell me after I get a little bit of experience they want to hear from me again, but how do I get experience?

I am considering boot camps, certifications, etc. I am even thinking about pursuing a masters degree, but I will need to get all the pre-requisites first; meaning that will take years and a lot of money. Any advice?"

The job is grueling and limited promotion options, plus I also have health issues, which make it hard for me. The issue is that I have only had this job for a 2 months and it is my first job out of college and I doubt leaving early would leave me with a viable reference for a future job. Furthermore, I reached out to some past members of this team and noticed that none of them put this job on their LinkedIn and I asked one of them about it (who had worked with my manager for 3 years) and they said that no one cared that they had this role, it didn't apply to anything, and that the manager holds grudges to people who leaves and does not give references. I also cannot ask other coworkers for a reference because I just work with one person, who is my manager.

Even though I am in a fickle, I feel like I need to make a change because my health is rapidly deteriorating. I really would like to find a remote job because of my health issues, but not sure which kind I should go for. I have a degree in business management, and have internship experience in marketing, strategy, and project management (but no professional experience).

tcrdyc,0,2022-03-12,A new time management method: how to treat school like a full-time job,ucrstudent340,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/tcrdyc/a_new_time_management_method_how_to_treat_school/,"Want a similar work-life balance to that of a full-time engineer, in college? Try this method I've come up with.

In the US, a typical engineer spends works 45 hours per week and commutes 3 hours per week on average. With 36 work weeks per year excluding summer, this comes out to (48)(36) ≈ 1730 hours per year spent for work excluding summer.

At a typical US college there are 30 weeks of instruction per school year (excluding summer). In that case you could aim to average (1730 hours) / (30 weeks) ≈ 58 hours per week of instruction on school-related obligations, to have a similar work time : free time ratio to that of a typical engineer. (Assuming you take off the full winter break and spring break.)

During the school term, put in as many hours as it takes to get at least a B- in all your classes. You could use a 7am-6pm schedule given a half hour off for lunch break, each day starting from Monday, and clock out for the week when enough work is done for the week. Log how many hours you spend each week on school-related obligations* on a sheet or document.

When it's time to register for the next term, calculate your average hours per week spent for school during weeks of instruction. If your average is significantly over 58 hours per week, allow yourself a lighter courseload the next term to compensate. If your average is significantly below 58 hours per week, take on a heavier courseload the next term to compensate. Over multiple terms, aim for your overall average hours per week for school to be close to 58.

*To clarify, your hours for school-related obligations include any hours spent towards completion of your degree (i.e. in-class time, study time, car commute time) or payment of tuition (i.e. time spent on internship apps, a part-time job if you have one). If your school differs in weeks of instruction, or if you expect to spend more than or less than 48 hours per week for work in your future career, you should adjust these numbers accordingly."

I've heard many things on this sub about grades and GPA not being looked at as closely, and I do have a few internships, including a co-op at Intel. I run a nonprofit software firm in my area as well. 

Keeping grades up at school has been difficult at times, often due to situations outside of my human control. Either way, I own my GPA and grades as they are a result of decisions and priorities I made, like family.

If not, which country would this be a realistic say?

A throaway account because im quite active here and i worry that some1 may find out who I am haha.

So i need a bit of advice. Im currently a student on his last semesters of his B.S studies and been working as a working student since my first semester here in Berlin. I work mostly as a Frontend Eng, and ive worked for different companies in germany/eu.

Okay, lets cut it to the chase. Id say I love to focus on what I do great, that is creating web applications. This means im looking to get a job lets say as a frontend eng after I graduate.

But, im in a funny situation.  Atm, I work 2 part time SWE jobs, and both jobs r chill. Im earning the same amount of money (+-100eur diff) after tax as a fulltime who earns 50K (after tax, too).

The thing is, the salary im seeing for fresh grad (non FAANG) are like around 50K, and even some are 40 something (😣wtf). So my question is, is it even realistic to ask for 60K as a newgrad working on web apps? Are these numbers up to date?

Sure I can maybe negotiate up to 55k or smt (this seems to be the upper number Im seeing on the internet). But after tax, thats only gonna be like ~200eur more vs wht im making rn, while that full time position comes w/ so much more responsibilities, working hours, you name it and less perks in general (not from work) as I wont be a student anymore in the country.

My goal is to get into big tech (minus Amz) to reach such numbers (probably higher actually) post graduation but what about the “usual” companies? Has anyone done this before? Which companies if you dont mind sharing? What country?

For more info: non EU, has ~3yrs werkstudent n intern experience (incl. one big tech.. does this even help? Lol. Prob sounds desperate but im just a village lad trying to secure max TC while I can).

tcx85r,62,2022-03-12,"After years in QA, this past week was my first full week as a Frontend Engineer!",Trev125,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tcx85r/after_years_in_qa_this_past_week_was_my_first/,"TLDR: I did QA for 5+ years and finally found a company that valued me and wanted to help me grow in my career, and I was able to switch to Frontend and stay at the company! 

___

This past week was first full week as a front end engineer, and I loved it! I thought my story was somewhat unique/interesting so I thought about sharing it. 

I originally got into technology when I was a kid, building “custom” PCs with my uncle. They were custom, but they were these tiny HTPC type things, that basically only had integrated graphics, so they were great for gaming or anything. 

When I decided to go to college, I ended up first looking into mechanical or manufacturing engineering, since I really enjoyed playing around with the 3D printer that was in the library. After taking some of those classes, I realized I wanted to do more technical stuff, but didn’t want to do all the math associated with a Computer Science degree. At the same time, I got a temporary job on campus doing some basic “web dev” (which, in the case, was just copy and pasting stuff from an old website into a drupal site, and that was pretty much it) after a summer of that, they asked if anyone else wanted to stay on to do Quality Assurance, and since I had no money, I stayed. 

I started off only doing manual QA. A dev would push a change to our development environment and I would make sure it was good, and that was it. I slowly started expressing my interest in more technical things, and my boss let me know that they did have some older Selenium automation that could use a little love. I looked into it, and figured out how to get it to run (which was pretty difficult for me at the time) and started figuring out how to update them. I had to learn Git and the language everything was written in, ColdFusion. Needless to say, I didn’t like that language a lot. 

After doing that for a few more months, and realizing I needed to declare a major, I decided to go apply for the Information Systems program at the university. Sadly, the informations systems major was in the business school, and I didn’t do too hot in Econ and Finance, so I didn’t get in. 

My fall back was the Information Technology program, which, luckily, was an open major. I change my major to that, and got to work. 

A lot of the things I learned in that major weren’t totally applicable to what I wanted to do, but there were some things. I ended up learning binary, learning how to setup networks, how firewalls work, how Active Directory works, and even did a little bit of VR game making. While I knew that a lot of these skills wouldn’t directly translate to what I wanted to do for a career, I knew that learning how to learn different skills would. 

All this time I was working as a QA engineer, and getting better and better at automation. Eventually, I got a summer internship at a local tech company and had a blast there learning Cypress and how to do testing in a way that wasn’t a page object model. 

I knew that I was kind of shoehorning myself into QA, as that was my only marketable work experience, but I was okay with that. I liked QA, but I knew it wasn’t something I wanted to do forever. I mentioned that near the end of my summer internship, and my manager totally understood, and said there would be opportunities to grow into other rolls (Devops interested me a lot at the time). When the internship ended, I got a full time offer to come back after I finished my last two semesters, and I was ecstatic! Sadly, during those ~6 months while I was finishing my degree, the company got purchased by a venture capital, and they cut a lot of people, and rescinded all outstanding offers. 

I was deviated, but luckily I was able to make some connections there (a lot of the people I was working with were laid off too) and I was able to secure a different job before I graduated (Lower pay and worse benefits, but it was a job that I needed).

During this time, a different friend reached out to me about an opening at their company, and specifically looking for a QA engineer who wants to learn some Devops skills. They had some cypress tests setup, but they wanted to integrate it into pipelines, and I jumped at the opportunity. I went to that company, and saw this as my chance to learn Devops, and pivot to that career, either at this new company or at another. 

As I began to learn Devops and all thats involved with it (I was invited to their standups and team meetings, and was even given some tickets to work on that were low priority). I realized it wasn’t for me. Kubernetes was difficult for me to understand, and I didn’t want to live my life in config files. So while I did the work I was assigned, I let my boss know that Devops isn’t for me. She asked me if there was anything else I was interested in, career wise. I mentioned that I took a couple frontend development classes in college, and I like them. (Php and Vue) 

She set me up with the front end team as their QA engineer, and that exposed me to React and GraphQL, which I find fascinating (specifically GraphQL since my only API experience was with REST endpoints). 

After about a year at the company, I was told there was an opening for a junior Frontend engineer, and I applied! I thought I was a sure fit, since I knew the products from an internal perspective, and anything I didn’t know from a coding perspective I could pick up. Sadly, I didn’t get the job (and let me say, applying for an internal position, and getting passed on for an external hire is rough). 

The other person started, and I worked with him pretty closely. Oddly enough, after just a month or two, he left, so the position was opened again. This time, my manager talked to the hiring manager and said that they should really give me a shot. They interviewed me again, and I got the job!  

And so, this past week was my first full week as a frontend engineer. It’s been quite a journey, but it’s been a good one. I thought that this might be an interesting read for those of you who feel “stuck” in your current job. There are companies out there who understand that employee development, sometimes into different fields, is really important and valuable."

tczy2w,3,2022-03-13,What does a Pricing Specialist do? (is it more finance-related or is it more close to marketing? ),Coffee_Mint001,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/tczy2w/what_does_a_pricing_specialist_do_is_it_more/,"Hi, so a little bit of a background: I am a Banking and Finance undergrad and I am currently taking a data analysis course (and so I've been learning programming languages such as Python, Java) and I've been offered the chance to have a job interview for a German car parts maker. The company  is a worldwide supplier of driveline and chassis technology for cars and commercial vehicles, along with specialist plant equipment such as construction equipment. It is also involved in rail, marine, defense and aviation industries, as well as general industrial applications. 

Now recruiters said they have a vacancy in their Pricing &amp; Marketing department and are looking for a Pricing Specialist intern.

The job consists in handling operational pricing for x market, calculation of customer specific sales prices, in line with the central pricing framework . And the intern will implement the pricing in the ERP systems, create and manage local KPI for price performance and so on, and will mainly use SAP.

I've made some research but could not find anything clear about the role of a Pricing Specialist. So my questions are:
- is the role MAINLY focused on finance or marketing (or perhaps something else?). As a Banking undergrad I wouldn't want to waste my time working only on marketing (no offense to anyone in that field) when I could find internships focused on data science or enter an entry level position in an intermediary.
- what are the day to day activities of a PS?
- what are the career advancements as a PS? (I've asked the recruiters this but they did not give me a clear answer but what I got is: since the intern will be often in contact with the other departments, as well as with the HQ, the person can choose to specialize in anything and decide where to go from there as there are many opportunities)
- can this lead to being a Financial Analyst?

And most importantly:
- is it any different from a PRICING ANALYST and TRANSFER PRICING SPECIALIST? 
- do you use programming languages or visualization softwares (such as Power BI and Tableau?) 
- does it have anything to do with BUSINESSES INTELLIGENCE? 

Any explanation or suggestion will be highly appreciated, thank you!"

I did not plan on wanting to enter the CS field but now (after a lot of experiences that more or less made me adamant to avoid law school), I realized that it truly might be the field for me.

I coasted through my CS classes and knew ""enough"" to get A's and B's but suffered imposter syndrome all throughout it and never really fully dedicated myself to it like I might have had I been confident in myself. I graduated in June of 2021 and haven't done anything productive since. 

I do not have any work experience in computer science or any internships to put on my resume. The most I can put is my cyber security projects, a few scrappers I build to analyze data, and a cashier job I held down for 8 years.

I did study consistently throughout the semester but i guess Im just not doing it the right way. It really destroyed my self-confidence and I feel like no matter how much i study i will never achieve a decent grade because of how steep the bellcurve is. 
I am really interested in applying for SEP but do you think I still stand a chance at all? Also I am constantly worried that my cap will hinder me from securing an internship in the near future. My resume is not the best either, i do part time FNB work and I'm in committees as well but that is really all. 
Tbh, I kind of already know the answer to my own question but I guess Im really just seeking for some comfort &amp; encouragement out here because I am really discouraged to the point where I constantly worry about my grades and lose the mood to even study, when all i need to be doing is study in order to get out of this situation HAHAH"

This year as soon as applications opened for grad roles I applied straight away. I got my first rejection email today from PWC. 

It honestly doesn’t surprise me, this field feels so competitive and it feels like impossible to get a job at a good firm. My gpa isn’t the highest but I have all the interpersonal skills, I guess my gpa is the reason stopping me from getting offers. Does anyone have any tips for getting a job in taxation? Like serious I feel so hopeless and the more rejection emails I get the more it crushes me into pieces. 

My majors are Accounting and Marketing. I’ve been rejected after the video interview assessments and some before any assessments e.g RSM.

I haven't heard anything back from NEU (also MS CS AI) yet, but I'm a bit inclined to believe that I will get accepted.

I wanted to pursue MS degree to have more internship and jobs opportunities in the US. I'm fine with either typical SWE or ML-related opportunities as long as the pay is good. So, I'm wondering which university between USC and NEU would fit my goal more?

**My profile:**

CGPA: 3.5x/4

Work experience:

* SWE Intern @ A game company in my home country
* NLP/CV Research Assistant for almost a year @ My undergrad university

And so far I've heard pros and cons of each uni are:

**USC**

**Pros:**

* Great alumni network
* Good location, more internship/jobs opportunities (closer to Bay Area)

**Cons:**

* Huge class size
* No support for finding summer internships

**NEU**

**Pros:**

* Great co-op program
* Better public transport @ Boston

**Cons:**

* Less opportunity/less prestigious?

At first I would prioritize NEU because they seem to focus more on sending students to get jobs. That and I have a trusted friend who I can share a room with in Boston, which is quite a big thing to me. But after not hearing anything from NEU for a while I hesitate and start to see how much I can achieve if I choose to attend USC instead.

Any opinion, suggestions, or comments on this? Any opinion is welcome and will be appreciated!"

for example : 

In my first year , they taught us Adobe flash but I heard about unity , and eventually  I make a game.

as my final year project I am working a both flutter project + tkinter (Tensor flow + Face recognition ) 

In between soo many different programming languages and platforms and frameworks.

But many of my friends stick to java or .NET.

So, when I went to SE interviews they expect only .NET or java guys.

I am one of top coders of my class , but I did not get a job.

So I was bumed up but one of a company called me they really interested about me and asked me to become a DevOps intern. And this is the only offer that I got.

Hi! I just wanted some guidance on how to proceed as I’m not sure how the future of meta will be. I currently have a pending offer from Amazon for a business analyst internship expiring this Thursday. I won’t know what team I’m placed on but the internship includes data analysis, visualization using SQL tableau etc. I recently got an interview for meta with the final round being this Tuesday. The role  is global operations focusing on integrity and keeping users safe. It’s a pipeline system where I interview with different teams and get placed so I selected all the analyst ones that require SQL// stakeholder and problem solving experience. I’ll only know the final role and location of Meta If they call me before Thursday ( I told them about my upcoming deadline). Both the roles seem pretty  similar but I liked the roles I selected for Meta more. My main concern is the future of Meta and whether it will lose its prestige as an internship due to its current declining reputation. I just wanted any insights from people in the field, what would look better as an internship when I apply full time etc. 

It’s unlikely I’ll even get the internship but if they do respond within time, I want to make sure I know what to do as I would have to make a decision pretty fast."

Of course hardly anybody regrets doing so, but I have some serious reservations, and even thinking about applying stresses me out lol. Here's where I'm at:

**Pros:**

* I mean, it's a few months of living abroad!
* The base cost is the same as a semester at my university, but it'll probably be a bit cheaper with study abroad scholarships
* I'd be at Trinity College in Dublin, so the educational experience will almost certainly be incredible
* As an IR student, being able to live abroad will definitely be helpful
* I haven't had the opportunity to travel to Europe, and my focus is on transatlantic affairs. However, I'll probably be in Italy for two weeks this summer for research

**Cons:**

* After three years, I finally feel at home at my university. I have great friends and an amazing support network that I would hate to give up as soon as I feel I've truly settled in. After losing out on so much to COVID, the thought of leaving now really hurts
* I have the bulk of my senior thesis to complete and would rather not spend all my time abroad doing that
* For the thesis, I'll have to do some stateside research anyway and think it'll be feasible to take some research trips with friends
* I also wouldn't love job searching while abroad
* I don't do too well with making friends quickly, so I worry I'll be very lonely while abroad, especially if I have to devote so much time to other activities while there
* I am likely to attempt a part-time internship in the fall (hopefully paid), and doing that while abroad would be difficult
* I have to account for travel costs, but those will likely balance out with any scholarships I receive

I'm wondering whether it would be doable for me to find a job at the IT sector. I feel like my strongest knowledge is with Python (and maybe JS) - many of my previous projects are written in it. Some of my most notable past experiences in the field would be participation in ""Cyber Battle of Estonia"" finals and Estonian Olympiad of informatics.

&amp;#x200B;

My Github with some previous works - most in Python and one in JS/HTML. Besides that, I have a bit of experience with SQL syntax and Linux. I'm currently working on getting a grasp of React native, but I feel that my passion is rather in the backend fields. Most of the internships I looked for are searching for university students to hire after the internment, unfortunately for me I will have two years remaining until I can get into one.

&amp;#x200B;

So, onto the question - If I have a shot at getting an IT job, what should be my course of action?"

Thing is, I'm so confused all the time. I don't think I'm making any meaningful progress and I don't know how to chip away at any of the projects I'm given. So currently I am just working my way through the codebase and the technologies the company is using (which also involves googling a ton). 

Which brings me to my question of whether this the norm for everyone's first internship? Just taking the first few weeks to get used to the code while doing some self-learning at the side?

I appreciate any advice. Thank you!"

I'm thinking about asking my boss if she'd let me work at the store again.

I really find it hard to stay in the moment/ be present. My face feels hot, my heart beats way too fast and my chest feels tight af to the point where I feel like I am going to pass out and collapse. It feels like there’s something very loud blasting at me but yet I can’t clearly make anything out of the mess in my head. And I can't pinpoint what is the trigger/ cause (maybe I can but it feels like there’s both a lot yet nothing to be stressed about). l don’t even know if stressed is the right word bc idk what I’m feeling 💀. But all I know is that this feeling gets so overwhelming sometimes it escalates to a point where I feel like I’m in danger and I start crying. Lol. And it’s so damn exhausting when it reaches that point because I keep thinking that something bad is going to happen and I get so unnecessarily alert at everything. There’s literally like nothing life threatening or truly disastrous happening so why am I always ???? I don’t know what’s wrongggggg with me.

I always thought wtv I’m feeling would disappear once xxx ends but it never does? For example when O levels and A levels ended, I never really had a sense of relief that it’s over and that I can finally take a break. I always catch myself worrying about something else and it sucks because I don’t want to spend my life just optimising it to achieve a nonexistent end goal. I get stressed/ worried over internships, uni apps, interviews, not having a good portfolio, not doing enough right now, slacking off, not being ambitious enough, not having a goal in life, not being able to erase the past and just forget about it. I think about all the mess-ups I’ve had, I think about all the choices I’ve made and wonder if I should have done things differently, I think about how I should have or should not have done something. I get stressed over the way I am right now, so unlikable and I think about all the bad traits I have and somehow I just get convinced that I’m destined to fail. Heck, I even get worried about household expenses and not earning enough money in the future for myself and my parents. The future feels so scary and I get stressed over not knowing how to be an adult and that I really have nothing figured out. When I do manage to set some sort of goal for myself, I get a strong urge to delete myself once I achieve that goal so I can just escape the world and not need to worry about the next thing anymore.

I really get so tired of worrying and thinking all the time and I can’t sleep because of it. The only pro is that I often find myself feeling so tired that I’m just in a daze and I don’t really absorb or process what is happening to me anymore. Is this normal? I’m pretty sure it’s just overthinking, and doesn’t everybody deal with overthinking? Then why is it that mine preoccupies my mind ALL the time and leaves me feeling so helpless, sad and even confused… I can barely remember any instance where I am not stressing out or being anxious about literally anything. Maybe the people around me are just good at coping with their thoughts.

edit: hello, thank you so much everyone and those who commented/ messaged. It really means a lot as I find it hard to talk to anyone ik irl about this. I’ll keep in mind all the resources and advice mentioned and will consider seeking professional help as well when I’m ready to do so.. All the best guys :”)"

I received a decision yesterday which said that I was not admitted to that program, however they have offered me a seat in the Professional Master’s Program (PMP) in the same discipline. 

They have said the degree offered at the end of the course is the same as the daytime MSEE and this program gets the same CPT and OPT opportunities as well (and yes, it is also eligible for the STEM extension). The classes however will be scheduled from 6pm to 10pm (basically in the evenings).

The program looks the same except for the lack of a research track and the duration going from 2 years to 1.5 years if one is attending full-time.

As I'm a fresh graduate and have got only a few months of internship experience, would this program be a good fit for me? Any guidance would be appreciated. :)

Hey reddit. I just signed my google STEP intern offer and of course i feel very lucky and grateful, but i started realizing that i know nothing about real world programming.

I'm not dumb and I'm ok at problem solving (hence passing the interviews), i know java pretty well and I have some competitive programming experience (hence passing the screening) but that's it.

I have no idea what real - world coding is like and i have no idea how to build a real project or what software engineering  is like.

I'm not experiencing impostor syndrome since I know this stuff can be learned as long as you know the basics, and that if the company was looking for an experienced intern they wouldn't have hired me in the first place, however i would like to start learning from now so that i could enjoy my summer internship more and maybe get a return offer. I know they give you time to learn there but im a bit of a slow learner, would like to have a kickstart.

Can you give me some general areas of cs that every swe would need to know? Like do i learn web dev? Git? Tech stacks?? Any technical skills that you think are ABC"
tdcuhv,2,2022-03-13,Advice for career direction.,AstroWizard70,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tdcuhv/advice_for_career_direction/,"TL;DR at bottom.

I am a second-year at my university right now pursuing a double major in Computer Science &amp; Math with a combined BS/MS in CS specializing in Machine Learning doing our Research Track (I can change my track to either just coursework or a project track too). I'm almost finished with my undergraduate degrees, having only two more CS classes after this semester and a handful of Math classes (two upper-level prob/stat classes, abstract algebra, number theory, and quantum computing). I feel pretty lost in my career direction right now. 

I really chose CS as an opportunity to make money doing math, which is a real passion of mine; however, I've been noticing that in my real projects outside of coursework, I rarely do any math outside of basic linear algebra with some occasional calculus. I found out pretty fast I really do not like software engineering/development. I just can never get the motivation or focus to work on projects like that (could be my ADHD too). As more time goes on in my education, I find less and less enjoyment in my CS coursework, and I much prefer my proof-based math courses. I have been somewhat enjoying my graduate coursework with Deep Learning and Computer Vision, although not to the degree I had hoped.

I'm not really sure what to do with my career now. I think Data Science or some type of Machine Learning industry research would be good for me, but I've struggled heavily to find any real work and have been losing excitement about the fields. I'm going into my second software engineering internship, as none of my Data Science/ML applications went anywhere. I'm also considering law school for patent law or intellectual property, as I was raised by an attorney, have really strong skills (Communication, writing, public speaking, etc.) and interest in that area, and most of my family has told me I would do great in Law; however, I'm being really cautious with that route as it is a hefty financial, time, and career commitment, especially with 3-years of a CS career sacrificed for Law School. 

Any advice on career direction or places/fields I should look into would be much appreciated. I admit, money is pretty important for my career to me, but I still would like to generally enjoy my work so I don't burn out quickly. I am definitely burned out now in school, although that may just be how intense I made my education for myself.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR/Conclusion: With pursuing a double major in Computer Science &amp; Math with a combined BS/MS in CS specializing in Machine Learning doing our Research Track, what advice would you give for career direction, ideally with heavy emphasis in math."

I have recently been pulled into a dilemma that has been taking a toll on me mentally. Hopefully some of you with better life experience can give me some advice. Thank you all in advance.

**Background**

I am a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from a well known engineering school in the states. I am at the heart of the automotive industry and it has been my lifelong goal to work at an OEM but with life, things don't always go as planned. I graduated this past December 2021 and aggressively continued the full-time job search into the new year. I applied to several OEM's but had no luck during the process. I began getting desperate to find a position and started to apply at automotive suppliers, and ended up getting an offer from one, which I just started at this past week. It is important to note that I had two prior internships (also at a supplier), and the duties I was performing there are pretty much identical to what I will be doing at the new position, just fulltime (product engineering).

**Main Info of Job**

* $76k annual salary with 3% bonus opportunity
* Remote 3 days of the week, have to go into the office two days a week (commute is 1 hour each way)
* 401K, HSA

**Dilemma**

I already know what I am going to be doing and essentially already dreading the work I will be doing. I am regretting even accepting the offer in hindsight, as a lot of the applications I put in at OEM's technically aren't rejected yet, so if I do get a call back/offer, I am bounded by the position I already accepted. The two day a week commute, although it doesn't seem too bad, is a really horrible commute (extremely shitty roads with crater sized potholes and just a depressing part of the state overall). There were so many places I applied to that were &lt;10mins from my house and I only got 1 phone interview like 2 weeks ago and I still don't know if they rejected me or if they are considering me. I was hoping I could land a project engineer position straight out of college since I have a good engineering background/internships + ppl skills, but clearly it didn't work out that way either

I just don't know how I would handle the situation where I'm a good 3 months into this current job and one of the recruiters from the OEM calls me for an interview. If I do get the job, I'm definitely going to feel alot of guilt giving my 2 weeks notice to my current job because the whole team is bending over backwards to help me get onboard right now. I just know that after this initial training phase is over, my life is about to be consumed by the duties of this job and it's really depressing to think about.

If you read this far, thank you! Any advice about how to handle this from your own experience would be much appreciated. Feel free to ask me about any more details to understand what's going on and I'd be happy to elaborate!"

tdf87o,0,2022-03-13,Not Excited About my Consulting Summer Internship,howixi,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/tdf87o/not_excited_about_my_consulting_summer_internship/,"I am looking for advice from people who were in this situation:

I'm currently in the first year of my MBA in an M7 school. Like many others in my school, I recruited for consulting, but I'm among the minority in my class who didn't get an MBB offer after interviewing (some people didn't even network or practice casing and were able to land an offer from my school) with them and had to take a top T2 offer in NYC (didn't have other options as other industries were irrelevant and/or didn't like my profile).

The summer pay is great, and I will probably be doing comparable work to consulting interns in MBB, but I'm just not excited about the company or the people I'll be working with (it's clear from the profiles that they come from a different caliber than MBB). I am afraid that I'll have to keep putting on a show that I am enjoying being in the firm over the summer, am excited about the possibility of going full-time (I'm not but fear that I may not have other options) and that eventually, it will blow up or have a negative effect on my performance.

Many other interns from top schools in this firm seem to have a similar feeling - they openly say to other interns that they are not excited about interning there in the summer and are there only because they didn't manage to land something better. This is not an environment that will make me feel better about this outcome when most of the fellow interns don't want to be there and are struggling as well with their placement. I know that this is a first-world problem, I should feel happy and proud, etc., as people keep telling me, but I also know that I'm now going to be forever behind my peers if I won't make it to MBB in the fall and that I have to suffer through this summer. It's a depressing feeling in such an ultra-competitive school environment, especially given people make subtle jokes about those who struck out/keep saying ""you have to try again next year"" and making you feel like the place you're going to isn't good enough (reinforcing internal misconceptions).

Are there people here who had a similar experience, and if so, what's your advice on dealing with this situation and feelings?"

I live in Canada so our internships last 16 months. In brief, my company is involved in IoT stuff, maintains tens of different services, and there is a lot of front-end, back-end, dev ops, database and cloud computing work. I work in a small team of about 7-8 developers, all seniors or juniors.

So far, here are a run down of my experiences:

**First six months of internship**

\- Assigned tickets to fix minor bugs or make minor code changes in various back-end services

\- Migrations into different databases

\- Running and creating new functional tests, unit tests, etc.

\- Learning the deployment process and CI/CD pipelines (involved Gitlab, Jenkins, etc)

\- Learned how to use AWS work accounts, ssh-ing into EC2s that run different services,  explored with my personal AWS environment so I could test my code changes in an interactive environment

\- Did some basic front-end work with React

&amp;#x200B;

**Next six months of internship (up to now): my team is embarking creating a new project that spans multiple services and involves a lot of AWS cloud services**

\- Learned docker, how to pull and build images, how to set up docker networks, volumes and mounting, etc. Also learned more about gradle files and builds

\- Learned different AWS cloud services (i.e. lambdas, sqs, sns, ses, NATS, dynamoDB, ECR/ECS, api gateway, etc), and of course the SDK libraries built around these services 

\- Implemented proof of concept,  in which I integrated a few AWS services to work in tandem (SQS, lambda, SES/SNS). I then created the official codebase for this and this is where we will be making our code changes

\- Implemented large swaths of another service that interacts with the service that i designed

\- Project Design: I drafted a proposal for yet another proof of concept for some middleware that works closely with the above two mentioned. I presented my team different options, and we came to a consensus. Then my team lead presented my proposal to the product manager and it's been approved, so we are now going with that.

\- Learned a lot more React and implemented proof of concept for UI based on design submitted by the UI/UX designer

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**So to summarize:**

Languages and technologies worked with: Java, Python, ReactJS, MySQL, several AWS Services, Docker and development tools (different IED's), Jenkins, Gitlab

Soft skills developed: During sprint reviews, reviewing and estimating tickets and story points,  discussing requirements, etc.

Projects: A lot of proof of concepts, design proposals, bug fixes, migrations, deployment, integration

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first software developer position ever, so I want to know if my experiences are average, below average, above average, etc. I want honest answers here as I have big goals after I graduate."
tdfkqm,1,2022-03-13,PLEASE NEED HELP on transitioning to another job!!!,ShuffledPast,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tdfkqm/please_need_help_on_transitioning_to_another_job/," Disclaimer: Quick statement before anyone starts to point it out, I am not so concerned about my writing quality in this post or any potential grammatical errors.

So, I am really lost in life and struggling with what decision I should make when it comes to what I should do to quickly (relatively speaking) switch over to another job (and start an actual career) and in a deeper sense, trying to find what I want/should do in life to finally be content and feel happy with myself. I feel like I already know the answer to what I should do, but there are still a few things that I know I could really use some advice/opinions on, part of why I am not taking action is purely hesitation due to an inherent lack of motivation/ambition. Before I get to the main point, I’d like to give some of my background before I give the two options I am thinking of taking in order to get a job, this is to somewhat “paint a picture” of who I am.

So, I graduated from a university receiving a B.A. forever ago (2014) in a degree that was maybe not “useless” per se, but simply put, not a practical degree that is heavily sought after unless you do a LOT to make yourself stand out from all the competition. Yes, I realize you can make that argument for many things, but realistically speaking there are fields that are heavily sought after (nursing for example) that it doesn’t matter what place you finished in your program, just that you passed, have the license, and you will find somewhere to work. The professor of another program (will get into that shortly) even said the same thing to me and other students about us just passing. Well my B.A. degree doesn’t fit in that category. After I graduated I tried looking for a job related to my career field with still never really having a clear goal of what I even wanted to do in terms of a profession in that field, only that I had an interest in what I had studied but I just wanted a job. If I am honest, I didn’t look terribly hard or probably didn’t look as hard as I should’ve and didn’t put as much energy and effort in the job searching process due to a lack of motivation/ambition and I wanted to take a break after graduating. Eventually I got a job working at a warehouse where my mom worked, I worked there for about 2-3 years (I can’t remember exactly) and only part-time because that is the only thing they offered, and while I was complacent and somewhat content, the entire time every single day I was thinking of my situation, depressed, and thinking that I can’t continue this forever. I was depressed for various reasons: I knew this wasn’t really something I could make a career out of, because my parents put a higher standard on me and my sibling that I was (and still am) falling short on, and because I know realistically I would never have been able to financially support myself with that job working part-time. Eventually at the end of that timespan, I reached a fork in the road and decided I need to make a life-changing decision there and then, continue working there or go back to school because unfortunately as much as I utterly despised the idea of going back to school, it was my only alternative option and I simply wasn’t going to get a better job due to lack of work experience (like many college students) and so my life wasn’t going to change if I didn’t attempt it.

I ended up deciding to apply for a very difficult and rigorous school program in the healthcare field that I wasn’t really interested in, I did it because it was a career that had a high job growth, I needed to stop “messing around”, and I told myself “sometimes in life you got to things you don’t want to do”. In short, it was a decision I made out of practicality, not because I had any real interest or skill in that field. I still didn’t have much passion or ambition towards any particular career period, but I needed to pursue something that would finally give me an actual career afterwards. As I already said, the program was extremely difficult especially since it was in something I never had any interest in, but I had reached a “fork in the road in my life” and I was absolutely determined like never before and was going to give it my all. I was studying roughly 10 hours a day, even on the weekends, I was unbelievably stressed out of my mind and due to all that stress and anxiety, I was perhaps the most miserable and depressed I’ve ever been. My parents and my sibling (of whom I was living with) were impressed and surprised at how hard I was studying and how I just completely devoted my life to the program (not that I had any other choice with how hard the program was). I say this not because I am saying that I was a slacker in school (was always an “A” “B” student with the occasional “Cs” but mostly got “B” I’d say on average), but I was never one of those typical overachievers who were either naturally smart or studied a lot to make sure they got straight “As”. Eventually though I reached my breaking point in the 3rd semester, I wouldn’t go as far as saying I had a panic attack because I didn’t, but I failed a lab exam and I broke down crying hard in the shower and breathing heavily, I was depressed, exhausted and pissed that I failed that exam. Afterwards I got to a point where I literally couldn’t push myself to study anymore, every time I tried, an overwhelming sense of exhaustion came over me. I always say, even if I were to have taken more free time (which I still inherently felt I couldn’t do, I was studying that hard because I needed to in order to pass my classes ‘barely mind you’) I don’t think it would’ve made a difference, I simply was burnt out, was depressed due to all the studying and not knowing why and what I was doing there in that program since it wasn’t something I had any interest in.

After this time period I was really REALLY down, I felt ashamed of myself because not only did I “quit” the program but I had managed to somehow push myself and study harder than I ever had in my life (albeit at the expense of my mental and physical health) and that in of itself I saw as sort of an accomplishment. Although in the end it was something that did not bring me any fruition and I can’t replicate that level of discipline now even if I wanted to (which I don’t due to the high stress and anxiety that comes with it). I once again had to move back in with my parents and started to look for whatever work I could possibly find, at first I only managed to find part-time work at a fine dining restaurant, eventually the COVID 19 pandemic hit and me and many co-workers of mine were laid off. I then found work as a remote customer service rep (think call center) for a large national car insurance company, I also didn’t have interest in this particular field, but I needed work. This was actually my first full-time job but we (hirees) all had to go through a 1-2 month of remote training via webcam and once again a high level of stress started to creep back up because of the fast rate we were going through material, because I wasn’t good at learning about insurance policy, and I (like many) don’t do well learning remotely like that. It wasn’t the same level of stress that I experienced in the program (I personally don’t think anything will match that level of stress) but it was enough to remind me of the program and I am simply not going to put myself through that ever again. I ended up leaving that, and I found a job at a warehouse distribution center working full-time, and have been there ever since (reached my one year anniversary in January).

So here are the two options that I am thinking about: It is between either applying for a job in the area of copywriting/content writing or public relations specialist OR to find a place such as a marketing agency where I can see if they will allow me to volunteer to actually pick up skills. As I mentioned earlier, I think I already know which path I am leaning more towards, the volunteering path. The reason being is because I have already experienced the joys \[insert sarcasm\] of applying for jobs wherein I (like many MANY others, it’s not unique to me) would send in application after application after application and would be absolutely lucky if I even got a reply or even a phone interview (that’s like a godsend right there) and frankly after a while I became exhausted, disheartened, and downright depressed. I also feel like no matter how well I try to “market” myself when applying, no one is really going to offer me the chance because although I have done some writing in a past internship for example and have written may research papers in college, I don’t have any experience when it comes to this field in particular. If I remember correctly too, I know for a fact that I had applied to one (maybe two; not sure) copywriter positions for example years back (before the COVID pandemic started) and while I was lucky to speak with someone over the phone after persistent calling to reach someone about my application, she was friendly, thought my past internship experience was interesting, but in the end the response was something akin to “unfortunately, we are looking for someone who has experience doing this”. So I feel like I would be wasting a lot of time and energy, and I really want to waste as little time as possible to changing my life around when it comes to a career. I know there is no guarantee that the volunteer option will lead to a job through whatever agency I find or otherwise, but even if I don’t get a job offer from them, I will have at least picked up skills from a legitimate place that I can put on my resume and also show that I was still staying active and trying to pick up skills all the while working full-time. I am not trying to do both options at the same time (volunteering and applying), it’s one or the other, I am also not trying to return to school. One other point I’d like an opinion on, I’d like to know what you guys think on how long I should make my dedicated time at the place I found to volunteer at. As quickly as I want to change things around, I feel as though I should be there for at least a year, especially since I would only be working there one day out of the week (the place I found is open Saturdays which works out since I work Mon-Fri), but do you think if I tell them I could make a 6 or 8 month commitment instead that that would be too short?

So just to re-iterate, what exactly is my question? My question is simply that I would like some opinion(s) on which action I should take and why. If any of you have questions for me in relation to all of this or a particular thing I touched on that you would like for me to elaborate on, feel free to ask. That being said, I am really looking forward to your help.

Thank You

TL;DR: I have graduated with a B.A. in 2014, and since I didn't do as much as I should've, I have struggled to find a decent career related to what I studied or what I want to do. Even entry level positions require years of experience beforehand, so i have two options, keep trying to apply to jobs that I would like to do which may or may not lead to a job (most likely not in my opinion) OR find a place to volunteer at that might transition into a job. I want to waste as little time as possible transitioning careers."

Hi! I just wanted some guidance on how to proceed as I’m not sure how the future of meta will be. I currently have a pending offer from Amazon for a business analyst internship expiring this Thursday. I won’t know what team I’m placed on but the internship includes data analysis, visualization using SQL tableau etc. I recently got an interview for meta with the final round being this Tuesday. The role  is global operations focusing on integrity and keeping users safe. It’s a pipeline system where I interview with different teams and get placed so I selected all the analyst ones that require SQL// stakeholder and problem solving experience. I’ll only know the final role and location of Meta If they call me before Thursday ( I told them about my upcoming deadline). Both the roles seem pretty  similar but I liked the roles I selected for Meta more. My main concern is the future of Meta and whether it will lose its prestige as an internship due to its current declining reputation. I just wanted any insights from people in the field, what would look better as an internship when I apply full time etc. 

It’s unlikely I’ll even get the internship but if they do respond within time, I want to make sure I know what to do as I would have to make a decision pretty fast."

tdgoay,55,2022-03-13,"Tips for networking, internships, and reaching out to alumni",thatoldstugg,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/tdgoay/tips_for_networking_internships_and_reaching_out/,"Wanted to do a quick write up to help fellow Bruins because I want to see people from UCLA succeed and do great things. 

Quick bit about me: I graduated in Spring 2021 with a social sciences degree and work in private equity in the Los Angeles area. I want to be transparent about salary, I work at a boutique firm (nice way of saying small) during my first year my base salary was 85k with bonuses of about 68k by the end of 2021. This year I am on track to clear 200k including bonuses. 

What prompted me to write this: My colleagues and I often get email outreach from students from all of southern California but for obvious reasons I most often get outreach from UCLA students because of the alumni connection. I actually really enjoy being able to help fellow Bruins but wanted to give out some tips to help people in the networking process. 

1) Do SOME kind of research before reaching out to people. Many people want to work in ""finance"" and don't really understand that finance is a very general term for a huge industry with many different functions. I get emails from students who proudly tell me that they are business econ majors at UCLA and they want to work in investment banking and want to work at my company. This is a huge red flag because we are not an investment bank. We work closely with investment banks but we are a private equity company. At a minimum what this says to us is that you are lazy/stupid or worse that you simply don't care to put any effort in. 

For people interested in the general industry of finance, here is a helpful career map to help narrow down your interests so you can be more targeted in your outreach: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/map/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/careers/map/)
Edit to add: the above link is solely for their career map. I don’t have any experience with or advocate for whatever courses they offer. When I was in undergrad I came across the career map and found it helpful in narrowing my interests.  


2) When you do get someone to commit to a call or ""coffee chat"" come prepared with targeted succinct questions about THEIR role, field, and company. Don't pepper people with very general questions about ""finance"" or anything easily Googleable. People seem to think that just reaching out and having a conversation is networking but it is a lot more than that. Take the time to convey through how thoughtful your questions are that you are smart, hardworking, and that you care. If it seems like you are just phoning it in for the sake of reaching out because that is what you are supposed to do, it will be obvious and people will write you off. The impressions you make here matter if you expect these conversations to net you any benefit in the future when it comes to internships or jobs. 

Side note: This applies specifically to investment banking. If you find someone in IB who will give you some of their time be very succinct. People in IB work crazy hours (I sometimes get emails from them at 1/2am and then again at 5am) and if they are willing to give you some of their free time be respectful of it. 

3) Don't just send LinkedIn connection requests to alumni without a message. I get so many connection requests from students with not a single word, it honestly comes across as weird. 

4) If you do get an internship interview, similar to number 1, COME PREPARED. We get so many potential interns that we interview that can't answer the basic questions of ""What is private equity?"" and ""What do you know of OUR COMPANY NAME and our portfolio companies?"" There are students that come in and expect the fact that they are part of whatever exclusive UCLA/Bruin investing/consulting/blah blah club to carry them into an internship and it flat out won't. We reject people all the time who look great on paper but come across as entitled in the interview. 

Most of my advice applies to finance but it can be applied to most industries. In any event, I hope this helps some of you and I hope everyone is able to absolutely kill it in their internships/future careers and make Bruins proud!"

***Thank you.***

List of good ideas rcvd so far. 

* 1	Sources of income as a 1st year student / Sources of income in any year of undergraduation please.
* 2	How to search for internships? (Field specific advice)
* 3	How dependency on colleges is decreasing when it comes to computer science.
* 4	design education in india
* 5	Research output in India and how it relates to entrance examinations and the auxillary systems (like coaching classes).
* 6	How to excel in Indian law schools
* 7	Off the beaten path subjects like Materials Science , good colleges for this, scope of field
* 8	Mathematics and computing branch in Engineering and science.
* 9	Good Institutes in India for Linguistics, Archeology, etc. ie, courses not many people take, and job opportunities in India and Abroad
* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?
* 14	Actuarial Science, exam prep, scope and experience in India
* 15	Future of academia in Mechanical Engineering. (Preferably from people who are just now completing their PhDs and looking to get into academia, the obstacles they're facing etc)
* 16	Sports Data Analytics
* 17	Masters abroad (preferably from people who have completed their masters abroad)
* 18	does anybody know how to take good notes? From a textbook and during a class/lecture....
* 19	Undergrad overseas or foreign universities and Hybrid courses (Few Semesters in India/ and Few abroad)
* 20	Courses for Power Engineering. PhD in the Energy industry. Options after undergoing a diploma course in the same industry. Job prospects, not necessary, but if indicated will be gold.

Would appreciate any inputs. 

A bit about me. CS undergrad in the USA, hoping to concentrate in AI. 

These are some of the comparisons I have made between the two.

UCSD vs UofT

UCSD
Pros
- really good CS courses
- nice weather
- near Silicon Valley 
- decently ranked

Cons
- hella costly living expense
- internship is not guaranteed 
- not the best in California so I will be competing with people from UCLA, UCB and Stanford.

UofT
Pros
- Really good program in terms of the structure
- nice immigration wise
- one of the best in Canada
- internship is part of the program so it is guaranteed.
- overall cost for tuition is matched by the internship.

Cons 
- not the best weather lol
- Not sure about the Toronto job market
- leave the USA
- fairly high cost of living as well

What are your thoughts? Which one would you choose? why?"

I hope my question belongs here. 

A brief description of my current situation: I'm an Indian studying finance as an undergraduate program in Spain. The degree is in English and as far as the degree itself goes, it's great. 

Unfortunately less than 25% of the population of Spain speaks English and I'm finding it very difficult to find ways to advance my professional skills in any way since despite having some knowledge of Spanish, it is far from enough to work in a professional setting. At the rate I'm learning Spanish, I would maybe be capable of it in 1.5 years or so, but I would prefer to not waste that time if possible. I truly love finance and I find it uncomfortable to stagnate and do nothing except the work I get from university to pass my courses, leaving me with large amounts of spare time on my hands. 

Finding internships where I can get by with a majority of work in English seems impossible and college clubs also happen to conduct all their activities primarily in Spanish. Most Professors seem to conduct their research in Spanish and only use English as a medium to teach classes. 

My question is: are there any methods by which I could gain experience that would be valuable on a CV that I could find in my unique situation (i.e. Opportunities thag I could grasp that do not require a high level of the native language from me)? Alternatively, are there certifications or some additional studies I could undertake online as an undergraduate student that would also aid my resume? Are there finance clubs or volunteer research assistant positions that are possible to join online/remotely?

Thank you very much for reading and I would appreciate any and all advice that this subreddit could give me."

At the end of the day, idk how I’m going to feel about the role until I intern, and if I love it, there’s no issue! But in the event that it’s not a good fit for me, do you guys think it would still be a good idea to accept the role so I have an in? 

Also, since I still have another recruitment cycle left in undergrad, I think having the experience at a Big 4 would be really beneficial and make me a competitive candidate if I want to go to through the full-time recruitment process my senior year for another firm, or even move positions within EY (if they extend me a full time offer).

I also have issues with a filter but mostly under agitation. 

Anyway, I was recruited by a fairly well known fitness resort and seeing as how the kitchen I was a sous chef in was run by extremely toxic owners (think marital disputes on line, and that scene in Burnt where Bradley Cooper has a meltdown on his staff) I was eager to leave and probably didn't ask the right questions or take certain things about my interview and what I observed during but still I jumped on the Head Chef was 6 months in from a contract company and decided to stay and was frazzled as all hell but I know how shit is right now in F&amp;B so when he was like hey I need a leadership position that will grow into a sous chef position and I think you're it I was in, despite being told the entire BOH staff were essentially brand new to the industry.

 Like people win prizes to stay at this place on wheel of fortune and have pieces about them in magazines and the longest held employees have all only been working the line collectively 18 months, shoulda been a flag. But whatever get in jump on board and they start having me redo platings and replace menu items pretty much after my first two weeks cause I got my first raise then too which also shoulda been a flag because during hiring I responded to an recruitment for a certain pay and they pulled the ""that's top grossing we need to do a probation period for 3 dollars less an hour"" but when I got the raise it still wasn't the negotiated rate and the hr offer email was never sent a figure was just added to my hourly. So I mentioned it to the head chef and he says that's Bs but still nothing come of it.

 any how functionally I've been performing the duties of a titled sous chef for 3 months and when the ad was posted for the job I applied internally through HR when my head chef told me to apply for it. No response or word about it again after for a month, however in that time platings have been changed and certain menu items processes reinterpreted for presentation all approved by the head chef, though because of improper communication between FOH management and Boh management not all of those changes were applied to recipe cards. So during service 2 weeks in a row FoH management scolded me for not following menus or doing things right, and I wasn't doing anything wrong so I stood up for myself, in the process calling them out for a lack of communication. Like they went to the department head to tell them I was doing something wrong meanwhile the dept head has my platings photographed and on record justifying my position. 

So week 3 comes I think everything's good y'know chefs washing dishes but FoH manager is expo again and does their best to bury and agitate me all service until finally they question my portion sizes covering saying by maybe this is why we get guest complaints about inconsistent plates on different days so I pulled out a measuring cup and was like bam which they then exploded at me shouting about me having an attitude and being disrespectful all night, now I habitually say sir/ma'am heard please thank you etc. I was hit as a kid if I didn't, threatened to send me home, chef interrupted and FoH manager stormed off saying this is why you're never getting that promotion. 

Chef arbitrated a conversation like 4 minutes later where he was like how did this service come to this, I let manager take the lead and she goes back to three weeks ago and unloads about how it's not my place to correct her when she's on duty it didn't matter that things changed she was in charge those days and chef should have her back. I said that has nothing to do with service tonight, she blew up again I pointed out all she had to do was text chef when I asked her to on those occasions and the whole mess woulda been avoided she left the meeting yelled at the chef and slammed the door on her way out. 

Ten minutes later another arbitration and she's super nice and apologetic and it goes back to please let me do my job in peace, how it should be. Here's the kicker: that manager, her husband who is a cook as well, our culinary intern turned demo intern, and the VP of operations are besties. Like drink together at each other's houses besties. After my days off, I come back to VP wanting to chat with me in her office, she says there's been talk of me criticizing upper management  and we have that whole conversation where I have to walk her through exactly what happened from my side even though she already knows, but she peppers her interrogation with questions about my happiness at work and asks me how my employee housing is, it's a shoebox studio I took advantage of our of necessity because my previous apartment got flooded out by upstairs neighbors with dementia who forgot they started  to take a bath but never got in and ran the shit for 6 hours.

She tells me she thinks I've been teaching our chef stuff, and improving stuff but then says she really likes that I'm there to do a service and that I'm not tied to anyone. She brings up receiving my application and says she's just waiting on feedback from the rest of the culinary team and then starts talking about all the previous chefs that have worked at the place and their qualifications on paper etc. None of which me or the Head chef have. But asked me to tell her if I'm disgruntled at all in the future. Afterwards her demeanor and the other from that group dynamic have changed towards me and the Head Chef and the Sous Chef listing updated to include qualifications higher than that which current BoH leadership has.

I can't just find new employment cause work gives me cheap housing but because it's a work contract if I quit or get fired I have 10 days to move or rent goes up to 3k, I pissed off the mean girls club at work and now I need to smooth things and avoid future altercationc until after I cater my friend's wedding  and work out getting my business license, advice?"

My school requires the following: *Intro to CS*, *Data Structures*, *Discrete Structures 1* (logic) *and 2* (probability), *Computer Architecture*, and *Design &amp; Analysis of Computer Algorithms*, along with calculus 2 and linear algebra. Are these sufficient?

I’m also taking a class on *Principles of Information &amp; Data Management*. The rest of my classes are electives focusing on data science, AI &amp; ML. I’m also a math/stats major, along with CS. Would any of this help me? Would I have to practice/LeetCode more than usual to make up for it, or would I be fine as is?

Some classes that my seniors strongly recommend all majors take include *Internet Technology* and *Operating Systems Design*. And for SWE roles, they recommend taking *Software Methodology*, *Principles of Programming Languages*, and *Software Engineering*. However, I’d have to make major changes to my schedule to take any of these, since my schedule is full with stats and math classes. So the only way I could take any of these would be via additional summer classes. I’ve already spent two summers taking classes so I really don’t want to spend a third one on classes- I’d much rather do research or an internship. 

Sorry for all the specific class names, if it helps I can provide a brief description for any course that I mentioned above. Also, I suppose the answer to my inquiry would depend on the specific role that I’m aiming for and how competitive it is, as well as how much practice/LeetCoding I’ve done, but I’m just asking about the most general cases in order to get an idea of how it is."

I’ve even pondered thinking about if I should just quit looking for positions in software engineering and pursue other less lucrative positions that don’t require specific degrees or direct experience, like administrative assistant. Long story short, I suffered from lifelong depression under which I did not open myself to other opportunities in college and focused solely on studying for high grades.

Admittedly, the volume at which I’ve applied to software engineering positions has dipped massively as I have been depressed over the continuously disappointing outcome of being told they chose not to move forward with me…

As the post says, I got admitted into the program that was second on my preferences. The faculty, curriculum and areas of research match very well with my interests and I'm beyond proud of it!!

It's not an ivy league school or any of those highly selective private universities but a good state school with a strong reputation for my program of study. Moreover, keeping costs low without compromising on the quality of education was of utmost importance to me and this achieves that.

 I was the first person in family to complete a 4 year college degree and now I'll be going to graduate school. If you'd told me this 2 years ago, I would have laughed it off. I had to work really hard to get through undergrad due to some health and family issues but this makes it all worth it. I know grad school is hard but I'm going to give it all I've got, for if life has prepared me for anything, it's hardship.

To all you aspirants that had to fight battles on various fronts and had to work your a*s off to get through college and couldn't graduate with a 4.0 GPA or such, don't lose hope. Don't let one aspect of your application overshadow everything else. Take up some internships, pick up some relevant skills, work hard to prepare for your standardised tests, explain your shortcomings (if any) on your SOP and you'll definitely make it. 

All the best and cheers!

tdtvw4,2,2022-03-14,How to leave a job after 9 months but leave door open to return?,Accomplished-Roll329,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tdtvw4/how_to_leave_a_job_after_9_months_but_leave_door/,"Hi!

So I know it sounds weird.

I got a graduate role (Computer Science) at a company. I honestly really like the company and really interested in what they do, the work culture etc.

However, I am really not learning anything as a graduate. I spend a lot of my time doing debugging, copying and pasting other people's solutions with minor changes and documentation. I feel like my trajectory for growth was amazingly positive, doing well in Uni then completing an internship where I worked on a project from start to finish and learned LOADS. However since starting this graduate role, I've been really down and my confidence has taken a huge hit as I literally never code, which is pretty fundamental for my career.

I've been offered a job in another city where I would be joining a completely new project team, with other graduates to learn with and a really interesting tech stack. I really think this will be an amazing boost for my career.

I need to hand in my notice to my graduate role, but I can see myself returning to my home city some day and would love to be considered for any openings they have in the future because I like everything else about the company, just the graduate role isn't working for me. How do I go about handing in my notice after such a short time without burning any bridges?"

Since I barely found any information online on the Luxembourg office, I decided to write a blog post about it.

is there anyone who can focus on work and do actual 8 hours a day  ?

my boss didn't complain about my productivity before  only one time (I didn't work all day cos simply I couldn't focus and felt overwhelmed) , and I wonder if it's actually normal for programmers to work only few hours a day in their 8 hours work day."

I´m an intern at a very small but interesting international company, that I landed on after looking for a job for more than a year, and after quite some months working with them and bonding with the staff, they sadly informed me that corporate didn´t let them create the position in which I´m working for, they could only let someone there if it´s just an intern (because of budget issues) since they are still growing and are very small compared to their branch offices in other countries, and even this bigger offices, don´t have the said position. Since day 1 they have been clear with me regarding this hiring topic, so I understand.

Truth to be told, I´m being underpaid, and they know it, they have told me that a good amount of times, they feel they could be exploiting me for that low amount of money compared to the amount of work that I do, they even raise my salary for this lasts months, but just a little, so, that´s why they will let me go and look for a new intern, a new intern that I´m supposed to help them look for, which is something that kind of stings me, since I know how great this place is, and leaving my place to someone else feels kind of... weird.

It´s been a great time having this first real job after having bad experiences, but I´m very bummed to leave it, I´m sad to leave a place where I feel respected, have a good working environment, flexibility, and the people are great to work with. Also, since they don´t have te permission to hire me, they are doing everything they can to help me get a job, which it´s very nice and I appreciate it a lot.

So, here I am, asking for advice on how to deal with this issue of helping them look for someone to have my place, and trying to not get so sad with the idea that I have to start all over again the long process of looking for a job."

They’re both at the same commercial bank, so I can only choose one. 

1.	Operational risk 

2.	Credit analysis and underwriting 

Based on the interviews, they are pretty much what you would expect as far as what a work day would look like. So I would like to get your opinion and what things I should consider. Things like what type of exit opportunities these roles could set me up for, work life balance, salary potential, etc.

To be honest, neither of these roles is what I was initially looking for, but it’s the only offers I have received and summer is coming close. Which is why I’m not sure which to pick. I wanted to get into IB, corporate banking, or asset management. But those are obviously very competitive and I didn’t get the offers I wanted from those roles. 

Thanks."

te10g0,1,2022-03-14,Should I get an Internship in a new career field?,piccplayer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/te10g0/should_i_get_an_internship_in_a_new_career_field/,"Ok, so this post has a couple of parts. I have an advanced degree in one field, and took coursework in my preferred profession while getting said degree.  Problem is, I have not worked in the industry yet. I had some family concerns that came up after graduation and I took a year off to care for a family member. After I started searching for jobs again I was not able to get a job in my field and took any job that would hire me. Now I'm ready to move on from my current job, and have been applying to similar jobs because I have 4 years of experience. HOWEVER one of the places I'm interested in that lines up with my past experience also has two positions open in my preferred field, one requires years of industry experience, but the INTERNSHIP also requires a year of experience. Problem is, this is the only chance I see at getting close to my chosen field without additional schooling or another degree, which won't help me with the current problem, but would help me later. 

So my question is should I apply for the internship, knowing it won't cover COL expenses (it's only part time)  or continue to focus my efforts on getting a new job in my current field? I haven't been able to get one so far but I have a few more applications out. I'm really afraid that I won't get any and will have to stay at my current job or go back to the 'I'll take any job that will here me' since my current job already has me taking days off because of the anxiety (it's job specific, not related to the work itself but a change in leadership) 

Also, if you could answer, why would a part time internship require prior experience?"
te2ct1,3,2022-03-14,I need some perspective please,Venstorpa,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/te2ct1/i_need_some_perspective_please/,"Sorry for my poor English but it is not my first language. 

I have bpd, I’ve been doing talk therapy for 7 years, I’m on meds (tried many of them); but despite all of these, I’m constantly in deep pain, alienation, dissociation. No one really seems to get me. I’m almost 29 yo, doing two internships at once, but any of them seem to bring me anywhere in terms of future job prospectives. My degrees (BA in literature, MA in gender studies) are pretty useless in my country, due to high unemployment rates. I feel so overwhelmed by the only thought of my future. I hope I had invested better my time, instead of pursuing degrees that hasn’t brought me anywhere useful. I feel trapped and cannot see any future perspective. I wish I could have a job in my field, but I don’t have the right skills and enough experience for it. 

The thought of suicide has been with me for as many years that I can remember, but wasn’t really an option till now. I don’t have a plan right now, but I really don’t envision any positive future for me. 

People around me tell me to be positive, to be patient. But I feel I’m wasting my time in both the stupid internships I’m doing and that in 4 months at the end of both of them I will be stuck in nothing. 

I’m so sorry for my family, friends, therapists. I don’t have the energies to cope. I don’t even have tears left in my body. I tried everything in my power. But everyone tell me to do more, to try a little harder. If they only knew how much it costs me… I do talk to them about how I feel… they all tell me I have a too negative perspective on my reality, also my therapist says the same. But what can I do? This is the brain I have, I don’t have the power to change it. 

Sorry for this rant… I feel so powerless and disengaged from the person I used to be. Someone interested in the world, in people around me; now I just feel empty. Not even the war shakes me a bit. Everything seems pointless. 

I never really wanted to die, but now I don’t see the point of living either.

Thank you for reading me."

Grad school is the last possibility, not sure if it's worth it to become a ""new grad"" again.

I don't have to work for FAANG, but I'd like to have a shot there/other similarly competitive companies. I'm pretty open minded, mostly I want to start somewhere that will help me grow &amp; pays competitively.

I have two years at a small firm, and have been offered an internship at a Big4 next year. Ideally I would like to take leave from my job for the internship and return when my internship is over. Not sure if that is feasible.

Or in place of leave has anyone quit with a negotiated return time after their internship?"
te5084,7,2022-03-14,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (3/14/2022),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/te5084/weekly_job_qa_thread_3142022/,"Hi all,

Here is the 114th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

Outside of leet coding, what can I do to better improve my odds of getting an internship? Furthermore what subsets of CS should I pour more time into/how? I'm also pretty interested in data science/ML but I don't know if these will be applicable to my career in the future.

However, I have already accepted an internship offer as a software automation engineer for a company in California. The pay for Capital One would be just under $60/hr and the pay for the company in California would be $35/hr. The work being done at Capital One seems more interesting to me. Does anyone have an opinion if reneging would be advisable in this situation?

Edit: Reneging could come at the cost of no longer being able to use my schools career services. The company in California is a satellite internet provider.

Edit 2: They were super understanding and they told me to keep in touch."
te84fn,0,2022-03-14,How many internships did you apply for to finally land one? (Also I added a little rant in this that got this post taken down from r/college),[deleted],CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/te84fn/how_many_internships_did_you_apply_for_to_finally/,"How many internships did you apply for before you landed one?

After looking at similar posts that say they applied to like…50+, it’s making me feel much worse about myself. I applied to 16 or so and I was struggling to find even one more. I’m a biology major and I wanted to stay in my state (Indiana) and I just want to say this, with all my heart, fuck Indiana. It feels like a wasteland where dreams and opportunity goes to die. I can’t find anything here so I do everything everyone tells me to do; make an amazing resume (or the best I can with NO experience!!), LinkenIn, Handshake, allll the fucking apps they tell you to use! NOTHING! Nothing works! Even if I WANTED to apply for 50 internships I can’t find these things! 

Rant incoming: how the fuck are you supposed to be dealing with all this shit?! Internships, extracurriculars, and make suuuure you ACE all of your classes or else no one will want you in grad school! Like seriously FUCK THIS! I’m reaching a point where I might just burn out, but I can’t let that happen. I will actually die before I let myself become a failure. 

Anyways…back to the topic at hand. For STEM fields, how many internships did you apply for? Did you get anything out of it? Is it a waste of your time? 

Sorry for the rant, I’m just really regretting  life choices and hating that I went into this field. That’s all."
te8go2,4,2022-03-14,Advice Needed: SDET to SDE Transition,firstonesnotfree,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/te8go2/advice_needed_sdet_to_sde_transition/,"**Background:**

I've worn the hat of an SDE as well as an SDET (internships, full-time). \~6 YOE (full-time), \~2 YOE (internships) Currently an SDET, Team Lead at a FAANG.

I'm comfortable parsing through backend services, building them from scratch (have done that at one of my previous companies).

The only thing I haven't done fully on my own is coming up with a design. I can read through the design documents, weigh in on where there could be scalability/reliability issues, debug any issue when things break in production and I feel I bring a lot of value to my development team. In-spite of this, I can't shake the feeling that I'm always considered a second fiddle in the project (nothing flows to me directly - dev team is point of contact for anything and many a times, they discuss everything together and I only get to know about some of these things because I have good relationships built with some of them - we also have siloed groups where these discussions happen; no sense of ""one team""). I'm tired of this. Management tries to do things better, but it's just devs who (for what ever reason), feel that the project is solely their effort.

Now, here's my dilemma - I've been getting interview requests for Senior SDE, mostly. And I do feel it's time to choose to either remain as an SDET or make the switch to SDE. A lot of the recruiters are looking for ""% of the project I designed/architected"" - which of course, is something I didn't do. I've been the bridge though with some of the test frameworks I've built.

**Questions:**

1. How do I spin the narrative? Or is it worth spinning (i.e. developer productivity, quality focused etc)?
2. Should I just talk about the work I did and be forthcoming with my experience and desire to try SDE work?
3. Should I ask them to consider me for lower levels on my own (i.e. like E4)? Don't want to get down-leveled too much :)

Skip SDE dreams, try for Staff SDET elsewhere (and the cycle of feeling second fiddle would persist - unless you guys know any amazing teams/companies!)

I’m prepping LC and using DDIA. Have an AWS Solutions Architect cert as well.

I do feel this sense of guilt if I try to narrate some of the designs that the dev team made (which I did play a role in, but coming up with a design was all them - I do know the design and the trade-offs, but it's not my own).

Any advice for a (potentially) lost soul?"

Hi, I have a bachelor's Degree in Computer Information Systems and am currently going back to school for a masters in Information security. I want to apply for cybersecurity internships, but I keep getting rejected. Can you review my resume (Hiring Managers Highly Welcomed) and let me know what changes I could make. Thank you."
teawgx,1,2022-03-14,College Decision Advice,ZookeepergameNo4597,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/teawgx/college_decision_advice/,"During the application period, I had no idea what career I wanted so I applied to Cal States as a mathematics applied major because I liked math. I also applied to California Community Colleges. But later I decided that I wanted to become a wastewater plant treatment operator but decided against it. Now I want to do Front End Web Development.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently doing The Odin Project foundations and so far I am enjoying it. I am sure that is the only thing I want to do. I am also in a cybersecurity program by CyberForward. They said that they had 6 students from the last class doing internships in the cybersecurity realm. They also said they will help us with finding an internship from cover letters, resumes, to applying. So that is also something I am considering.

&amp;#x200B;

A CS major seems good except that for Cal States;

CSUF - I read that their CS department is a mess(20-minute commute)

CSULB - I read it doesn’t have a good CS department(25-minute commute)

CSUSB - I have read on quora that it’s also not that good(1 ½ hour commute)

CSU Poly Pomona - Read that changing majors to CS is very hard. So if I do go here I will most likely change my major to CIS(35-minute commute)

&amp;#x200B;

I could also go to a CCC then transfer over to a UC or Cal State for computer science. I identified Pasadena City College as the one I wanted to go to. They have good transfer rates but it’s a 1-hour commute

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Want to be a front-end web dev. Either go to Cal Poly Pomona as a CIS major or go to community college than transfer as a CS major."
tebca2,2,2022-03-14,Career advice: from tax accounting to software engineering (long post),Nolo__contendere_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tebca2/career_advice_from_tax_accounting_to_software/,"**TLDR: I'm a senior tax accountant looking to switch to software engineering but I want to see if it's worth it. (Feel free to skip to my questions below if you'd like to give any input!)**

I'm currently a senior tax account working at one of the top mid-sized firms in the nation. I'm pretty good at my job to the point where I've been asked if I've considered becoming a supervisor but to be entirely honest, I'm fed up with tax accounting. The hours are brutal, it's tax season 1/2 the year (initial filing and extension time) and I hate not being able to go on vacation whenever I please (ex: Germany for Oktoberfest or New Orleans for Mardi gras because it's tax season). I'm 28 but I feel like I'm wasting away my youth on a career that kills me with hours only to walk away with decent pay. To be honest, the pay isn't awful but it no where nearly compensates for the insane hours I've worked and you can only ask for so much at certain levels. When you hear software engineers starting with $70k more than you currently are, it puts a lot of things into perspective.   Maybe pandemic has made me see things in a different light or maybe I'm on to something: I haven't determined that yet lol. 

I've recently considered switching over to software engineering. I don't exactly have experience in coding, etc but I did self teach myself years ago when I was about 10 and was able to read/edit HTML codes without any education/guidance at all. I also created an interactive Excel spreadsheet years ago that was so amazing, even the partners at my old firm were impressed. It was so fulfilling. I wish I continued to develop that talent and I wish I knew it could have been a career choice.

Not saying that software engineering is the same as HTML coding 18 years ago or creating formulas in excel, but I'd like to think that I might be able to pick up on it better with some guidance, education, and dedication. 

I've done some research on those who have switched from accounting to software engineering and have come across mixed opinions with those who strongly felt the switch was worth it and would never look back, and those who strongly felt it wasn't worth it and should continue to stick to accounting. Granted, these people posted years ago so I feel the industry isn't the same as it used to be. 

I truly want to leave tax accounting and have thought about leaving ever since pandemic started but I'm scared to leave my career for something that might not be worth it - but I'm also scared of working in a miserable field for the rest of my life and possibly missing out on my calling. 


That being said: I have a few questions regarding your recent personal experiences whether you're in the field, in the process of becoming a software engineer, or you switched to software engineering (and loved it or hated it). I know there's a FAQ section in this subreddit but I'm turning to you guys to see what you guys personally think since most of those posts are years old and I'm sure the field isn't exactly the same. 

1. What is it like being a software engineer (front end, back end, etc)? What are the hours like? 

2. What type of company do you work at? (Tech, real estate, etc)

3. What are the general pros/cons of your career?

4. (People seem to hate bootcamps) but if you know of any great ones, I would really appreciate any you recommend (same goes for any college degree programs!)

5. What programs do you recommend learning?

6. What do you recommend I do to get my feet wet in the meantime? 

7. After getting the education/guidance needed, would I have to start as an intern? Or would I be able to land a full time position?

8. What is it like interviewing/looking for a job?

9. What do companies look for when promoting you? (Ex: in accounting you basically have to have knowledge and show ownership of clients to be considered for a promotion)

10. What/when was your starting salary? How much are you making now? And what city/area do you work in (if you're comfortable sharing)?


Sorry if this has been posted before. Feel free to link any recent posts you think could be helpful. I pretty much want you guys to either help burst my bubble or let me know if this is something I should definitely continue to pursue. 

Thanks in advance!"

I am a soon-to-be graduate from a technical program that specializes in Computer Science and in this program, they train students to become fresh and new Software Developers available to work in the market. Think of it as the equivalent of graduating a Computer Science degree from a Community College. My program has an internship phase towards the end where graduates have to take a 3 month internship to pass the program and receive a diploma. Luckily due to my performance, I was able to land a paid internship of about 50,000$ annually at one of the largest financial consulting firms where they are willing to pay me during their 3 months of training before I fully become integrated into the team. 

This got me very excited as a recent new grad that hasn't had any real-world work experience in this domain yet and still landed a paid internship, however one thing that felt really off was their contract and specifically, the duration of their contract. My program planned on interning us from April to June this year, however the contract is written that I will be working under the company for 2 years. This suddenly becomes problematic because I do not have any intention of staying with the company long term since I am planning on continuing university studies in Software Engineering this upcoming fall. I have talked with the company regarding this clause and apparently, there is a penalty if I quit before the end of this contract where I have to pay them back a certain amount of money and I will be left out from yearly bonuses. They do however encourage part-time work while studying and they are even willing to pay for my tuition fees (which I do appreciate a lot). I have put a lot of thought into this dilemma but I am still unclear on whether this is right for me.

What do you guys think about this? I have heard of terms being thrown around in this sub like ""sweat-shop"" or ""body-shop"" so am I signing up myself into one? I do not have any work experience yet, so I don't know whether I should take this offer or not.

TLDR: soon-to-be comp sci graduate received a paid internship which I am happy for but it has a 2 year contract that I must abide or else I pay a fine. I have plans on continuing on to university so this actually becomes problematic"
tedw5m,9,2022-03-14,i think my mom needs therapy 🙃,redvelvetlrh,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/tedw5m/i_think_my_mom_needs_therapy/,"before i start lemme clarify that my mom is great in many ways and no she doesn’t think i owe her for the sacrifices she made, but bro i think she really should see a therapist :) 

i live with her because my dad has to work in a different country, and recently she’s been diagnosed with a heart disease which, paired with anxiety, is NOT pretty. she’s seen many doctors and cardiologists but refuses to recognize that she needs to take care of her mental health too, and that’s been weighing down on me. i feel like i’m being super picky (esp in this sub) because she hasn’t forced me to be doctor/engineer/lawyer or anything, and i’m grateful for that, but lately her stress from work is becoming projected on me and how i’m not doing “well”. i’m a government/policy major that wants to work in the government someday, which needs good internships. unfortunately that is super competitive, and my mom is convinced that there’s absolutely nothing in my brain except for video games and tiktok. which i do use and play but every time we have an argument she brings them up. like i’m just some stupid person that fails all her classes and doesn’t do well at all. 

the point is, i’m NOT. i may not be getting 4.0s (and trust me i beat myself up for it everyday) but i have an above average mark that’s gotten me into the top school in my country and one of the more competitive majors. it just feels like what i do is not enough and all she sees is me on discord with my friends or whatever. and the worst part is, whenever i casually bring up how stressed i am about this economy and job market, she gives me the usual lecture about how i should worry about the present, blah blah blah. BUT when we argue, she suddenly remembers every single thing i’ve ever told her about my own stress and anxiety, and how i’m only stressed because i don’t work hard enough and i only play games all day. i’ve told myself multiple times that i’ll never share my feelings with her again because they’ll just be used against me, but stupid little me keeps accidentally slipping those things out when i talk with her. 

it feels like the most she talks with me is when she’s telling me i’m not doing enough. when we have normal conversations it usually ends pretty quick because we don’t have too much in common to talk about, and discussions on politics usually just end after a few sentences because i’m too tired to argue. but when she’s mad at me the words just don’t. stop. coming. like we never talk that much normally. i always have to tread carefully 24/7 to avoid a sudden outburst from her. i’m dealing with a lot of anxiety &amp; depression myself but i don’t want to show it anymore. it’s gonna be blamed on the games and the phone and whatever else, and it’ll just come up in a future argument about me being lazy and having nothing in my brain. 

and i’m worried about her. i’m worried that her heart condition will get worse, and the way she’s stressing about work is really really not healthy. when i brought it up that she should see a therapist, she just said “i’m spending all my insurance coverage to pay for YOUR therapy”. well mom now I don’t want to go to therapy anymore so that’s great wonderful showstopping amazing. maybe i’ve been pulled into the asian parent cycle of feeling guilty, but i really am grateful that she never forced me to do the other stereotypical asian stuff. and i’m upset now because her behaviour is acting like those exact stereotypical asian stuff, and i dont think i like it. 

tldr: anyway how do i tell my mom she should see a therapist without her being mad at me lol

edit; she thinks i say she needs a therapist because i’m mad that she’s picking on me and i got an attitude. well i kinda am but also…it’s really making me want to move out now but because covid and financial reasons i’m a 20 year old stuck at home with 0 friends :)"
tee8x5,0,2022-03-14,I hate Gayle McDowell and what she has done to this industry,ifiwasyourboifriend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tee8x5/i_hate_gayle_mcdowell_and_what_she_has_done_to/,"If you take a look at her LinkedIn, she has 12 months of internship experience at Microsoft and  3 months of internship experience at Apple. 

In terms of working experience as a software engineer, 2 years and 9 months at Google. 

After that, she was a VP of Engineering for 9 months. 

We literally let a person without a decade of software engineering experience shift the paradigm of how technical interviews should go and essentially create a system where it limits diversity and focuses on rote memorization. 

And the funny thing is, we didn't even have to make Cracking the Coding Interview a ""must have"" in our bookshelves, we just bought into the idea that it would make us better engineers but in my case, it didn't. 

It just made me hate the thing I once loved so much. 

I long for the days when I could excitedly discuss my projects or work on them without the angst of feeling like I was wasting my time not practicing or memorizing these trivia questions. 

I miss when programming didn't have to be this competitive thing (not suggesting competitive programming isn't cool, it is if that's what you like to do — some of us just like to build things and that's okay too). 

I hate feeling that we bought a book written by this smug ass woman who likely never has to write a lick of code for a living ever again, and yet simultaneously defined the trajectory of many talented people who may never reach their true potential professionally because they can't sort a binary tree on a Google doc."

They speak about Steve Shreve with stochastic calculus for finance I and II. And another book was written by Salih Neftci(principal of financial engineering ). Do you have any suggestion ? Also can you confirm if these books are a good beginning for quant finance?

\- I am looking for a book about valuations methods /IB notions (Comparable Analysis, DCF, book value).

\-Finally, a book that can be a good introduction to private debt/private credit.

I want to become familiar with quant finance and strengthen my basics in finance. I don't know if I am asking for a lot(sorry if that's the case ), but I want to use this time properly in case I get no offers. Thanks for any answer I could receive"

1) Qualcomm is a more prestigious/known company. While the prestige of a company shouldn’t be such a huge factor in my decision, I’m trying to strengthen my resume. Garmin is a big name as well, but not currently as known as Qualcomm.

2) I feel like Qualcomm is currently very relevant compared to Garmin. They are doing great and they seem like they will continue doing great for a long time. Garmin, however, isn’t as relevant in the current industry. They still are doing well, but their products aren’t as widely known anymore due to location based apps (like Google Maps) being on every smartphone.

3) I like the location of the Qualcomm internship - Santa Clara, Bay Area. I will basically be working in Silicon Valley if I accept the offer which is a great opportunity for networking. Garmin is in Kansas, Olathe.

4) The pay is better. I know that interns shouldn’t worry about the pay. But assuming I get a full-time job offer from the company after the internship, I think Qualcomm will still pay more than Garmin to start with.

5) Even though Qualcomm isn’t my dream company (Apple is), I can see myself working there for a while after graduating. I was told that it is very likely that interns get a full-time offer after an internship at Qualcomm if they do well. While I definitely would be excited to work at Garmin as well, I feel that Qualcomm is a better fit due the the reasons listed above.

What are your thoughts? Do you think burning the bridges with a big name like Garmin could fire back? What is the possibility that future companies that I apply to could know about me reneging? I know it will be on Garmin’s system, but will other companies be updated about this? I feel like it is very unlikely for the HR or the recruiter to start working for another company that I will apply to in  the future by coincidence. Basically, what are the possible consequences of reneging when it comes to my career? I want to get your opinions on whether reneging will be worth it in my situation.

Quick Note: I know the consequences when it comes to my university. I’m aware that I could be banned from certain job application sites affiliated to my university if they learn about me reneging. I’m asking more in terms of the effects this might have on my career in the future."

I have been admitted to the 12-month MISM track at CMU and the 16-month MCS program at UCI! I am leaning towards CMU as I can straightaway start applying for full-time roles as compared to a mandatory internship at UCI. The data science electives at CMU are really good as well. CMU starts in May whereas UCI will be starting in August if that is something to consider.

Is there any reason that I should give up CMU for UCI? Still waiting for Columbia and UIUC (MCS). Rejected from Upenn and Cornell Tech.

tel3ui,2,2022-03-15,"trying to quit my job, no idea how",usedmaterials,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/tel3ui/trying_to_quit_my_job_no_idea_how/,"basically i started this job as an intern, then they hired me about 8 months ago. i got along with the staff fairly well, but i never really clicked. this isn't surprising as i am awkward and also work nights, so i don't interact with them on a daily basis or anything. we're understaffed and i'm asked to cover for others frequently during all shifts, i don't make a lot of money, and working night shift has kinda really destroyed my life, there's a lot of reasons why i don't want to continue working there.

first of all, i don't know if i should tell the director or the manager that i want to put in my two weeks notice. i don't see either on my regular night shifts, but i will be stopping by work during the day soon, and i anticipate both of them being there. 

my second issue is like... if i do put in my two weeks notice, i inevitably have to speak to the other staff members (who i know are going to be irritated when they learn that i'm quitting, i don't blame them because it adds more stress on their shoulders) on the way out of the building. do i bring it up to them? i don't want my last two weeks to feel extra awful because everyone hates me. my director/manager would tell the other staff members as soon as i left either way, and then i'd just look weird for not saying anything. but if i did say anything i feel like it'd be awkward because i could come across as really unemotional even though i'm just feeling uncomfortable.

important note: i do live in a small town and would love to upset my coworkers and bosses as little as possible. my volunteer work will likely crossover with their work at some point and i want it to remain good.

another important note: while saying things like ""just tell your boss you have school coming up and you need to prepare for that, but that you loved working there. i'm sure she'll understand"" is good advice in general, i'm needing something a little more detailed because i literally have no idea how to get to that point."

I interact with many postdocs and grad students in the lab and in neighboring labs. So many of them didn’t get to their dream school until graduate school. I know it’s heartbreaking to work so hard and get rejected. But you just have to keep at it. Don’t give up and think it was all of a waste of time. Your cv will help you get that first college internship, or that research spot in a Chem lab. Your dedication to whatever ECs you’ve done will carry over into the volunteering and ECs you do in college. Wherever you do your undergrad, you’re going to have to be as productive, if not more productive, than you were in HS to get that first job or get into grad, med, vet, whatever professional school. Get used to working really hard and not getting every position you want. That is life. Keep your heads up."

temdj5,143,2022-03-15,Burning out?,ReallyInferior,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/temdj5/burning_out/,"I don't know if this is the best sub to ask this in, but I've never felt so helpless in my life, and so stressed out, and on top of it all, alone. I am finding it harder and harder to focus on my work, not that I hate my major, in fact I love my major (minus the competitive part *and yes it is CS and im Y1*), but things are really building up upon me, and I think mental health and confidence is taking a big hit. 

In terms of academics, I am really just an average student, and I can accept being mediocre. But the constant chasing of the deadlines, I can never seem to catch up to anything. I spend 7 days a week studying, maybe not 100% productive, but I do spend a good deal of my time studying to be the average student I am today. But week after week, no matter how much time I spend, I can't seem to catch up to anything. I can't even have some time to be me anymore. I am not hoping to be smarter, I am not hoping for school to be easier, for that I know that's what comes in this university package.

But what I can't do is that I don't have a way, or anywhere I can vent out. It's like nobody understands me, and I don't really have any close friends that I can let all these emotions out to (and hence I am here). And handling this alone, I don't know how much longer I can do it. It's tough being without anyone, at least for me. And seeing people being with their friends and cliques in real life, the feeling of being alone, just sinks in further. Sometimes I can't help but wonder how life would be if I wasn't born, how life would be if I didn't make so many mistakes, would I be happier? And to top it off, I have zero plans for the summer, while everyone else seems to have decided to move on with Orbital and Internships. I don't know how, I don't know what I am doing wrong, but it's exhausting. But I guess I managed to get through 9 weeks. Somehow.

Part of this stems from the fact that I still have a few years left in my major and part of it stems from the fact that I'm having trouble being motivated to pursue more jobs after countless rejections. I really want to thru-hike the Colorado Trail this summer (480 miles) but obviously, I can't do both that and an internship as it is a 5-week affair that starts in July. Should I work harder at getting an internship or should I focus on pursuing more personal life goals?

Any advice would be appreciated"

Problem was that I found out the program would require another and even longer unpaid internship than my undergraduate was (3 months), which took all my savings. 

So I put the Master's on hold for a year or two so that I can work and build substantial savings. Also I am trying to move out of my uncle's house. Now the plan is to work, save, and get my SW license. 

I wanted to do Healthcare Social Work, specifically   Geriatrics or Program Planning/Non-Profit. But all those jobs wouldn't hire me right out of college or required a Master's. But I wanted and needed to get experience working with the elderly. So I took an RA job at an Assisted Living Facility. 

My question is: how long should I stay here to make my resume look great? There aren't any jobs open close by that deal with the elderly. There is a ""Social Service Assistant"" position open 1 hour away at a Rehab Nursing Home. But there are 2 problems:

1) 1 hour everyday is pretty far with gas how it is now. 2 hours there and back.
2) The reviews of the place are BAD. I see more bad reviews than good ones and that includes pictures of filthy rooms. 

So I am not sure I want to work there. 

I have gotten 6 full paychecks, all varying. They vary because sometimes I get lunch at the facility and the hours have been weird the past few weeks due to short staffing (12 hour days, 2-3 days off, 8 hour days, 6 hour days so they can avoid overtime pay).

I added all 6 and got the average:
$785.95 per check or $1,571.90 a month (biweekly pay)

My monthly bills are:
$671 (includes rent to my uncle)

I wanna move out with $5,000-$10,000 in savings. 
6 months would get me $4,715.70
12 months would get me $9,431.40

And that is not counting cleaning supplies, gas, cat food etc. 

I mean I can make more if I just stoo ordering from the facility and don't buy coffee everyday. 

But my question is:
1) Should I stay at this job 6 months to a year? 

(When I was in college there were a lot of job openings and most of them said at least 1 year working directly with the elderly preferred or 6 months)

2) Should I stay at this job until I see a better opening come up? 

3) Does it look better on my resume if I stay longer and don't leave after 4 months?"

teq5ep,1,2022-03-15,wondering what the best avenue is for first internship?,InternetSandman,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/teq5ep/wondering_what_the_best_avenue_is_for_first/,"I'm currently going to college for computer science as well as working part time at a small manufacturing shop I've been at for almost 5 years

Sometimes when I walk through the office I see one of our guys working on code (possibly for a website or internal systems/databases or maybe even things we make, I'm not sure), but it's just one guy doing it and he has a bunch of other different work he does around the shop too

At the end of the summer semester at my school I'm going to start looking for an internship/co-op, and so I'm debating quitting my job at that time to focus as much as I can on that, because the career switch is the ultimate goal and thankfully I have enough saved up that I'll be able to coast on those savings till I get an internship. I know there's no guarantee I get one though, and if I don't, I'd have to wait till I switch to a bachelor's program at university to try again (basically another year of school) because of the coop credit requirements in my current diploma program

But I've been wondering if it would be better for me to try and switch roles within the company I'm at. I want to ask my boss if I could switch to an internship-like role (starting around the time I would have quit), helping develop and learn to code for a company *while* seeking an internship.

Pros: more income, and on-the-job experience programming to strengthen my resume 

Cons: less time to focus on interview skills and technical skills, less availability for meeting with mentors from school to help my resume or make connections, and the programming environment probably doesn't resemble that of an actual software company

TL;DR: is it worth trying to switch to a programming role in my current company while seeking an internship, or is it better to quit and put that energy towards resume building and technical skills for my job hunt, assuming that I can coast on my savings for several months till I get said internship?"

So I recently got my first full time job after 10 months since graduation, which I'm very grateful for. It's a content editing job for a startup company that works from 9 to 6. The pay's kinda good (at least I think it is?) but the way to the office is very long and the office itself feels very suffocating, with little to no sunlight, which kinda sucks.

So I have this weird thing that I found ever since my internship, if I work full time then right in the middle of the day my body would feel extremely nauseous, with symptoms like feeling hard to breathe, wanting to puke but nothing comes out (I think they're called dry heaving?) and very slimy saliva. Usually I would take some coffee or vitamin c (those kinda tablets that can dissolve in water, orange-flavored) to reduce the risk of it happening, but sometimes it just doesn't work. Today was my first time working full time again after some very long time, so I guess my body's not exactly used to it, but experiencing those symptoms again gave me a lot of concern for my long term health.

Is this a thing? Do I have anxiety? I'm actually very scare of social interaction and just the thought of answering the phone scares me to no end. I also have some very traumatic experience with a part time job during my uni's life that left me with some ptsd-like symptom (the phone-scaring that I mentioned) and a extreme fear of toxic work environment (it helps me turn on my survival mode and stand up for myself if I feel something's unjust, but I'm pretty sure that's a hindrance for me if i want to have a good job in the future)

I tried really hard to suppress these fears and supposed anxiety, but they never got better, and I'm getting worse at tolerating these reactions. Are these anxieties? Should I seek professional help?

I'm from Vietnam by the way, and people's knowledge on mental health is just...very misinformed or ignorant, I'm not even sure where I can get a good therapist/psychologist around here. My parents also says that it's something everyone has to deal with and it will pass, but they're not exactly experts on anything mental health related (they were the reason for a lot of my current sufferings, which included some suicidal thoughts) and I'm not exactly sure if I'm being gaslighted into believing that it's not a mental problem. Please help me."

Little about me;

I graduated with an engineering degree from a reputable university in Turkey, last summer. I've been working in a field related to my degree since the 3rd grade. I've had couple of internships in good companies and now I work at a highly known global company as an Industrial Engineer.

I am really good with numbers. I use BI tools, SQL and/or Python in order to build ML, data science models and more. I am also comfortable with English so the language barrier should not really be a problem for me.

As for ""wanting out"";

I've always dreamt about living in a bigger country, especially the US, since my childhood. As I grow older, I've realized how hard it is to accomplish.

Going for Master's seemed the perfect way however the costs (housing, tuitions, commute, food etc.) reach to a point where I can only afford a small portion of them. Going for PhD had seemed to be the least expensive way but I realized it was not really my cup of tea so academia has been removed from the list.

I thought, why not apply for jobs abroad? Yet, most of you would probably imagine how that gives you almost no chance to get hired, considering how little work experience I've got. So there goes another way.

Then, I've searched for programs that governments offer as I am aware that they need skilled immigrants in their country. Canada's programs are really interesting yet they are extremely competitive so I've acknowledged how I, for the moment, stand no chance. Then I saw Australia's subclass 476 visa program. It really seemed to suit me. I satisfied every single requirement that they have so I genuinely felt happy. However, turns out, since it has a staying limit (18 months) employers don't really want to hire you as your PR is not really certain. I still may apply for it but the fact is there.

Finally, I've realized that I really ran out of options. Oh, sure, I've applied for the DV lottery twice and have almost 0 faith that I will ever get chosen. lol.

While me being this desperate; people in my country do manage to go abroad. I don't understand. What is the problem with me? Am I not good enough or are my goals higher than they should be?

Sorry if I have taken too much of your time. I really would love to hear your advices, experiences dos and don'ts."
tew5g7,85,2022-03-15,Guide to Financial Career Paths,socialoutcastloner,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/tew5g7/guide_to_financial_career_paths/,"I remember when I first started my research into financial careers, I was extremely confused by the different options and terms thrown around. Thus, I have compiled a guide to help out anyone that's new here. First we'll go over some basic prerequisite information, then the career areas and lastly, the path for some of the areas. Feel free to suggest edits/corrections. Hope this helps :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# Prerequisite Information

**Buy side vs Sell side (common terms you'll encounter in reference to certain careers)**

* Sell side - side of financial market dealing w/ creation, promotion and selling of assets to public (essentially all services)
* Buy side - side of financial market that buys the assets
* Buy side positions are usually preferred due to lower hours &amp; higher compensation
* *Sidenote* \- buy side &amp; sell side in reference to M&amp;A is completely different

https://preview.redd.it/9todw2cnaln81.jpg?width=1129&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aa602ffb425c6afb7df050f5e3e5d3a0a7078db4

&amp;#x200B;

**Institutions (w/ focus on sell side institutions) are broken up into 3 divisions**

* *Front office* \- client facing division (direct revenue generating activities)
* *Middle office* (vague term w/ vague boundaries, sometimes included as back office) - supports front office by processing transactions negotiated by front office personnel (functions generally include risk management, IT, accounting, &amp; legal support)
* *Back office* \- administrative tasks (functions generally include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, compliance, accounting, &amp; IT)

# 

&amp;#x200B;

# Career Map

Listed below are the places where you'll find jobs, and the areas/paths inside those employers. Some paths are expanded on below. And yes, this is heavily inspired from the CFI career map.

**Employers**

* Banks (sell side)
   * Investment Banks
   * Commercial Banks
* (buy side) Institutions
   * Hedge Funds
   * Private Equity (PE)
   * Venture Capital (VC)
   * Prop Trading Firms
      * Trader
      * Quantitative researcher
      * Developer
   * Other buy side institutions
      * Portfolio Management
      * Research (“buy side research”)
* Corporates (a.k.a. Corporate Finance)
   * Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (FP&amp;A)
   * Controllership (accounting)
   * Treasury
   * Corporate Development (CorpDev)
   * Investor Relations (IR)
   * Internal Audit &amp; Risk
* Public Accounting
   * Audit
   * Tax
   * Consulting
   * Financial Due Diligence (FDD)
   * Valuation

*Sidenote* \- This categorization isn’t perfect, some areas aren’t included (eg, management consulting)

&amp;#x200B;

**Investment Banks (front office divisions)**

* Investment Banking Division (IBD), 2 forms of classification
   * First classification: products groups - specialize on specific product, work across various industries
      * Advisory - Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A), Restructuring
      * Underwriting (a.k.a. financing or capital markets) - Equity Capital Markets (ECM), Debt Capital Markets (DCM), Leveraged Finance (LF) (technically part of DCM though practically, different product group)
   * Second classification: industry groups - specialize in specific industry, work across various products
      * Healthcare
      * Real Estate
      * Utilities and Energy
      * Etc
* Sales &amp; Trading (S&amp;T)
   * Sales
   * Trading
* Research
   * Equity (ER)
   * Fixed Income
   * Macro/Economic
* Asset Management (AM)

*Sidenotes*

* Investment banking (&amp; investment banker) usually refers to IBD
* Hierarchy/organization really depends on the specific investment bank

&amp;#x200B;

**Commercial Banks**

* Common career areas/job titles
   * Credit analyst
   * Relationship Manager (RM)/Account Manager
   * Portfolio Manager
   * Branch Manager
   * Credit Officer/Loan Officer
* 2 main progression paths/areas
   * Sales (Relationship Manager)
   * Credit/Underwriting/Risk (start off as credit analyst)

*Sidenotes*

* Credit/Underwriting/Risk is seen as more stressful but some do it before jumping off into relationship manager for career progression reasons
* Usually: credit analyst → relationship manager OR stay in underwriting to eventually becoming credit officer
* Also some really high positions like regional director, VP of commercial banking and EVP (executive vice president) of commercial

&amp;#x200B;

**Corporates (a.k.a. Corporate Finance)**

*Sidenotes*

* Corporate finance is an ambiguous term, meaning depends on context. It may refer to either the field/subject of corporate finance which is investment banking oriented (prefered definition in Europe) or working in finance at a corporation (prefered definition in the US). Though here referring to the latter (to unambiguously refer to the latter, it’s called “finance at a corporate”).
* Can be referred to as working “in industry (finance)”
* CFO oversees corporate finance department of company
* Controllership, FP&amp;A &amp; Treasury are usually the ones part of the CFO’s team

# 

&amp;#x200B;

* Associate (3 - 4 years) (entry point for MBA or other graduate studies)
* Vice President (3 - 4 years)
* Director or Senior VP (2 - 4 years)
* Managing Director

&amp;#x200B;

**Financial Planning &amp; Analysis (Corporate)**

* Previous experience in related field (eg, Big 4 accounting) or rotational analyst program (neither are necessarily required)
* Analyst (typical entry point for undergrad)
* Senior Analyst
* Manager
* Senior Manager
* Director
* Vice President
* Senior Vice President
* President
* CFO

&amp;#x200B;

**Controllership (Corporate)**

* Staff Accountant (2 - 3 years)
* Senior Accountant (2 - 3 years)
* Manager
* Assistant Controller
* Controller
* CFO

&amp;#x200B;

*Sidenotes*

* Timing to progress through positions really depends but can expect similar to Public Accounting except a bit slower (though you can circumvent that by job hopping)
* Can start off in Public Accounting then make the switch to Industry as this will speed up progression (the path shown here is for starting off in industry though)

&amp;#x200B;

**Audit (Public Accounting)**

* Staff Accountant/Associate (2 - 3 years)
* Senior Accountant/Associate (2 - 3 years)
* Manager (3+ years)
* Senior Manager (YMMV)
* Partner

&amp;#x200B;

Also you'll want to look into exit options and career transition possibilities (eg, it is possible to transition from controller to FP&amp;A role usually at a Director level)"

I need to give my recruiter a preferred location so I could get an official offer. Right now I'm leaning towards McLean or Chicago. I don't know which one I should rank as first. From reddit I know people say that McLean is the bigger office and it's better career wise and for networking. What does that mean? Why would it matter that McLean is bigger and has more employees?

Does anyone know the return offer rates of these offices for TDP? My main goal for the internship is to receive a full time offer. However, working full time would also mean staying in whichever city I choose. Chicago seems to more fun than McLean because it is a bigger city and there would be more people to meet and what not. I also am Asian and Chicago has a larger Asian Population than McLean. Which one should I pick?"

Basically, I'm a semester and a half from graduating with a BS in IT and I feel like I've learned nothing from this degree. I can **maybe** set up a basic network with a couple of routers, some switches, and some PC's.

I couldn't tell you jack shit about cyber security other than password resets are bad security policy, consult NIST, and how different malware work.

I can set up a crappy server if you give me a few hours and a USB with server manager, but beyond adding some people, some policies, and some groups you're on your own.

If you need a basic powershell script or two then let me know and I can Google some stuff.

I know how to do some basic work around a Linux terminal and I use Debian casually on my laptop but any professional work is beyond me.

I don't want to diss the degree necessarily because I know I've been taught and learned more than this but after a semester most it's just gone. The pandemic didn't help either. 

I've applied and applied for internships but I haven't gotten much back, even after getting my resume checked out by career services. Even one of my professors told me it's just not a good time. I'm planning on getting my A+ this summer because I feel destined for help desk anyways so might as well improve my chances. 

Any advice? Am I being too hard on myself or is this the right idea? I like networking and I want to eventually get my Network+ but from what I've read networking, like cybersec, isn't really a ""first job"" field."

The government subsidizes employers up to $5000 (50% of wage) for students interning in tech.

But here's the game changer: you have to be in COOP or on Internship. 

Many schools don't have co-ops. Some universities offer ""proof of internship"" but not everyone offers them. 

I used to believe that ""Waterloo coop doesn't matter, I can find jobs on my own"". The reality says otherwise.

For example, at my school, McGill University, there is an option for a ""science internship"" but you have to be registered as CS major, not SE major. I had to change my major.

In summer, I don't think there's the ""science internship"" option, making it much harder. [Correction: there’s an option]

Small to medium sized employers care about expenses. If you cost 50% more than the other students with coops or internships, they mostly won't hire you. I experienced this first hand. 

Bigger employers don't care as much, but you need previous internships to get the bigger internships.

Thus think twice before deciding your program. 

Hopefully that helps. If I made a mistake, feel free to correct me."

I joined in January 2021 and so far everything has been great, good feedbacks and all, I’m also up for a promotion to project manager in July. 

Probably for this reason, my current manager and mentor is giving me increasing responsibilities, including managing newcomers at our firm, giving them tasks to do, etc. Last December, a BA resigned after 6 months of tenure, and so my company found a replacement just two weeks ago.

Long story short: turns out that this new BA is not a good performer to say the least.
He struggles a lot in completing simple tasks, running calculations on Excel, formatting tabs, presentations etc. despite my efforts of showing what he has to do, scheduling 5/6 meetings since he joined. 

Also, feedbacks from other managers are not so great and basically he’s falling behind in a moment in which we as a firm are facing several deadlines with our clients.

So today me and my manager had a meeting, where he shared his thoughts on this new BA, citing his poor performance and that he is already missing deadlines. I simply said that he was struggling and I think he won’t last long in this fast paced environment. 

So my manager is going to have a chat with him this Thursday and he said that he’s already thinking about another replacement before the beginning of April. 

I’m feeling so guilty right now. I empathise with the BA because he has to adjust to a new company, and it may be difficult to do that in just two weeks, no matter how many deadlines we face. On the other hand, I can understand what my manager thinks, as we cannot lose time or we risk losing some customers. Also, he already has experience (just an internship though) in the field. Maybe I should have said he needs more time, I don’t know.

What do you think I can do? Speaking with the BA, spending more time in training him, or just don’t think about it? Thanks"

I'm also writing this for those in a similar position as I am. Hopefully we can all gain some sense of direction. TIA!

&amp;amp;#x200B;

\--Here are my goals:

1. to be making a salary of $125K-$175K in the prime earning years of my career (obviously if I could make more, all the better)
2. ability to work from home
3. be able to do ""consultation"" or ""contract"" work in my later years and be ""semi-retired"" before fully retiring
4. I'd like to achieve a sys admin position or something like that which pays at minimum $52k salary BY January 2023.
5. I'd like to achieve the role of an assistant IT project manager by June 2023
6. I'd like to achieve the role of an IT project manager or Software project manager by June 2024

Along the way, I'd like to achieve my CCNA and ultimately my PMP or CAPM. I think that's a powerful combination. I have plans to study for and pass these exams.

\--Here are some things that come easy/things I like to do:

* Setting up VPNs and routers and wifi-related stuff
* managing people on a wireless network
* managing people's usernames and logins
* I'm obsessed with internet security and passwords. Always thinking worried about my info being secure. 
* I've heard about cloud admin, but not sure what that day-to-day would entail?

\--Here's where I'm at in life and career:

* I recently quit the addictions in my life, am 7 months in my recovery
* I'm in my late 20s, have a shit load of student loan debt and nothing to show for it (did not graduate)
* My education includes 2 years of graphic design school and 1.5 years of economics
* Once the haze began to lift, I began to figure out what I like doing besides the addictive things
* A friend recommended getting involved with tech ""because you're constantly talking about it"" and also because he knew  of 2 people ""who work for software companies as project managers making like a buck 25 a year working 6 hour days and working from home."" So I did. 
* It dawned on me that going straight for project management was maybe not the best move, I wasn't qualified. I also already had experience in IT in college (had a job with Info Services department).
* This lead me to searching for the best and highest paying IT jobs. I found those, and then searched Indeed, perusing the credentials required for each job and set out on a path to get said credentials. 
* I also took the first IT job I could: an ""IT and ecommerce intern"" with a supply company (which is where I'm writing from...sooo boring. For now at least. :D).

It seems that there is no way getting around learning python and other coding languages if I actually want to be involved as a project manager in this industry one day. Even just to have that respect amongst the people I'd be managing...Any other credential I would get like a CCNA or CCNP or even CompTia certifications seem absolutely SECONDARY to learning the ins and outs of coding and computer hardware. SQL and Spark would be next I think. At that point, getting a comptia cert would be laughable though...

To be PERFECTLY honest, I don't THINK I want to code every day. But I also have NO idea. I'm pretty sure not many people do but I could be wrong. However, I recognize and feel like I'm personally responsible for learning this industry and all it entails from the ground up if I want to be any sort of respected when I'm managing people down the road.

My questions and diemmas:

1. What's a good, hands-on way (BESIDES PAYING $4K+ for a bootcamp) to learn coding? 
2. If you are of the opinion that I can achieve my goals without spending valuable time and money learning to code, what is your suggestion? Might there be a way to learn a decent amount but not the whole thing--maybe just enough to qualify me to manage this industry?
3. Is there another path to achieving these goals that I'm not noticing? I know I'm kind of networking-oriented, as I have set up a modem/router and then a separate router to run my VPN on so my gaming console can access different countries' Netflix. I don't even know what that set up would be called, but it was easy for me to set up and I know I enjoyed doing it.
4. A dilemma I have is that I don't know which direction to take. I don't want to waste my time learning coding when I might be able to achieve my previously stated goals without it.

TLDR; SO. Is there a way of achieving these goals without coding? If so how? Also, how can I get more exposure to this industry so I can get a better idea of what I want my day-to-day workload to actually be.

Again, thanks, everyone, in advance. I hope to get some good dialogue and discourse going on this subject as I know there are plenty of people out here wondering the same things."
tf0jyr,2,2022-03-15,"College student currently in retail, trying to enter IT",noahajac,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tf0jyr/college_student_currently_in_retail_trying_to/,"Hello all,

I am currently a freshman college student that's a supervisor at a part-time retail job. I am currently in community college for Information Systems but will be attending a 4-year school for either Information Technology or Computer Science. I would much prefer the former but it depends on what school I end up attending.

My current goals are to eventually be in a sysadmin or networking type role. I do enjoy my current job, but I have recently been increasingly eager to start my path in IT. But I am having a tough time deciding whether it would be worth it at the moment to leave 
for something more IT related.

One of my responsibilities for my department currently is anything equipment related. If something isn't working, I am usually the one to put in the tickets. Additionally, I created and maintain a custom browser extension that is used to automate some tasks in department. This puts me in a really strange position. The company owners/upper-management know about this extension and have had me ""install"" (its an unpacked Chrome extension) it in our sister stores. They know my skills and are aware of my goals. But despite this, my position is still technically not an IT position.

There are a couple factors that have pushed me to make this post, some of which I won't share, but the two big things are pay and uncertainty about my future at this company. I don't need the money, but even without any of the extra things I do, I feel I am underpaid. The company has offered a summer IT internship in the past but I am not sure if they still are. So I am essentially left with 3 options:

1. Stay put for now. Wait a year for the IT internship and hope I get it. Pursue a raise. 
2. Ask now for a PT position in IT, if declined, pivot to 1 or 2.
3. Put in my 2 weeks and start searching for PT helpdesk.

If I was out of school and full-time, 1 would be off the table, but that is not the case. I am not really sure if a part-time entry level IT job is realistically accessible. I plan on getting at least a CCNA over the summer, and I do have *some* experience from my homelab (DNS, virtualization, routing, etc).

I was hoping for some advice on my situation. I am thankful for the opportunities that my current company has provided me, but I feel that I may be doing myself a disservice by staying.

Thank you!"

I am currently a senior in college and on track to graduate in May with a bachelor's in CS. I just received a second offer today and am struggling with making a choice.

The first offer is at a small local company of about 25 employees. They have been around for almost 20 years now, so they are not a fresh startup. They are starting a new 6-month onboarding program where they want to bring on about 5-7 fresh college graduates to train for software development.

* Salary: 70k + $1,000 signing bonus
* PTO: 15 days
* Languages: [VB.Net](https://VB.Net), ASP, Python, MySQL, and Java
* Benefits: medical, dental, vision
* 401K with employer matching
* Ability to earn raise and/or bonus based on performance
* Able to earn 1-3% from the profit pool at the end of the year after the company exceeds the goal
* $50 monthly credit for cell phone and internet bill

The second offer is with a much larger company which ranked in the top 250 companies last year according to Fortune's website. I have been working here as an intern for the last 1.5 years. The position I got an offer for is an IT Development Rotational Program. It consists of 2 mandatory 9-month rotations, with an optional 3rd rotation. I have the freedom of choosing where I want the focus to be (DevOps and Cloud, Data Delivery, Cybersecurity, etc). However, they did offer me a bit less.

* Salary: 66k, no signing bonus
* PTO: Not sure about this one yet
* Languages: Not sure, depends on what I choose for my rotations
* Benefits: medical, dental, vision
* 401k with employer matching

I'm stuck between these 2 choices. Part of me thinks that I'll be able to get to a high salary fairly quickly in the first option. I also think that upon completing the program with the second option, I could apply for a full-time position in the company and make a good salary (85k+). I feel like I will get a large amount of exposure and experience in either position I take, as the small company doesn't have a massive IT department to specialize in individual tasks, and the large company will have me rotating teams which will give me a vast amount of exposure.

These are all just thoughts going through my head, I do not know how accurate they are, which is why I decided to post here and ask, hoping to receive advice from more seasoned developers and engineers based on their career journey. I hope I provided sufficient information!"

tf3ma7,1,2022-03-15,My biography scared some people,NeverStepD7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tf3ma7/my_biography_scared_some_people/,"Today we had this project about an antology of texts (short stories/poems/articles/etc) and a requirement was to write a biography of the compiler of the anthology (me).

The thing is that I wrote about the 4 most important parts of my life, I was excited because they are like story arcs that led me to develop into a better person, and how that led me to feel how I feel towards the impurity that we need instead of just values (stuff like being selfish to preserve yourself in hard times or greed when it comes to save money for the future or fear when it comes to survival).

It turns out no matter how many times I edited my biography it was incredibly depressing to read, I kept the important parts and erased the most traumatic ones, I wrote about what led me to be where I am now

The summary is that ""I was a hyperactive kid who started being more quiet to listen to more people instead of just screaming what I wanted, but that led me to listen to both my parents when they wanted to divorce and I became their complaint bin against each other.

On my depression my parents made me study abroad to make me get more character and I ended up in a faraway internship highschool where I graduated and got into the university.

Then I was pulled out of the university for the pandemic so I had to use my savings and work in order to gather money to keep living here, at the same time I was being patient with a drug addict who moved to the house I was renting, so I moved to another house with the last of my savings and quit my job after some more time because it was being hard on my well being (I literally had to start taking pills for the muscular pain and liquid badaids for burns and cuts) and because I was going back to the school""

I literally don't know how to write it without making it sound worse, and I avoided parts like the paranoia I developed from the drug addict when he was drunk and started threatening me, or my parents when they had violent fights, or the time when people wanted to be away from me when I was depressed about the divorce, I already overcame most of those issues and I am ok, but the people in class were concerned because the professor made us read each others anthologies."

I graduated from UCI in 2020 with a Bachelor of  Science in Computer Science, but I was never very aggressive or  confident in myself in school.  Because of that i never secured any  internships or any professional experience in school.  Since then I have  only worked in part time positions in non tech fields from now and then  and haven't had any position in tech until now.  I have no confidence  in myself and I frequently drop personal projects cause I don't think  they would be worth it.  And that led to me having no updates to my  Resume since I graduated which I know looks really bad.  In addition, I  am really bad with connecting with people which I should be doing to get  myself into a coding community so most of my days is spent in  half-panic attacks worrying about how far behind I am getting without  actually doing anything.

The only  hope I can see is working on personal projects but I don't even know or  when to put it on my resume, cause in my eyes its all garbage.  Like I  want to quit searching cause I am start to feel like a waste of space,  but I haven't even gotten a job yet so I don't even know if I would make  it.

I´m an intern at a very small but interesting international company, that I landed on after looking for a job for more than a year, and after quite some months working with them and bonding with the staff, they sadly informed me that corporate didn´t let them create the position in which I´m working for, they could only let someone there if it´s just an intern (because of budget issues) since they are still growing and are very small compared to their branch offices in other countries, and even this bigger offices, don´t have the said position. Since day 1 they have been clear with me regarding this hiring topic, so I understand. 

Truth to be told, I´m being underpaid, and they know it, they have told me that a good amount of times, they feel they could be exploiting me for that low amount of money compared to the amount of work that I do, they even raise my salary for this lasts months, but just a little, so, that´s why they will let me go and look for a new intern, a new intern that I´m supposed to help them look for, which is something that kind of stings me, since I know how great this place is, and leaving my place to someone else and even help in their recruiting feels kind of... weird.

It´s been a great time having this first real job after having bad experiences, but I´m very bummed to leave it, I´m sad to leave a place where I feel respected, have a good working environment, flexibility, and the people are great to work with. Also, since they don´t have permission to hire me, they are doing everything they can to help me get a job, which it´s very nice and I appreciate it a lot.

So, here I am, asking for advice on how to deal with this issue of helping them look for someone to have my place, and trying to not get so sad with the idea that I have to start all over again the long process of looking for a job."

* Pros: The flexibility and the ability to assist on different projects is exciting. Working with various projects allows me to gain more experience and meet other people in the organization.
* Cons: Projects I'll be working on are unclear and my mentor is remote/working at another location. Not much opportunity to connect with other interns from different departments and the organization's name isn't as well known.

**Offer 2** is an internship in the Ethics/Compliance department for a global pharmaceutical. I'll mainly assist with legal work, documentation, and investigation projects on healthcare standards/regulations. 

* Pros: The company is very well-known and there are many opportunities to network with interns within and across departments. Interning in this organization makes me feel that I might have a ""breakthrough"" in my dream of working in pharmaceutical/health companies in the future.
* Cons: Never done compliance-related work before and am not sure if it's a fit. Am worried that if I accept and end up not liking the role, I'll have difficulty transitioning to a non-compliance area in the future.

I'm very stuck between choosing the position opportunities or company prestige/benefits. Any input or opinions greatly appreciated!

tf8f22,3,2022-03-15,I’m approaching the anniversary of the day I officially cut off all contact with my toxic ex-crush. One year “strong” even though I still feel sad about it.,Bigbuckrocks,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/tf8f22/im_approaching_the_anniversary_of_the_day_i/,"Basically she led me on while she was in a relationship (we did meet before she met her boyfriend but our relationship was entirely online), and even suggested that we could be together if things didn’t work out for her and her boyfriend. I cut off contact in early April 2021, a lot later than I should have, because of the toxicity of the relationship.

Despite the fact that she wasn’t the most attractive girl, we shared something really special (and almost sexual) and it felt hard to lose that. I know that there are more attractive women out there, but I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to have with them what I had with her, but this time in person.

I’ve considered breaking no contact but I’ve been resisting the temptation. I still have her blocked on all social media and all our conversations have been deleted, and I have no plans to undo that. I don’t see any reason why I should either, because after I cut her off, I finished college, I got an internship which later turned into a job (And I’m getting a raise next month!), and I started living on my own in a different part of my state for the first time. Going back to her would feel like taking a step backwards in life. She had her place in my life but now that time has passed.

I have done dating apps periodically but nothing too much has come out of that. I did recently start growing a beard too, although I may be subconsciously doing this because her boyfriend has a beard.

I really thought that this would be way in the past by now, but it’s still there, even if it’s just a little bit. I really wish that it was nothing more than a virtual summer fling, and that I immediately ceased all contact as soon as she mentioned she was starting a relationship with someone else. But I know not to do this again."
tf8f8y,2,2022-03-15,Mind Stays Blank. All The Time,Frank_Von_Tittyfuck,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tf8f8y/mind_stays_blank_all_the_time/,"My mind is a perpetual state of emptiness. I never know what to say to people, not even my closest of friends and families. I just have no thoughts and always seem to cut conversations short. And the times that I do have ideas and thoughts, I can never put them into words fluently. I end up mumbling and feeling insecure, causing me to stutter a bit and just speak so awkwardly. Sometimes I even wonder whether I got my damn point across because it comes out so garbled.


I always wondered how some people can tell stories so well and get people to laugh with them. I never seem to have stories to tell, and when I actually do have a story, I deliver it so poorly that it ends up not being interesting or funny. Then I feel like shit because no one responds to it enthusiastically. This develops into a cycle where I don't want to open up or talk a lot in conversations. It's a nasty ass cycle and I hate it.


I don't necessarily fear social settings either. I can make eye contact easily, I don't fear groups of people. Heck, I go out to party every weekend and mingle with people all the time (im a college student). IT's just that I never have anything to say to people to keep conversations going. 


I still see myself as somewhat functional. Unhappy, but functional. What I mean by this is, I have no trouble going out into the real world and doing what I need to do. I don't get nervous when I order food or interact with people. If anything, the reason why I avoid interacting with people is because I'm afraid of not being able to say the right things to keep conversations going and interesting. When I'm interacting with random strangers with small talk, I can do just fine. But it's when I'm interacting with someone because I'm trying to develop a bond/relatioinship with them that I stumble and come off as awkward, cold, aloof, arrogant, and uninterested.


Sometimes I wonder how I managed to have the friends I do now. So in that regard, I see myself as functional. When people mention how they get panic attacks or avoid interaction at all by staying in their homes, I cannot relate to that. Eye contact for me is really easy. I was able to secure an internship for this summer. I managed to date a girl for two months (although it ended). But I have motivation in life. I have goals and a passion. I devote my time to chasing a dream and putting the work in, so it’s not like I’m lost in life or aimlessly living. It’s probably been one of the few things keeping me going and giving me a sense of hope, besides religion and my spirituality. I know I'm not normal and the thing I want most is to be normal. I want to be that person who has an engaging voice and so many stories to tell. I can try faking it, but it's so mentally taxing that I can barely sustain it. I’ve been to therapy and have had deep childhood trauma that I’ve explored (sexually abused). I’m aware that this is probably connected to the way I am and the way I feel, and I’ve made progress in recognizing that. Knowing is not nearly the same as changing though, and change in this sense has been a bitch to go through.


I take meds for ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. But as of late it seems like depression and anxiety has been able to creep back into my life. The funny thing is, getting treatment and taking meds never really assuaged the part of me that couldn’t hold conversations or the fact that my mind always felt blank. I just learned how to deal with it better, I guess. I feel like I’ve tried so many different things at this point and I’ve made very little progress to show for it. It’s depressing and brings me to despair at points. I would never actually do it, but living life like this, especially when I’ve hit my low, low points, has really made me feel like I want to kill myself. Luckily, I’ve never lost faith in the idea of a better tomorrow and I’m aware enough to know the damaging effect the consequences of that action would have. Life for the most part though, at least involving the part of life that brings about connection, love, and companionship, has been mostly pain."

It seems like every interview I have they make me feel like it's 100% sure I'm getting the position and it absolutely never happens. It's been more than 10 interviews by now and I don't ever even get past the first stage. I've been seeing friends of mine from regular universities and nearly no knowledge on certain fields getting jobs super fast and easy. 

I've been looking for a Data Science or Analytics intern and I'm a student graduating at both economics and business administration at the same time at the best university for both of these courses in my country. I have several projects that I've posted on GitHub. One of them is a data pipeline along with a dashboard analysis, with even a video 30 minutes long recorded on how I made the pipeline. Also I have 3 interesting data science projects with the application of regressions and time series analyses. None of this seems to matter a single bit. I'm also taking 2 courses from aknowledged companies in my country, one of them for data engineering and another for data science.

They also always keep asking me about who I am as a person but I honestly don't even see the point of telling them this now. I'm someone really focused at what I do and I've learned German within one year, currently studying Mandarin and within 6 months can already read pretty well bc I study it for 3 hours a day. Besides I always tell them about how I used to play 5 hours of guitar a day when I was really focused at it. All of this should be enough to prove that I'm really dedicated and I thought all this stuff mixed with the ranking of my university, my projects and knowledge on the field would be enough to get me into at least an internship which I know most people get to without knowing a thing about the topic but it absolutely isn't. 

I rarely ever get a reply on the CVs that I send and when I do I never get past the 1st interview. I'm studying literally the whole day but honestly if I've done all this by now and it hasn't been working it just feels absolutely soulcrushing. Am I really this bad qualified?"

I very much want to take 493 Cloud, and am in somewhat of a dilemma with school. I'm continuing to intern (part time) for the company that I'll be taking a full time offer with this summer when I graduate. Effectively I have a job lined up, and am doing interesting work as an intern.

I very much want to take this course, but am a little put off by the reviews of how time consuming it can be, when I hear we are just developing a ton of APIs and deploying them over a cloud environment. I'm familiar with API basics, and have made my own before. I don't know cloud stuff, and have probably not done API development as extensively as this course will require of me.

Again, I want this knowledge and experience, but am not tied to getting it from OSU. Are there outside alternatives that are of the same quality? Idea would be to take a less time-consuming OSU class so I can devote more time to my internship.

&amp;#x200B;

**Context**

1) For context, I probably have weaker time-management skills than most in this program. I definitely struggle to devote a full 40-45 hours / week to a job and take a 20 hour/week class on the side. I can keep it going for a while (6 weeks or so), but struggle to keep up that pace especially in the second half of the quarter.

2) My job is not 'steady' in the sense that I can clock in clock out. Some weeks are heavy, some are light. I had 2 heavier weeks towards the end of this current Winter quarter, and it definitely ate into my studying/project time. It was tough.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you in advance for those who give feedback!"

tfb0ff,3,2022-03-16,Contemplating Giving Up on Pursuit of Software Engineering Job,The_Zhuster,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tfb0ff/contemplating_giving_up_on_pursuit_of_software/,"24M, graduated from a high-ranked university with high GPA (3.9+) with a B.S. Computer Science back in July 2021. Due to clinical depression that I’ve suffered throughout my life, I ended up being too hyper-fixated on keeping high grades that I ended up being uninvolved in every other aspect. Like no internships, almost no interaction with classmates, no involvement in clubs/orgs, and no part-time gigs. 

As a result, my resume is as barren as it could be, giving little incentive for recruiters to vouch for me, along with almost no connections to act as a booster. I don’t believe any sort of reformatting will improve my resume, as I spoke with career coaches that looked over it and they mostly agreed that my resume is as good as I can make it with my qualifications and/or experiences. So, I feel like I’m stuck in a lost cause applying for full-time positions in the software engineering niche when I know I’ll get turned away left and right. 

I’d like to get my foot in the door anyway I can, whether it’s starting smaller from a contract job, internship, or a boot camp/coding school, but my parents (who I’ve been living with post-graduation) would not support it. They have expectations of immediate gratification, not settling for me getting anything besides a full-time job. They’re driven by their delusions that graduating from a top-ranked college alone should make me stand out regardless of my lack of experience. I would enroll in a training program or boot camp, but my parents would not provide the monetary support necessary for enrolling, so it feels like that’s out of the window. So I feel like I’ve been shut out from an optimal launching point for growth in my pursuit of a software engineering job. As for projects, I have harder time finding motivation for doing those when there’s uncertainty as to what project seems worthwhile to show off, and when there doesn’t seem to be a given structure/grader like there would be if this was a project required for class. There’s also more risk time-wise for me in investing in projects as will be made clear in first sentence of next paragraph. 

I will also be forced to move out of their house by July, so I have to find elsewhere to live and pay rent for, but I as of now have no money to my savings to afford it. So at this point, I’m contemplating giving up on finding a career in software engineering, and am considering just taking a gig in a profession that does not require initial experience (like administrative assistant or data entry clerk). 

I’ve just been feeling too overly depressed as of late that I’d be appreciative of any comments giving me insight on how I can turn my livelihood around for anyone that has been in my position or came from the same educational background as me in computer science. Offers like PMing in comments would also be heavily appreciated. Sorry for the excessive catastrophizing by the way."

I was really inspired and motivated to learn new things as i was doing my first internship and he was experienced and wasn't soo much interested in programming like me. After 1,2 weeks i was better than him in the same technology stack due to my learning capabilities and intense motivation. He told me that he was only working here because he got no other job due to covid and they are paying him very low and told me that lets start a business together initially with freelancing. Don't get me wrong he is a very good guy but too emotional because his parents died or whatever reason he is very emotional unlike me. 

Anyways he created a website started bringing work from different platforms and i also started working on them at that time was around mid 2020. I was so eager to learn and work i didn't think about earning money i always thought that we should save money to make something big. It was going good so we hired few people remotely as well and everything was going good. But deep down i knew i wasn't learning new things and not earning money. I didn't say anything i knew he would think i am being greedy. So fast forward on mid of 2021 he got a good job offer and he joined the company without asking to me.

I never asked directly that but when i talked about money they were always like we are growing doing this and that shit. I was really angry in my mind.

I am a final semester BCIS student majoring in software development, and have over the past month or so first seriously started looking for internship/graduate roles.

I am lucky enough to have landed two formal 4-month part time internship offers at two different places, but I am really stuck on deciding which one to go with. Some help would be appreciated here! For some background, most of my experience is in React.js, React-Native and Java, with a focus on the first two (experience in a few other places too like Python/DRF and C, and some backend experience with various NoSQL and SQL languages, but not as notable).

With all of the above in mind though, I am still green, so my focus is on getting experience over all else (and hopefully transitioning to a graduate role at the end).

**First option:**  
\- Startup  
\- $22 p/h  
\- Frontend focus (React, TypeScript, maybe some DRF backend)  
\- Technical interview was thorough (has better understanding of my current abilities through a coding assignment I submitted)  
\- Web development  
\- Better ""vibe"" (felt the introductions interview we clicked better)  
\- Pretty sure I'll be working on the one big project  
\- Might be bit of an assumption, but I have a feeling that I will get more of a focus from a mentor/training/support perspective than the second option

**Second option:**  
\- Small/medium growing software engineering consultancy  
\- $28 p/h  
\- Full stack with frontend focus (React, React-Native, Flutter, Firebase, AWS, probably more)  
\- Mobile and web development  
\- No technical interview surprisingly, but did chat about my experience  
\- Sounds like I'll be working on at least a couple projects  
\- Expectations seem like they might be higher

A reasonable question might be what I want to work with in the future, but honestly both mobile and web based applications have been challenging but fun (have made one RN mobile app and a few React web apps as a team). I am not sure what I want to focus on, but for now getting better with what I have some experience with at the moment has been my focus, but I am also happy to try some other things out. I do think I prefer frontend, but don't mind some backend too.

If I were to outline my current mindset, the first option feels safer and I am thinking it will help establish my foundations better perhaps, but the second option feels like it has more potential provided I can keep up with what is expected of me.

Help the indecisive me make up my mind everyone please!"

While UIUc has a better ranking, i can't say I'm a big fan of their iSchool. While that might be overlookable since i could take courses from other schools, apparently for the main course, i can only take a maximum of 2 courses iirc? 

And while it does have the research park thing for internships, i can't actually decide if that's better than the coop program or not. 

I had attended an info session on the UIUC's iSchool for msim program and it didn't actually give me much confidence. While it had some good things, the uncertainty of the speaker and the students didn't instill me with confidence. On the other hand, neu has been kinda elusive and i don't know if they even had such sessions.

So, how does one make the right decision, for the entirety of the course as well as the associated internships and job opportunities post graduation?

What are your thoughts?"

tfdbv9,3,2022-03-16,I've just been denied a good internship position and my will to keep job-hunting wavering.,Aidamis,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/tfdbv9/ive_just_been_denied_a_good_internship_position/,"Hi, I'm your average job-hunting joe trying to finish college. In my graduate school or book publishing, the last semester is a half-year internship. Last year, I didn't have many problems to find a position not too far from home, but this year I've almost exhausted the local options.

I had a lot riding on that one internship offer where at last I would have had employment close by, and yet I've been rejected. I'm probably taking it too personally and failing at looking at it in a positive light like the stoics teach us (I might eventually, not now), but the fact is the motivation to keep up the search is far from its highest.

Only a couple of small local houses remain, and then I'll have to keep applying for jobs in Capital City™ , some other places on the other side of the country or even abroad. This is the ""plan B"" situation, and I'm not liking it one bit. As stupid or weak as it may sound, I'm on the verge of flat-out giving up.

All these years I've telling myself ""unemployment? not for me"" but also ""working far from home? not for me"" and as Mark Manson wrote in ""Subtle Art of not Giving a F"", that feeling of entitlement bit me in the buttocks and caused a lot of distress.

I do not feel like ""facing"" or ""confronting"" or ""standing up"". I've had glimpses of ""courage"" in my life, but always fell back into disappointment and questions such as ""what for?"" ""for who's sake?"".

I'm nearing 28, few friends (one very dear is on the other side of the globe), six-years-too-late in my last year of college, and a whole bunch of self-respect and self-worth issues, plus nihilism.

A mental health specialist understood my unwillingness to be looking for some manual job and suggested I look for part-time if not full-time employment in local book stores or public libraries. And yet I'm afraid this would only distract me that internship-chasing. The problem is, if I don't find an internship soon, I don't know how I'll have the mental capacity to be looking for a proper ""job"" afterwards. My mind might end up in the ditch for the years to come.

Thank you for reading, I'll try to write at least two cover letters today, Capital City (TM) be damned.

Any advice, criticism, sharing your own experience is appreciated, thank you.

Have a good day, and stay safe."

Honestly its not a 1 month internship its more of a 4 months internship, I recently just got another offer of internship at a better company with better pay overall. To give u context I want to quit this internship eversince I got in, I previously had complained to the hr regarding how low I was being paid overall, It may seem like Im so money oriented but no, I am a mobile engineer with previous experience in projects and organization I even did an unpaid intern once. The problem with my current intern is that the pay is so low yet we are expected to do tasks that are seemingly a full time job so it just seems like an unpaid intern. You might ask why did you take it knowing such facts? That's the thing I didn't know, when the news broke that I was accepted I asked them how much would I receive from this internship, when they answered it was fair. But I once I got in, they changed their policy and said that they cannot pay me more. They did offer me that I can quit anytime with 1 week of prior notice. So I just went with it thinking that I could endure this 4 months, but it turns out it's just so tiring. So I am planning to quit and get into another internship, previously I've already put this internship on my LinkedIn but it's only been a month , should I just delete it from my CV and Linkedin? Or just leave it there ? I am afraid that future employer would have red flags over me if I do the wrong move. Any Input Thanks!"

My senior at the time was great but let’s just say I left without giving any notice since the other supervisor was pretty racist. 

I was a victim of domestic violence and sexual assault in the summer 2017 by my partner at the time. 

I changed my name a couple months after getting a restraining order from my ex so that I could start fresh. 

I am now moving to a new country and a new company and have found out that the decent senior from my previous company years ago has also been offered a position and will also be joining this firm. She knows me from my previous name.

When I changed my name, I wanted to have a fresh start, to literally never have to meet anyone  from my past life and from that seriously traumatic year (I understand that’s unrealistic) and to obviously protect myself from my ex. 

At a “welcome party for the newbies” zoom meeting, it was clear that she recognised me. I don’t want her to mention to anyone about my previous name and I don’t want to have to constantly share my past to people or be part of office gossip. I might actually have to work with her as well since we’re both going to be on the new team.  

Any advice please on how to approach this?"

I will be going for NS this year, but am really afraid of university education as I keep hearing that it is difficult. Hence, my queries are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. What are some useful study strategies which we can utilise?
2. Time Management tips?
3. How to balance internships with studies? (I want to aim for a perfect GPA, along with 4 to 5 internships by the time I graduate if possible.)
4. Is it possible to use my time from now till matriculation to prepare myself in any way possible? (Army time etc)
5. How important are extra-curriculars in university? (e.g. president of some club vs grades) What would be an ideal position or number of CCAs for good balance?
6. What do employers look out for, and how can I use university time to truly tailor myself as a well-employable and dedicated individual? (I heard of GPA, internships... any more criteria?)
7. Do universities hold career workshops? (like resume-writing etc - I forgot what my ECG counsellor said oops) Also, are there career centres in every university?

tfjvxx,8,2022-03-16,Baseball Team Owner Exploits Employees while Boasting about Profits,CannabisSoup,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tfjvxx/baseball_team_owner_exploits_employees_while/,"The title says it, and this obviously isn’t a new narrative. Anyway, let’s get into it;

I worked for a baseball team, I won’t say names but it’s fruit related, and the owner exploits his employees / interns SOOOOO BAD. 

I was the singular full time videographer (shot and edited pretty much everything myself, aside from TikToks &amp; regularly worked 14 hour days during the season and often taking time to finish projects off the clock, at my house) and I was making $32k/annually. Keep in mind I was receiving basically 0 bonuses/bumps if content or merch videos resulted in merch sale spikes or generated large ad revenue. Eventually I started getting like $200 if a video went over 1mil views but I had to fight for that.)

The broadcaster, who is the voice of the team and basically the only reason anyone enjoys their game broadcasts, who was also making ~32k annually, went and explained he felt he was being undervalued/underpaid, and was apparently told something along the lines of “yeah, we know” and then offered a whopping $2k raise annually. 

None of this is /too/ bad (I guess), because salaried jobs with benefits are still nice and I understand that. However, this is where the fun comes in. 

There’s apparently terrible inconsistency on pay, since I recently found out a full time employee is being paid $900 a MONTH, which certainly seems illegal but, apparently since the team is classified in the “entertainment industry”, the owner only has to pay his employees a minimum wage of $5.50/hr?? Idk how exactly that law works or if he’s just straight up breaking a law there but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

On top of that, This team literally relies on interns during the season (typically college kids eager to build their resumes) and hires a bunch every summer to properly staff up in preparation for games. That’s great, what an opportunity! Working with “the most fun team in sports”, how epic! Well, you get roped into it, most of them come from out of town (therefore having to find a place to live because, to my knowledge, that’s not provided) and you work your ass off, 9-5 on week days, 9am (11am if you get the “late start”) - ~1am depending how long the games go on game days, for $500…A MONTH. 

If the disgustingly low incomes aren’t enough, the cherry on top is that the owner and President have addressed it. Saying “we don’t have much money, so no one makes much money here”. But then, they’re profitable during Covid, only team to play a season during the pandemic!! ((Yikes)) And after almost every game last season, the owner would boast about how we crushed merch sale records, night after night! He would boast about how we’re crushing ticket sales, selling everything out! Don’t forget Online merch sales, better believe those are up, too! Also, he owns at least 3 houses, 2 of which are on the islands, one of which has a whopping ~$1.2m price tag and a private beach entrance. Claims he can only afford these homes “because we Airbnb them” yeah, maybe, but also unlikely. 

I, thankfully, got myself out of this organization. But even then, it wasn’t without what felt like some scrutiny. 

The owner never spoke a word to me once I gave news I was leaving (aside from one back handed comment of something like “oh, you actually came in today” when I showed up to work once). They even tried to kind of make me feel bad by being like “we have xyz projects we need you to finish before you go. You’re putting us in a bad spot. Yadda yadda yadda”. Well, you wouldn’t be in a bad spot if you’d hired more than one person to basically run the entire media production aspect of your team like I’d told you. But nah, you “didn’t have enough money for that” but still hired 3 new people into ticketing(??) 

Also, I frequently asked other employees if they were happy with their pay there and literally everyone I asked said no :)

But I digress, this is becoming a rant. Moral of the story, if you feel like/think you’re being exploited by your employer, you certainly are, and you should gtfo out and find somewhere that actually values you and what you do for the company."

tfo1yj,121,2022-03-16,Why Reneging is a Great Idea,pizzzaislove,UIUC,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/tfo1yj/why_reneging_is_a_great_idea/,"Someone linked this article from engineering career services as a comment to a recent post: https://students.grainger.illinois.edu/ECS/reneging-on-offers/

I found this article to be outrageous, out of touch with the real world, and downright fear mongering (if you think this is hyperbole, read the article). It basically says that you should never renege an accepted offer under any circumstances, gives a bunch of bogus reasons for this conclusion, and completely omits any discussion on when reneging might be beneficial for your career.

I don't mean to insinuate at all that you should willy-nilly renege on offers. You should value the company's time and try to only accept once you're sure. But in many cases, you don't know if or when better opportunities will come along and it's often a no-brainer to renege.

Here are some misleading and disingenuous excerpts from the article:

&gt; Reneging on an offer is a quick way to ensure that you will not able to work for that organization in the future.

No, reneging does NOT ""ensure"" that you won't be able to work for that organization in the future. Yes, it is possible that you may get blacklisted for a period of time in some cases. But most of the time recruiters can empathize with your decision and even tell you to reach out if you ever want to work there in the future. I know this from my own personal experience and that of many friends/acquaintances.

&gt; people you angered by reneging may warn others in the industry about you

Yeah, I highly doubt anybody does that. Imagine a recruiter from Amazon who is so angry with a student reneging an offer that he tells his friends at Google and Meta to never hire him. Don't be rude, clearly explain your circumstances, and apologize for the inconvenience, and I doubt anyone would get angry. It's just disingenuous to write that.

&gt; Reneging on an offer damages the University of Illinois reputation and future recruiting opportunities for Engineering students

UIUC is a top 5 CS school. The positive impact on your career that would happen if you renege for a better offer, far outweighs any loss of reputation that UIUC is going to suffer because of you. Also UIUC is a big school and companies understand that. How one student behaves has virtually no correlation how a different student might, so I doubt any employer has ever thought ""That one guy from UIUC reneged on an internship, imma not hire from UIUC this time"". Does this actually happen? Comment if you disagree.

&gt; There are consequences for reneging. Students who renege are blocked from using Handshake @ Illinois for a minimum of one semester or longer.

Lmao okay. @ECS, there are consequences for being so petty. I'm never donating money to you guys. (Countering an empty threat by making an empty threat of my own).

ECS owes it to students to give them fair and balanced advice that is most likely to help them with their careers. They should fix this article and at least make it more balanced. Thank you for coming to my ted talk."

How should I negotiate?,Ginger386,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tfohvt/just_got_my_first_offer_how_should_i_negotiate/,"A bit of backround: I'm in my last few months of college (SWE major) and have spent the last 6 months applying to places (mostly entry-level/new grad opportunities). I've got a few phone screens and assessments I still need to complete for a few other companies, though.

A company I hadn't thought too much about -- just wanted to get interview experience -- turned out to be really interesting culturally and the people who interviewed me (members of potential teams I could join) seemed really great. I could actually see myself at that company for the next couple of years, learning and growing. I was surprised and pretty excited to get my first offer from them today. I haven't gotten the full offer letter yet, but this is what the recruiter and I talked about over the phone and followed up on via email:

- 5k signing bonus
- 85k salary
- I get a relocation package, but details still incoming on what that's like
- I can pick my team and start date

Cons:

- I've been lucky enough to live at home this whole time, paying minimal utilities and expenses (courtesy of my parents), and the position requires moving a few states away. I'm kind of nervous to be on my own for the first time
- I'll be pretty far away from friends and family

My parents and friends tell me to negotiate and I've read online that I should, but I've never negotiated anything before and since the offer has a deadline and I'm a new grad, I'm scared they'll rescind. They haven't said specifically that everything is non-negotiable, so maybe it's just my nerves getting to me. I've got a couple of internships under my belt for experience, but nothing too long or too in-depth. I thought I'd take the offer to my mentor and my school's Career Services department to see what tips they can give me, but figured someone on here might've had a similar experience and could give more insight into the negotiation process (if any) for entry-level/new grad positions.

TLDR: Got my first offer and don't know how to negotiate or if I can."

So I'll be graduating in the Fall, and thankfully have an internship secured for the Summer (everyones favorite rainforest). I got reached out to by a recruiter from a well known tech company, and it got me thinking. When should I start interviewing for new grad/ full time? 

I mean I'd like to have a go at companies like Google, Apple, Netflix, some unicorns, etc. but it seems most new grad roles aren't up yet. Should I tell this recruiter I'd be ready to start interviewing in the summer, that way I can do them all simultaneously and not have to accept any offer too early? Thank you"

tftam9,45,2022-03-16,How I landed a Fortune500 internship as a freshman,Landonnnn_,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tftam9/how_i_landed_a_fortune500_internship_as_a_freshman/,"Hey there everyone,

I just received my formal job offer after a couple of rounds of interviews, and wanted to share my experience(s) for anyone else that will be in the same boat that I was. 

I’m a second-semester freshman at a small school in Tennessee, majoring in computer science with a concentration in cyber security and data assurance. At the beginning of the semester, my thought process was to try and get an internship for the summer to boost my resume, and ultimately, make me even more competitive in the coming years so I can secure a job upon graduation. 

Firstly, I worked on the important stuff. I created a LinkedIn profile and ran it through Jobscan.io to optimize my profile. I don’t think this is the most important thing, but I figured SEO optimization would be nice and might be appear higher in LinkedIn searches as well. The most important thing for the “getting started” stage is your resume. I couldn’t tell you how many revisions my resume went through before I ended up with one I actually liked. I highly recommend you nitpick your resume until you actually like it. If you finish and are thinking “Is this good?” the answer is it probably isn’t. You need to be satisfied with it. Once you are, have it critiqued. Send it to friends, families, or anyone else who would give you feedback. I had the opportunity to have my resume critiqued by an NSA employee and the CIO of a tech company based in Charleston, SC. Not everyone will have these opportunities, but you will have the opportunity to run it through ATS scans and submit to your friends or even your career office at your school. 

Second, is apply to as many jobs as you can possibly find. I personally used LinkedIn, Indeed, and Handshake. Most of my success came through LinkedIn, but I did opt for Indeed later on as it did seem to have more relevant results compared to LinkedIn. Handshake was mediocre, but it’s still a source nonetheless. I know the job application process can get tedious, filling in the same information over and over again, and correcting incorrect resume parses. I found this extension super late into my job search, but I wish I found it earlier: SimplifyJobs. It has built-in application tracking, application form auto-fill, and even it’s own job board. This is in no way a sponsored ad or anything, I just really think their product is a great tool at organizing your applications and cutting down repetitive steps to maximize your output. 

Third is the interview stage. In total, I probably applied to 60 (or more) job postings. I heard back from 7 of them for more information, and of those 7, 5 requested interviews. 5/60 is an 8% success rate— not good. That’s why it’s critical to apply to as many as you can, even small companies you’ve never heard of. A lot of them are remote now, will probably continue to operate on a remote basis, or offer relocation assistance. Anyways, you have an interview! Most companies will probably opt for a one-way interview first; such as HireVue. Fun fact about HireVue, you can find all the questions that will be asked by checking the network log in Developer Tools and find the GET request to their API: it will be a JSON response of all the questions;). One-way interviews will typically focus on what you know about the company and see how your values align with their values. Bs your answer if needed, answer how you think they want to hear. Next stage is one-on-one interviews (in-person, Zoom, MS Teams).  I’m not going to go into a full guide on proper interview etiquette, but dress in formal attire, be prepared to answer common interview questions, and be ready to highlight your experiences. Always find a way to highlight experiences during an interview. One of the questions I was asked was: “Have you ever had to explain a complex topic to someone who doesn’t have as a deep of an understanding as you?”  and I was able to highlight the fact that I have a Writeups Blog on my website where I do writeups for CTF events which shows my thought process and the ability to summarize complex tasks for a general audience to consume. Also, ask questions! Interviewers want to know that you aren’t afraid to ask questions. Ask for clarification on the job duties, on the work schedule, whether it’s remote or in-person and whether relocation assistance is provided. 

You’ve finished your interview and hopefully nailed it. What’s next? Send a follow-up email to the interviewers. To each interviewer, not just one. Thank them for their time, show your appreciation by mentioning how it was nice to meet them and learn more about the company / job, and then highlight how you think you your experiences would be a good fit for the position. Send this email within 2 days of completing your interview (I personally opted for sending the next day). If you don’t have their emails, contact the hiring manager who scheduled the interview and ask for their emails. You might hear back from the interviews, you might not. For me, it was about 50/50. Some responded and thanked me and some didn’t respond. That’s okay. 

After about a week or two, if you haven’t heard an update from the hiring manager, send an email and ask for a timeline on the process: when should I expect to hear back about next steps? This shows you are interested in the position, willing to take initiative, and are able to organize and manage your time. 

—

Those are the basic steps of the job application process, along with my tips and tricks to make yourself stand out. This is all from my personal experience, and everyones’ experiences will vary. I just cannot stress enough, apply to as many jobs as you can physically find. Most companies don’t want freshman or sophomores, so you have to choose quantity over quality. 

Some other tips that I noted:

* My tips will be useless to you if you don’t have any experience at all. For cyber security, I have done an array of capture the flags, HackTheBoxes, writeups, etc. If you’re software engineering, show some GitHub projects, practice Leetcode for the coding questions— experience is still a big factor. Because you don’t have the classroom experience, you have to have make up for it with extracurricular activity. 

* Keep track of your applications. It can get confusing when you start applying to so many, so definitely keep track. You can use the SimplyJobs extension, some other application tracker, or even create a new email to help separate the clutter. I kept Notes on my phone with what jobs I had interviewed for, been followed up with, etc. 

* Don’t get discouraged. You will see plenty of rejection emails. I was down to 3 jobs that I was waiting to hear back from post-interview. 2/3 told me on the same day that another candidate was chosen over me.. and that same day, not an hour later, I was called about accepting a job offer. 

* Be ready to improve. If you go through an interview and are denied, don’t be afraid to reach out and see how you can improve. Contact the interviewer shortly after the rejection email and just ask for feedback. Ask about how you could improve during the interview process, how you could improve your resume, how you can make yourself a more competitive candidate for the future. This is a huge green flag for interviewers— showing you are open to improvement and receptive to feedback, and can leave an impression if you happen to interview for the same company next summer. 

* Network network network. I wouldn’t advise connecting with the interviewers and hiring managers until the hiring process is over. If you get denied, connect with them via LinkedIn. If you get accepted, definitely connect with them. Networking is very important for the job searching process. 

— I hope this helps anyone in the same boat that I was in. I think applying to internships as early as possible helps 1) find out if you’re truly interested in the field and 2) boosts your experience immensely. I recommend it to pretty much every freshman: it doesn’t hurt to try."
tfusgh,1,2022-03-16,Early Career/ Progression first job questions,Ok-Definition-2362,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/tfusgh/early_career_progression_first_job_questions/,"Hi everyone, I recently graduated from UCSB with a 3.4 GPA in the BS Statistics and Data Science program and am hoping to break into the machine learning field. I have been having trouble getting interviews and have applied for roughly 100 jobs in the LA area over the past 3 months. I was in the USAF for 6 years and worked as an avionics technician on F-15's and have some hands on experience with a handful of electrical systems/trouble shooting. I had a rough go of life during school and due to various personal reasons including Covid did not work on any big projects or do any internships and I know this is my biggest weakness (technically I was in the rocket club and designed a pintle injector and did some simulations with a computational chemistry group but nothing directly ML) . Also, many of my courses from UCSB have IP protection all over them and I am not allowed to put them on GIT hub or anything to show employers some of the AWS/SPARK/Keras/neural net projects I have worked with. I would like to get into reinforcement learning and creating autonomous systems for mostly about anything. 

My question is however, that I currently have two job offers and potentially a 3rd around the corner as as I have another interview scheduled. I have offers for a systems engineer II for Boeing working on the new F-15EX specifically on the simulator side for training. As a systems engineer I don't feel I would be progressing in the ways I would like to be but the pay is decent and it's with a system/platform I am familiar with.  There would certainly be some use of creating adversarial agents and other computational problems but mostly not solved by me, I'd mostly write requirements and do the integration from my understanding. I'd have to move away from California and live in St. Louis MO which is it's own can of worms haha. (Even for continuing to look for ML work I imagine CA is the place to be, at least compared to MO). Also I know raises at contractors are hard to come by and you mostly need to transfer/ get a new job for a real raise. Ideally I could get into some of the autonomous systems they are working on as an internal transfer but far from guaranteed and I am skeptical about the type of experience it would be.  

The second offer is at least a computer science position, where I would be working at a military research lab developing classified weapons.  (ideally I'd get away from the military industrial complex, but so far they are my only offers and I'm not sure I want to wait longer than I have to find something else). The upsides here are I could create simulations/ use ML wherever I can find uses for it and potentially get patents on my work/ things that I develop if anything were to work out. Also lots of time off, every other Friday off and some decent benefits. Roughly 20k a year less than the Boeing job but seemingly in a better direction and as it's an entry level program there is a direct ladder to take me well above the Boeing salary after 5 years employment with CPI + pay raises not even factored in to those numbers. 

The third Job idk about yet, is a 'Data Science' position for NASA which clearly seems like the best fit, but there is no guarantee and the work would be automating financial reporting and working with Power BI and Tableau, which according to staff from my school, are red flags for 'analyst jobs' to be avoided to further a real ML/Data science career. Also the requirements seemed dreadfully easy and to not really be doing any work with ML, it sounded like mostly just writing scripts to integrate data sources together which I'm also not sure how much I'd really learn from that's kind of just basic coding. Ideally if I did get it, i'd be able to transfer to other things within NASA but again, a long game without any real guarantees to move in the direction i'd like to be. This job would be remote though which is a pretty big perk and like the other FED job would include my 6 years in the military so I could get a pension after 14 years if I stuck it out. 

Any advice on which to choose/ how detrimental systems engineering would really be or any systems engineers that can talk about if they manage to use any machine learning skills in their job. This is essentially the start of my career and I'd like to do my best to push it in a direction I want over the long run. I'm not sure an upfront extra 20K a year is really worth 'abandoning' a more direct CS position, but it is certainly tempting particularly with a 10% IRA match compared to the FEDS 6%."

I was able to get a internship before I completed high school at a startup and was able to successfully migrate to a contractual position doing IT during my freshmen year of college In total I have about 4 years of total experience at 19. ( I’m most likely an outlier for the most part). 

Well I wanted to move on to a more professional career path but I am having a really hard time finding work. I do interviews after interviews only to be told that they passed me for someone with more experience. But I have 4 years of experience in regards to a position that is pretty basic entry level even for me and then to also be way younger than most. I feel that’s an accomplishment in and of itself.

What am I missing?"
tfwd7h,1,2022-03-16,Feel super overwhelmed in my internship?,Ivan_834,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tfwd7h/feel_super_overwhelmed_in_my_internship/,"I’m currently a college student interning in IT for a not-well-known company that is quite large behind the scenes. I was really excited to get an internship at this company, as I thought that it would provide me with wonderful work experience in the IT field, while also being able to work with other interns. 

Despite this, when I started my first week I found out that I was going to be the only intern in my division. To add to that, I was also going to be doing full-time employee work. I wasn’t going to be doing intern projects, rather full-on professional projects. The first two days, it felt as if the company dumped such a large amount of information on me that I had never encountered before. In addition, they also did not go in depth in explaining any of it. To add to that, I was given a project to do where I had to use a database and know how to search up/specify certain projects that I needed to reference. I don’t know how to do any of that. I was told to just ask questions if needed but it feels like I’m holding my team back.

Because of the situation, it’s only the second week but I already feel like I’m regretting doing this internship. I feel so overwhelmed and am so, so stressed out sitting in a cubicle by myself with projects that I do not know how to do. In addition, this isn’t the specific field that I want to go into. I just thought that I’d do it to gain some sort of IT experience. Lastly, being the only intern in my division is very scary. I have no idea if I’m doing well at my job because I don’t have anyone to compare my work to, and no one to socialize with that’s my age. Is this how internships typically are, or better internships guided far better than this? I’m genuinely thinking of plotting for my two weeks already because I’m just so miserable, but also thinking of staying just long enough so I can satisfy my internship credit for school. If anyone has any advice please let me know, thank you"

These health problems made me very depressed at the time as it seemed i would never recover from it and possibly end up dying from it this made me cut off most communication with many people including her without telling her anything i was dealing with so i intern ghosted her by accident.

It took about 1-2 years for me to finally get over my whole depression even after getting cured as it really fucked up my whole prospective on life however as things were getting better I started to talk more and more about the issues i was going through and reviving  lost friendships.

However I still managed to forget to inform my ex/crush about all of this making it look like I had just left our ""relationship"" behind without warning this didn't sit right with me due to the fact we are all about to leave high school soon and I don't want there to be any bad blood between us. 

Since we both had mutual friends it really wasn't hard for me to do so, however when i tried to talk to her she seemed quite distant and really wanted to move away from the conversation but it didn't seem to have any ill intent as to why. 

I was somewhat happy with the results of the conversation as it kind of left us on speaking terms.

Fast forward to today, I had just came back from doing some sports with a group of my friends and due to this i was quite agile and not in tune with my surroundings this meant when my crush was coming past to get into a class I was walking past I must have stuck my foot out right as she was going through tripping her up in front of everyone and all i could really say was a low effort sorry due to embarrassment.

I tried to apologise again to her in private but it seemed  like she just wasn't having none of it.

What the hell do i do as i really don't want to seem like the bad guy here but all my efforts turn out to screw me over.

TLDR: I stopped talking to my ""GF"" at the time for 2 ish years and when i tried to mend our friendship I ended up tripping her up in front of her whole class."

tfxen1,4,2022-03-16,Fear of not Making It.,Pipipomu,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/tfxen1/fear_of_not_making_it/,"I have this strange feeling of not being successful and constantly worrying that I will end up disappointing my family. It has gotten to a point that it keeps me up at night, feeling anxious of the future. Part of it might be due to seeing how my brother's life has always played out. He hasn't graduated and is constantly falling behind in life.. My parents are positive and supportive of him, but when people are constantly questioning his goals and where he is heading with life now that he is almost at his 30s, it feels that my parents are slowly starting to doubt him. My mother cries and keeps asking why her son is the way he is and my dad has lost hope in him too. My parents say that they believe in me and that they never felt any sort of worries towards my future and goals because they think I have never given them any sense of disappointment. All of this at some point did make me believe that I might be able to support them and become successful after I graduate.  


I have always been the straight As type of student. Got internship, made good connection throughout uni life, and have always been showered with compliments by friends, professors, and relatives. However, deepdown, I've always felt that I am very undeserving of this. I have felt nothing but pressure and a sense of fear that one day everything will collapse. It is going to sound so selfish when I say this, but I don't want to be like my brother. I try to not think that way, but every time something incovinient happens, I feel like I will disappoint everyone. I feel very guilty and selfish everytime I think this way, because my brother has always been supportive of me. Infact, we've both always been supportive and there for each other. I like to believe that whatever I am right now has a lot to do with the role he has played in my life. He has done nothing wrong, but always have been supportive and there for me whenever I needed someone the most. He constantly reminds me that my everything in my life has been going smoothly, and that it will continue too for a long-run. He tells me that I have everything figured out. When I try telling him I am scared that I might not make it to the real world, he laughs it off becuase he thinks I am being ridiculous for thinking in such a way. He says that there is nothing to worry about and that he's shock to see me think this way because of how everything has been going for me.  


I am graduating this semester, but I have terrible feeling that what if I don't graduate? I have 2 Cs right now and it keeps stressing me out thinking that if I don't graduate by this semester, I am going to fail my parents. I will become what my brother has become to them. I am scared that people will say that their children are the same. I am so scared.. I don't know how to get rid of this anxious feeling. I have shared this with my mom but she just laughed it off and said there was no way I wouldn't graduate this semester. My brother also had the similar reaction to what I said. I am so concerned and it makes me want to cry and throw up. It's not just about graduating, but also the thought that what if I don't get a job after graduating? What if my degree will be nothing but meaningless (I had to fight my parents when I chose the major that they disapproved of) I don't know what to do.. My fear is taking over my life and my grades are reflecting that too at this point."
tfxhk9,1,2022-03-16,Seeking advice on breaking into analytics field (mostly IT experienced and some analytics coursework),_Olive_Juice_,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tfxhk9/seeking_advice_on_breaking_into_analytics_field/,"I’m looking for some advice as I’ve started on my efforts for breaking into the analytics field. I graduated two years ago with a bachelor’s in MIS and a business analytics minor, and I have since then worked as an IT auditor. It’s not nearly as technical or interesting as I’d like my work to be. I’ve spent the past month applying to 30-40 jobs and have gotten 2 phone interviews with nothing beyond that for either. I got the vibe for both interviews that they didn’t think I had enough analytics-related experience as I talked through my resume, which was a tad frustrating of course. 

  

&amp;nbsp; 

  

In my analytics coursework in college, I took classes on using Excel, SQL, R, and Tableau. I did pretty well and still feel comfortable using those skills today (I have them listed on my resume). I also had a brief internship that was somewhat analytics related, and I have other internships/work experience as an IT business analyst and IT service desk employee. I understand I don’t have extensive experience in a strictly data analyst role, so I’m hoping to get some advice on some ideas on I have on how to proceed next: 

  

&amp;nbsp; 

  

1. See if I can get transferred to an analytics role within my company. I’m not sure how realistic this would be, as there don’t seem to be analytics openings very often at my public accounting company. I also don’t want to get in hot water for showing that I do not want the current job I have, but maybe I’m over thinking that (my manager knows I have a strong interest in analytics).  

  

2. Keep applying to jobs as a currently am doing. I know the job hunt isn’t easy, so I could keep applying consistently and hope for the best.  

  

3. Take time away from applications and instead work on a portfolio and/or certifications, and then go back to applying. Right now, I do not have a portfolio or any certifications.  

  

4. Apply for IT-related jobs at other companies and try to get transferred into an analytics role there after a while.   

  

&amp;nbsp; 

  

I know I have seen some form of all of these options through browsing this subreddit, but maybe providing some background information on my situation could help narrow things down. Thanks in advance!"
tfxj8e,5,2022-03-16,How to get into coding,Evansnotfunny,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tfxj8e/how_to_get_into_coding/,"Hi, I'm a 15-year-old in high school and I've made a decision on the future career path that I will take. I want to get into software engineering with a computer science major and I'm wondering If I should start learning how to code. I want to get into a top university so I see a lot of benefits of starting now. I'm not sure where to start off, I also want to land myself an internship later in my high school years. I have a ap comp sci course junior year so I will be taking that as well, but by then I should be pretty well versed.  

How should I learn? Do I self-teach? How do I land myself an internship?"

tfy4bh,3,2022-03-16,Messing up at my first internship,Jhit_Slime,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tfy4bh/messing_up_at_my_first_internship/,"I'm a first year currently on my first internship doing SWE at a well known Canadian company. Before joining, I thought I would be progressing really fast, but I quickly got humbled.

It's now been 2.5 months, and I've still not gotten comfortable with the tech stack, or how industry practices are in general.

Even today, I got absolutely roasted on my PR (not in a mean way) and I'm worried that I won't get a return offer because the coworkers probably see me as a burden to the team, even though I really am trying my best.

Is this a normal experience for the first coop, or is there something else that I can be doing in order to not be seen as much of a burden?

Also, where TF do people get ""quantitative metrics"" from? I see a ton on random resumes but it all seems like it's made up...

Any advise is appreciated, thanks."
tfzmes,1,2022-03-16,Advice For Entry-Level Game Dev Jobs,Jafale,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/tfzmes/advice_for_entrylevel_game_dev_jobs/,"I’m going to be graduating in May with a Bachelors in Computer Science (I technically double majored in Math too). The job I have lined up doesn’t start until September, so I figured I should probably have a summer job so there’s no big gap in my resume. As someone with a long-standing interesting in game dev, I keep on gravitating towards the industry in my job search. 

However, I admit I know nothing about breaking into the game dev industry, much less securing a job that would work for my situation and just run from May to September. Are temporary jobs like these common, and are there specific places to look (or others to avoid)? Is a 5-month stint long enough to be considered a normal employment period in the game dev industry, to where I can confidently look at full-time positions rather than temporary ones?

Obviously I would just be looking for something entry-level. Would even an internship be worth looking at, even though I’ll have graduated by then? I have already done one internship, though it was in platform engineering, not game development. 

In terms of prior experience, I’ve been in my university’s game dev club for a few years now, I took a class on game dev where I worked with Unity, and I’m currently doing a senior design project that’s a game in Godot. So I do have a few projects. In terms of specializations that might make me stick out, I have also done four semesters’ worth of undergrad research in audio software and signal processing if that means anything. 

So overall, is it even feasible to be looking for a game dev job given my constraints, or am I better off looking at a summer job in a different field? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as this is totally new territory for me."

I just got diagnosed with ADHD, still have been in university and i am afraid i won’t be able to finish it ever and humiliate myself. I don’t want to be an adult who can’t take responsibilities and don’t see any respect. Feeling like i can’t grow up. I am trying to find new ways to collect credit outside of my university, because i might get academic suspension. Even though i found many online courses and different alternatives being really enthusiastic about them i don’t trust myself to ever complete them nor am i putting enough work on my current semester. I want to do an internship this summer etc. İ always plan things but can’t get myself to do it when it’s real. Although i throw myself in uncomfortable situations and force myself but school requires continuity, weekly, biweekly homeworks, final project, final exams, quizzes…even when you start writing an assignment it needs to be continuous and you need to maintain motivation and focus. I am trying though, harder then earlier in my 5th year at uni 🤦🏻‍♀️ But when i say yes i am doing it! Next day i might turn completely opposite, drgging myself to check my agenda. I am teying to be disciplined but i am struggling, feeling stupid, lazy, unskilful. Creates lots of insecurities and ancirty anda really heavy feeling of shame. Any practical or emotional advise would be much appreciated!"

I'm currently attending Umass Lowell and have a 3.1 gpa (yes I understand this is not good, not bad gpa (more on the bad side though), my goal is to bring it up to a 3.2+ before I graduate).

I also have a 6-month IT internship that I have on my resume as well (though I'm not sure I will keep it on there as it isn't exactly relevant work experience) with my boss there being my only professional reference.

What I'm currently stressing about is what kind of job offers I should be expecting when I eventually graduate. Although I keep hearing about very generous offers for students graduating with computer science degrees, I refuse to believe it is all true. Salary wise and benefit/location wise, what should my expectations be for my first job out of college?

**CMU:** 

\+ Great brand name 

\+ Located in Silicon Valley 

\+ Better Internships opportunities 

\- Small campus size 

\- Not as good as Pittsburgh

I'm a penultimate year Physics student at a top UK uni and I look forward to work in quant finance, although I didn't manage to secure a relevant internship this year due to my lack of preparation. Instead, I have two other offers for the summer. One is for data science at a global analytics company, which is not very known to the general public and I am not sure how known it is within its niche sector (mostly deal with insurance and energy clients).  The other one is for research at CERN, which is the top scientific institution on the planet, with a mostly computational/data analysis project on particle collisions, although I am not sure if the work will teach me any relevant skills that I can apply later on.

Regardless of my choice, I will also be preparing for quant recruitment (probability, stats, brainteasers, leetcode etc.) during the summer.

I know that some places will likely not consider your graduate role application without relevant work experience (eg. Citadel confirmed this at their Data Open last week) so I am in a dilemma right now. Any opinion on my situation will be greatly appreciated."

My job essentially revolves around being a support to the senior management team for a department, along with the analysts in it, even though they aren't technically my boss nor within my team. For context, I've been in this role for just around 2 years.

About a year ago, there was a huge change in the management structure of the senior team I was supporting, and as I result, my workload dramatically increased. It didn't help that my immediate manager went on maternity leave at the same time, so I had to begin shouldering most of the work she had previously done. I did receive some support when she had left, but the support herself has also just gone on maternity leave, leaving me alone with an intern to do all the work.

At the moment I'm just extremely worn out by the amount of responsibility and work on my plate at the moment. My mental health has significantly worsened, and I feel like I have this brain fog all the time. I used to even work out every morning, but I've stopped because I just feel so tired from work now. I'm being asked to make decisions that I'm in no way ready to make, and while I did manage to receive a promotion, it feels forced rather than something I've earnt.

I'm kind of at an impasse at the moment I guess. I genuinely do like the team I work with, and my manager will be coming back from her maternity leave very soon. But even then, I feel like the workload will never subside, and my manager will be coming back part-time initially due to personal issues. I'm questioning if there is even a point to me going to work now because I just end up sitting at my dazed for the entire day, completing 1 or 2 tasks before just heading home. 

I've tried taking a few breaks but I feel like I end up just working on most days because there really isn't anyone to take my place whenever an issue comes up, and I don't want to leave the intern on our team alone to deal with all these issues. I've started looking at other jobs as well, but I'm definitely despairing at going through another job search, especially since I'll need to request another visa sponsorship to continue working in the UK, while working in my home country will be unlikely as I'm not fluent in the language spoken there.

I don't really know what else there is to say I guess. I'm just extremely burnt out and I just feel like I'm waiting to get fired at this point. Anyone has tips dealing with burnout/advice in my situation?"

The first semester went amazing, I had near-perfect grades, I made friends, I thought things were going to go well and I was going to do great. 2nd semester, not so well, my grades fell to the lowest point I had ever seen them. I became unmotivated, I was forced into becoming the General Manager of a job I didn't like to support myself enough to pay for college and my life in general. I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Severe ADD and Moderate ADHD which is not an excuse for anything but I was pressured to go see a doctor by my girlfriend, friends, and family as they were confused about what happened. I felt horrible and eventually just stopped going to class and mentally checked out, skipping all exams and cutting everyone off. I obviously failed all of my classes and was placed on Academic Probation. I focused on myself during the summer and I thought I was doing a lot better. I was still in the horrible job that I wasn't even able to take time off at but I felt much better. I started the semester with great ambitions and started off strong, with all A's, I had spoken to multiple Multi-Billion Dollar companies about internships and I was offered two for the Summer of 2022. I was thriving, until the beginning of October. I lost all motivation again, I quit my job and obtained a new one that took A LOT of stress off me and I was paid more and received benefits that started in November but I feel it was too late. I proceeded to stop attending classes and just mentally checked out and did not attend my exams resulting in a 2nd flunked semester in a row. With this came Academic Suspension. I did not attempt to readmit and appeal the decision for the Spring semester of 2022 because I understood I needed to figure out what I was doing wrong and what changed. I am taking one class at a community college just for the credit and to stay up on my skills and I am doing well in it. I just spoke to my university about coming back in the Summer or Fall of this year and I was told that due to my GPA, I should consider obtaining another Associate Degree and transfer to them in the Spring of 2024 (My expected latest graduation date). I have no idea what to do or where to go. Should I apply to another university and would they even accept my application? This is my fault and I do not expect pity, I just want advice. My family has no idea this is happening and they thought up until I saw them last year that I would be graduating Spring of 2022. Do I just take a break and take a few classes here and there and use my Associate Degree to obtain a decent job for now or should I attempt to find a new college and finish out my degree as quickly as I can (Probably about 2 years).

**A little context:** I'm finishing up my computer science degree over the summer and I have been doing web dev freelancing here and there through college. So, I figured it was time to start applying to jobs. I spent the last few weeks applying to hundreds of jobs and interviewed with a couple and managed to get an offer letter fairly quick.

**The process:** I started applying to any entry/junior/mid level developer jobs about 2.5 months ago. This particular job application and interviewing process took a month from start to finish. First they asked for a code sample, then I had a phone call with the founder, and finally an in-person interview with the CTO and another developer. A couple weeks later I got a phone call and discussed compensation and received the offer letter.

**The position:** Its marketed as a full-time frontend position (html, css, js, php) but they said they may need a little bit of backend work as well. The company is a small startup with around 10 employees that has one other developer excluding the CTO. They wanted me to start full-time asap but due to my summer classes they instead offered me an internship until I graduate. This is fine with me since I will have flexibility with my hours to accommodate my summer classes and I will have the option of going full time once I graduate (August 4, 2022) where I’ll be getting a salary with benefits, PTO, etc. My only concern is the stability of the position since it is a small startup.

Edit: The internship is paid!

Yesterday they reached out asking if I wanted to interview with them, and I agreed, scheduling the interview for 9 am this morning.

Right off the bat, they say the internship is unpaid. I was obviously annoyed by that, but I kept my cool, because having an internship is better than not having one, to get experience at least. It'll be good to see how it goes in the real world with a real dev team.

Oh, no. My bad. Later on, the interviewer let me know that there's no dev team. I would be working by myself, with no supervision, writing code that literally no one else there understands, creating entire programs from scratch. 

The interviewer kept trying to convince me that it was better they hire me, and not someone with 10+ years of experience because the one with 10 years of experience would know better what works, and what doesn't. I'm paraphrasing that in a way that shows how dumb that is.

For some reason they also mentioned that I would have weekly assigned readings. Such topics as, I kid you not, how and why to smile more.

But I don't think the people at the company are actually dumb. I think they know exactly what they're *attempting* to do. They want to make it sound super exciting that I have the privilege to write their code for free, and get all this experience. That way, they don't have to actually pay someone to write code. Where that logic falls though is here:

I'm not a great programmer. That goes for the majority of comp sci students. The fact that they think that the code I, or another student like me, could produce code similar in quality to that of a senior developer, is baffling. This *will* come back to bite them in the ass. 

What happens when their intern leaves, and they have no one to maintain the code? What happens when they finally hire an actual developer with actual experience, and they have no idea what the previous intern did (because there's likely 0-5 lines of comments)?

Ultimately though, if I do end up getting selected, it could be fun to just write absolutely trash code, and make it worse and worse while keeping it under the radar."

I applied both this year and last year - I remember last year being devastated when I was rejected.

I know it feels like these things make or break you - but they don’t. This year I did get an interview but I’m still not sure whether I’ll get the position, and I’m okay with it if I don’t. I know its really upsetting when these things don’t work out the way we want them to - but don’t let these experiences define you! There are so many opportunities out there and your worth is not based on getting into one program. I was able to get a job last summer and an internship this semester without SiR and at the end of the day, things work out.

Just a message to anyone out there feeling stresssd or anxious - good luck to you and if you don’t get it, don’t worry, because I promise you this won’t be the thing that makes or break you. :)"

At this point in my life i am stuck at a crossroads between working a dog shit minimum wage job in which i would never be able to support my self financially (23 still live with my parents) or go back to community college to finish a degree in a career i do not see myself doing (Dental Hygiene) but as of late webdev/programming has sparked my interest. The school i am considering going to is Austin Community College and it looks like they have a pretty good Web dev program and also have certifications, internships and other opportunities available to help someone get their foot in the door but from browsing various webdev subreddits i have gotten mixed messages about going to school for this career field, i understand that you ‘don’t need’ to go to college to learn these skills but as someone who barely knows anything about the field i believe it could be beneficial in some ways. Outside of books/travel/gas my tuition is completely covered by Chapter 35. I currently have been learning Javascript on Team Treehouse, what other resources would you guys recommend to learn and immerse myself in programming? Any feedback is appreciated! Thank you.

Edit: I am currently unemployed and have saved enough $ from my previous jobs to help me get through school if i choose to go that route."

The recruiter at the company told me that I will get the formal contract ""in the next few weeks"".

I waited for a week and asked for an update. They emailed back pretty quickly and told me my offer details have been sent to the pre-employment team and I will receive the paperwork ""over the next week"". That same week I got a background check form, which I completed right away.

It has been a bit more than 2 weeks since I submitted my background check (the emails stated that it usually takes 1-5 business days) and I haven't gotten anything. I emailed the recruiter again 2 days ago asking about the status of my process, but so far there is no response. Now I'm very worried b/c I've never seen such a long wait between an offer and a formal contract and I fear that they are no longer going through with the offer for reasons I'm unaware of.

My questions:

1. What else can I do on my end? The recruiter has their number in the email signature. Should I just wait? Should I call them? Message them on Linkedin?
2. Is this delay between the initial offer and formal contract common in big companies?
3. Is it common for companies to rescind offers at this stage of the process? I'm sending out more applications to other companies in case this one falls through.

Thank you all in advance! As you can see I'm very anxious right now :')"

I have been lurking on this sub for more than a year now, decided to create my own post to explore available options in my current situation. Firstly, I'll be summarizing the points which I believe the most important, then I will touch upon the specifics which might change the optimal outcome. Without further ado, lets jump into it!

&amp;#x200B;

* I am a senior Industrial Engineering student (I will be graduating in July, 2022)
* The language of instruction for my program is English.
* My program is awarded with European Accreditation of Engineering Programs (EUR-ACE) label, this means that my degree is recognized within USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and all the member EU countries.
* Currently working as a Software Developer (Specialized in Robotic Process Automation \[RPA\]) in an exporting company.
* **Working Experience:** 

1. 4 months of internship experience in an American Esports company (as a Community Manager)
2. 6 months of managing my own start-up (also an Esports team). *I want to add here that we were about to receive $200,000\~ of investment for the project, but things didn't go as planned with the other co-founders and in my personal life.*
3. I have been working as a Software Developer for 10 months as of now, will have 1 year of experience by the time I graduate from university.

* Have around $30,000 to finance my further study-relocation. 
* I have lived in Sweden for 6 months (thanks to Erasmus+) and really enjoyed my stay there, however making ""real"" friends was a bit problematic experience for me.
* I am a native Turkish speaker, besides I believe my English is approximately at C1-2 level depending on the subject (haven't had a chance to prove it via exams like TOEFL yet), other than these two maybe I can add very limited Swedish to the bucket as well.
* I am looking for a journey that maximizes my ROI given my limited resources, would prefer continuing with MSc rather than directly searching for job offers (I believe this will benefit me much better in the long run).
* Even though title suggests that I am willing to go ""anywhere"", I am more inclined towards places that I would feel more ""welcomed"" rather than being treated as a complete outsider, alien-like. 
* Would love to live in a country like Switzerland which is considered as international (cantons like Zurich), financially stable, safe, organized etc.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to talk a bit about my story to give a deeper context as well. I was born and raised in Istanbul (a city that accommodates more than 15 million people) with my father but I have lost him due to cancer after 6 years of fight against it last year around. Afterwards I was forced to sell the house by the local government since I couldn't afford re-building it due to approaching earthquake threat. Now I am somewhat broke, lost my father, burnout from studying and working at the same time, traveling 4 hours each and every day to go to work-school, living with my mother since the rent prices skyrocketed in Istanbul, and feeling lonely during all this process. However, I still think that I can prevail, I have not give up yet and not looking forward to do it anytime soon, there is always a way out of a misery and everything is temporary, therefore this is the main reason I am posting this. 

Logically there are three main options for me;

* Continue studying in Turkey with MSc (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data Analytics or related fields) while working, then try to find a job or a doctorate program abroad.
* Concentrate on the job, get the necessary experience (3-4 year) then seek a job outside of Turkey.
* Directly sail towards abroad, try to make it elsewhere by studying and working (if I'm lucky enough to find a job).

I am not sure which path should I follow, kind of lost to be honest whilst bearing with all the tasks I have to do right now. I would appreciate your takes on the situation on hand since I do believe outside perspectives might be helpful here. 

Lastly, I want to point out that I have nothing against Turkey, love my country and culture. This is more related with the things I have experienced personally that lead me to this direction, but I also can't deny that the uncertainty and financial instability that I feel as a young Turk played a role in this. I also want to thank in advance for those who made it this far into the post for their time, sorry if this was a bit longer than necessary, but I needed this."

Sports Product Management at the University of Oregon,NAMI_JUN,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tgllb6/is_grad_school_worth_it_sports_product_management/,"Hey guys, so I am currently a Senior in Undergrad and I was just applying for internships and what not, and decided to apply for the Masters of Science at Sports Product Management program on a whim. I did well on the interviews and now as result I have been accepted into the program. Although I am very excited about being accepted, there is one thing that is really holding me back which is the price. 

Graduate School is extremely expensive, and I am worried about being finically restricted for the rest of my life. Money is a huge issue for me and as a result I am currently about to graduate with my bachelors with almost no debt. With that being said working in the sport industry and working on sports products has always been a dream of mine since I was little, and now I have an opportunity to get into industry through this program. I am worried about the price, but I just wanted to hear from others if it is worth cost and time to pursue a graduate degree in sport product management. 

I have asked reddit before about other big life decisions in the past and people have been helpful and extremely supportive, so with that being said, please let me know what you guys think!

I'm in the process of trying to get hired as a self-taught developer. I just have a lot of doubts about what I can do and what kind of job I should aim for.

I would say my skills are mostly, React, Javascript, CSS, SCSS.

Ideally, I would want to aim for an internship or Junior level position but the industry these days, those are few and far between.

So I wanted to ask..

&amp;#x200B;

1. What was your first job? Was it a regular position as a full blown web developer?
2. Has any ever gotten hired and been like ""Crap, I'm not capable of this work."".
3. What was your stack at the time of your first job?

Any tips, comments, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."

Second job is Blockchain devloper in a small start-up. Package is 30LPA. I loved my mentor here, work is very interesting.(now working as an intern) Only problem is that crypto market is very unpredictable and I feel this job does not provides the stability as the company very small now(10-15 people).
I am 23 years old so I am thinking whether to take the high risk reward route or work for some time in a stable company, save some money and then switch job in Blockchain industry."

I think I’m ready to move out at 24 - would appreciate your advice on if this is a good idea and any tips for a good location etc.

I graduated, got an internship, then secured a full time job over the pandemic. I’m currently living with my parents in suburbia. My job is near Sherway Gardens and my annual take home is around 80k. By my calculations, 1700 monthly seems reasonable for rent but I’d like to keep it lower if possible.

I’m considering moving out to gain some independence and start to focus more on my career, well-being, and maybe start actually having a dating life. Super bored at home.

Parkdale area seems to be a good fit. Other options would be some other west side TO neighbourhood (suggestions welcome), get 2+ roomies and live in a liberty village condo or something, or maybe live in Etobicoke.

Pros:
- ~20 minute commute (comparable to current situation)
- close to trinity bellwoods, ossington, little portugal for restaurants/bars 
- close enough to sauga to visit parents
- higher density area so easy to find gyms, classes, activities, grocery etc

Cons
- more expensive than etobicoke
- potential roaches/bedbugs in that area it seems?
- guilty to leave immigrant parents

Thoughts? Also would getting roommates through one of those Facebook groups be advisable to save money?

Thanks so much."

I really enjoy the coding courses that I have taken and am wondering if I’m just better off trying to get a CS internship. 
I work for a small biotech startup working on a drug delivery product, but it is not dealing with genomics at all.

I plan to pursue higher education, but I was hoping to get some guidance from people in the field about what steps I should take given my current situation. I am fascinated and excited by the new innovations in this field and really don’t want to make the wrong choice just because I don’t know what to do next.

tgmgcd,0,2022-03-17,A close friend of my family is in need of money and I don’t know if I should help her instead of a family member.,Independent-Jaguar-1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tgmgcd/a_close_friend_of_my_family_is_in_need_of_money/,"Heres the deal, a really close friend of my family just got in debt with a mental health institution because she interned her daughter in said place.


Turns out the place is ridiculously expensive and she was told not to intern her in there due to its price but she did it regardless.


Currently they are not doing exceptionally well so she was forced to make a raffle in order to raise money for the occasion.

Now I feel bad for her, I’ve known her ever since I was born but don’t get me wrong, I barely know her or her family but  she’s been around since ever and I treat her as my aunt.


One of the reasons as of why I feel bad is because her husband died 7 years ago due to a cardiac arrest, they where a lovely family, they where famous around the group for being a pretty close family and it all went to crap since then.

They didn’t deserve this at all so I wanted to help them giving around 1.2k or so , its nothing compared to the amount they owe but it’s money I don’t intend in using and that I currently don’t “need” and I know I’ll get them back eventually.

But then I realised about something, if I am willing to spare 1k to a family friend , why am I not willing to spare it to my biological aunt who is currently in debt and will get out of debt if I where to pay that amount.

I line her and all but its a different scenario or so I think.


My other aunt the one we are talking about is barely getting any help from friends and family members, I even think that if I where to pay that amount it wouldn’t matter since she is friends with a pretty wealthy guy who is more thank likely going to be paying for everything once the raffle is over.


But Idk I almost feel as if I should help her, there’s other family members who might need that cash as well but they are not even close on being in debt with such amount tho so idk what should I do.


I don’t even know how my family is going to react once they find out , my family is not particularly well but I am doing well atm so I might as well help but tbh idk what to do."

Before enrolling in a local CC I was a duty manager at a major airport, and before that I was an operations supervisor. I have about 8 years of real work experience so I think I can hit the ground running with a degree, regardless of internships.

The problem is im not too passionate about computer science. I don't hate it, but I was only doing it for the money. plus I legit suck at math, I remember in HS it took me 7th, 8th and 9th grade to pass algebra 1. 

Anyways im looking into a lucrative major, my schools offer Business Admin, with Finance Concentration as the closest majors to finance. I can do Econ, since its not as math intensive.  But I've read some people claim Econ isn't as good a major as finance. My main concern is maximizing earnings potential. I was also looking into coding bootcamps but they seem very sketchy, hit or miss kinda deal.

Never went for any internships or anything like that either. So when I graduated i was jobless and mentally ill. Fast forward to today, i am still jobless. I spent the last 2 years doing absolutely nothing. My mind was just blank. But lately I have been feeling much better. I realised that I just wasted 2 years of my life and i don't know what to do anymore. I have no work experience of anysort and I think i am starting to loose touch with my degree. ( Studied EEE). Lately i was thinking of doing a masters or MBA but it seems the application period is mostly over for 2022? If that is the case then it seems that plan will have to be on hold for another year atleast. Can any of you help me out? I just need some guidance or something.

So I applied at one of the biggest if not the biggest web dev company in my region. I got the position and went there on monday which was my first day, expecting a little tour and signing the contract. But nope. I got my first project which is basically a web application for a client and got to work. This being my first real ""job"" I didn't say anything. It wasn't until friday that I got my contract. And to sum it up: 40hrs/week at about 2.80€/hr (For reference minimum wage is about 9.80€/hr.) or to be precise with what's in the contract: 450€/Month.  
  
Not only do I get a fraction of the minimum wage while working on a client project on my own, but I even have to do the same hours as everyone else. Remember the 40hrs/week? It's more like 45hrs/week since my 1hr break per day doesn't count to the 40hrs. This wouldn't be that bad if I would get paid fairly but at 2.80€/h it's a whole other story.

I'm an undergrad comp sci student graduating this coming May. I have a decently high GPA, 3.89, but unfortunately, I took some not-so-great advice from someone close to me and didn't go for any internship opportunities in the past few years so that I could just focus on doing well in my classes and graduating ASAP. It wasn't until recently that I realized just how helpful having internship experiences would've been to increase my chances of landing more/better interview opportunities.

Anyway, so I ended up completing the entire interview process for an entry-level SWE position with a single company --  a ""WITCH"" one. I was shocked at how easy the first round of ""technical interviews"" was. This was the situation I faced: I was supposed to have two back-to-back interviews, but there was some sort of technical malfunction/error on the company's side and I ended up only interviewing with one of the interviewers... and then the HR manager who organized all of this didn't even bother to reschedule the second interview OR even make me go through the final HR round because I ""did so well with the first interviewer."" Idk, it sounded kinda weird/fishy to me.

Lol so I got the job and while the compensation obviously wasn't impressive or anything, the base pay was about ""average"" or a smidge higher than the average starting salary for an entry-level SWE position in my area. And I'd have health/dental/vision insurance, 401k, etc., as well as the option to work remotely, which is something that I see as a perk. Another thing that interested me, though, was that the hiring manager told me that I'd be given an option to work with a FAANG company for my first ""assignment"" after my training. Is this considered a ""decent"" opportunity for a fresher at this sort of company? If I were to take this position, I definitely wouldn't want to stay at the company for more than a year -- but would it hurt my chances of getting better positions in the future? I keep hearing terrible things about the reputation of these sorts of companies sabotaging peoples' future shots at ""higher tiered"" companies.

Would it be a bad idea to practice LeetCode/increase my skill set by working on personal projects and such while working for this WITCH company so that I can make some money in the meantime? Any advice is appreciated, I'm kind of at a loss right now :(

TLDR; graduating senior CS major with high GPA but no internship experience, should I accept an offer from a WITCH company and work for a year while increasing my skill set/practicing LeetCode to prep for other opportunities, or just focus on LC/interview prep after graduation and then apply for a ton more jobs?"

I studied Digital Games with a focus on Game Art and finished my studies (bachelors degree in Germany) last March. 
Sadly I am incredible unhappy in my job and its very niche application. Always stressed out about the future and barely enjoying life thanks to that. 

In the last few months I noticed that I am really interested in programming so I started with CS50 and 100 Days of Python by Angela Yu (Day 20 so far).
I‘m really really enjoying it and I‘d love to switch careers as quickly as possible as I‘m „already“ 27 years old and very goal oriented.

I looked into a masters degree in computer science (FH Trier) that I could do without having an IT related bachelor, but for that I need another 6 months of work experience.
Sadly I don‘t really see myself staying at the current job for another 6 months.

So now I‘m thinking about my possibilities…
Is there any way to get entry jobs without having experience before? Or even internships? 
So I can get my full 1 year work experience before jumping into the masters? 

I have quite some money saved, so affording life ain‘t priority number one.

If you do not share the same and have had the acceptances you’ve wanted, congratulations! May more come your way, :). If not, hopefully this post will show you that you’re not alone. 

Where do we begin?

During my 9th grade year I had to take care of an ill parent, deal with a degrading chemistry teacher, and adapt to an environment where I was constantly being bullied. My GPA naturally suffered, and throughout high school I was playing catch up to fix it. I took nearly all the extracurriculars that my school provided, found my love for tech entrepreneurship and law and developed a social debate platform, did summer courses, and SAT prepped for 2 years. 

Not only that, but I reached out to so many school administrators and people in my area for internships, programs, asked for more AP courses to be included in the curriculum. I went through hell and back to receive nothing but silence.

Everything I’ve done has been to no avail as my school provided literally no support system. They picked school favorites and gave them the best networking opportunities, placed in the best word for them to the colleges, and even the teachers knew them and looked after them, especially their grades.

All of the work I’ve done has amounted to nothing but rejection letters.

Is it just me, or everything you do can be overshadowed by someone with the right connections or networks? You could of worked your ass off when it comes to your extracurriculars or volunteer hours, your research projects, your essays-but none of that will matter if someone is already predetermined to get that seat of yours. It’s really left a stain on my view of schooling and the college application process. 

It’s gotten to the point where college isn’t even my main goal right now. Not even an interest. I’m actually considering just pursuing the development of my startup and going from there, but I know the amount of risk that’ll entail and the scrutiny I’ll get from friends and family. 

Does anyone else feel as if these past few months have really gone to prove that it isn’t what you know or did, but who you know that counts?"

Case went fine, but behavioral yikes! 

Right off the bat the behavioral interviewer asked me who i case interviewed with bc I mentioned I was coming from a case interview and i honestly didn’t remember her name and I told him that and how I was a very focused on the case and wound up. And then a minute later, I told him who it was after finding her info. 

Started off rocky 😭😭

And then when I was talking to him about one of my consulting experiences, and how we need to analyze a large data set, and he kinda was like “oh that’s not that much” 

And then he’s like “oh that’s like that’s an interesting recommendation, and not to be rude but I’m assuming you don’t know why it’s so important”… and like yeah I didn’t know as much as him but I’m interviewing for an internship and he’s an executive of the firm. I totally appreciate the knowledge but it felt a little condescending, especially bc it was an interview for the position and not just a coffee chat or something.

And then he ended with “can I give you a piece of advice, and I understand that nerves play a role, but you talk a little fast”. And again I can take criticism and advice it’s just like the vibes of the interview were just off. My initial phone screen with the recruiter went amazing and she liked me! But this was just a weird interview.

I know I’m still pretty young, but it’s so easy to feel like I am a failure because I thought I was sure of what I wanted in a career. Any ideas for what sounds like a good fit would be gladly welcomed. Just needing some direction at this point."

What would y’all recommend?

I heard that the in person experience is very valuable, especially as an intern, but if it’s only 2 days a week, is it still worth spending money on an apartment and travel expenses?

If I’m home I get to be with my friends here, my family, visit my girlfriend, and save a bunch of money, but if going in person 2 days/week is more beneficial, i will happily take it. 

Thanks for the advice!"

th7h2n,4,2022-03-18,Should I take the Promotion?,Aggressive-Cicada85,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/th7h2n/should_i_take_the_promotion/,"I am currently a Jr Sys Admin for a school district. I was hired almost exactly a year ago straight out of a back end software development boot camp. I won't go into why I decided to go into System Administration over Software Development but over all I am liking the job. Users can be infuriating but, all customers are in some ways, right? 

This is really a two person shop with some student interns. About 5 months after I joined up, the IT director left. One of the main reasons I took the position was to work with them. We hired an IT manager in their place.  The new manager hasn't really lived up to expectations and I was approached by C-Level and told they were more than likely going to let the new IT manager go and they wanted me to take the place as IT manager. 

**I am looking for advice and input.** I don't feel prepared to be an IT manager. I have been working professionally with technology for less than two years. I also feel like I would be an idiot to turn it down. 

Pros for accepting.  

Not only is it a large pay increase but I feel like it could open doors for my future (although I flip flop on this). 

I like the C-Level team and think I have some great ideas for the future of the district. I would be able to hire those under me and expand the department with full freedom.   


Cons. 

I was a manager in my previous carrier and just don't enjoy managing people. It's not a skill issue, more that I would rather manage a machine than a person. I worry I will sandbag myself into management for the future. 

I have no idea what I am doing when it comes to on-prem networking, PBX phone systems and analog intercoms. I have been able to troubleshoot all of the issues that have come up but without confidence.  I am able to get use some of my budget for a managed service if necessary. 

I like being a System Admin and don't feel like I am done. I like to just work with technology and code and not worry about the larger picture when it comes to 5 year plans, inventory, finance, budgeting, projections, etc. 

  
Thanks!"

computer and network security: This course will cover how computers are compromised, what one needs to do to build security into every program, how cryptography assists in securing data, how operating systems affect computer security, how networks are secured, and the social and ethical aspects of computer security.

vs.

NLP with deep learning: Deep learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) applications have come together in the last decade to provide solutions for real-world problems involving human communication. Translating from one language to another, extracting information from legal/medical/financial/etc. records, and replying to customer inquiries, are all NLP tasks for which cutting-edge solutions often depend on deep learning. In this course students study deep learning and NLP methods, first individually and then together, to develop applications that are currently in use today.

both appeal to me a lot, so i'm looking for opinions on what might be the best choice career wise.

For background info I have an internship this summer working on cryptography and security so I'm worried that the network security course will effectively be a semester of me saying 'wow i wish i knew this 3 months ago' but already having figured it out over the summer."

Hi guys, first post here, somewhat recent web dev boot camp graduate. Applied for a .net position at company. Interviews went well, got rejected but with positive feedback and them saying direct skill gap was only reason. I thanked them but offered myself as intern to possibly work/shadow for free until I’m ready to take on job. They were impressed and said that they could take me on as a tier 1 tech support and said it’s often that people in the company grow out of that position quickly. My only problems Is I don’t want to get stuck as a tech support for years and years. As the experience probably wouldn’t event count towards future coding jobs. I like the company and it is remote after the introductory period and offers benefits(albeit somewhat low pay for the tech support role). Would I be stupid to take this and try to work my ass off to get into the developer position?"
thg14v,1,2022-03-18,Incoming international student to the US for a MSCS,CamiloChafloque,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/thg14v/incoming_international_student_to_the_us_for_a/,"Hi all!

Im an incoming international student for an MS in CS in a top 10 unversity starting this fall.

My question is at what time is it good to start applying for summer 2023 internships or recent grad FT jobs? Also, ive heard people saying in a lot of subreddits that they apply to 100+ companies for internships or recent grad full time jobs so here comes my second question. How is this process works? Are there websites or resources with lists of all kinds of companies (FAANG, medium companies, safety companies) that can facilitate the application process or do I literally  have to go one by one and search for SWE/related and apply to the positions? Sorry if it's a dumb question, but in my country it is not very common to apply to 100+ companies at the same time.

Lastly, I've also heard that the fact of being an international student puts you at a disadvantage when applying for jobs (I don't know if it is the same for internships because I've only heard it for recent grads FT jobs) because of the whole issue of sponsorships or i don't know if its because other factors as well. 

How high are my chances of getting a good job as an international here in the US right after my master's degree? (By good job I mean 70-80K or higher). Are there any international students that went through with what im about to go through and succeeded that would like to tell me their experience?

Thank you all."
thhewc,110,2022-03-18,Why prestigious schools are overrated,trigon_dark,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/thhewc/why_prestigious_schools_are_overrated/,"I posted this as a comment but thought it might get more visibility as a post. I'm posting this because it's my 6 year anniversary of getting rejected from all my top and target schools.

The main point of this post is to say that the key factors in getting a good job / into a good grad program out of college probably aren't what you think they are, and sometimes going to a less competitive school is not only as good as going to one more prestigious, but actually gives you better access to resources that will affect your job hunt.

When I graduated high school I got rejected from every UC I applied to and only got into one school with a 60% acceptance rate. I was very depressed but committed myself to getting the best grades possible and applying to internships every year. I didn't get amazing grades but I did find a research opportunity by year 2. And got an internship for my first summer. The last two years of college I ended with about a 3.6. Year 3 I got another internship and continued being a research assistant . My last year as I was about to graduate I was terrified of not getting a job, so I started studying for the GRE and applied to masters. I ended up getting contacted by a peer of the person I helped with research who offered me a job at my absolute dream company (Microsoft, the intership experience also really helped me get this job). Then, with a recommendation from that same professor I helped I got into my top choice for grad school (#2 program in the country for my field). I 100% believe that I wouldn't have had this success if I had gone to one of my top schools. 

At UC Berkeley it would've been WAY harder and more competitive to get a research opportunity, one friend told me you basically had to be at the top 10% of your class to be considered for research. I'm a decent student but definitely not even in the top 50% of Berkeley students academically. Additionally, with a less intense workload at this college compared to my top schools, I had plenty of time to apply to internships and go to office hours to get to know my professors. These two factors (research + internships) is what lead to this success and it wouldn't have been possible at a harder school.

The point is: if the goal of college is to get a good job, your last two years of college are WAY more important than the previous 6 years. Also, people don't get scouted for going to good schools or getting good grades, they get scouted for having the right connections and internship experience. So if you're feeling bummed about college decisions remember:

1. the value of a good school is the connections you'll make. If you're proactive about making connections then you'll get a lot more value out of your education. Plus if you only get into a school that you think you're over qualified for, that just means you'll have better access to research opportunities/ the attention of professors
2. employers weigh internships much more highly than grades or which school you went to. Being a good student doesn't directly map to being a good employee, but being a good intern does.
3. if you're worried about ""prestige"" then take the words of my old mentor to heart: ""People used to know me as the guy who went to the university of Hawaii. Now they just know me as the guy who works at Google.""

And if you're worried that it'll mark you for the rest of your life going to a less competitive school remember: only assholes brag about where they went to college :)"

GRE: 309/340 -&gt; 159 Q, 150 V and 4.0 AWA

Internships: 3 Industrial in domains of Data Analytics and NLP, 2 Training-based in Linux and Data Science

Research Experience: Had published a pre-print, recently did a lot of improvements to it working with a prof., and am working on it as a final year project of bachelor's. Yet to publish any papers, might end up spinning 2-3 papers if published though, in the domain of Artificial Intelligence.

Extracurricular Activities: Did a lot of it! Been club member for 2 clubs, taught 40 students Python, arranged 5 competitive coding events.

Achievements: Won a coding competition got $50, stood runner up in another competition got $50 and an AI hackathon runner up fetched me $100. (I'm Indian so, the amount's a lot for us) Also, have participated in a few hackathons in Robotics and Software Development.

I am aware I need a better bedside manner. 

I recently got promoted in the company I’ve been in for almost 2 years. I’ve done the role before within the same company for 6 months but in a different department. That was easier though because staff were trained very well and there wasn’t any issues apart from one with a new staff member and there was more than one person in a supervisor
 role. 

I’ve only officially been in a few days but I’m having challenging behaviour from some staff. Mostly very very mild insubordination but it’s disrupting service and are trying to do what I’ve been promoted to. The issue is I’m a bit more experienced in what we do than some and the advice given needs to be followed for a number of reasons, if not their could be legal implications, company embarrass etc something I’ve helped resolve and rebuild when happened in the past at this company. 

Anyway, I got promoted, came back and meetings I implemented months ago in a enter role but the most senior in the team at that level. They were fine. Someone new who was an intern before came back and said they shouldn’t be changed up. I disagreed with this because our team needs structure and a good lead. My boss who can say yes to everything said that she were happy the way they were which was for someone senior to lead them.

I come back and well they’re changed with about no structural and it’s a nightmare. I also come back and this intern is trying to do a leadership role and it’s just impractical because their advice would have our board members spit their coffee out because of the implications it has. 

I find myself doing my old role and cleaning up what my untrained new staff can’t do or refuse to focus on or take advice on. 

I am aware the way I speak can be bad and wrong. I’m very direct and I need to find a softer approach. I’m trying but that’s very difficult for me. 

Can anyone give me a bit of advice on how they’ve dealt moving up into a leadership role from enter or someone who is stepping out of their duties and getting them to step back in and focus ? 

Thank you

My current thoughts for each are,

HFT -&gt; pays more initially (not sure about long term?), though is a smaller field + has non-competes so is harder to change companies and so on. Generally lesser WLB and higher turnover rate. Though the work itself seems challenging/interesting.

Tech -&gt; pays less initially (again not sure long term), larger field with more opportunities to change companies. More chill WLB, though potentially less interesting work (mostly basic CRUD-app stuff).

To what extent is it possible to start at hft and then transition to tech, and would you be significantly disadvantaged from doing so?

Given the choice between hft and tech firms in Aus, which would you pick and why?

Should I stay in this organization?,saynotopudding,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/thlco3/how_do_you_deal_with_leaders_who_micromanage_you/,"**TLDR: I'm part of a sub-committee of a group that is helping to plan a year-end big-ish event. (not paid btw lol just uni things). The heads appear to be micromanaging, and I am considering leaving the organization. Am I overreacting? How do I deal with leaders like this, and should I stay?** 

Detailed version:  
**Background of me joining the organization:**   
I've been struggling with poor mental health for the past few years, and as a result my resume has been blank since 2020 (before covid). I haven't been able to do anything besides the bare minimum in school. No research, no jobs, no internship, and mediocre grades.

Things started getting better recently, and I'm on track to graduate some time this year (hopefully) (albeit with a very tattered transcript). So this term I decided to try to ""put myself out there"" by participating in the planning of a big-ish event. Unfortunately, I blew my interview (symptoms of adhd were particularly bad during the interview), and I got offered a lower position instead. 

I was initially unwilling to accept the offer because I only applied for one position, and there was no discussion of this alternative arrangement during the interview. I haven't been doing ""grunt work"" like this for many years (sorry for the lack of a better descriptor, english isn't my first language), so to be very honest, this isn't necessarily the best fit for me. While I do have the experience of planning an event like this &amp; it's not something new for me, I know that I'm much more suited at doing ""big picture"" stuff/ and coordinating stuff etc. because of my past experiences and positions.

There were also other initial red flags wrt this group (like them changing my interview time the day of, sending out interview invites really last-minutely, as well as sending me an acceptance email with the wrong position etc.). (just some things that didn't seem too professional for me) 

But I ended up saying yes anyway, mainly because of my empty resume and I guess I just wanted to get back to doing things. : ( Joining this could allow me to build connections with other people from other schools, which could... be beneficial? I guess. 

I genuinely tried my best to be optimistic. Unfortunately, things haven't been going great. 

We've had a few meetings so far, so we have not progressed significantly yet. The head of my subcommittee, A, comes across as an incompetent leader, and imo has been allocating tasks to us members for performative reasons (tasks that are done for the sake of doing them). A seems to not know what the event should actually be like, and I have tried to tell them that ""hey we ought to take into account x and x"", but I got shot down. 

I ended up still submitting research including stuff I thought was necessary (that A disagreed with), only to get criticized in front of other subcommittee members again during our meeting yesterday. A was very firm on their idea and spoke to me in an accusatory manner, which was unpleasant. One of the heads (of the entire event), B, joined the meeting later, and eventually corrected A wrt this issue (because I was right all along), so I got criticized for nothing lol. A essentially pretended like nothing happened and moved on, and repeatedly went back on their word during the meeting. (e.g. earlier on when A was talking to me they'd say something along the lines of ""did you consider x? x is a MUST, so what you found so far doesn't work.""; but later on when i clarified (with B present), they'd say something like ""oh, we just wanted to know if x is an option, it's not mandatory per se, it's just info that's good to have.""... (fwiw I *had* considered x, but because of my experience, I know that there were other better ways to do this, I took this into consideration) 

I was tasked to do a follow-up on this issue based on what B wanted. All I have to do is email an external party to enquire some stuff. (a straightforward task) 

**Regarding the micromanagement aspect:**  
One thing that felt iffy for me was that B attended our subcommittee meetings. Maybe they wanted to be more involved/ to get to know each member better, idk, but it's something I personally wouldn't opt to do as a leader in an organization of this size, because A is supposed to be the bridge between the subcommittee &amp; B, right? During the meeting, B was also very involved with the decision-making process, and even felt the need to tell me that the best way to do my allocated task would be to ""send an email"", which... I already know and was planning to do so...? So it did feel kinda bizarre. 

But yeah perhaps I'm just thinking too much? 

The last straw for me (on top of the meeting yesterday) was that A contacted me today afternoon and requested me to send a draft of this email to A, B and C (another head) to get approval before I send it out (to the external party). I was annoyed for 2 reasons:

a) I have not sent out the email yet, because I was thinking of doing a query in-person first to build rapport with this specific external party, then confirming any queries via email. (my own idea) Had I been more efficient/direct (haha), I would've already sent the email out this morning, so I wish they had told me earlier. (I mean this didn't actually impact me, but I just don't vibe with the way they did this, y'know?)

b) Imo this really felt like a classic example of micromanagement. All I was tasked to do was to contact an external party with specific questions to ask (that we've already discussed beforehand, I'm not randomly coming up with stuff), I'm not even making any decisions for the organization, so it's quite ridiculous to me. 

So... yeah. We're only starting out on this project but i'm already feeling very suffocated, so I'm considering leaving the position. (I already have emotional dysregulation to deal with, so this is not fun for sure!) It's not going to look well for me, and we might very likely cross paths again in the future (I might just attend this event myself as a participant LOL + we're all in similar fields), but this doesn't feel like it's worth my time and energy anymore. 

I weighed the pros and cons prior to accepting the position. I knew that I wasn't going to get further growth within the organization as it is student-run and I'm graduating soonish, so I won't be able to progress to higher leadership positions next year, and I'd at most help out with advising. But I really wanted to get back out there, so I said yes. I also had not anticipated this level of micromanagement as the organizing committee is decently sized (at least 50 people I think?).

I understand that when I get a job in the real world I'd very likely come across bosses like this, and I (obviously) can't always just quit when things like this happen, so I'd love to know what your thoughts are wrt my next steps. 

Thank you for reading! (sorry for the word vomit) I appreciate any input."

I am currently studying marketing specializing in fashion and soon I have to complete a mandatory internship, which is a part of my study programme. Now I have two offers, one of them is from a growing fashion brand, where I would be working in the buying department. And the other offer is from a small PR agency with a great portfolio.

The problem here is that I like them both and I want to do them both but I can only pick one. An internship in buying could potentially help me a lot in the long-term, but I rarely see any vacancies in buying in fashion. However the communication field is somewhat saturated but there are a lot of vacancies if you look around. That's why I don't know what to choose.

I know that some of you here have more experiences than me in both fields, so could you tell me which field has more potential in the long-term?

Thank you and I would really appreciated it if you guys could give me your two-cents."
thlqaj,6,2022-03-18,Online Internship/COOP Applications and Recruiters,TheThinkerMaker,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/thlqaj/online_internshipcoop_applications_and_recruiters/,"I fucking hate that when there is an info-session at my university for a company i'm interested in applying, its always at a time where I either have important class, project reunion and/or have an exam. It's literally fucked up because most company recruiters pick their interns at these info-sessions when they collect resumes and they only go to the job fair as protocol and they don't even listen or care what students do. They pick 80% of their interns before the job fair. They even say it and wear it like its a badge of honor. For the past 4 years its been the same, I can't go to most of the info-sessions, resume reviews or presentations about X company and when I go to their table at the job fair they either give shitty resume advice or tell me ""haha good luck next semester/year"" and misguide every student or shrug them off because they have the positions full and don't want to say that explicitly. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THE POINT OF YOU GOING TO THE JOB FAIR THEEEN???  


I know this because my whole engineering department mentions it in orientations for freshmen and also I am friends with people that have gone to company activities pre-Job Fair and walk out the first day with an internship or COOP. I'm obviously happy for them, but I'm pissed off at recruiters because when I send them my resume or I apply online, I don't even get a rejection email or a response. I'm pissed off because I have more experience than some of them and they don't even offer interviews.  


The other problem is online applications, I don't even know to how many positions I have applied since November last year. I started counting officially in January (thanks to Sankey Diagrams I saw on here) and my ""official"" count is at 31, but it's way more. I have at least made 31 unique cover letters and applied to a lot of other companies with faster applications. I have received only one rejection email, and it was 20 minutes after applying (I even felt good that they sent a rejection email). I haven't received an email telling me: ""Ohhh were are considering you"" nor ""Hey we rejected you after reviewing you"" nor ""Hey here's an interview even if we don't plan on giving you an offer"".   


It's seriously depressing how fucked up I feel. I literally want to cry, I have classmates telling me ""Damn with that resume how have you not been given an offer?"" and on the other hand, I haven't even been offered an interview once in the last year. The first email I receive of an interview appointment I will literally cry. I feel insufficient, I feel that I'm a failure as a engineer, student and person and it fucking hurts. The worst part is that I'm starting to go off into debt, actually need the money from internships because I have shitty parents and don't have a secure safety net.

I am not saying that people living in S.V find it easier to get internships but it is relatively easier. )

Hi! I'm searching for help because I'm at loss on what to do. A little back story about me, I have had depression for about 10 years now. My biggest issue I suffer with is crying at everything. My response is always to cry at anything stressful whether it's something big or small. I have tried everything under the sun to cope with it and the best thing I've found to do is to surround myself with positive and supportive people for my conditions. I am a very private person and I don't like to talk much about my depression/anxiety. I only talk to people I know who I'm safe to talk with. Along with my depression journey I decided to switch up jobs completely and do something I absolutely love to do, which is to work with dogs. I started working for a private business in the state of Georgia so I don't know much about private business rules and such. I started this job around October and started to do really well with myself. I would say the best I've done since I've been officially diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. I started out as a dog bather and showed promise so I was told by the owner that she wanted to give me the opportunity to become a grooming intern. I felt extremely good because I was doing something I absolutely loved but with good things comes the bad. As soon as I was told this I was instantly doubted by the salon manager because of my anxiety/depression. She told everyone in the salon that I wouldn't make it. I kinda shrugged it off because I know not to listen to people that can't be supportive of me. As time past drama became a issue and anyone that works in a grooming salon knows there's nothing but drama. There were a few times that I got emotional (never because of the dogs) but because almost everyone around me would be constantly putting down someone. This started to take a toll on my mental health. I felt extremely unsupported and around nothing but negativity. One day the owner of the business pulled me in her office to talk. She was explaining to me how learning to grooming was hard and I better ""toughen up"" or I wouldn't make it. And of course my response was to cry because I don't like being cornered and not being able to stand up for myself. Later than day I was stoped and asked if she could purchase me natural remedies for my depression to try to help me ""cure"" it. She proceeded to tell me a story about how she ""cured"" a family members depression. I was definitely caught off guard and thought it was extremely unprofessional. I barely even know this person nor does this person know me or the struggles I've been though. Especially to be asked that when I consider myself to be doing the best I have been in a long time just didn't sit right with me. More time past and my job review came around. The owner pulled me in the office and basically told me the same thing except added about how half of people don't make it to groom because their emotions get in the way. At the end of the review I was told that my goal needs to be to get my depression under control and my medication correct. Again I thought that was a very unprofessional thing to say especially when it comes to talking about medications. Time passed and what started out as a week away from me interning to almost 2 months now and learning only learning two things about grooming. Rumors had started floating around about the owner talking to other co workers about my depression and how they were concerned about me.

At this job I have met a person I would consider to be one of my bestfriends for life. I would definitely say she has helped me learn more about at standing up for myself. For the last few days I have felt down because of petty drama happening at work and people being hateful towards me for no reason so I have kept my head down and followed my rule, go to work, head down, finish work, and go home. I am the type of person that believes work is work. Work isn't my life. My life it out of work so I do not consider co workers ""family"" like some do, they are just strangers I work with. Today I finally got the courage to ask the owner about my grooming internship because of the rumors I've been hearing. Before I could get anything out of my mouth I was asked what was wrong with me. My response was nothing I just needed to ask some questions and was told by the owner I need to cut the bullshit and tell her what's wrong because she knows something is wrong with me. I explained that I had some concerns by the end of convo I was crying because it's a stressful situation for me. After the conversation I went into a more private room so I could calm myself down and my friend followed right behind me to help me get through a hard situation. She is the only person I do feel comfortable with at work. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the owner telling me to come talk to her again and telling my friend to leave. I was sat down and asked what's wrong which ended in me not being about to get a word out because I was being compared to the now salon manager. A few other points I was told was 1. I needed to fix my medication and get help 2. I was too sensitive. 3. I needed to look in the mirror. 4. I wasn't the same person since I started (no longer had a big happy smile everyday) 5.there was concerns that I was going to break learning how to groom. During this she kept mentioning that she has been talking about my conditions to the salon manager and a coworker that isn't a manger but more like a owners pet. I was basically gaslighted the whole conversation. My biggest thing is that I don't bring my personal life into work. I go to work, I work, and I leave. Nobody knows my struggles and I don't care to share and I have made this very clear a few times to my owner but somehow it always comes back up. My concern now is everything I told her today because I was basically forced is going to be spread throughout the salon. Nothing is confidential here and it sucks because I don't want my information out there. The owner thinks she helped me with this conversation but really she just made me feel worse about myself. I do consider myself a very functional person with depression. I force myself to get up and work to keep myself distracted. I thought this job was my safe place where I could go do something I love but now I feel horrible about everything. I Have doubts and it's wanting to make me quit my goals and dreams of being a groomer. This is something I've set my soul in and to basically be told I'm broken today really hurt and made me go on a downward spiral. It really was the cracking point. I would try to find another job but where I live it's very hard to find someone to train in grooming. I believe the owner and the salon manager is definitely overstepping their boundaries but it's not like I can go to a HR person because they are hr. I'm just at a loss on what to do. Any words of advice?"

I explained that I had some concerns by the end of convo I was crying because it's a stressful situation for me. After the conversation I went into a more private room so I could calm myself down and my friend followed right behind me to help me get through a hard situation. She is the only person I do feel comfortable with at work. A few minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the owner telling me to come talk to her again and telling my friend to leave. I was sat down and asked what's wrong which ended in me not being about to get a word out because I was being compared to the now salon manager. A few other points I was told was 1. I needed to fix my medication and get help 2. I was too sensitive. 3. I needed to look in the mirror. 4. I wasn't the same person since I started (no longer had a big happy smile everyday) 5.there was concerns that I was going to break learning how to groom. During this she kept mentioning that she has been talking about my conditions to the salon manager and a coworker that isn't a manger but more like a owners pet. I was basically gaslighted the whole conversation. My biggest thing is that I don't bring my personal life into work. I go to work, I work, and I leave. Nobody knows my struggles and I don't care to share and I have made this very clear a few times to my owner but somehow it always comes back up. My concern now is everything I told her today because I was basically forced is going to be spread throughout the salon. Nothing is confidential here and it sucks because I don't want my information out there. The owner thinks she helped me with this conversation but really she just made me feel worse about myself. I do consider myself a very functional person with depression. I force myself to get up and work to keep myself distracted. I thought this job was my safe place where I could go do something I love but now I feel horrible about everything. I Have doubts and it's wanting to make me quit my goals and dreams of being a groomer. This is something I've set my soul in and to basically be told I'm broken today really hurt and made me go on a downward spiral. It really was the cracking point. I would try to find another job but where I live it's very hard to find someone to train in grooming. I believe the owner and the salon manager is definitely overstepping their boundaries but it's not like I can go to a HR person because they are hr. I'm just at a loss on what to do. Any words of advice?"

thp7lr,28,2022-03-19,A quick word about today,shiaaron151,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/thp7lr/a_quick_word_about_today/,"I'm sure that many of you are disappointed about your results today. I know I am. Waitlisted to UCSD, rejected from both UCI and UCLA, and just yesterday I got rejected from Notre Dame. It hurts. It really does. I don't think it bears repeating that life is full of rejections, and the only reason why these ones hurt so much is that they are the first ones. In the past, you may have lost the privilege of using your phone for a weekend. Maybe one time you asked the teacher to use the bathroom and they said ""no."" As life moved on, we started getting rejected from programs, internships, and more, but we all thought to ourselves ""It's okay, there will always be another chance."" However, this is the first time we are receiving feedback on something that we feel is so important to our futures, and something we all feel like we can't try again with. And unlike those lost internships and programs, you feel a lot of pressure in seeing all of your friends and the children of your parents' friends getting into name-brand schools. You hear your parents talk about the neighbor next door who got into Berkeley. And for Asian-American households, and perhaps many others also, the age-old adage ""Why can't you be more like..."" rings louder today than it ever did before.

&amp;#x200B;

**I realize I am in no position on any of this, but I just wanted to air out some feelings.** 

  
It's important to realize that beyond obtaining that first job or internship, as long as you work hard and make the most of every opportunity, you are going to be fine wherever you go. Trust me. The fact that all of you are sitting here worrying about this right now implies that you all are, to some extent, **worried about your own future**. This automatically makes you more inclined to work for what you want, and I'm sure everyone here understands the importance of doing so.  
**This is not the end.** After receiving today's result, I felt devastated because I thought that it was over. First, there are no ""low-tier"" schools, only ""low-tier"" students. You can have someone go to Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, and still be a complete and total failure because they failed to make the most of themselves while they were there. It's important for you to take what you have and turn it into something that you can be truly proud of.  
Finally, **rankings are rigged.** The top schools in the country will always stay top for the most part, because the people ranking these colleges are newspapers who need to sell issues, and they can't do that if the college rankings aren't ""trustworthy"" a.k.a don't conform to what society already expects. As I already mentioned, it's more important for you to take advantage of opportunities, as many are not even concerned much about college after that stage of their life is already over. So don't spend so much time comparing yourself to other people, obsessing over the ranking of the school to which you were admitted, and wondering ""If I had just gotten this higher GPA would I be able to get into a T20."" Because in the end, it doesn't matter. The ranking of your school is definitely not conducive to the quality of education that you will receive. As long as you go to a decent school, that burden will always rest upon you.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope this consoles some people after the stress of today, and the stress of the past few weeks."
thpp6f,32,2022-03-19,Embedded Software Developer Intern Interview Prep,T10-,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/thpp6f/embedded_software_developer_intern_interview_prep/,"Hey guys,

I’m a student and I have an embedded software developer internship interview at a large company that does great work with the manager and a senior SWE together scheduled for next week. I’ve never taken any low level coursework (no comp organization/architecture, no OS…, i’ve only taken OOP and DSA both in C++) so I’ll be going in extremely unprepared. 

I know C++, but that’s pretty much it. I have a few free full days to cram and was wondering **what you think they’ll ask me + any suggestions on what topics to cram?**

I just started prep an hour ago and I’m currently looking over topics in C like volatile and void pointers and their usages.

Edit: Thank you guys for all the comments!  I really appreciate the help

Edit 2: Got the offer thank you guys!!"
thqfqt,1,2022-03-19,Career advice regarding ML jobs,Towhidul_Tonmoy,learnmachinelearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/thqfqt/career_advice_regarding_ml_jobs/,"I have done my undergraduate in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I wanted to build my career in ML.
I have experience working with ML for last one year. I have some projects and participated in different Kaggle competitions.
But I don’t feel confident about my learnings. 
When I went to check different ML jobs in foreign countries, they ask for Msc or PhDs.

My plan is to directly apply for jobs in foreign countries or at least go for Master’s in a foreign country, and then apply for jobs. But I don’t have any research papers yet. I have a CGPA of 3.7(out of 4.0). I have huge experience in  extra co-curricular activities. 

Now I am seeking advice for,

1) How should I prepare myself for applying in job interviews?  Can anyone provide me guidelines for that?
Should I follow any books or resources? I have basic python experience. I know all the terms. Do I need to do problem solving in Leetcode or something?  I don’t have experience working with data structure and algorithms?

2)Is preparing for Masters in ML field a good option? Which country or which universities should I target? Should I prepare for direct jobs or start preparation for Msc?

3)There are different job options like, Data engineer, data analyst, data scientist, ML engineer. 
I have experience working with ML algorithm and also have a internship experience as an powerbi developer. 
So, for me which field is more suitable?  Or, in which field,  there are high chances for me to get a job between this position? 

Thanks in advance"

First off, I want to say that my goal is to do well in school, possibly secure an internship the summer of my freshman year, and have a job at a faang, or similar company by the time I'm done with my studies. I'll be studying CS at a pretty good university (UT Austin), but the only downside is that they teach in Java. I have pretty novice knowledge about python (up to OOP, but that seems to vary between languages) but I'm not sure if this minimal knowledge will transfer. Although I'm in AP Computer Science, I don't know the first thing about Java. Should I try to self teach so I can get a head start? I've also considered not studying at all so I won't get any bad habits and get good foundations from my professors. Is this a good idea? Is it sustainable for my goals? thanks"
thr5hn,1,2022-03-19,I am a soon-to-be-graduated CS undergrad without internship experience looking for Masters in CS in the USA,satyayeeet,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/thr5hn/i_am_a_soontobegraduated_cs_undergrad_without/,"I am in the final 2-3 months of my undergrad course. I don't have any research or internship experience. However, I have received a full time job placement with a good pay, that I am planning to take up for a year before going to the USA for my Masters in Computer Science.

Will the lack of internships and research experience affect my chances of getting into good universities (CMU, Georgia Tech, Purdue, UIUC, Cornell, etc.)? Or is a one year job experience good enough? Also, if internship/research experience is required, how do I get one now?

I feel like I have wasted my time and I have 2-3 months to go before I complete my Bachelor's degree and after that I have my job so I think it is tough to find a good internship that would look good on my resume. (Projects: I have one ongoing final year project and have done one before too, but other than these two, I haven't done a lot)"

thskt1,5,2022-03-19,I am about to graduate and i need some advices. I am indecisive.,Adorable-Account-148,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/thskt1/i_am_about_to_graduate_and_i_need_some_advices_i/,"Hello. I am 22 years old and i am currently a graduate student in computer engineering. I really liked. But there are a lot of specializations in the field. 

I'm currently doing an internship as a Java Backend developer and something feels off... It feels like I'm just glueing some libraries with some design principles to display data from the database to an interface. I feel i can do more than that.

I've always been curious about how things work. Why it works exactly this way and not another. I also did an internship in system administration and networking. Just because I was curious. 

In my free time I learn things from cybersecurity (exactly pentesting) and artificial intelligence (deep learning and reinforcement learning). They caught my attention during college. I've been doing this for about a year and I still don't know what specialization to choose. 

I would like an area where you need to know more than just use some libraries to retrieve data from the database. I want to be an expert in what i am doing. Not now or tomorrow, but in years to come. But for that i need to choose a specialization. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm going in a circle with my indecision. Any thoughts?"

Thank you for your time responding to me. I don't have simple words to explain this so bear with my long winded explanation.

I'm a freshman in college getting my pre-reqs out of the way. Currently, I have no certifications. I do have plenty of experience in IT. Fixing phones, building computers, fixing computers, all which came with a lot of troubleshooting.

 I have now worked in this internship I got from my dad. This company has a few locations. The IT staff team is off-site and i work at the office 20 minutes south from it. 

May I also say that we have a separate company that sets up the secure servers, and the IT team manages them. Over the past 7 months of being hired under the director of the location as an intern (not IT but basically IT) I have taken care of any on-site IT problems, any new-hire setups, I've been a help in a huge amount of headaches and had higher ups go to me asking if they can do this and that or how they could do this or that. 

I wouldn't say this out loud, but everyone there knows me and a lot of them really like me and I get a lot of praise, which is definitely because of my great people skills, patience, and grip on technology.

IT is planning on getting someone to be stationed in the building, because this company has grown over 150 people since I got here (I set them all up) and they have recently got a deal with a major company which will last them til far after I die. Point is, its a company getting big and still getting bigger.

Everyone knows me, including IT. I'll often call up and be the mediator for what's really going on in a problem an employee is happening. They like me. And the director over there has recently asked me what hours I work (I work 30 hours a week in a college semester) and there is talk of training me and hiring me on as an employee stationed in the building.

I'm scratching my head at the opportunity. On one end, hell yes I'm a freshman in college catching a rare opportunity to be apart of a (pretty fail safe) growing company. 

Then on the other end, I don't know. I just don't know a lot about business, or if this is a bad idea. Can anyone give me some advice here?"

I just received a verbal offer yesterday from Verint for a SWE internship role this summer and I am most likely going to accept it once I receive the written offer. I am wondering if anyone else has ever done an internship for Verint before and how it stands in terms of reputation as a software company? I am just a bit curious and thanks for any information in advance."
thywx5,3,2022-03-19,Deloitte or PWC Tax Intern advice?,FetusTheBest,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/thywx5/deloitte_or_pwc_tax_intern_advice/,"I applied for Summer ‘23 tax internships and have gotten offers from Deloitte and PWC so far (and awaiting KPMG’s decision). I came into the interviews with Deloitte in mind as my goal, and Deloitte ended up offering a slightly higher salary ($1.56 per hour more to be exact) + most of the people in my school end up going to Deloitte so I feel like it’d be easier to get to know people in Deloitte since I already know some going there. But I feel like my PWC interview went really well and I clicked with the Partner I interviewed with more so than Deloitte’s (he also offered me the position just an hour after the interview and told me he wanted me on his own team). Just wanted some advice on how to decide (especially since this is my first time applying for internships) before making my final decision"

thyzkk,1,2022-03-19,Two Career Paths,SnooPears4486,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/thyzkk/two_career_paths/,"Hello everyone! I am a 26(F) and I’ve recently had the opportunity to get an apprenticeship as a tattoo artist or pursue a job offer that pays very well. 

I have been the creative person since I could remember. I’ve dreamt of tattooing professionally and finally had the chance to plead my case a few weeks ago. I didn’t think I’d make it until I had the call the day I got a job offer. The thing about the apprenticeship is that the schedule changes by month and I was told that they do work it like a full time job, so 40hr a week. The apprenticeship is also unpaid and the time line would be a year until I am a licensed artist.

The job offer pays the most Ive made in my entire career and it’s a possibility that I can make more after the probation period. It’s a Monday thru Friday deal and pretty basic corporate job. I feel like I can do this job but it’s not something I’m head over heels about. It’s just the pay that is making me second guess pursuing the internship.

I am married and I did have a conversation with my husband about this. He is 100% supportive and would help in anything I decide to do and so is my family. I’m just having trouble deciding because I don’t want to put so much on my husband and family financially if I do take the apprenticeship. I’m looking to get some feedback from an unbiased perspective. 

Thanks guys!"

**Hooks:** Semi-Immigrant mother (born in PR but since it’s part of the US commonwealth idk), divorced parents, death of a parent, mentally ill siblings + family members (idk ig these could be potential essay topics lol), LGBT, good writer, good designer

**Intended Major:** English (English Secondary Education) —I want to be a HS English teacher

**ACT (didn’t take SAT):** (*Edit*) 18 😭😭

**School:** Early College High School. I’ve been taking college classes since 1st semester of freshman year.

**GPA:** 3.77 W (school doesn’t do UW)

**Coursework:** All HS honors classes from 9th to 11th. My school doesn’t offer AP or IB classes. I’ve had all A + AB Honor roll so far in my Junior year (haven’t gotten a C or lower 🤞🏽)

**Awards:** Participation award for Scholastic Art and Writing 2022 for two essays and a flash fiction piece

**EC:** 

-Crosby Scholars (college prep/community service program, have to check how many hours in total)

-Community service hours by religious activities, sent out thank you cards to many people during quarantine, door to door, phone calls, letter writing, ect (strongest EC)

-I really want to intern at my local elementary school for senior year next year but I’m not sure if it’s possible for me

*-Also noting that my HS school is small and since it’s an Early College HS we don’t have many opportunities for EC’s like traditional HS’s*

**Essays/LOR:** I’m still not sure what imma write about but I’m confident in my technical writing skills. As for LOR, I’m definitely going to ask my English IV honors teacher and my Civics/Economics teacher (maybe my Chem teacher)

**Schools I want to apply to next year:** 

-In-state: UNCW (my most aimed for), UNCC, Appalachian State, UNCG, Queens University, Meredith College, not sure where else yet

-Out-of-state: NJCU, CCNY and Hunter (both CUNY), and I might apply to NYU just for fun (even tho I would love to go lol) 😭😭, and the rest I’m not sure but I do sometimes dream of leaving town.

I also understand that NC is one of the lowest paid states for teachers so I’m probably going to move away from NC in the future 😃"

My big thing is I want to know why that is. I'm trying to land an internship next year and the outlook is basically I will have to teach STEM to do so. That said I am hesitant to do so before I have this conversation. 

Are kids just typically resistant to math or is there some other reason that makes STEM teachers hard to find? My base line assumption is that they are probably just working higher paid jobs and that's why they don't go into it but it's really hard to know.

Anyone have any insights on this?"

Will I have to register for a course related to my work (an elective like 213) or some other course for the summer session? Or is the process completely diff and I'm misunderstanding something?

For reference, the CPT page on RGlobal says this under eligibility- ""Approved to register for corresponding course/credit for the practical training for the semester/summer during which the student is engaged in practical training""

This summer I'll (hopefully) finish my (4 year long) undergrad CS programme, in an EU country. During these years I've accumulated a lot of meaningful knowledge and tried every single technology that seemed new to me and haven't worked with before (I know, it's better the be a good at one thing rather than mediocre at 15 other things, but I feel like college years should be for experimenting things).

I also managed to get an internship during the summer at a quite big company that has it's HQs in US, working as a, mainly, backend developer (PHP stack but also some basic HTML/CSS here and there), and got a full time offer after it, making roughly 18k - 20k euros / year before tax, which is above the market's average for a junior position in my country . (Currently, I have 3 months of internship experience + around another 6 months of full time and by the time I will start my masters, YOE would be \~ 1 year).

For masters, I'm thinking about joining VU's Computer Science Msc. programme (Internet and Web Technology Track). I was wondering if it is possible to actually work during masters in Netherlands, since I would need to work in order to afford to stay there:

 1. Is there a maxium of hours you are allowed to legally work if you are pursuing any kind of education ?

2. Are companies actually interested in hiring students that are actively pursuing masters ?

3. How hard is the curriculum of a CS master in Netherlands ? Does one have the time needed to both complete the Master and actually work ?(part time, at least ?)

&amp;#x200B;

Also, would I be eligible for that 30% rule I've seen people talk about when it comes to Netherlands ? I could also keep my actual job for a few months (since it's fully remote) before I find something satisfying in Amsterdam(would be prefferable, since there is the university as well) or Netherlands. What could my salary expectations be as a new grad (Bsc.), that doesn't speak Dutch, with one year of relevant experience and a few side projects, and also pursuing a Msc. in CS ?"

I stupidly focused only on my classes the past 4 years and didn't join any clubs or organizations. Didn't manage to land an internship anywhere, either. I'm underprepared for graduation. The resume I created for myself is very blank and not very impressive. The only thing I can put on there is that I've made the Dean's List consecutively for the last couple years and my GPA is a 3.5. I need to start sending out my resume in order to secure a job after graduation but I'm afraid it'll be very difficult to find a job when I have no experience. 

Any advice? Advice from people in the IT field would be especially useful."

AMA",javaHoosier,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ti142j/bartender_back_to_school_in_late_20s_to_faang_in/,"Always fascinated by programming, but wasn't great at math. I mentally convinced myself it wasn't for me. Self teaching wasn't working for me either, but couldn't shake the desire to keep trying. I eventually decided to go back to school in my late 20s and just go for it. First 2 years I heavily questioned whether if computer science was for me or not. My junior and senior year I started to find my groove.

I had one internship and then I took a terrible low ball offer after graduation in Silicon Valley, there for 2 years. Used that as a stepping stone. This week I just signed my faang offer.

As for leetcode. After some practice I got decent at the questions. I'm no where near great at it and never practiced hards. I definitely didn't live the narrative where you eat/sleep/leetcode. I just did two questions or so a day for about 2 months. Baked into my daily routine.

That being said it was a lot of work overall, but my goal with this post is to provide an anecdote that you don't need to go to a top 10, start at faang, or grind your life away to achieve this.

Okay now that that's out of the way. I am a JR CS student at some branch campus school in the middle of PA. I applied for 90-120+ internships in the fall and I have received 3 offers rejected one, accepted one BUT I got a new one this week and its put me in a hard place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Company A:  
35 / Hour, 3000 Sign on, Owing Mills, MD (Asset Manger)  - Relocation required (no assistance) - Already Accepted in November

I would be on a small team named Enterprise Architecture and my boss told me they do API Dev, Web Dev, Dev Ops scripting, and Mobile Dev

&amp;#x200B;

Company B:

36.10 / Hour, 4000 Sign on, Philadelphia, PA (Software Company) - No Relocation - Got last week

C#, IOT stuff with raspberry pi  


For me this is difficult to just tell Company A I have to leave to get more money because I have already been onboarded and talked to my boss and a bunch of people in HR and I feel a connection with them if that makes sense? Company B just came out of no where and I had an interview and then I had an offer. Company A is also more known then Company B so its harder to just leave for that aspect as well. If you guys could help me out I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks!"

ti9znr,5,2022-03-19,[Rant] IA/Internship is pure torture,deadButalive23,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ti9znr/rant_iainternship_is_pure_torture/,"Basically your supervisor is the one who makes you pass with flying unicorns and rainbows or the one who question yourself on how is this the right job for me or something. 

Really don’t get how the percentage for IA is that big. My supervisor was not the supervisor who would teach and help and actually explain what to do, that person expected me to be like a “full timer” who knows the stuff?? Mind you I’m an archi intern but I ended up with some engineering supervisor. Basically the most absent supervisor out there always on site and going for coffe breaks or wtv that person is doing -.-. 

I have asked questions cause you know I’m an intern I hardly know the what I’m suppose to do cause I’m new in this work line that person did not explain clearly and gave a very vague description most of the time so I have to ask more than once to understand what that person is saying and y’all know what that person said “go look at the architecture drawing” here’s the best part when I asked question personally as that person does not reply to my messages that person told me “okay I will explain to you later” that later did not come and I just ask someone other full timer how to do the task. 

Tahan that person for 6 months and honestly that person was why I dreaded to go to work and my walking anxiety. I have a few weeks left before I’m ending my internship and chioasz and never come back to that company due to the horrible experience as an intern I heard my grades and it’s a fail?? (apparently) When that person hardly mentored me and brushed me off most of the time. Start of the year I was passed to someone who has knowledge of my course and that’s when I have only started learning once I was under the architect’s wing. 

Should I raise this to my LO as I might have failed my IA due to that person who basically thinks I’m a walking hassle to their life or wtv and that person got promoted to a higher position 😭😭😭. Honestly if this is how this line of work is I’m re-thinking my life decisions

Edit: dang I sound so frustrated 😭 and thank your for answering!"

&amp;#x200B;

1. How is the workload/academic scene like at UofT? I have heard that it is pretty intense and stresses students out especially due to grade deflation and the POST system (espeically for CS). If you have found it challenging, how have you managed it?
2. Speaking of the CS POST system, I have heard that they revised the system recently so that now newly admitted high school students to the CS stream are now guaranteed admission into the program given that they get specific grades and take specific courses. How would this change things?
3. I have heard that a lot of students in Arts &amp; Sci do double majors (to the point where it is the norm?). If you have done a double major, how was it like?
4. How employable are UTSG CS grads? How are UTSG CS grads perceived in the tech industry in Canada/United States, and are there a lot of UTSG CS grads that end up working in reputable tech companies?
5. How would you compare UTSG CS to Waterloo CS/SE? Is the program at Waterloo necessarily better because of the co-op system? Or is it manageable to gain the same/similar experience at UTSG CS by actively seeking out internships on your own or through PEY (I have heard that A&amp;S have launched their own version of it too called ASIP)?
6. How is the social scene like at UTSG? Is it easy to make new friends?
7. What do you like and dislike about UofT, or UTSG CS specifically?

&amp;#x200B;

I would appreciate it if anyone can offer some insights!"
tib1o3,2,2022-03-19,How can I prepare myself for my first internship and job?,YourAverageRedneck,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tib1o3/how_can_i_prepare_myself_for_my_first_internship/,"Thanks to the many years of this fine subreddit's support,  I have recently accepted a ""System Administrator"" internship and I was wondering if I could get some advice on how I can prepare myself. I understand that the purpose of an internship is to learn, but I still worry about being pretty underprepared. I've never even been formally employed before. I'd like to at least learn a bit before I go in so that I can focus on gaining more advanced experience, however realistic that may be.

Here are some of the paraphrased/reworded job duties/qualifications:

* Knowledge of industry standard NOC tools
* Knowledge of various IT systems, troubleshooting, notification/escalation of events
* Support infrastructure design/implementation
* Provide operation and tech support to server environments

I'm in school for IT, but truthfully I've only really taken a few programming courses, a database course, and a very hands-off general IT course. I've done some stuff in my own free time such as taking an ethical hacking/linux course, tinkered with some packet tracer labs and gone through a good bit of network+ material, done some small stuff with AWS and Azure, as well as do a bit of programming/scripting in my own free time. 

Apparently a lot of their servers are in Windows Server which I've never worked with, so that slightly worries me, but they already know this. I would greatly appreciate any bits of advice you folks have to offer, be it technical or general."
tib5wc,2,2022-03-19,Web Dev Internships,Accomplished_Bug6296,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tib5wc/web_dev_internships/,"Hello everyone! I am a sophomore in high school. I’ve been learning full stack web development for the past year now. I know how to build the frontend and backend of a web app from scratch. To be completely honest, I am stronger with the frontend stuff only because I’ve spent more time with it. This summer I would like to get a web development internship. I feel like I’m experienced enough but would gain much more experience as an intern somewhere. Only problem is I don’t know where to start looking. Any tips?"
ticbl8,12,2022-03-19,Should I change my major?,Fun-Obligation5729,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/ticbl8/should_i_change_my_major/,"  

I’m a cs student whose halfway through my second year. I picked cs because I wanted to build apps and stuff and honestly it was the only major that I had any interest out of all the other ones. I’m not necessarily the best programmer but not the worst one either. Given some time I’ll eventually figure out the solution to any given problem. Sometimes I get stuck doing my hw problems but I’m okay with it as it is not supposed to be easy.

But recently I’ve been having second thoughts about the major. Tbh my biggest concern is the competition in this field . I applied for a lot of internships but didn’t get any in swe ones. I could see that for one position there were 200-300 people applying. I read very often how people struggle to get their first job after graduating. Which honestly scares me to death and makes me worried on how I’ll be able to survive in it. Also the fact that CS grads have to compete against Bootcamp grads and people from other countries trying to get a job in the US does not help either. Other than this, imposter syndrome has been playing a big part. People in my college seem to know so much being the same year as me, especially the international students. Like holy shit how do they know so much being pretty much the same age as me? It’s so impressive.

If it’s not for CS, I’m thinking about doing accounting. I like working with numbers. Even though it would not be as interesting as CS it’ll be ok. Unlike Cs, if I put in the effort I’ll be able to master the whole field and everything that’s in it. Starting salary may be nothing compared to CS but eventual progress is pretty good in accounting field.

I’m sorry if it has been a long post. I’m really struggling about making this decision and any kind of opinion would help."
tidmbu,9,2022-03-20,Should I keep going with my degree if I get a job offer?,throwaway98341235432,cscareerquestionsOCE,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsOCE/comments/tidmbu/should_i_keep_going_with_my_degree_if_i_get_a_job/,"Hey guys, I need some advice. So I have a bachelor of science with a major in mathematics and statistics. Now I’m doing a masters of IT (3 semesters left including this one). I’m currently applying for graduate software dev jobs and internships. (I have two projects on my resume which I think has helped a lot).

Say I get a job (I might have an interview lined up depending on how I did on a coding challenge), should I continue with my masters of IT or start working full time as a software developer? I honestly want to start working but I don’t know if it would be a mistake to quit my masters of IT. On one hand, I hear people saying experience is king in this industry but on the other hand, I hear people say the degree is more important.

I also feel like the masters of IT is a bit of a waste of time and money. Some of the subjects are meh (although others have been useful). I just feel like I would be better off learning on the job and gaining experience.

Obviously, this is all hypothetical because I don’t have a job lined up but I just want to be prepared. 

TLDR: Should I quit my degree if I get a job or decline job and finish my degree?"

tig06h,1,2022-03-20,"Lost my first proper job offer and idk how to feel about it, please read and let me know what you think and advise. What do you think I did wrong? Did I get greedy or was I actually late?",deebee1713,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tig06h/lost_my_first_proper_job_offer_and_idk_how_to/,"So I applied to a company, interview was great, they wanted me on board but pay was lesser than I expected. I said no initially because I really didn't expect to get the interview in the first place and I had other long term plans but the idea of earning money stuck so I went ahead with the interview.

Then they asked me would I change mind if I get better pay, so I said I want 1.5X of what they offered. 
They said they were willing to increase compensation by 1.2X and it'll be a good opportunity which I too believed as it was a rising start up.

I replied saying I accept and I just put in a request to increase ctc just enough to cover travel cost as it was too expensive just to commute to and fro. But I got a reply later saying I was too late to reply and the position was filled, which I assume is code for 'we're not gonna hire you, we found someone doing the same for lesser'.

Idk why I'm thinking so much about this, I didn't even intend to start working yet as I'm still yet to finish undergrad and I already have 2 internships out of which both will offer job but less pay. One of the internship is my country's highest reputed institute which is a golden ticket to almost any foreign university I would apply to. So I'm pretty sorted that way, all i gotta do is put more effort which is doable.


But since that company dropped me, even though I dropped them in the first place, I just have this ""I didn't make it"" feeling happening in my gut. I'm telling myself it doesn't matter but I really have to hear it from someone else.

Thanks for reading.
TIA."

But to get an interview I probably need previous experience, which I can only get during my freshman summer without taking gap years. I am already interviewing with two companies but I feel conflicted if I really would like to take an offer if I was given one. 

Is it really necessary? I am not sure if I want to waste all my summers at uni, but getting into big tech early is a great goal to get financially stable and be in a place that respects engineers.

I will probably have experience as a teaching assistant for courses like ADS and OOP and some hackathons by next summer, but I don't know if it's enough to get an interview with the good stuff. I study at one of the better universities in the Netherlands, but not a super international name.
Thanks for any opinions!"

I had an interview this week for an internship that I am very interested in. I also know that landing this internship would open many opportunities for me going forward.

I felt that the interview went pretty well, and I was able to connect with the interviewer on a personal level. However, I know that nothing is certain until it is over.

**Nevertheless, in this position I will be using a lot Excel on a daily basis. Particularly, data analysis related Excel skills using functions such as COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, PivotTable and reference functions (e.g. VLOOKUP), and these are functions that I am comfortable using. And I mentioned about this during the interview as well.**

**Now, I am going to be sending a thank-you letter, and I am thinking of going the extra mile, and attaching an Excel file with it showcasing me using these functions. Is this a good move?**

I'm a second semester freshman in college who's going to be applying for internships this upcoming fall. I'm probably going to mostly be applying to roles involving software development and/or product/project management, but also other roles within that sphere such as analytics or data science related roles! I mainly am targeting ed-tech (which is where I've worked for the last 4-ish years in various roles [see note]), but will be applying across the board. I may also apply for some roles regarding history such as museum internships or educational roles, but I'll probably write up a separate resume tailored towards that.

Note - I've worked for X for around 4 years (since the beginning of the sophomore year of HS), but in many roles kinda bouncing around, it wasn't until June 2020 that I started any sort of tech role, and so I chose to omit other roles. Would it be better to be stingier and keep 1 page or to include more but push onto 2+ pages?

EDIT - please ignore the formatting issue on the last project, that was just from anonymizing and changing words - it's formatted correctly on my real resume!

How is the life of a PhD student at Cornell Tech (NYC campus) compared to at Cornell Ithaca?

1. Do you feel a bit more deserted, as it is a smaller campus with fewer professors etc.?
2. How much do you usually save a month?
3. What is the taxation model? I think I heard that at NYC you get 38000 over 9 months. Which is $4222. How much of it would be left over after taxation? ( I do not know if the online tools for calculation are accurate or not )
4. What is the average stipend one gets in an internship during the PhD?
5. Do people generally have alternative sources of income? (Specifically, do international PhD students have such sources in the *middle* of a semester?)
6. If you get a grant, can your stipend be increased beyond the general amount?
   1. If not, why would I care if I get a grant or not? Do other universities allow such supplementation of funds via grants? I believe I read that CMU allows it.
7. How is 'The House' as a residence for students? Is it fairly priced?
8. Is there a discord channel for Cornell Tech PhD students?
9. How does the more industrial /start-up style orientation of Cornell Tech affect your temperament for research?

**Letters of Recommendation**

not totally sure about this one. i made the mistake of only using one teacher on my application, so i was bombarded with emails from colleges asking for an additional rec. i used my junior year english teacher and got to read her rec, it was decent but didn't sound super personal. the second rec i had was my employer from an internship i did over the summer and had a great relationship with. i didn't get to read her letter, but i feel like it was pretty good.

**Interviews**

had interviews for yale, dartmouth, princeton and northwestern. all of them were pretty meh, but the princeton and dartmouth went better than i expected. the dartmouth interviewer was also a senior and i'm pretty sure he went to the same high school as me. he asked me a question about what movie universe i would want to live in without regard to magical abilities and I said The Truman Show, and he was so thrilled at my answer and told me ""he never thought of anything like that before, and no one else had said anything like that either.""

**Essays**

so i applied via QuestBridge to all of the t20 schools they had available, and all of the state schools and such i applied through common app and coalition. so the essays for QuestBridge were a little different and i don't think they were as good as I hoped they would be. When it came time to write all of the supplemental essays, I think those were a little better. My main common app essay was about how i overcame the set of cards I had been dealt with my homelife, and still worked hard in school to support my sisters and try new things in life. i know its kinda cliche, but it's my life story sobeit.

tiv0pf,1,2022-03-20,Need advice from fellow college students - Currently stuck in a field I hate and I've accepted an internship that just really do not want to do.,Typhlosion34,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tiv0pf/need_advice_from_fellow_college_students/,"I've been gaining a lot of different perspectives from my family, friends and college professors and they all have been very insightful, but have not helped me make a decision or accept my predicament for what it is.

A little background first. I'm currently 3 years into my college education. I never wanted to go to college, but I was pressured into it by my family mainly because I received a scholarship out of high school. I didn't have any idea what I wanted to do, so I went for a business bachelor's degree. I studied that for about a year and decided it wasn't for me. Well, a new program had started at the regional campuses, bachelor of science in engineering technology, which has a heavy emphasis on manufacturing and machining. I really thought this degree would be more hands-on and I would be working on machines and getting dirty. Well two years into that degree and I'm learning that I will be sitting at a desk all day making blueprints, or so that's how the college is making it seem. I'm more interested in learning more about fixing/running heavy equipment.

To make my predicament more complex, the job I have, and have had since I was 17, I really love. It's an operations maintenance job at a race track and I get to be outside and learn how to operate heavy equipment, do basic electrical work, a little bit of automotive, also landscaping and just overall physical labor that also challenges my intellect. I really love landscaping, especially mowing with a zero turn - it's truly the place where I feel the happiest, but quite frankly every time summer ends its like school gets in the way of my happiness. The job doesn't pay too well but their are full time opportunities that would be feasible if I lived within my means I think.

And to add yet another layer of complexity, I have it in my mind that I MUST take an internship, even though I don't plan on using the degree and the college does not require it. I have it in my head that if I ever decide to leave the track and use my degree nobody will want to hire me because I have no work experience. So, long story short, I ended up accepting a co-op at a manufacturing plant because I felt pressure from the school, my family and myself to do it. Especially because the pay is really good. However, it is a field that doesn't interest me in the slightest and I don't want to give up my summers working at the track to go there. Unfortunately, because of all the pressure I have put on myself, I accepted the offer back in January without weighing my options. Now, as the start date (May 9th) approaches, I feel so depressed and dreadful every time I think about it. I absolutely do not want to do it even though I haven't even tried it yet. Just the thought of wasting my whole summer inside on a computer is depressing, I couldn't stand it because I love being outside and getting my hands dirty. I feel like I have already sacrificed enough of myself to school, why do I have to sacrifice even more of my happiness to them?

All in all, I just feel overwhelmed and stuck, school has already taken away my passion with this boring degree that I don't want to switch from again because that is more wasted time and money. Honestly I would be happy just not taking the internship and just finishing the degree, that would be a happy compromise. Yet at the same time, I feel I would be making a huge mistake not taking the opportunity, or judging it before it starts. But I just love my current job and wouldn't dream of leaving it. I also know it is a morality issue to retract my decision on an offer I accepted, especially one with good prospects. However, I only get one shot at life and I'd rather spend it being happy than being rich.

I'm interested in other's perspectives and thoughts. I have had professors tell me it would be foolish to do something that doesn't make me happy, but I have also had family and my current co-workers and employers tell me I should try the opportunity and do it for the money.

tivb36,2,2022-03-20,My Dad suffers with bipolar and I really need some advice.,joshjsamuels,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tivb36/my_dad_suffers_with_bipolar_and_i_really_need/," 

\*\*\*So I've just finished writing this, and it took way longer than expected, and I'm sure I missed out loads of context, and some of it might seem weird and rambly. It was quite emotional writing this, and I don't think I have the energy to read it back, but I think it paints a decent picture of my situation.

Thank you to anyone who will sit through it and read it

Essentially, I really need some advice.

So, throughout my whole life, my Dad has suffered from quite an extreme case of Bipolar Disorder, as well as poly drug addiction. (I am 22, he is 53).

My mum and he got divorced when I was too young to really remember them together (the only memory I have of them together is him (my dad) headbutting her (my mum) in the kitchen of our old house when I can't have been any older than 2 years old.

My mum was the person that raised me and my sister (who suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder). My mum is an angel. She sacrificed everything for me and my sister and is the most loving, caring, kind, selfless, and angelic individual I have the pleasure of knowing. It is an honor to be her son.

My Dad had affairs throughout the whole marriage, and constantly lied about his drug and gambling addictions, almost living a double life. I have heard stories about this from both my parents, and so have built up a pretty solid picture from both of their perspectives.

Throughout my childhood, despite my dad often being manic (and sometimes really quite dangerous) my mum would allow us to see him as she really wanted us to have a father figure growing up. Despite everything he put her through, she never said a bad word about him to us.

I remember hating going there on weekends. He was either high or sleeping. My sister and I were always hungry when we were there. The only thing I remember eating when we were with him as children was sweets. This seemed fun at first, but then I would get hyper/sugar rush, and he would get angry and aggressive. I remember always being scared around him. I remember even from such a young age, being very aware that his behaviour was irrational, and that he was on some sort of drug, though I wasn't quite sure what that meant at the time.

Fast forwarding now, I am an adult, and have moved away from home to go to university. The last few years have been particularly difficult for him, as I'm sure it was a lot of people who struggle with mental health.

His episodes are getting closer and closer together. He has been particularly abusive / manipulative towards me in these times.

About a year ago (I was doing my third year of university, which is a year in industry, and I moved back home to my mums in London where he also lives to do n internship -- i'm not sure this is particularly necersary context, but I wanted to make sure it was clear I was back near him), he calls me with slurred speech, and tells me he is having a stroke. He was going through a manic episode at the time and had recently relapsed. My initial thought was that he was lying (as he had lied about this kind of thing pretty constantly throughout the last few years). His impression of someone having a stroke was pretty good this time though, so after I hung up, I called my Grandma to see what she thought, and we decided to phone an ambulance just in case.

Turns out he did have a stroke. He was in the hospital for a couple of days, and then got released as his health was OK. He does this thing when he is unwell, where he really seeks attention and sympathy, and puts on a 'weak' voice. He wasn't getting much sympathy due to the emotional abuse he had put us through the weeks leading up to this. He then calls me and tells me the doctors found a brain tumour. Obviously I was incredibly worried, and scared that I was going to lose my Dad. Turns out he was lying. Again, this left me feeling really angry towards his. Why would he lie to me about that? Obviously he wants attention and sympathy, but does he not understand what kind of emotional rollercoaster it is to find out your dad has a brain tumour, to initially think he is lying (the guilt of that), the anger and relief of finding out he was lying... etc etc...

Fast forward a few days and he keeps asking me for money and I won't give it to him because I know where it would go up his nose. He tells me he hates and keeps hurls all sorts of horrible insults at me. I decide to go over to his flat and make sure he is okay. I was still really angry at him, but I wanted to maintain a relationship with him, and my sister had completely cut him off by this point, as well as my grandma and aunties slowly being pushed away too. He kept calling me 'gay boy' and 'poof' etc the whole time I was there. (I am not gay, and I have a wonderful girlfriend). I kept telling him to stop, as I didn't find it funny. Eventually I told him I was going to leave, and he told me to get a sense of humour. I got angry and (in fairness, what I did was very petty), but I switched off the light as I was leaving, he grabbed a knife and screaed the flat down and followed me out the door, yelling ' I'll fucking slice you, you cunt'.

Then, then, shortly after, he tries to kill himself. He calls me telling me he hates me and that he's swallowed a load of pills, so I call an ambulance. He had done this 5 or 6 times already throughout the years, and each time it was a cry for help rather than a proper suicide attempt, but I always call an ambulance anyway. They pump his stomach and find nothing, or not enough to do any real damage. It is always so traumatic. I feel really guilty that his mind takes him to a place where he feels he needs to do something like that. I'm not sure why he does it. I feel guilty that I resent him for it, but it is really unfair that he constantly puts me through this.

 

Anyway, fast forward again, I am now in my final year of university. He has been sectioned a couple of times, threatened to kill my Aunties, threatened to kill his boss (who had kept him his job for 20+ years through all his episodes), eventually leaving him fired. (he had done worse in that job, but I guess they had finally had enough). He has made a couple more 'suicide attempts'

I work really, really fucking hard. I get to uni for 8am, and leave at 8pm, every day, no matter what. I love what I do and I enjoy working so hard at it. A month ago, after another smaller manic episode, my dad tells me he has gone to hospital and that they have found a tumour. He said he is waiting for results back to see if he has cancer or not, but they don't think it looks good. He sounds pretty healthy or level, and so I believe him, although my gut tells me it probably isn't true. Through speaking to him everyday for the next week or so, I become pretty convinced he is telling the truth. Then I find out through my sister, who spoke to my auntie, that he had made it all up, and had never been seen by a doctor in the first place to get a scan done.

At this point, I am done. I can't do it anymore, and I am sick of the emotional torture he puts me through. I decided I wasn't going to say anything to him, but that I wasn't going to speak to him until I graduate (another 6 weeks from now, so about 10 weeks from then). I didn't want the distraction, as when he acts up it always plays on my mind.

He only tried to call me twice between now and then, and I wasn't even sure he had noticed I wasn't speaking to him. Then this week, I hear from my Auntie that he tried to kill himself again last Sunday. (again, the doctors confirmed he was completely fine).

He texted me the following message last night that i have so far ignored

""Please understand this could be my last Will and testimony. My whole body is in absolute agony. I have spent the last three years in agonising mental torture. I hate and detest everything about me. I feel my body shutting down. The kids have it right I’m no good. A worthless robbing coke junkie. I will stay at Edgware for the duration but I have the perfect building to jump off. That Amanda at the 999 has a lot to answer for. I had two brilliant ideas. Rent a 4,500 sq foot flat and live rent free and get a bank loan and open up a bikini car wash. It may have been a profitable and enjoyable future for me. Alas that has been shot down in flames""

 As always, I feel really guilty. But again, I know that all he is looking for is a response, and I am bored of giving in to him. I think I have to let him go. I think I'm ready to cut him out of my life. I can't deal with the constant worry with him any more. He has never been a good dad to me, and all he does is bully me.

Please can someone tell me what I should do. I am worried I am in for a life full of guilt and regret should he actually do it, but I also think I'm at a point where that is a worthy trade off for the constant emotional stress he puts me through.

I feel really lost.

I am sorry for the really long post. I am really grateful to anyone who reads it, and anyone who responds with their opinion / advice.

I am also really sorry to anyone who may have bipolar, who feels that I am being a bad person by wanting to cut him out of my life... I'm sorry"

The next day I received my score for an exam (worth 50% of the semester) well my dumb ass submitted the wrong document in the electronic deposit box because of a problem I got with my drive and that my folders all got mixed up. My Professor doesn’t want to hear me at all and says it’s my responsibility and that there’s nothing he can do. So I will definitely fail this class and if I fail this class I cannot do the internship. Im sick of it - I never win. It’s ALWAYS like that with me.

I took all the ap comp sci classes at my high school in my 4 years and I learned java script, so I figure that will help me get up to speed faster with R. I was wondering what is the best way to learn it? I have looked into two options and wanted to know if anyone had experience or info about them. The first one is swirl(https://swirlstats.com/) and the 2nd is a coursera course(https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming?action=enroll). I kinda like the 2nd option as it grants a certificate, so it would be something tangible I can show the company over the summer. Any help would be great!

My second question is how far can I get in a week? I am on spring break right now and want to know how far I can expect to get? Thanks!"

In my country, you need to do 6 years of internship of surgery (so you can learn from your ""seniors"" during that time, but you're still considered a doctor).

We usually go to a different hospital every year. In my first year, I was in an University Hospital. It was really stressfull but I always had someone to relay on, and the surgeons that trained me always did the best to teach us. Of course, the internship is surgery is hard and you kind of ""need"" to accept some terms before you'll even begin. (Everyone know that you'll work a lot of hours. I did 85h/week that first year. You also know that the surgeons will scream at you.. a lot..). I knew all of this, so I was mentally prepared. But oh boy, it was still so hard to take care of people when your studies doesn't prepare you for any of the shit of the real world (a lot of you probably relate ha ha ha).

Anyway, that was my first year : tiring, stressfull, but quite fun because everyone was nice in the end.

Here comes my 2nd year: It's in a really (really) small but rich country (not hard to guess, but oh well, don't wanna say too much of myself). In that country, there's no real ""university"" or ""high constitution"" of medical practice. Usually these types of structures are there to be sure that surgeons and others medical specialities respect the international guidelines for diagnosis, treatment etc...Wich means that every surgeon can do wathever they want, nobody will bat an eye....

The mentor (""Dr X"") who I'm following for one entire year is.... quite the disgusting type. He doesn't care about his patient, he's doing all of this for the money. He doesn't have any problem to tell the patient ""well, surgery is the best option"" when it's clearly not.Dr X is supposed to teach me and help me when I'm taking care of his patients. He is supposed to teach me surgical methods (since in 4 years I'm a ""true"" surgeon). But he does none of this!I'm 25 and I'm alone, taking care of 18 patients : some have their whole foot BLACK, some want to die, some other are asking every day to see their surgeons.He. doesn't. care.   Dr X prefer to do his political things, taking care of his 5 cars and doing his real estate sales than help me.He doesn't teach me jack shit in the operating room. I'm just standing there and doing almost nothing. The only thing that I do is reminding him **wich side we will be operating**, since he doesn't know that himself.

Everyday that I go to work, I can't look myself in the mirror. This is not how I want to work. I work to respect my patients and do the best for them. These shits are killing me inside. It's so hard to go to work knowing that you don't even care about anyone (to protect the minimal amount of sanity left in you)... That you are trying to do the (limited) best by yourself and going ASAP home to forget all of this.This hospital is such a bad place... Everyone talks behind the back of everyone. There's clearly two groups in this hospital : the one that like Dr X, and the ones who don't. Since Dr X has a lot of ""power"" in this hospital, he's able of firing the ones that hate him.

Dr X is also **seen as a god** by the people of this city (since he's in politics etc). I can't help but feel disgusted to see all of these patients having surgery when they don't need (12yo with removal of appendix for ""chronic pain"" without even eliminating Crohn's diseas or any other disease). It makes me **sick.**

In 7 months, I will finally go to another hospital and forget about all of this. But everyday is a nightmare... I don't know how I will survive this... I cry every night... It's so hard.

PS : thanks for my boyfriend for being there with me. I'd have been crazy without him.PPS : Sorry for my English, not my 1st langage."
tixrrh,59,2022-03-20,"Which school has the best consulting outcomes, Kellogg, Ross, Columbia, Tuck, or Booth? A facts-based approach to consulting recruiting outcomes.",No-Barber3237,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/tixrrh/which_school_has_the_best_consulting_outcomes/,"Disclaimer: I am an incoming student at an M7 school that is not on this list. I come from a technology background and hope to career switch into MBB.

-------------------------------------

There's a lot of opinions in this subreddit about consulting recruiting, but not a lot of data. I think such conjecture is of zero value when there's zero data supporting it.

In this post, I seek to compare Kellogg, Ross, Columbia, and Tuck using data available. **I would be happy to add other schools to this analysis if other schools post their data; let me know if another school does.**  The sources of data are as such:

**Ross:** Employment report, for all companies hiring two or more interns or FT for each company. (Note: despite this, we have an exact count for Ross because Ross also provides a list of all companies that hired an intern. So if it doesn't appear on that first list, but appears on the second, we know they hired exactly 1 intern. If they don't appear on either, we know it's 0.)

**Kellogg:** Employment report, for all companies hiring three or more interns or FT for each company.

**Columbia:** Employment report, for all companies hiring three or more interns or FT for each company. (There are additional ways to get more specific - eg: if a company doesn't appear on the ""total hiring companies list"", we know it was 0. If it appears on that ""total hiring companies list"" for interns, but the specific number wasn't listed, we know it's either 1 or 2.)

**Tuck:** Complete internal data

**Booth:** Employment report, for all companies hiring four or more interns or FT for each company. (This is the worst data set)

These are different data sources, and thus, I will present the final result in ranges to accommodate the impact this has on the result.

--------------------------------

We do not have data on number of applicants for each company, so it's impossible to say what fraction of the population struck out completely. However, the underlying arguments are reasonable:

1. The strong majority of students would take MBB over either T2 or boutique, if both options were available.
2. Schools with a higher MBB ratio indicate a stronger overall population; it is likely they had fewer strikeouts.

As such, we will be looking at the ratio of MBB outcomes to T2/Boutique outcomes. I will define the ""MBB Ratio"" as #MBB / (#MBB + #T2 + #Boutique). This will correct for the number of people in each school recruiting for consulting - that way, smaller schools or schools were consulting is less popular like Tuck or Ross will not be disadvantaged against larger schools or schools where consulting is more popular like Columbia or Kellogg. For the purposes of this analysis, we will define companies in the following way:

MBB: McKinsey, Bain, BCG

T2: S&amp;, EYP, Deloitte, Accenture (accenture isn't a B4, but we'll call it T2 for these purposes)

Boutique: Many firms such as ZS, LEK, Kearney, Altman Solon, Keystone, etc.

We will only be looking at accepted internships.

For class of 2022 internship placements, we have the following numbers:

------------------------------

# **Conclusion**: 

Looking at the class of 2022 internship data, Kellogg, Booth, and Tuck are of similar strength for consulting recruiting. Michigan Ross is much weaker. CBS is slightly lower, but that could just be a lack of data. (It is **unlikely** to be an artifact of CBS students preferring NYC, as there is no reason to assume that would change for MBB vs T2/Boutique.)

It is almost certain that Kellogg and Columbia are closer to their upper bound than Booth is based on what data was reported (3 hires vs 4.) However, it is my opinion that all three of those schools are likely closer to their upper bound than their lower bound, although there is insufficient data to prove that opinion.

I have also conducted this analysis with classes other than the class of 2022, but the result is essentially the same with other years.

Since then, I have also watched many videos hosted by many cyber sec youtubers about this same topic, and for the love of god and my conscience, I can’t hold on to my real feelings and conscience about this topic anymore. I feel like I need to have a place to tell the truth from the ‘inside’, from someone who by your judgment probably counts as ‘made it’, and to let everyone who is concerned about this topic share their real thoughts here. My goal of this post is to let people who are still waiting on the sidelines to get a REAL sense of what’s going on, not some curated content on YouTube or half assed answers you get from somebody here. And for that, I will tell you guys my story from the very beginning. This is going to be a long story, so grab your popcorn and sit tight. (If anyone who questions the truth of my story, I am happy to share with you my professional LinkedIn profile if you msg me privately) 

&amp;#x200B;

Like many of you who asked this very question, I was just like you in 2015. I was a first gen immigrant to the US, and was in my early 30’s. I spent my 20’s doing exactly two things: serving in the US military, and then getting my cyber security degree from a legit school using my GI Bill (My military experience was not an IT related job). When I graduated, I was in the same situation as many of you, waiting on the sidelines, wondering if I could get my dream job, a job with real benefits, a real salary (not hourly or contract), with great co-workers in a great location, and future career growth prospects. I did a bunch of stuff during school to prepare myself for such a job after graduation as well: 2 IT related fully paid internships doing MSP/help desk stuff, totaling 2 years of related experience. I was not in good shape health wise: I have a debilitating back injury that needs surgery soon, so getting a good job lined up with good health insurance with low deductibles was absolutely necessary for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought I had prepared well: I graduated with a 3.5 GPA, had paid internship experience related to my job, only thing I missed was a few certifications, buy hey, this is in 2015, where CEH was rumored to be the ‘it’ cyber security cert (LOL), and few the guys in my grad class had any kind of IT cert as well, so I didn’t put a lot thoughts into it. I started to apply for entry level jobs in anything related to tech: IT system admin, cyber security, software. What follows is the typical story you see here on reddit: not many replies, the ones who did interview me on the phone or in-person, are your no-name local small businesses that have no future career growth possibilities and pays less than $50k to start. Most of those jobs are still help desk, nothing really cyber security related, let alone all the fancy stuff like software development. The most interest I got from any place was an entry level help desk position for a local retailer in a dump for $45k, and the recruiter on the other side of the phone had told me “this is a very high offer”. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can imagine my disappointment at that time, thinking I had put nearly 10 years worth of my time, my youth, my hopes, dreams, and energy into this moment, only to come out like this. I ended up giving up my job search process, and after my college graduation ceremony, I traveled outside the US for a 3 month trip. When I got back to the US, I was a man in my early 30s, living in my mom’s place, with a bad back that would prevent me from doing anything physically challenging. I was in a dire place, doing exactly what many of you did that asked the same questions here and on YouTube: where are all the entry level cyber security jobs at? I thought there is a shortage of such people doing such jobs? What’s going on? 

&amp;#x200B;

Then one day when I was laying on my bed lamenting about my situation, one of the guys that I did my senior capstone projects with in college called me out of the blue. He was my PM during that project, and I also happen to know he was second in my graduating class, as he had the second highest GPA in the entire few hundred people who just graduated with me. He started asking me if I had really worked in the US military before, and he happened to find this job with a small defense contractor doing software development. There was an opening for an entry level position within this company, it was not doing cyber security work, but software related stuff. So he asked me if I was okay to do this job, and of course I said yes, given the situation that I had at that time. He then gave me some tips for interviewing, and set me up with his manager for an interview. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I got hired, this job turned out to be everything I had ever hoped for. I started at $60k a year with every benefit you can think of, the company was located at one of the most beautiful seaside town in the world, this guy who recommended me for this job also managed to find me a cheap pad to live in somehow (And a year later when he left for greener pastures elsewhere, I took over the lease of his pad for a relatively cheap price). Career wise, no I was not put into a position to do cyber sec related work right away, but the company was willing to train me from the ground up, even though at that time, I hardly knew how to write ‘hello world’ in Java! Oh, did I forget to mention the great co-workers that I had? The office that i worked in was small, probably 20 people total, that included the senior management team of the entire company, so I was able to work face to face with some of the most qualified and experienced systems engineers there. I was so happy, I knew in that moment I had got ‘it’, it being the entry level job everyone who went to college hoped for they will get, and one moment I was hopelessly laying on my bed, to the next moment I am well on my way to a promising career with great pay and benefits. With this knowledge in hand, I didn’t waste my time the next 4 and half years. With this job, I barely ‘worked’ during my 8 hours of time that I had to sit in the office: I probably had a real 8 hour working day less than 1 month out of all my time I spent there, rest of the time? I spent my free time at work and a few hours after work to hone my cyber security skills: I studied and earned my Security+, CEH certifications while at this job. After I got my Clearance, I left this job to work at a national defense contractor for a six figure position (50% pay raise), and while I was there, I got my Certified Kubernetes Admin cert, which prepared me to jump to another fully remote job last year (Another 50% pay raise and my current job). 

&amp;#x200B;

So when I see someone that asks “where are all the entry level cyber sec positions/how to get one of them”, I know what you mean, you wanted what I had to start my career that got me to where I am today. A job that has great pay and benefits, and great bosses/managers that gives you fertile ground and time to grow, lets you do your job without overwhelming you with work, pampers you while you learn to provide value to the working world. Now that I have got out of that entry level job and have served in 2 different companies, I can tell you such experiences in any field are the rare exceptions. Trust me, I know, else I wouldn’t push myself so hard to continue to leverage my good luck. But of course, I want to write here about why such positions are so hard to come by, especially when it pertains to cyber security/IT. Now that I am in a senior cyber security engineer position, what I really want to say is “How the hell you guys dare to be gatekeepers once you get here to all those guys on the sidelines”, but after I hold that thought for a bit, I think it’s more complicated than that (Yah enough about my stories, time for what’s really matter to you, the reader). 

&amp;#x200B;

What happened really is, time has happened and tech has shifted. What does this mean? I will write here in my own experience: back in 2015, many companies were still just starting their own GRC and cyber engineering department. Most of those companies still have part of their legacy applications hosted within their own data center, probably ready to jump on the cloud computing/microservices app train. Back then VMware certs were the darlings of the industry, along with the traditional networking stack like CCNA/CCNP and such. Cyber sec were the new guy on the block, and many companies, due to the position that they were in, had money and time to take on brand new grads that are also looking for an ‘in’. I remember many of the guys in my college class who got jobs at Cisco, Crowdstrike, and a few other smaller MSPs that do pen tests with not much experience in IT. Fast forward to today 2022, most of those companies had already done the transition from their monolithic legacy app hosted in an internal datacenter with VMware to a microservice based app hosted on Kubernetes in one of the big cloud computing providers, not to mention the “working from home” shift happened thanks to COVID. What the above big shift in tech is that people like me, who was able to find an ‘in’ back in 2015 timeframe, and who were doing whatever that had to be done to keep our skills current, are now ripping the fruit that is happening in tech during the last several years that you were in school. This means that cyber sec went from a field with many entry level openings to a field that is largely needing only mid to senior level practitioners in a matter of few years. The technological factors that enabled us to get our foot into the door have largely been gone, yet the education you just received in school was geared towards a time in the past that is no longer in the present. So now, I have seen new grads that are at least twice as qualified as the most qualified guy that I knew when I graduated, trying to apply for a job that is beneath the technical level of my first entry level job that I mentioned above, for less pay and no one bats an eye for it. Not me, my consciences can’t hold on to that, I feel bad for you guys who are on the sidelines today looking for an in, because when I was you, I was in a much worse situation personally but I was lucky that I got what I needed and I was able to leverage that opportunity to the promised land. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cyber sec Youtubers are the ones that disgust me the most when I research about this topic. Almost all of them are one of those few guys that ‘made it’ like me, yet none of them acknowledge their survivorship bias, and amazingly, all their talking points are the same! Get this cert, do this networking, do some CTF. My ass, haha. All those things should be on the job training, just like what got you there today. This probably ruffed a few feathers, but go ahead and reach deep down and tell me what I am saying here isn’t true today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Truth to be told, I was able to secure my current job in a senior role in cyber, only because the other guys on my team currently had no experience in working with software engineering, and I had no experience working with any cyber security team yet, so a mutually beneficial opportunity had united our interest (Plus the company that I work for now got a windfall of business thanks to COVID and the money printing madness that happened afterwards). This is how I am able to get a cyber security job with technically zero experience in cyber but a few certs. Once again I knew this is very ‘unicorn’, so I didn’t sit and rest and I have gotten my first security specialist certification in one of the big three cloud computing providers to show my new team my capabilities and willingness to learn new things. My salary over the past 5 years that got me here are as follows: $60k - $72k (internal raise) - $110k (Job change) - $150k+10% (current job). If you think this is high, remember that guy who got me my dream entry level job? We graduated college at the same time, he is now a senior cyber program manager at a major company, making $230k a year plus bonus. And he isn’t even the highest earning guy I know, another dude is a manager of software engineering not even in a FANG company, set to make half a million this year. Amazing how in just a few years away from college, the distance between each individual and their own career is already this far apart. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here is the real kicker: you still have hope to do a ‘side twist’ and get your foot into the door of cyber security. There are still many critical job skills that are very lacking in today’s cyber security engineering teams. One of the most crucial skills that I will recommend here is the Linux command line. I am constantly amazed at just how many people working in tech that don’t know a lick about how to use one of the most amazing software ever composed in human history, the Linux command line. I know software engineers that had to use Git GUI to do their pull requests because they don't know how to use the Linux command line. Hell I didn’t know how to use it either, I got introduced to it during my studies for the Kubernetes certification. This is why I am going to be gunning for Linux certifications, especially the red hat ones next. The web that you see today, including Reddit, are hosted in Linux. Docker containers are lightweight Linux OSs. Yet most people I meet working in cyber security are older folks who lived and died by using Windows server and PowerShell, few had any experience in Linux, and even worse, few know what is the real difference between a monolithic app and a microservices one. Pen testing will require you to run a bunch of commands in Linux as well, one of the security advantages in Linux is that you can lock down commands down to the flag level if you want to, knowing how to do this will set you apart a lot in your entry level resume. Things change in tech a lot, but it is not immune to the Lindy rule: things that have existed in time for 30 years, will survive for another 30 years at least. I don’t see how Linux will go away, since it is already launched to planet Mars, and probably will be the OS of choice in the upcoming space age. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kuberentes is another thing you can work on to bolster your chance of getting into the door: it is the VMware of yesteryear. This is what visualizes the hosts that docker containers run on today. Terraform and Cloud are also popular, but I think those things will change before we know it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, none of those things are very ‘entry level’ by the standards that I had when I went to school, but times have changed, and if no one was willing to give you on the job training, those are the things that you can work on to show that you have got an edge over others. This is what I have been observing since I started working in tech. Unlike many others here, I have done exactly 0 CTF, done 0 GitHub projects, went to 0 cyber security conferences, yet since I got the “on the job training” that everyone thinks should be the norm but is not, I was able to leverage that opportunity to where I am today. For people that had similar opportunities compared to mine, please stop telling those guys waiting on the sidelines to do those things, you know that’s not what got you to where you are today. Yes, doing them will add some points, but that’s not the main reason. Knowing the right person while you are in school is just so much more important than anything else, catching up to the latest technology while still upkeep on the tech that never changes is also important once you get your foot in the door. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ok the rant from my conscience is over. For people looking for entry level jobs into cyber security, let me know what I can do to help you. And I’d love to see more people here sharing what “really” got them to where they are today, instead of all the standard talking points. New guys on the sidelines don’t need them, they have been hearing them all their lives. They need insider information that will help them get an edge during interviews, direct them to the right resources, and hopefully be able to make up for the non-existent luck that they were not able to get.

TL;DR: Read from the 3rd paragraph from the end for all the relevant information you actually need."

Writing today hopefully for some perspective and support on how to handle this situation in the least damaging way possible.

The background for context:

I am a student intern at a site where things… have not always been handled in the most “ideal” way. 

My internship ends next Friday, I am officially done with my masters program. My site has been aware of this since I started. The clients I see know I am an intern and that my schedule would be changing when it ended. 

5 weeks ago I asked my site supervisor if I needed to transition my clients to other clinicians in the gap between my graduation and my associates license coming through. My supervisor asked that I not and instead keep seeing clients without a gap, I would just continue to be unpaid until my license came in. I believed her when she told me this was a-okay legally.

A lot happened since and I realized I do not want to stay here for the long term. There have been some pretty big questionable things that make me massively uncomfortable staying (left alone with no licensed therapist in office with clients without notice, my supervisor moved out of state with no notice and is only doing telehealth now while keeping the physical practice, HIPAA and consent concerns, concerning billing suspicions, and now this newest issue). I planned to finish my internship and *then* give a month notice to give my clients enough time to transition and process. 

Well my site started acting off and talking about starting to pay me “under the table” starting next week from an unrelated bank account (they are not legally able to bill for me and have not paid me for my internship). Alarms started going off for me so I did what I should have done a month ago, I called my state board directly to cut through the legal jargon of our statutes. Turns out that NO I cannot keep seeing clients in the gap between school ending and my license coming in. I am not shocked in hindsight and it seems like such an obvious thing but I believed my site because they’ve hired interns before and told me that of course it was fine because otherwise the clients would go without care and that would be unethical. 

I confronted my supervisor and the owner about this and they initially pushed back but then relented and encouraged me to just tell my clients I need a week off… then another… and another… until my license comes in. My supervisor offered to do emergency telehealth appointments as needed. I was appalled. This is no way to treat clients. They then tried for get me to sign a contract (I did not).

The last day I am able to see clients legally is the 25th, this Friday. I panicked and contacted my faculty supervisor who cc’d the department head and fieldwork coordinator. They are all in agreement that I have to essentially abandon my clients by ending my service by the end of this week as I am now balancing abandonment versus operating unlicensed. 

I feel sick to my stomach and I am so so angry at my site, my supervisor, and myself for believing them and not calling earlier.

What to do going forward:

My plan is to send each client a basic email (secured) tomorrow morning outlining that I will be leaving (to give them as much “notice” as I can) as I don’t see anyone until Wednesday. I will be offering extended hours this week to accommodate anyone who needs more time or session flexibility, and I spent today making individual folders with resources, emergency contacts and referrals, activities, articles, art projects, etc. based on the work each client had been doing, their goals, that I had session planned for the coming weeks. 

My notes and treatment plans are solid and documentation is in place for them to transfer to another clinician. 

Does anyone have any advice for other ways I can support my clients in this awful space?

ETA: any advice on what on earth to say to clients who ask why things suddenly changed? I’m keeping it vague but I know some will ask repeatedly until they have a satisfactory answer."
tiyy5j,32,2022-03-20,TIFU by not going to doctor because I thought I just had gas pain.,altaccountgobrrrrrr3,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/tiyy5j/tifu_by_not_going_to_doctor_because_i_thought_i/,"This actually happened a couple of weeks ago but I was too embarrassed to post then. Alt account because some friends use Reddit and don’t want them finding my real account. Sorry about the length, but I wanted to make sure I didn’t miss any of the fun bits.

This story begins on the night of the super bowl. I was hyped to watch it with my family so I got out the popcorn and tried to get comfy. About 40 mins in, I start having this pain on my lower left abdomen. I don’t think much of it, I sometimes get gas pains from my horrible diet so I just figured I would get it out of my system soon enough. 

Another 20mins past, at this point, I’m sweating and my skin is clammy. The pain has gotten worse. At this point I’m thinking that I should REALLY hold off on the enchiladas for a while. I decide to take gas pain medication and lie in bed; stretching myself like a pretzel so I can get that sweet, sweet relief of a fart. But nothing comes out.

I ended up just kinda falling in and out of sleep until it was morning. When I awoke, my pain was less. Figured I had passed gas in my sleep or something. Epic. Feeling better.

About 8hrs later, while doing homework, the pain is back. I didn’t want to go to the hospital cause I knew it would be expensive so I just downed some Tylenol and bared it.

A couple of days pass. I’m not feeling great but I’ve experienced worse. Until Sunday night.

Oh boy, Sunday night. The pain was back ten fold. This time with a friend! I felt like I had lost all the warmth in my body, my parents placed blankets upon blankets to warm me up, but nothing was working. My teeth were chattering and my body wouldn’t stopping shaking and shivering. This went on for around three hours. 

The next day, my mom decides I’m going to the doctor. My usual GP wasn’t in so I got an intern in. I go in and they ask if I had had a UTI in the past weeks. When I replied yes, I in fact did, the nurse looked at me and gave me a cup to pee in. Great. 

So I pee in this rinky dink cup and they test it. Something about it having nitrites and blood and the intern turns to me and says “have you ever had kidney stones before?”. Immediately, I’m shitting my pants cause aren’t those the ‘super painful ones?’. 

Either way, I get sent home with a cup to collect any kidney stones and a antibiotics prescription, just in case it was an infection. 

Cut to that night. Shakes and shivers are back in full motion. I can hardly breath. I’m gasping for air and can’t keep down any food or fluid. That’s when the vomiting starts. Because I had had no appetite, it was all stomach acid. I hardly slept that night.

The next morning, my GP (she’s amazing), calls my mom because she had heard that I went in to get checked out. As soon as she heard that I was vomiting, she immediately told us to get to the ER ASAP, because that is NOT a kidney stone. 

Next thing I know, I’m lying in a hospital gown, shaking and shivering, an IV in my arm and blood being drawn. My temperature has skyrocketed but I can only ask for ‘more blankets please’ cause all I feel is the cold. After waiting through an excruciating 4hrs, I’m wheeled to the CAT scan. Wheeled back. Wait. Try to eat. Wait. Throw up. Wait. Get checked on by nurse. Wait. Beg for water cause I’m extremely dehydrated. Wait. Pee in a cup. Wait.

After another 3 hrs the doctor walks in and tells me and my mom that I don’t have kidney stones! Wahoo! Nope, instead I have pyelonephritis! Or in  simple terms, a kidney infection. 

Lemme tell you, there is nothing better then the sweet feeling of drugs being pumped into your system through an IV.

TLDR: don’t avoid getting checked out by a doctor because you think it’ll go away. Also, if you experience “gas pain” after having UTI, it might not be gas pain and don’t be stupid like me."

I figured I would be able to juggle having my job and classes, but I was not prepared for the switch from online to offline. I had to quit my job because of my extreme social anxiety and depression, I also had to withdraw a class too because I was falling behind. I thought I could pick up the pace for all of my other classes this spring break but I kept messing around. Now I dont think I could get maintain a decent gpa this semester, my gpa is a 3.6 cumulative, and Im afraid of bringing that down this semester. I have no idea what I want out of my major(IT), maybe tech support, but I cant even get an interview for any of those jobs. I could get more certifications(I already have an A+ cert), but its just experience that is keeping me from being hired, which I severely lack. I havent been able to get into an internship at all, which continues to worsen my situation. Im already seeing a therapist and a neurologist, but I dont find them very helpful. I could go to CAPs, but I remember going to them was not very helpful the last time I went. I dont really know what I want out of life, I wanted to take a gap year years ago to explore what I want in life, but my parents just want me to finish my education as fast as possible. I dont have any money or options as a backup, nor any idea where I want to be and how Im supposed to get there."

I feel like Im only qualified for minimum wage jobs

I have an engineering degree (mechanical) and couldnt find a job after graduation because everything requires experience or skills or certifications that I simply dont have. I also never had an internship because at that time i suffered from a combination of extreme social anxiety, lack of social development from childhood, lack of connections and lack of experience. Thats the reality and I know I couldnt have done better at that time so Im trying to work with what I have. Say I fucked up all you want but you don't know my situation through that time.

Im thinking now I need to learn coding or get some IT certs or SOMETHING. I taught english in korea for 2 years. It was hard- but I definitely grew a lot as a person from it.  Im just at a loss of what to do from this point. I've been learning to code again. As far as certs or skills go, anything is within my ability.

Are there quality entry engineering jobs or something? What would you do in my situation? Is it hopeless? Im 27 with no real career.

TLDR: What should I do with an engineering degree and 2 years teaching english?"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

tj0eh2,26,2022-03-20,"Being offered a great postdoc opportunity, but I feel scared and worried due to personal problems. Afraid of burning a bridge in the meantime.",math_chem,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/tj0eh2/being_offered_a_great_postdoc_opportunity_but_i/,"I am a PhD in STEM, on his last semester before finishing the thesis. I will likely finish it in August

Last week I was offered a post-doc position in a very big laboratory, with funding from big industries and such. This is a ""golden ticket"" to many other PhDs like me, especially because my future PI has given me a ""free pass"" as to when I'll be joining them. He wants me to take my time to finish my thesis and, after I get it done, take a few days off and then move own to assume my post-doc position. The prof. loved me during the interview and is really looking forward to working with me, but after thinking more about the circumstances I am scared and insecure about assuming this.

I have zero doubts on my technical skills to handle the project, the problem lies on my personal life. In late 2021, I was accepted to  research internship in a laboratory overseas, with scholarship/grant. I had to use **over half of my savings** to provide the doccuments neccessary for the visa at the consulate, because this grant would only arrive at a date later than my interview. In the end, my visa was denied and, due to an impossibility of extending the beginning of said internship, I lost the grant. In other words, I wasted 60% of all my savings for nothing, sold/gave away many of my things and nearly lost my appartment lease. The grant/funding agency said that it is not their problem, since I am not traveling, so I will not see a single dime of their money. It has been two months since this, and I still lose sleep at night, from a feeling of financial insecurity. This, combined with a diagonis in late november/2021 of a chronic, life-ending illness, with little treatment, has completely fucked me up. I am struggling to finish this PhD, because everything feels completely pointless right now. I am at a constant battle where part of my brain thinks that this dream of doing science was a waste of my life, and urging me to find a way out.

Now, the problem on the post doc offer... for the reasons above, I don't think about the project itself, only the money. The professor took a really big interest in me, and pretty much tailored this position to my profile, and is putting me in a very interdisciplinary project, because he believes me to have an excellent profile for research. My doubts further developed when I saw they offereing another post doc position, more ""technical"", more towards people who want to get in, get some technical skills and move on to industry or high-ed. lab technician/managers... and my eyes jumped right to this, because it screamed ""financial stability"" due to the possiblity of transferring these skills to industry, despite the professor having created and offered me this position.  

I feel that I am biting the hand that feeds, and throwing away an offer that many other PhDs woluld dream of having. Further considerations about money, I will receive a lower grant (still a lot of cash to live comfortably) because I lack overseas experience and, since it comes directly from the university, and not from private/lab money, it would likely take 1 to 2 months, or more, for me to begin receiving my salary... and I cannot have any other jobs during this. I would need to move to the most expensive city in my country, spend whatever is left of my savings to live there while they take over a month to evaluate my project and begin paying me. I am absolutely terrified of doing this, because imagining myself on a position with ""almost zero"" on my savings makes me cold sweat and my heart beat faster.

I apologize for such a wall of text, and thank anyone who took the time to read it. I have not been well recently, and am feeling completely lost towards my future, lacking dreams or perspective. Right now, I only want for my health to not worsen due to this illness, and to still have money for a house and food after my PhD. The world seems grey to me nowadays."

I really want to get an internship lined up for summer 2023 and I want to start prepping for the interviews in the summer. I have a plan for projects to help me get interviews, but I’m not sure where to start practicing the skills needed to pass the interview. I’d appreciate any advice."

I have a history of SH and Depressive phases that came from my parents bad divorce. After a long hard battle I got my head right and managed to get myself healthy. That continued for more than a year+ now. Then in the span of a few days I feel like it all coming back.

In Highschool, I worked really hard to get good grades, navigating home based learning during Covid, being away from friends during covid was hard. But i ended up getting a 44 in the IB ( 5 A* and 1 A) which is definitely an achievement. Ive spent all my summers since middle school doing internships or working, including the summer after I graduated. I worked so hard and applied to schools in the UK. I ended up not getting into my dream school which was unfortunate but okay (its very hard to get into). I figured it was a really safe bet that I would get into the rest. I just found out a day before my 19th Birthday (Today) that I didnt get in to my second choice either despite being above all their requirements significantly and having what I was told was a strong application. Now I only have my safety school whos requirements are way lower than what I had achieved grades wise. Its a decent school but a punch in the gut since I worked so hard. I know I sound ungrateful and I sound like an overachieving kid but thats how I was raised.

On top of that Im serving National Service in my country doing very hard physical training. I started off obese and super super unfit but since lost 20kg and seriously worked on my fitness, i pushed myself super hard and even got into the commander course, this doubled my time in training but I wanted to push myself. Even borderline gave myself an ED and worked on my fitness. Ive passed the fitness test but am just short of the advanced goal that I need to be a commander. My course finishes next week and if I cant reach it by then they kick me out the night before I graduate my 6 months course that pushed me to my limits. Ill lose everything I worked so hard for because of one pushup and one situp. Its also my 19th birthday today, so missing the advanced fitness goal was the worst birthday present.

Personally all my friends I grew up with have also left the country to go study abroad and I feel left behind and so incredibly lonely in a romantic sense. Im tired physically and mentally, pushed myself hard whenever I could and apparently all for nothing. I feel so lost about my future, troubled about my present and my past isn’t really a positive time. I cant shake the creeping thoughts to start SH again and I can feel myself spiralling towards how I felt when I was suicidal before. I dont know where to turn since my father stopped paying for my therapist, mental health is still a taboo with my parents and my friends who are now across the world I cant talk to for various individual reasons. 

I fully dont expect anyone to read this but i need to get it out. I dont know if ill have the guts to go through with it but if someone held a gun to my head rn id probably thank them."

tj61eu,1,2022-03-21,Super discouraged about the job search… Any help or advice?,RPCVinVA,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tj61eu/super_discouraged_about_the_job_search_any_help/,"Hello! I love Reddit as it has helped me through some very challenging times in my life, and I am currently going through an internal crisis. 

I am 29 years old and graduated with a pretty useless BA degree in International Studies and Human Development. This was back in 2015. I was (and still am) a very hard worker all through high school and college and was very involved at university. I earned a stellar GPA, worked three jobs, studied abroad, held various leadership positions in organizations, won six different scholarships, and maintained a very social life. I never did internships but I volunteered my butt off and was offered a volunteer coordinator position in the Dominican Republic for a non-profit organization and an internship in China. I took the internship in China working in university and college counseling for an international high school and had the time of my life living abroad for a year. While there, I was able to strengthen my language skills (Mandarin) and taught English as a side job. After my year was over (2016) I came back to the USA and did a year of AmeriCorps service and served as a leadership program facilitator/mentor for immigrant children in the DMV area. This really opened up my eyes to the non-profit sector, and I ended up applying to serve as a Peace Corps Volunteer after finishing up my contract. I was accepted as a volunteer and finished my service in 2019…

At this point I had gained a lot of experience in working with youth in the areas of life skills, sexual health, future planning, and leadership. I was sure I wanted to be a school counselor at this point! I also became fluent in Spanish (I speak Spanish, Mandarin, and understand Cantonese and dabble in Quechua). I was very ambitious.

Well, after I came back from service, I immediately went into foster care and became a case manager trainee. At first I was doing well, but I immediately burned out 6 months in and resigned. This was also the time when the pandemic hit us. I was very very discouraged and decided not to apply to graduate school to become a school counselor because I felt that I wouldn’t be able to handle working through trauma with students. I applied to a few jobs in logistics programming and became an Auxiliary program assistant - basically an entry-level job that didn’t require much experience. I excelled drastically and throughly enjoyed just planning after-school programs and helping with the execution of programs and events. I actually got bored and eventually thought about going back to working with kids. At the time of my yearly review, our head of operations told me she wanted to promote me but there was a salary freeze so she couldn’t… to this day, I don’t think she was honest and just didn’t want to promote me. My direct supervisor advocated for me, but there was only so much that could have been done.

During that time, I also applied to a graduate program in global studies with the expectations that I would get in. I wanted to go back to working with the international population in the states and use my language skills! I decided to quit my job and move across country to where the school is located with my boyfriend. It’s in the PNW and he wanted to move back. I quit my job on January 14, 2022 and found out in February that I was waitlisted for the program. I became discouraged again because I was betting on going back to school for my masters. Now, I’m just assuming I’m not going to get in and am frantically looking for employment. 

I just feel that I’m not qualified for anything except retail or working in the service industry. I know beggars can’t be choosers but I’m just discouraged. I’ve only applied to around 4 places and haven’t heard back. Maybe I’m too hard on myself? I guess I’m just trying to figure out what can I even do. I’d love to work remotely, but sometimes I feel like there’s never going to be a remote role that will hire me…

I’m just discouraged."
tj6av7,1,2022-03-21,Should I push through?,robke53,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tj6av7/should_i_push_through/,"Recently I found myself feeling more and more exhausted from work. Im a self taught, I've landed an internship at a small company, then after 3 years there I went to work with my senior to a new startup in US (i'm from Europe). it's been 3+ months at this startup and I kinda having a hard time..

I know that i'm not the best dev, but it's really hard for me here, the tempo is kinda really fast, working in different timezones is another thing. my CTO has 0 soft skill and one colleague is already thinking of quitting because of that. I constantly worry that i'm underperforming or that i'm going to be let go because of something.. Okay so the pay is really good, there are a lot of places to grow for me, but as I say this job is getting on to me more that I would want. Even when I talked with my CTO ant told him that I feel a lot of pressure/stress here. His response was that some amount of stress is good for me.. Well tbh, I don't like to feel stress when I work, hell I don't wanna feel stress ever if it's plausible. I've heard multiple times sayings from them like ""hey, this feature is kinda big for us and might get a new client, so no pressure"" which obviously sounds differently..

Is these working conditions sounds okay to you? Or am I stressing too much or how does it even sound to you?"

tj961b,8,2022-03-21,Career Advice,Infoseye,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/tj961b/career_advice/,"A little background story...

I got into IT at a very late age 29yrs I had no idea or focus on what field of IT I wanted to get into. I had a thing for tech technology, but before now I was the go to kid in the family for fixed devices not turning on or can't connect to the network or setup stuff etc so the desire was there to get into IT but no idea where to begin.

So I studied computing in uni, I applied for a permanent position and got rejected due to lack of experience.

I couldn't sign for internship then due to my age, most employers or people I had the opportunity to meet and ask  for advice kept saying why didn't I get into IT earlier or tried discouraging me basically nothing helpful.

 I did a Google search for entry level IT certifications I could have to atleast secure me an interview and level entry job to gain some exposure and experience. 

With self study I got a+ certification which I was happy about since it was my first time diving in with no experience but still couldn't land an  IT job so I switched to contracting roles with little or no experience which I secured one so over the years I have been contracting gaining more IT experience in roles like helpdesk, service desk, deployment engineer basically temporary roles just to gain more experience working with managers and more experienced engineers. 

Now I'm looking to move from a second support role to a more  technical role like cloud computing or cyber security, any advice will be appreciated."
tj9v8m,11,2022-03-21,"I don't like how my boss treats me but nothing ""bad enough"" has happened",throwaway271931,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tj9v8m/i_dont_like_how_my_boss_treats_me_but_nothing_bad/,"So I work in an office where my boss doesn't seem particularly keen on me. Some examples are:

• We were asked to do research and as I was explaining what I found to her she interrupts and says that's not helpful and closes the door in my face

• Constantly hangs up the phone on me mid conversation

• Will email the entire department to just ask about whether I completed an assigned task that has nothing to do with anyone else

• Has assigned a lot of my previous tasks to the intern so now there's gonna be gaps in my worklog track which is gonna raise questions at my next performance appraisal so much that I go around asking if anyone needs help with anything

• Ever so often makes comments about how I eat too much and I can only do that now because I'm young and thin but I'll be eating nothing but salads at her age.

• She also makes these little comments every now and again that make it seem like I'm annoying her by doing my job, like asking why did I say she's in office if someone calls for her or saying that she was willing to do something until I mentioned that someone in another department asked about it 

There's also a lot of subtle classism at my office that I can't truly explain that's directed towards me since everyone else seems to be from well to do families while I'm a first gen graduate who has years of catching up to do with house repairs and other expenses my family couldn't afford while I was at school. 

Since my family isn't particularly well off and I'm now the main bread winner I can't just quit my job. I live with my mother and things were hard when her job reduced her salary and we're paying a mortgage so if I quit without having another job lined up, there's a good chance that we could lose the house if I stay unemployed. My mother doesn't think my work environment is ""that bad"" and I just need to toughen up since there's worse bosses out there and we're too poor for me to have any period of unemployment. And I agree that there's way worse than this, I don't want to stay at a job where I feel like I'm being a nuisance at best or being constantly picked on at worst. There's also no hope of me getting promoted either since I've already overheard a few people talking to new person they've hired 3 months ago that they will be next in line for the promotion when I've been here for almost 2 years. 

What's ironic is that my boss goes on podcasts and social media and champions herself as a pro feminist who wants to see young women excel and wants to mentor young women when the last time our job had an opening, she explicitly said at a staff meeting that she wants a man for the position and said she was so happy to find one ""in the sea of women applicants"" and I'm the only woman in my department under 30 and I'm definitely not being mentored or even made to feel like she's approachable. 

I've already started applying for new jobs and I can't wait to hear back from somewhere soon"
tja8e9,5,2022-03-21,Remote entry level job/internship?,Alskibroski,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tja8e9/remote_entry_level_jobinternship/,"Hey guys!

I was wondering, how difficult is it to find a remote entry level job or internship for someone who just started applying? I don't have a degree in CS and I've majored in something that is outside of IT scope. I've always wanted to try myself in web development and about a year ago I've decided to start my journey. 

I've completed several The Odin Project modules where I've learned about HTML/CSS/JS, Linux and Git to the point where I was able to move to FullStackOpen, where I've learned about React/NodeJS, MongoDB and Mongoose, debugging, tools like Postman, Cypress and deploying apps on Heroku etc. I've done few projects from the courses and some personal ones, now I feel like I'm ready to start job hunting. 

The thing is, I live in kind of a third worldish country, where salaries are joke, especially for juniors (Even our middles and some seniors get paid less than some juniors from abroad, no joke). And with recent events that started happening, our economy is also kind of going to crap (Thanks, Russia!), so everything is getting more expensive, but our salaries stay the same.  

Is it possible for someone like me to get an offer remotely, outside of my homeland? Are there any websites that I can look into? I'd appreciate any reply. Thank you all!"

Hope you are doing better than me 

I'm on my final year of university and I'm just defeated.
To give you context i live in 3rd world country (jordan) 
The IT sector here is actually good there is alot of jobs 
But the pay is shit other than some American companies how have offices here and believe it or not we even have Amazon here.
So one of these American companies have a training program which sometimes ends with a job opportunity 
I took the program a year ago and technically i did amazing but didn't get an offer but some students how I've actually helped and i knew they didn't meet the requirements of the training got the offers 
The manager told me we need student how are close to graduation and i wasn't so ok i just forgot about it 
And actually found another job as a software engineer 
It's not nearly as good but it was ok 
Now keep in mind I'm still in university the new job was from 10 am to 7 pm in office the only reason it worked out at first was because of the covid look down in the university.
Fast forward 4 months and they open schools again 
Now I'm seriously Fucked! 
I started falling to attend classes and it looked like i wouldn't graduate on time so i left my job 
A week later the American companie i mentioned before contacted me to Schedule an interview, that was ok as they work from home and i can do my studies and work at the same time.
I go to the interview i did well fast forward a week and i got a second interview now this one they asked me some questions about Spring boot architecture i didn't have alot of experience with spring i know how to use it but it's not like I'm an expert but i answered all java 8 and oop questions and also solved the coding questions.
 Booom! next day a rejection email for some reason this really hurts me because most my friends actually got the job from the training program because they only had one semester left and i the stupid one took it when i had a year left.
Now I'm applying to Amazon internship grinding leetcode code all day finished the online assessment a week ago and still no interview.
What to do ? 
It's not like people in the US or Europe we really have limited chances the entire country have only two descent companies for new graduates.
We have more international companies with good salaries and life work balances but they aren't for new graduates they wouldn't even consider me at this point.
I'm not worried for my future i know i can succeed but the my present if Shit!!"

-mentioned that I traveled out of own funds to US to tutor the girl again f2f and that I had to balance school at 3-6am as a result

I’m disappointed so far, and I hope it somehow turns over soon. I’m assuming MIT and Caltech rejected me due to lack of olympiads as international. JHU and Williams because of 10k EFC and they’re need aware. Amherst just because it was really competitive I guess.

Do I still have a shot at the others?"

Then in 2019 december I graduated from Cornell University with a masters in computer science (machine learning major). I had two internships spanning 9 months after that in data science. Due to covid I couldn't find a job before my visa expired and so have been jobless for a year now. I still dont have work permit in the US but my spouse works here. I am trying for a Canadian PR. 

1. Since I have a very short experience in data science and a one year gap, will it be easy for me to get a job in ML or data science or data analyst?
2. Or do I have better chance if I look for jobs in software testing/
3. How easy/difficult will it be for me to look for jobs in other western countries ? I am an Indian national."

tjh2ae,0,2022-03-21,Think before Reneging,SignificanceLimp57,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tjh2ae/think_before_reneging/,"Some advice from a veteran of the industry. I often see people use accepting and then reneging as a means of “securing” an offer while still interviewing or similar. As someone who’s been in industry a bit, please do not do this. Most of you don’t see past the next year, much less the next 10 years. The industry is actually much smaller than you think. Talk travels, especially amongst recruiters and Hiring managers. You just never know who will come up again down the line. 

A story: My SO worked at a FAANG company for her internship. I worked at a small startup as a NG. One month into my job, the former TPM on her team (FAANG company with &gt; 50k employees) joined my exact team. Out of all the companies (s)he could have joined, it was at my small startup. Out of all the teams within my startup that (s)he could have joined, they joined my team. We very quickly established that connection. Trust me, industry is much smaller than you think. You will meet the most unexpected people when you least expect it. 

Another story: (Also my SO - still at the same FAANG company). They sat in on a debrief for interview at a fairly senior position (think Senior EM/equivalent). The candidate performed well, but the HM overrode the decision, because this candidate actually reneged on the HM’s ex-company ~5 years ago and HM heard about it from the recruiters at his ex-company. This was without the candidate ever even knowing who HM was. They just happened to renege at the company HM worked at previously.  

I’m not saying to never renege, but don’t use it lightly. There are real, valid reasons for reneging. Ex: health issues, family problems, moving out of the country, etc. - but don’t wield it as a tool trivially. You never know if it will come back and bite you. Also - as a side note - your word should mean something. Don’t break your word lightly (as a matter of principal, not just within tech/your career)"

However I was surprised some of them had never heard of it.


So, from a outside perspective, how is Qualcomm’s reputation/name generally? I sort of thought it was nearly comparable to FAANG but maybe I’m wrong. Let me know what you guys think.

Edit: Just wanted to add this question. Is Qualcomm a good stepping stone if I want a FAANG job after graduating? I’d be a software engineer there working on 5G stuff."

tjkm39,1,2022-03-21,Situation with Potential Company Switch,asking_anon,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/tjkm39/situation_with_potential_company_switch/,"So I am a college junior currently and I am pursuing a career in the Computer Science/Software Development field.  I was offered a job over the last summer before my Junior year with a company that offered me a job with a potential salary range.  The job is contingent upon me receiving a clearance through the company.  They have also stated that there is not an opportunity for an internship with them this summer and that they were not able to get me a clearance due to their being a ""freeze"" on clearances currently.  

That is all well and good, but I am still actively pursuing an internship this summer and a majority of them have a requirement of a security clearance to have the internship as well.  I have an interview on Friday with one of these companies.  Additionally, on their website and the intern search they put out they say they actively recruit interns that do begin working for them once they have graduated.  If this company, who I see in a little more of a higher regard with the research I have done, offers me the clearance level I will require for the position and they are able to process me through before the original company and offer me full-time employment past the internship, is it bad taste to not commit to the original company and pursue employment with them?

I am just starting my post-collegiate career and have talked to a few others, but thought to get a broader pool of advice from here.  Any help is appreciated!"
tjkud3,1,2022-03-21,I'm gonna have my third interview soon but I have a huge problem: the only reference I have may say bad things about me,eljijazo08,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tjkud3/im_gonna_have_my_third_interview_soon_but_i_have/,"I seemed to ace the first 2 interviews, but they told me that after finishing the 4th, they will be checking my references. I don't really have a lot of work experience, I only have a few, and the very last one ended in ""bad terms"".

Just to give a bit of context, I worked for a very small company under this guy's supervision. I did and excellent job there, and the guy even recommended me to be moved to a full time status (I was an intern there), but sadly that never happened and I was jobless again.

Anyway, my supervisor still kept in contact with me and he offered me odd jobs he personally needed help with (nothing to do with the company). For example, helping him make an excel for a budget, stuff like that, and he would pay me out of his own pocket.

The thing is, during the last ""job"" he offered me, I was really depressed due to other personal problems (something I can't of course say in the current interviews unless I wanna fail instantly) and I completely bailed on him. Even though he realized something was wrong and I wasn't paying much attention to what he was saying. He even said ""hey if you feel you can't do this job just tell me, there's no problem, I'll just do it myself"" I told him ""yeah, don't worry, I can do it"".

But I never did and I completely bailed on him. I never contacted him again and he never contacted me. And during that time I had lots of anxiety so I never contacted him to say sorry. 

Now it's 6 months later or so from that event. I can't say sorry now just for the current company to call him and ask for a reference, he will think that I just said sorry to get a good reference.

I know what I did was not correct, I just think it's unfair because the OFFICIAL work I did for the previous company was OK, it's just that I failed with his personal jobs he offered me and he probably has a bad opinion of me due to that.

I don't know what do to, any suggestions? Just pray and believe he will act professional and give me a good reference for my previous job?"

tjoqmu,1,2022-03-21,Seeking advice on deciding between law schools vs. engineering masters,Classic_Hedgehog6679,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/tjoqmu/seeking_advice_on_deciding_between_law_schools_vs/,"Not sure which path to take. Any advice is welcome!

Some background: Graduated from an ivy with a liberal arts/social science degree. Didn't do any internships outside of my school/school-affiliated institutions during my time as an undergrad. International; would like to work in the US in the short term future.

Why law: Was really into legal research, technology law, and internet law. Dreamed of participating in lawmaking.

Why hesitant now: After graduating, I worked as a paralegal in New York while applying to law schools. However, I gradually realized (through my work, my observations, and chatting with lawyers/legal professionals) that my previous understanding of the legal profession was divorced from reality. A large part of lawyers' work seems tedious, repetitive, and highly process-driven. Moreover, I used to think that long working hours, repetitive work, pressure, etc., were not terrible issues, but now I am not positive if I could bear it. After realizing that attending a law school may not be an ideal option, I immediately applied for career-oriented master's degrees, considering the possibilities of changing tracks.

Admission results: Currently admitted to a fintech program (still waiting to hear back from schools since I applied in Jan/Feb). It is under engineering school, so it's more tech-y rather than finance-y. I consider pursuing data scientist/business intelligence/financial analyst, etc., paths. I was also admitted to a t20 and a t30 (nearly 80k scholarship) law school. I feel like I am at a juncture rn and am a bit confused.

Some more info about myself: 1. As an undergrad, I took courses purely out of interest, and there was a lack of planning. My interests were rather broad, so I took a bunch of classes here and there. Although I was a liberal arts/social science major, I took over 10 math and statistics courses and learned programming languages. 3. Had extensive data analysis experience tackling social science questions. 4. I was extremely idealistic back as an undergrad and tend to be more practical now.

A few thoughts on pros and cons:

JD: (Pros and Cons are based on my understandings so that they could be untrue.)

Pros: 1. The barriers to entry are relatively high. Not so many people take the LSAT and attend a law school in the first place, whereas the barriers for becoming a DS/BI/FA are relatively lower. 2. With the accumulation of experience, lawyers tend to have more of an advantage as they get older. So the career trajectory likely has an upward slope. 3. I love the academic side of law / getting a legal education, but I also realize that ""studying"" law and ""practice"" law are very different. 4. $$$ salaries.

Cons: 1. I talked and interacted with clients all the time in my paralegal job. I am okay at it, but I don't enjoy it. Besides, I am generally an introvert. 2. I'm not too fond of repetitive or process-driven work. But since I'm international, I will likely end up in the private sector and pushing papers. 3. Few exit options (!!!). 4. Requires a huge investment of time and energy.

Engineering masters: (Ditto.)

Pros: 1. Career options are slightly broader. 2. More room for being analytical and creative, which I greatly value. 3. Work-life balance is better. 4. I like using data to inform business decision-making.

Cons: 1. I'm not as skilled as those with a quantitative undergraduate degree. And I wouldn't want to pursue a purely technical route in the future, so the career trajectory is not too clear. 2. As I mentioned above, the barrier for entry is relatively low, especially since I don't want to take the purely technical path (e.g., becoming a software engineer). Harder to maintain competitive advantages (compared to being a lawyer).

In the past, I always just followed my heart in most, if not all, of my decision-making process. Now I know that being passionate about sth is not all. More importantly, preferences may change with time and life experiences. And ""passions"" may not be real passions. They could be based on limited perspectives. Like you fall in love with a girl/guy but realize that you fall in love with YOUR image of the girl/guy.

Thank you for reading through this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
tjq35a,3,2022-03-21,Sophomore in College (Physics+Econ Double Major) Looking for Clarity / a Path,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/tjq35a/sophomore_in_college_physicsecon_double_major/,"Hello everyone, I was hoping some of you could give me some advice on a trajectory. For some background, I have always been a good math student, and my career interests have always hinged between engineering, science and finance. Junior / senior year of high school I decided to go into mechanical engineering in college. This was advantageous to me because the biggest university in my state is pretty well known for engineering, and I got a full ride scholarship here. I had the idea in my mind that I wanted to be a business owner some day (still do) and that engineering was more practical / hands-on, whereas I could learn finance or management later on as more of an independent study. So I took my foot off the gas a little bit academically.

Well I get about a year into engineering and I dont hate it, but the reality is I suck at hands-on engineering. Putting circuits together + designing and milling out parts is not my cup of tea. Should've just listened to the fascination with math, programming, data and the stock market I have had since childhood.

So I recently switched my major a double major in physics and economics. I am also minoring in math. My school offers many economics courses asynchronously and/or over the summer, so this way I can complete a degree bridging STEM and Finance and still finish 4 years from when I began. 

Ok sorry if I am running on. Right now my GPA stands at a 3.7, and I am still only a sophomore so I am hoping to get the numbers up for grad school at a target school. This is where the meat of my question comes in. I want to work in either fintech / algotrading (More of the Software Engineering side of me) or doing equity research in some setting. Basically I am looking at a few potential options:

1. MBA (Ideally at a target school)
2. CFA
3. Masters in Financial Engineering
4. Masters in Math
5. Masters in Computer Science

What do you guys think is the best route? Is there anything I can be doing right now to improve my resume for grad school? 

I am very self-motivated and willing to begin studying on my own for potential internships or just to get a leg up on doing one of these in the future. If there were no such thing as degrees and designations I would still be seeking out this information and studying on my own because stocks are what have sparked my interest my whole life. But because institutions, target schools etc do exist, I would like to find the best way of approaching this.

Endless gratitude for your help"

GPA: 3.75-ish overall from one of the Ivies. CS and History double major. I took a really aggressive ML-heavy workload, including grad-level CS courses in my senior year.

GRE: Did not take

Publications: 2nd author at EMNLP, 1st author workshop at AAAI, another under submission in the top venues (1st author)

Work experience: Two SWE internships at F/G (one summer was for an NLP-based team), TA'd for a few upper-level ML courses, 2 years of undergraduate NLP research.

Recommednations: Very good from 2 pretty famous CS professors, decent one from a 3rd CS professor

Other: National research award, women in STEM if that counts? US Citizen too.

Reflection:

I told all of my rec-letter writers today (was crying so hard which was EMBARRASSING lmfao) and they were shocked, especially since some of them were previously affiliated with some of the institutions in the past and had gone out of their way to introduce me to their former colleagues. I don't think any part of my application went really wrong, there are many talented candidate and it's just the luck of the draw.  Lmaoooooo

Right now I'm taking this really hard because during my college application cycle, I had gotten into all the top schools I wanted, and now I'm getting rejected from the schools that wanted me 4 years ago. I feel like I was so ahead of everyone, but I became complacent and now I'm behind the curve. I did get into a few of my safeties and am waiting on a few others, but I'm thinking about taking the year off to chill out and work in industry, maybe try again next cycle.

For future applicants, I just wanna say, you can try your best and still be disappointed at the end of the day. So it's best to emotionally detach yourself from the whole process and focus on what you have right now!

But yeah, thanks for listening to my ranting and best of luck to everyone waiting for their decisions!"

(Computational Biology),sschreiber96,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tjrbc7/masters_before_phd_computational_biology/,"My background: I graduated 3 years ago with a 3.79 GPA majoring in Computer Science. I had a small research internship for only 4 months in a computational biology lab, but have worked as a software engineer in industry for the past 3 years (I currently work at a well known large tech company). During my time working in industry I have taken a couple of grad courses in Machine learning (paid for by my employer) at Stanford through a non degree option program, which I believe will at least demonstrate my ability to compete coursework at a graduate level.

Given my lack of research experience (with no publications to speak of), would it make sense for me to pursue a masters degree where I can try to get more research experience before pursuing a PhD, or do you think I have a chance of being admitted into a decent PhD program in computational biology (and by decent I mean in terms of advisors, not university reputation)? I am unsure to what degree my software engineering experience offsets my lack of research experience (maybe zero?). I have done many projects in industry which required independent research that I could site in SOP, obviously not pure research in the academic sense.

I would love to skip a masters if at all possible. I would already be giving up a full time software engineering salary to pursue this, so not having to hemorrhage money for a masters would be ideal even if it makes me slightly more competitive. My letters of recommendation will likely all be from industry if I apply right now, although my supervisor has a PhD in bioinformatics so that might help a tiny bit.

Also, I am leaving off the reasons why I am interested in bioinformatics in this post, please just assume that I have good reasons in my SOP.

tjs4vj,95,2022-03-21,"My Entry Level IT Story, No Degree, No Professional Experience",Varseth_,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tjs4vj/my_entry_level_it_story_no_degree_no_professional/,"Hello everyone, my name is Varseth, and I thought I'd share my story about how I broke into the tech industry. I worked a job I didn't necessarily hate but knew it was ""Just for a paycheck"" and could not wait for the day I finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life. I stumbled upon the movie Snowden, the somewhat accurate movie about the NSA Whistleblower Edward Snowden. After watching I was really intrigued with how vulnerable most if not all our technology is and how abusive it has become to disregard any security measures that may seem silly to most but are the most dangerous to all. Now I’ve always been into computers, however I’ve never been so interested in making a career out of it. After more research about Information Security, I stumbled upon many YT channels that discussed ways of getting into Cyber Security. 

This is where I discovered CompTIA and the certifications they had to offer. The Security+ was the first cert that caught my eye and seemed to be the most ideal cert for an individual like myself who is interested in learning and gaining insight into security concepts, tools and technologies used every day. After flirting with the idea of starting my IT career journey, I really thought deep about my current schedule with working overnight full-time, taking community college classes, and maintaining my relationship with my beautiful supportive girlfriend, I decided to make the decision to resign from the job I had worked for almost 4 years and start this journey head on. I am pretty good with saving money, so I was able to be unemployed for about 7 months, however I did have a very minimal amount of income from DoorDash, which I thought was a great way to not only make my own schedule and some quick cash, but also a way to gain some more customer service experience. I understand I’m practically writing a novel here, but I don’t want to go into every specific detail about my study process, so it pretty much boiled down to Professor Messer Videos, Practice Exams &amp; Labs, Eat, Sleep, Repeat. Sometimes while I was waiting for orders to come in on DoorDash, I would sit in my car with no A/C and go over my Security+ objective sheet I had filled out while studying. About 3 months into studying for the Sec+, I scheduled my exam, took the test from home, and PASSED! I worked so hard to pass this exam and I was beyond excited to slap it on my resume and now hopefully get a job in Cyber Security… Oh silly me. 

After realizing that it is not impossible but very unlikely to get a job straight into that specific area of IT unless you are in an internship of some sort in that field and/or have your degree already (Which I do not have yet), I realized I’d have to work myself up the ladder if I wanted to become a Cyber Security Professional. This is where I took a step back and decided to take the A+ and gain more knowledge and skills in the basics. Little did I know how much information and things I was not aware of before studying for this Exam. The same study process applied with the A+, Professor Messer seemed to be the best resource for myself, and I highly recommend his material to anyone that is interested in getting into IT, however everyone learns different and there are hundreds of resources to use. Studied both A+ exams one at a time and was able to PASS both exams within about a month of studying. Now I have the A+ and Sec+ and started working on my Home-Lab to practice Windows Server, AD, 365 Admin Center, Azure, etc. I found it so reliable to know that there were so many channels on YouTube that had FREE 1, 2, 3-hour long videos going over all of these platforms. I wanted to take advantage of learning these skills as they are super important when wanting to attain an entry level IT job.

After attaining the A+ and Sec+, reconstructing my resume, and working on my Home-Lab, I started applying for entry level IT jobs, such as Help Desk, Tier 1 Technician, Technical Support, etc. Many of the same jobs have different names, but for recommendation, I would just search “IT” in the search header and FILTER to Entry-Level. I stumbled upon many job postings that seemed interesting and some that could make you feel degraded by the atrocious pay that were offered for the position, but hey, this is entry level and temporary. After many applications, many rejections, and few interviews, I finally received a call back from a recruiter, and after interviewing with a couple IT managers for this one position in the Healthcare Industry, I was offered a Full-Time Helpdesk position for $21/Hour in the DFW area! I would’ve never thought with no degree or professional experience I would be given such an opportunity. I’ve been with this company for 8 months now and am gaining so much valuable experience. This process was indeed hard, but I was dedicated enough to realize what I wanted for my life and what I needed to do to get there. This is not only the starting point in my career, but also a story about someone who gambled on himself and wanted better in this life. Thanks for reading."

This is a couple days after the fact, so rest assured that I'm not cheating or asking for help on a current OA.

Q1.)

A number is self describing if the digit in each position is equal to the number of times the digit appears in the number. For each input N, print 1 if the number is self describing. Otherwise, print 0.

For example, N = 2020 is self describing because the number in the 0th index is 2, and there are two 0's in N. The number in the 1st index is 0, and there are zero 1's in N. The number in the 2nd index is 2, and there are two 2's in N. The number in the 3rd index is 0, there are zero 3's in N.

My initial thought was to create a dictionary and try and make key:value pairs as the number:frequency. Then, I used enumerate to get both the index and value of each digit of the number, and tried comparing the frequency from the dictionary to the index of the number. I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it. Any help is appreciated!

Edit: I posted my solution; it wasn't correct for all three test cases. 

    N = 2020
    
    def sdn(a):
        _dict = {}
        frequency = 1
        for num in str(a):
            if num not in _dict:
                _dict[num] = frequency
            else:
                _dict[num] = frequency + 1 
        print(_dict)
        
        for i, v in enumerate(str(a)):
            if _dict[v] != i:
                return 0 
            else:

It is a nice job, lots of time for training, personal development, actually too much time. When I first joined, I was assigned a project with a team quickly for web app development and enjoyed the ability to learn actual industry stuff, not the things you only learn in college.

I excelled on my team and recieved good reviews, but it was a short project of only 3 months. After, I contacted my manager about the next project and was told ""to wait for someone to find something"" which made sense, not always a project to do. In the mean time I have spent my time training, learning new technologies, and working on pet projects for niche problems that I have ran into during my internships and time in industry.

This last contact was 2 months ago. I was contacted by a few people about potential projects, but have not heard anything since, which was over a month ago.

I am not disasitified with the compensation, I am receiving a relatively nice TC for my first software engineering job and I know dozens would kill for a job like my of earning great pay for doing nothing but personal training and projects of interest, however, I feel like I am falling behind in experience for the software field. I don't want to be one year into the job with questions like, ""what have you done wiht your time here?"" and admit to not doing anything actually industry related.

Should I try to find a second job? Or a different one? I can technically take a pay decrease (they are really paying me more than enough) as I want more industry experience. What are the suggestions for gaining industry experiences for newer developers? Or do I need to simply wait and take it slower?"

I don't mind the actual working part of it, the things that cause me to resent working somewhere is the disrespect, two-facedness, and shady practices of people above me that seem to happen constantly. Like the times I was told I had to stay an extra hour on the job 30 minutes until the end of my shift when I have classes I have to attend, being yelled at when something wrong happens at work when my manager never tells me about the cause of the problem in the first place, given a higher work load than they know me and my team can handle and being punished when we don’t get done on time. Not to mention the flat out illegal stuff some companies do like classify me as a independent contractor when I am clearly an employee so they can get out of paying taxes(that I have to pay for). 

I remember telling myself in college that these jobs are supposed to suck since they were minimum wage food service jobs that I did to help pay for bills. When I get some jobs related to my major, things will get so much better! I then moved up to getting experience doing internships and moving from there to a full time job. The same stuff happens there and that same dehumanizing resentment I feel towards that company. I feel like now going into my next job, I feel like I'm anticipating when things will go south, instead of if they will(although I do try my best to keep an open mind because I don't want to make it into a self fulfilling prophecy or something)

I hate being a victim, and try my best to be positive. I do not think of myself as someone who will blame my shortcomings on the world and other people. Whenever something bad happens, I always try to consider if maybe I was the problem, maybe I was doing something wrong. I don't think that I am the problem in a lot of these cases, but at the end of the day, if most of the experiences that I have with companies end up being terrible, I feel like there has to be something wrong with me right? 

I just feel kind of lost with this. Does it get better?"

I am in my second year of school and am planning on transferring out of state after this semester. I never wanted to stay in-state and came to this school because I knew I had a secured internship in the field I wanted. I would say I was happy last year and I definitely felt like I belonged. I didn't make many friends outside of my internship but felt very close with those I worked with and didn't have much free time to hang out with people anyway. I lived with my best friend from high school and she was the closest person I had. I made mistakes, I began a relationship with someone I shouldn't have and while it hasn't been confirmed, I believe it led me to get let go from the internship. I was crushed, a type of sadness I hadn't felt in a while. While being let go, the person I fell in love with did not want me as I wanted them. Over the summer after the year ended, I was unable to go home because I was told to stay over the summer in my college city for my internship before they fired me. I was stuck in a place where I felt like I had just lost everything and felt like I had no purpose. It was an extremely lonely summer, I got a job at a restaurant to pay my rent. My only social interaction was with my coworkers who I really like, however, they are 21+ and I could not go out with them as they go to bars. The other interaction was with the person who didn't love me, it hurt to be with them but without them I was completely alone. I thought about not being alive often and sometimes discussed how I was feeling openly with them. The summer slowly passed and there were good moments, but I was still constantly overwhelmed with sadness.

The next school year started again and I began living with my roommate from the previous year. I knew that this would be my last semester here and that I would be transferring to a different school where I could continue an internship. The first couple months were fun, it was the most I ever partied as I didn't do much my first year. I fell behind in one of my classes and let it slip to a fail. I couldn't get myself to care and just tried to have a fun time partying and going out. Towards the end of the semester I realized the importance of the class and had to beg for my life to withdraw. Since around that time, I've stopped going out. I ruined my relationship with my roommate for no reason. I made the person I love hate me (they were not good for me but for some reason just impossible to get over.) I never leave my house, and dread the days I have to go to work. My classes are mostly online and I just do not go to the ones scheduled for in-person (there are no attendance grades). It has been quite a few months like this. My only friend here is in a sorority and has many other friends, and we don't get the chance to hang out alone often. She invites me to group settings but I never go. I facetime my best friend who lives in another country nearly every day for hours, and she's the reason I am good sometimes. We never see each other though and it's so sad because I feel like if we lived together everything would be solved. I am moving to another state far away in just a matter of months to transfer, but I feel like this sadness and laziness and loneliness will never end. I'm excited to move and start again, but am so scared of a new school, as it has a tiny enrollment, about the size of my high school.  I leave my house only for work and nothing else. I feel I should say I also smoke weed every day.

I know I need to work on myself and just get shit done and start taking care of my body but I just can't. I never have the motivation. I want to not be here so badly so often and I don't know how to stop feeling like this. I have no friends nearby to spend my time with, I don't want to join groups or go out, I feel a weight on me all the time. How can I stop doing this to myself?"

Have gone through lot of resources, the last being the Odin project, did that for a month but then life happened and haven't done any coding for last 3 months. Also going back to Odin, I don't feel like doing the same front-end html, css learning for the umpteenth time. I feel like I have been approaching this the wrong way, I have been switching programming languages thinking there's a better opportunity there and so leave whatever I had learnt and start with scratch on the other one. And all I end up doing is repeating the same basic fundamentals of loops, if else's with different syntaxes.

I did try to learn some Data structures as well but those were also just theoretical knowledge. Haven't practiced anything, and theoretical knowledge you forget after a while. Also, the mandatory trainings assigned each year in our company doesn't help either. Like last year we were assigned to learn python, with no end goal. Just learn python. This year it's about azure cloud fundamentals AZ-900, junit and groovy (groovy is something I only chose from the limited choices I was offered, thinking at that time it would be good to learn something new 😓). 

So, I would like someone to suggest a clear plan that I can take so that I can get a job in a development role. The most experience i have is with Java only. Had practiced on hackerrank till I got 5 stars there, also used to do some competitive challenges on codingame. I am currently thinking instead of learning web dev with JS, I should probably do something with Java itself. But don't know how the job market is for java now. I am in India btw. So, if anyone can suggest a clear plan, along with realistic timelines I should try to achieve, that will be really helpful. Thanks in advance."

On mobile and caffeine’s out so sorry for typos and bad grammar lol

I am finishing up my software engineering degree and really thinking about my job prospects, I enjoy coding enough, but I really enjoyed my business minor and would rather learn how things work, explain things, and talk to customers rather than actually coding something. I have a few internships under my belt, but would definitely say I’m entry level. 

I am interested in project/product management, but not too sure how to get into it, or how much experience I should have as a Dev (if any) before moving on to PM. I’m also considering getting an MBA. Would love to hear any advice, personal experiences, or whatever comments."

tjxzdt,3,2022-03-22,"Torque based condition monitoring, how?",Chestere1,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/tjxzdt/torque_based_condition_monitoring_how/,"Hello reddit,

Currently in my last year of college in engineering school doing an internship at a big chemical company. Tasked to find a way of predicting failures on an agitator setup identical to [this one](https://imgur.com/a/dOLRRd0), preferably by measuring **torque**.

It has to be widely applicable throughout the different agitators on site, so it should be easy to install with limited downtime. My idea is to drill a hole in the top of the gearbox and install a torque sensor on top of the axle. Not sure if the sensor can measure correctly in that position?  

Since torque sensors seem quite costly, I also wondered if it is possible to calculate torque by measuring power and RPM, since torque is **(9550\*power)/rpm.** But how accurate is this to the true torque exerted on the agitator shaft?

If you experts have advice on how to handle this, let me know!"

I'm in a little dilemma over what the future holds for me. I am currently in my final year of studying electronic and electrical engineering. My reason for choosing this field of study was because of my love for mathematics, physics, and analytical thinking, back in secondary school. I'm performing well in college because I have been acquiring above-average-grades. I like engineering.

But there's a big problem. I am from a third-world country. The engineering profession is in a big mess. There is no well-paying job for the average engineering graduate. There is no silicon valley, no massive employment opportunity in the power sector, no big chance in the telecommunications sector either.

 Even if you manage to get a job as a graduate trainee, the highest amount you will get is the equivalent of US$100 to US$150 per month. The cash is not enough to rent a good one-room apartment. Also, during one of my internships, I discovered the poor working conditions for engineers in the industrial areas. Many of them don't have the required PPE to shield them from danger. The junior engineers keep complaining about everything. Furthermore, one of my professors in college warned my entire class that professional engineers are treated like shit, not only in my country, but in some other parts of the globe. He told us to go for a Masters.... and pursue an MBA. Perhaps, maybe an MBA will give an engineer a place among the board of directors (I can't say) He said engineers have little or no financial voice on industrial operations (which results in low pay). 

 In fact, to cap it up, every single sector in my country is a big ball of mess that can't be quenched anytime soon (healthcare, tourism, politics, technology, financial sector e.t.c you name it). Bear in mind, I still love engineering. But these conditions are really discouraging. However, another area that interests me at the moment is machine learning and artificial intelligence. I code decently well too. Computer science catches my interest.

Consequently, my nuclear family have been persuading me to get a second degree in nursing. With a nursing degree, they claimed that there is a chance that I could get a well paying job in America, Canada, Australia, or a first-world country. I figured that they are right. The requirement is to apply to a nursing agency or council, write a standardized English test, and pass the necessary exams. Also, the richest members of my extended family are nurses in the US and the UK. The pressure from my immediate family has been really intense. They claim that I have the mental capability and brilliance to pull through a nursing degree. They claim that I have always been an exceptional Student.

I can actually give it a try and get into nursing school. But, there's a problem. I am not sure that I'll  like the career. I don't think I like bodily fluids, poop, or blood. I'm not a people person. After giving myself a thorough assessment, I don't think I have what it takes to excel as a professional nurse. But I still can't say, because I've never worked in an hospital before.

I want to go in the tech direction. But I'm not sure things might work out. Should I give the nursing degree a try? It's gonna be another five years of schooling."

tk3yqn,1,2022-03-22,Internship Opportunity?,justjikooktrash,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tk3yqn/internship_opportunity/,"Currently I am a 1st year Uni Computer Science student (f/19) and looking for a summer internship in the IT field in Amsterdam. I managed to find one which actually contacted me back and even is offering the position to me but I asked for some time to think about it (2 days from now)

I am horrible at making decisions for myself so I came here.

I really like the internship; they want me to start in April, while I am still at Uni, for 2 days a week on site. Then, from mid-June till September they want me to work around 32hrs a week on site as well (however with the opportunity to work from home some days).

My bf and I are long distance at the moment and like to come see each other now and then when we have time off uni, so I fear that could come in the way of plans and as well I come from another country and would like to go back for a week in summer to see family and friends (I only have 2 weeks of holiday time if I am correct).

Edit: I double checked and I only have 9 days of holidays - My bf and I have a concert in London in August and I was planning to stay a week there...

Additionally, the pay is not too bad, I know some internships are done unpaid so I do not want to risk losing out on the opportunity. My main aim with this is to make some money (to pay my silly rent) and gain good IT experience for my CV (Though I already have some Hospitality and Marketing experience).

With all the pros and cons of the internship, I am still unsure of if I should take it and I lack friends and family who have done internships before so I can't properly form a strong opinion, I was wondering if anyone could give me advice?"

Here is the 115th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?  

   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

tk5lav,2,2022-03-22,Look for jobs first or look for apartments first?,VeritasAmicusMeus,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/tk5lav/look_for_jobs_first_or_look_for_apartments_first/,"Hi, I’ve been getting conflicting advice on my situation so I come to y’all.

I’m a senior in college in NJ, USA. Through my internship, I have been verbally offered a job (for after graduation in May) in which I’d earn 40-45k before taxes and I can work remotely anywhere in NJ. My girlfriend is also graduating, and is currently interviewing at a few different places.

My parents said that we should be trying to secure an apartment as soon as possible and then my girlfriend would search for work only in that area, and if she doesn’t find work before graduation she’d have to work at a minimum wage job to help with bills. They say that getting housing is more difficult than getting a job right now, so that should be a priority, and that we need to be looking for an apartment for May/June right now.

Her parents, however, say that she should apply all over the state and we try to find housing close to her work. This would have the advantage of us both having salary offers that we can present to the apartment managers. They say if my gf can’t find work we would just get a “cheap” apartment anywhere in the state and she would work minimum wage.  

A few important notes: we have about $8,000 in savings and as we are working through college we will probably have another $2,000 by graduation. Also, I have not been given a written, official offer with a salary for my potential job, so first of all I know that things aren’t definite until they’re in writing, and secondly, I would think this would hinder me from being able to get an apartment. Lastly, my internship told me that if I have to work from my parents house, which is out of state, for a month or two after graduation to get my situation sorted, that wouldn’t be an issue. 

So it comes down to this: When do we start applying for apartments? Now? After I get an official offer? After my girlfriend gets an offer? Thank you all for the advice!"
tk5vxr,1,2022-03-22,how to filter a pivot table using a reference cell?,DuskBobcat,excel,https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/tk5vxr/how_to_filter_a_pivot_table_using_a_reference_cell/,"hi guys, sorry in advance for my poor english...

so, I started a internship two months ago and I use excel on a daily basis. one of my weekly tasks consists of creating a top 10 list by product ID.

I decided I want to automate this process, and recorded a simple macro which extracts data from a production diary (copy and paste on another worksheet).

this production diary is a pivot table, filtered by year, month, location and day. among other data, it mainly shows my product IDs on the rows, and the planned production (P) and delivered production (E) of every single day of the month on the columns - as shown in the screenshot link.

so, I'm looking for a way which my macro sees a cell containing a =TODAY function, and filter my pivot table (production diary) based on that cell.

example:

=TODAY function returns 22-03-2022 (dd-mm-yyyy), then my pivot table gets filtered like this:

year: 2022 (from 2014 to 2026)

month: 03 - march (from all available months)

day: 22 (from all available days of the month)

sorry that's a noob question, this is the first time I'm using excel on a daily basis and I'm not used to automating stuff (even though it's very cool). thank you!!!"

tk6tei,0,2022-03-22,Should I get a second BSc in nursing after completing my engineering degree,honda_gingerbread,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/tk6tei/should_i_get_a_second_bsc_in_nursing_after/,"Hi, citizens of Quora. I'm in a little dilemma over what the future holds for me. I am currently in my final year of studying electronic and electrical engineering. My reason for choosing this field of study was because of my love for mathematics, physics, and analytical thinking, back in secondary school. I'm performing well in college because I have been acquiring above-average-grades. I like engineering.

But there's a big problem. I am from a third-world country. The engineering profession is in a big mess. There is no well-paying job for the average engineering graduate. There is no silicon valley, no massive employment opportunity in the power sector, no big chance in the telecommunications sector either.

 Even if you manage to get a job as a graduate trainee, the highest amount you will get is the equivalent of US$100 to US$150 per month. The cash is not enough to rent a good one-room apartment. Also, during one of my internships, I discovered the poor working conditions for engineers in the industrial areas. Many of them don't have the required PPE to shield them from danger. The junior engineers keep complaining about everything. Furthermore, one of my professors in college warned my entire class that professional engineers are treated like shit, not only in my country, but in some other parts of the globe. He told us to go for a Masters.... and pursue an MBA. Perhaps, maybe an MBA will give an engineer a place among the board of directors (I can't say) He said engineers have little or no financial voice on industrial operations (which results in low pay). 

 In fact, to cap it up, every single sector in my country is a big ball of mess that can't be quenched anytime soon (healthcare, tourism, politics, technology, financial sector e.t.c you name it). Bear in mind, I still love engineering. But these conditions are really discouraging. However, another area that interests me at the moment is machine learning and artificial intelligence. I code decently well too. Computer science catches my interest.

Consequently, my nuclear family have been persuading me to get a second degree in nursing. With a nursing degree, they claimed that there is a chance that I could get a well paying job in America, Canada, Australia, or a first-world country. I figured that they are right. The requirement is to apply to a nursing agency or council, write a standardized English test, and pass the necessary exams. Also, the richest members of my extended family are nurses in the US and the UK. The pressure from my immediate family has been really intense. They claim that I have the mental capability and brilliance to pull through a nursing degree. They claim that I have always been an exceptional Student.

I can actually give it a try and get into nursing school. But, there's a problem. I am not sure that I'll  like the career. I don't think I like bodily fluids, poop, or blood. I'm not a people person. After giving myself a thorough assessment, I don't think I have what it takes to excel as a professional nurse. But I still can't say, because I've never worked in an hospital before.

I want to go in the tech direction. But I'm not sure things might work out. Should I give the nursing degree a try? It's gonna be another five years of schooling."

The company I am interning at mainly uses C++ and Python which is a start. However, I struggle with wrapping my head around as to how I should accurately prepare for my first software engineering ""job"" essentially. I have been practicing coding problems, do some practice with method implementations to help wrap my head around OOP concepts even more, and will not begin taking on fairly beginner to intermediate projects. I am still unsure as to what I should be doing to prepare me because I am trying to look for some preparation that closely aligns with that of a typical software engineer. It gets overwhelming because there are so many resources available.

When I passed out I had two offers (TCS doesn't count). A 10-year-old SaaS service company offered me 8LPA and another one was a product company that paid me 7LPA. I had already started an internship at the product-based company and thus decided to continue here because after all, it's a ""PRODUCT COMPANY"".

15 months in now, I have had a roller coaster journey. During my 6 month internship, I was put in a side project that use Java SE where I did not learn much. I expressed an interest in Product Management and they put me in a customer-facing role where I thought  I'll learn a lot. Turns out it is a kind of internal User Acceptance Testing role. Spent 7 months there without coding a single line.

(Of course, I didn't have any solid frontend or backend skills out of college and I was exhausted due to personal problems to prepare and switch).   


It's been 2 months now since I switched to the core product development team. The tech stack is Java 8, bits and pieces of Spring and Hibernate, Azure, SQL Server, MongoDB, Docker and Azure. It's an enterprise software filled with legacy code with nearly zero documentation. My colleagues are helpful and they help me out. I am yet not working with ant frameworks. I just feel I am writing plain old Java code with some queries, etc. 

Only now I figured out the whole product and team is mediocre who just maintain status quo and want to somehow get things done. I was once an enthusiastic wannabe developer but now have serious impostor syndrome. On top of it, I got a hike this month which is peanuts. So I want to switch.

I am fine with backend roles or Flutter is something I have started looking at. How do I start the process of switching?

Should I learn some technologies in a bit depth, do DSA after that and then switch? It would take around nd 4-5 months for me. OR, should I only do DSA and give interviews and try to convince the companies that I do have skills? (I am kinda know it all person, so I can talk about various technologies but it might be hard to keep it up for long term). 

I do know that FAANG level companies don't care about all those and purely focus on DSA and other skills can be learnt on the job. But given that I am from a mediocre product company and a tier-3 college, it would be hard to land FAANG interviews. 

So, my dear fellows, suggest me on what to do?"

I was hoping I could get some advice in terms of career progression and really appreciate if you could chime in as i've been feeling in a slump lately.

**Background**

I am 29 years old and live in Toronto, Canada. Graduated in College with a diploma for Computer Networking and Technical support with a strong GPA. I learned various technologies from my time in College such as Windows/Linux administration, SQL, Python/Powershell, a little bit of security, and a lot of networking. I also did an internship for 8 months which was a helpdesk role which I loved.

After my internship ended, I got another helpdesk role at an educational institute which i've been working full time since July 2020. This current role pays about 42k a year. The main issue with my job is the lack of growth and pay. Most of my day to day consists of troubleshooting Office365 issues and password resets which feels super redundant. I have 1:1's with my director and I've been asking to do more outside of helpdesk so I can progress and learn however our IT team is a small shop and does the absolute minimum just to keep the lights on. My director told me I was getting underpaid but unfortunately there isn't much that can be done. There isn't also a career path for me at my current company or a roadmap for progression. However, she said she will give me projects to work on for career progression so I can add that to my resume and apply to other jobs. 

**Certifications**

I've recently obtained my AZ-104 last week and have my AZ-900. However I have minimal cloud experience. 

Ideally, I'd like to work in the cloud but I'm not sure what jobs I could apply for with my current experience or what roles I can progress into. I'm open to all sorts of suggestions in terms of career paths or general advice. 

Thanks!"

It wasn't even relaxing or anything, it actually made me more anxious than ever. 

I started smoking all of the sudden when my great grandma passed away in January and I've smoked weed almost every day since may after study or work. Sometimes I skipped those or called in sick just to get high. I really really disliked and hated than version of myself and after I got corona a week ago I decided to quit smoking. Now I haven't smoked weed for 9 days and I haven't smoked cigarettes for 5 days. For some it may not seem that impressive but I'm happier than I've been for a good while. 

My problem however is that smoking was my way of winding down and ""relaxing"", even though it wasn't relaxing at all. I find it very hard to replace the habit of doing any sort of substances after a long day, especially after my quite exhausting internship on tuesdays. Now I find myself drinking 1 or 2 glasses of wine after getting home. It doesn't look or seem very problematic now, but I'm afraid it could turn into something worse and I really don't want replace an old addiction with a new one. 

I'm usually too tired (or at least that's what I tell myself) to work out after work/internship/study. I'd like to start working out though because I barely did any of that the last couple of months. Is there anything else you guys would recommend for me to do at the end of the day instead of reaching for alcohol or something to smoke? Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)"

I started an internship in a company that sells premium products. They clearly make a lot of money because of the niche premium product market over here. The owner/managing director lives like a king on the 6th floor with his beautiful 5 star hotel style office room and the rest work on the 4th floor. There are NO engineers in the entire building except the IT guy. No mentors to introduce me to the system. No one to teach me about the business domain.
First when i went for the interview, they said that they want me to intern with them, but first I will have to present to the owner why and how data is important for businesses. I thought ""fine they want me to convince them why my position will hold value in their company"".  Remember I haven't been hired yet. He really liked the presentation and hired me and asked me to come the next day. After that they wanted me to figure out where the company can start collecting data from and what that data will mean for the company. At this point I was pretty frustrated because this wasn't what I was expecting. I was working extra hard for these people that I just met, and I was working to meet their expectations. I was doing a product manager + data engineer + data analyst level work as a first entry level data analyst job, because I had to figure out how to get the data out of the SQL server too. I sucked it up though. ""Life is going to be way tougher than this, all pain carves a way for you to reach satisfaction"" i thought. I gave him my plan for where we can collect the data from but he wasn't satisfied, he wanted more, he wanted all the columns that we would collect, as in all the attributes. I came back next day and now he was satisfied and asked me to start preparing the dashboard. Now the problem is that i still haven't been given the local read only access to the sql server, don't have any admin privileges in the system, don't have anyone to help me out with the engineering part, and theres a guy who wants me to present how 'data is going to change this company' at the next ""town hall"" meeting that they're having with the whole company. I am not afraid of presenting, and like to think i am pretty good at it but I am frustrated. I don't know what to do. I am clueless."

I am in my second year of school and am planning on transferring out of state after this semester. I never wanted to stay in-state and came to this school because I knew I had a secured internship in the field I wanted. I would say I was happy last year and I definitely felt like I belonged. I didn't make many friends outside of my internship but felt very close with those I worked with and didn't have much free time to hang out with people anyway. I lived with my best friend from high school and she was the closest person I had. I made mistakes, I began a relationship with someone I shouldn't have and while it hasn't been confirmed, I believe it led me to get let go from the internship. I was crushed, a type of sadness I hadn't felt in a while. While being let go, the person I fell in love with did not want me as I wanted them. Over the summer after the year ended, I was unable to go home because I was told to stay over the summer in my college city for my internship before they fired me. I was stuck in a place where I felt like I had just lost everything and felt like I had no purpose. It was an extremely lonely summer, I got a job at a restaurant to pay my rent. My only social interaction was with my coworkers who I really like, however, they are 21+ and I could not go out with them as they go to bars. The other interaction was with the person who didn't love me, it hurt to be with them but without them I was completely alone. I thought about not being alive often and sometimes discussed how I was feeling openly with them. The summer slowly passed and there were good moments, but I was still constantly overwhelmed with sadness.

The next school year started again and I began living with my roommate from the previous year. I knew that this would be my last semester here and that I would be transferring to a different school where I could continue an internship. The first couple months were fun, it was the most I ever partied as I didn't do much my first year. I fell behind in one of my classes and let it slip to a fail. I couldn't get myself to care and just tried to have a fun time partying and going out. Towards the end of the semester I realized the importance of the class and had to beg for my life to withdraw. Since around that time, I've stopped going out. I ruined my relationship with my roommate for no reason. I made the person I love hate me (they were not good for me but for some reason just impossible to get over.) I never leave my house, and dread the days I have to go to work. My classes are mostly online and I just do not go to the ones scheduled for in-person (there are no attendance grades). It has been quite a few months like this. My only friend here is in a sorority and has many other friends, and we don't get the chance to hang out alone often. She invites me to group settings but I never go. I facetime my best friend who lives in another country nearly every day for hours, and she's the reason I am good sometimes. We never see each other though and it's so sad because I feel like if we lived together everything would be solved. I am moving to another state far away in just a matter of months to transfer, but I feel like this sadness and laziness and loneliness will never end. I'm excited to move and start again, but am so scared of a new school, as it has a tiny enrollment, about the size of my high school. I leave my house only for work and nothing else. I feel I should say I also smoke weed every day.

I know I need to work on myself and just get shit done and start taking care of my body but I just can't. I never have the motivation. I want to not be here so badly so often and I don't know how to stop feeling like this. I have no friends nearby to spend my time with, I don't want to join groups or go out, I feel a weight on me all the time. How can I stop doing this to myself?"

tkbqyz,1,2022-03-22,There is no girl out there for me and I (23M) have been lately coming to terms with it more and more.,HungryAnswer1776,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tkbqyz/there_is_no_girl_out_there_for_me_and_i_23m_have/,"**Before reading this message, I have to warn you it’s pretty long, but there is a TL;DR you can read if you want the short version.**

I (23M) didn’t grow up in the healthiest environment because my parents were divorced for years. This was due to their mental, emotional, and cultural incompatibility. Nothing really more. The divorce happened when I was 6.

As a result, I was taught two separate things from both sides and didn’t know which parent to trust for the longest time. This was especially true when it came to romance.

To add on to this, ever since I was 8 or 9, I’ve seen my father date other women who I, at the time, didn’t know that they weren’t good for him. This happened until I was 18, which was only a few months before he passed away from cancer.

I had a lack of confidence and self esteem growing up due to my height, ignorance, and a social condition I had to deal with. This wasn’t ideal when it came to dating and many girls brushed me off. The ones who did like me were ones who I didn’t like back at all.

I’ve witnessed many relationships rise and fall in my life. My mother and father, couples at school, my father and women after my mother, my mother’s friend and his former husband, and even a family friend and his wife. I’ve only seen a small handful of relationships stick and it seems to get rarer now.

I’ve become more convinced from my father’s friend that most women outside of my family are out for themselves. They’re either greedy, manipulative, or shallow.

I’ve retained this belief because I’ve seen articles and relationships doomed to fail within my family and on the news about women killing or manipulating their S/Os before either winding up dead themselves, getting away, or getting locked up in jail. I feel like fairy tale happily ever afters just don’t exist. 

However, I know that there are women out there that are good people without a doubt. Unfortunately, I couldn’t form a relationship with any of them due to external circumstances, not being interested in me, or already having a significant other. When one of these three things happen, it tears me up inside.

To elaborate more on external circumstances, it’s either a problem on her end that forces her away, or the fact that we’re in school and probably won’t see each other again after we both graduate, along with long distance perceived as never working out.

On the other end of the spectrum, I’ve met more women who are greedy, manipulative, or just shallow. This was most evident when it came to the women my late father dated. The last one he dated in particular was a manipulative piece of shit.

For a time in college, I seriously considered paying an escort to help me lose my virginity. However, I’ve stopped myself from going further down that route due to the lack of emotion and overwhelming lust coming from those types of women. I also don’t want to risk getting an STD.

I’ve been to strip clubs a few times, but every time I went, it didn’t feel real. It didn’t feel genuine when I asked them to dance with me. It just felt like they had to do it and only cared about money, which took me out of the experience each and every time. It just felt shallow. I currently stop myself from going more often not only because of that, but also because I don’t want to burn a serious hole in my wallet.

I masturbate to porn often to try to compensate for the lack of women in my life, but it feels hollow as well each time I finish.

Let me give you some events that started with the girl being good, only for things to decline and end before a relationship even began.

I remember a girl who seemed into me during my sophomore year in college. We often hung out together, but she left at the end of the semester to take online classes (this was late 2018 pre Covid btw) because she didn’t have the best family either. We still texted every now and then, but I went to Facebook to check her profile one time. As soon as I saw her page, my heart sunk. I saw that she was engaged to another person and stopped contacting her altogether. She never tried to reach out to me and I could only assume that she moved on.

There was also another girl in my senior year that seemed like she was good for me. I tried to talk with her, form a connection, and for a while felt like I had some progress. I was going to ask her out to an event, but she sent me a Snapchat message that my ignorant ass forgot to save. She said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship and wanted us to remain friends. Of course I was torn up, but I respected her decision and wrote back to her playing it off. I cried myself to sleep that night. I remained friends with her until I graduated college.

Finally, there was this girl who was actually the younger sister of one of my mentors for my major. I often saw her at the bars each weekend and she was affectionate with me. I don’t know if it was genuine or if it was just the drinks loosening her up, but I could tell she was cute either way. This culminated at the end of the semester when she took my first kiss outside of a hot dog stand. I could only assume she was drunk that night, but she also flung onto me as well. However, she didn’t want to move forward with me and told me that “there are better girls out there” for me. I took that wording to heart (despite the drinking I had that night), but my dumbass didn’t keep contact with her over the summer. I found out later that she found herself a bf, so I convinced myself to ask her that if there were better girls than her for me, then would the guy she was dating me worse than me? Unfortunately, that time never came, and we lost contact after I graduated.

I also tried more ""creative"" methods than porn to make it feel like the compensation for relationships was getting bigger. For a time, I anonymously entered discord and among us servers to sex roleplay with others. It felt exciting at first, but it still just didn't feel real after some time, so I stopped doing that. I tried going on Onlyfans for a time as well, only for things to just be about all of the women being greedy and wanting my money for discrepancies in their photos or videos, so I left that route too.

Now, ever since I graduated, I’m back home. Working an internship and part time job before going to grad school in the fall. I work out too, but I can never really lose weight effectively as of now. Since I spend most of my days working from home, I’ve mostly given up on love because it’s just really complicated and hard to find a girl who is right for me. Especially since I’ll be moving away again in August. I sometimes feel like I’m doomed to live and die a virgin, and I’ve never had any girl my generation have genuine feelings for me in my life. I worry about finding love in the long run and I don’t know what to do or where to look.

I know you’ll probably say “count your blessings” or “it’s a better time now than later” or “relationships are not all it’s cracked up to be” or ""you'll have more problems in a relationship."" You’re probably right, but a major reason I want to be in a relationship at all is because I want to feel more normal in my life, and having a gf can help with that. I don't care if I marry or break up. Just as long as I can learn something from it or find happiness in it, I'm okay with any relationship outcome. 

I see couples my generation all the time wherever I go, on top of their couples posts on social media. Especially Instagram. I know a good chunk of them are younger than me, and it makes me upset and disheartened. It’s not like I can go anywhere fun with a girl either. For example, my work prevented me from going on a spring break trip last week.

To sum it all up, I have no idea what to do, where to go, who to talk to, or what to believe. I feel like I can’t find love and I feel close to giving up any hope I have left. I don’t want to encounter problems in the relationship, but at the same time, I don’t want to feel lonely either. It’s about finding that speculated gray area, but it feels impossible, and I don’t want to feel like all my efforts are futile. That's why I'm crossing a gray line between retaining hope for a relationship and completely giving up on getting one.

**TL;DR: I have never had a relationship in my life due to the internal and external factors plaguing me. I could never form a decent relationship and had a lack of confidence growing up. I’ve become convinced that most girls are either greedy, manipulative, shallow, taken, or just not interested. I tried to compensate with porn, strip clubs, and anonymous cyber roleplay, but it just never felt real. I’m stuck at home now and plan to move to a new town to pursue grad school, but as of now I’m still single and have been all my fucking life. I feel conflicted on what to think of women, but I still have some doubt left. I want a girlfriend more than anything else in the world, but I don’t want any potential problems with it either. I know though, that that’s impossible. Because of that, I’m close to giving up on finding love. What can I do to physically, mentally, or emotionally help myself about this? I don't want to feel like this forever, but at the same time, I feel like relationships like what I've seen are impossible to obtain, or too problematic to get into. That's why I'm wavering between retaining hope for a relationship and giving up entirely.**"
tkbw2o,1,2022-03-22,Where do you draw the line when it comes to a company you love not treating you fairly?,nifersaynifer_,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tkbw2o/where_do_you_draw_the_line_when_it_comes_to_a/,"TL;DR: I love my company, but I was looked over for a promotion I was all but promised. Now that I am looking at other jobs, I have offers coming in with the opportunity to make $10-$20K more. 

I've worked for the same company for nearly five years and they have always been great to me. It was a new role I took on as a department of one when I first started and have since expanded it by an intern and then hiring on that intern full-time. Over the years, I have added efficiencies and have contributed measurably positive impact to the department and enterprise. 

Without providing an exhaustive list of all the things I'm responsible for, I can say definitively that my role now is drastically different than when I stared. However, in that time I have never received more than a cost of living increase, let alone a proper raise or promotion/title change. 

About a year ago, during my annual evaluation, I expressed that I felt I was qualified for a promotion and offered my justification. My boss (the CEO at the time) agreed, saying that he saw no reason that one year from then (meaning 2021-2022) that I couldn't earn the title of Manager vs. my existing title Coordinator, which didn't really communicate what my true role was. 

Mind you, the entire time I've been there, he and all of leadership describe me as the ""leader"" of the department. ""It's your department."" ""She oversees the department."" This isn't language I have made up. It's something I have lived and was seen and acknowledged. I was told that until the next evaluation, the other employees in my department would report to me in practice but not on paper yet. My boss even had me run their mid-year evaluations, approve time off, etc. 

Fast forward and my boss ends up retiring, becoming a Chairman. Instead of using that transition as a time to promote me, he ends up placing a guy who has never been in my department and has no background in my industry as my supervisor. Mind you, this person's only function is to ""act as a conduit"" between the ownership team and my department/me. 

This person said he would manage my other department team members' evaluations even though I ran the mid-years. And when I asked him about my promotion and why it wasn't happening, he said, ""There are people on the ownership team who feel like you don't send enough emails to them with status updates on projects.""

I was expecting to hear something else, but nope. That was it. I even pushed the issue, asking if I had missed any deadlines, why these ambiguous complaints about my lack of email updates were important enough to prevent me from earning a promotion but not important enough for anyone to address with me in real time? I expressed how it's not fair to hold this against someone without offering them the criticism with opportunity to fix it. 

I rewrote my job description and placed it next to my original, highlighting the areas of measurable impact. I walked through this evaluation paperwork and previous years and highlighted all the good, but then asked how all of that is overshadowed by this vague piece of feedback. 

I was told I need to just work on earning trust of people who ""just don't get what you do."" 

I'm feeling so defeated because up until now I have never had a bad thing to say about my company or my job. But now I almost feel like the blindfold was ripped off and I've been taken advantage of or something. I used it as an opportunity to explore other jobs out there for the first time since I got this job. Turns out my title and pay come no where close to reflecting my value. In two weeks, I've had two job offers and four interviews lined up, all of which have salary ranges $10-$20K more than I make now. They are also fully remote. 

Is it career suicide to do this? Am I better off feeling sort of stifled and disrespected but overall liking the people and my job enough? Or should I take the leap of faith and try to pursue a role where I am recognized and rewarded? I'm just torn. Almost feeling like I am outgrowing a relationship or something. Not that it's BAD, it's just not as good as it used to be. And I'm thinking ""if they wanted to they would"" applies to more than just significant others."
tkbwmv,1,2022-03-22,What difference does having a 2.5 GPA vs having a 4.0 GPA even make?,Acrocane,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/tkbwmv/what_difference_does_having_a_25_gpa_vs_having_a/,"Hello everyone,

I am a 3rd year computer engineering student (I am a semester behind). I currently sit with a **2.43 GPA** and no outstanding qualifications. I am a **joke** in the engineering field and can easily be considered the laughing stock among all engineering intern applicants. I can't even get accepted to intern positions that are vastly eaten up by sophomores and freshmen, like QA or test engineering.

My teacher dad is currently chastising me for not studying for my algorithms and computer organization exams when I already know that even if I got a 100 on both, it would not have made a difference when it came to increasing my chances for employment.

I am **convinced** that regardless of how well my GPA ends up, I will not find successful employment for intern or full-time positions because an **overwhelming** majority of applicants are more qualified. 

So my question is essentially, what difference does it make? Even if I did have a **4.0**, how could this possibly change anything of my current situation whatsoever? As of right now, I am not doing good in my classes mainly because I just don't have a reason to. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I do not like sounding pessimistic and I am **extremely** open to hearing new perspectives and having my mind changed on how I view my future. I look forward to discussing with all of you and hearing your insight. It is awesome that I even get the opportunity to speak with engineers 1-on-1 directly and anonymously.

Edit: I am going to respond to everyone replying here because I genuinely appreciate everyone’s advice."
tkby1p,1,2022-03-22,Salary renegotiations have really made me hate my job,Popular_Shelter9135,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tkby1p/salary_renegotiations_have_really_made_me_hate_my/,"Created a throwaway to make this post because I’m very frustrated. I will try not to make this story too long, but trying to gauge if my anger is warranted and what I should do.

For some background: I am working at my first job out of college (I have had internships and prior work experience in my field, but this is my first full-time job) and I have been working at this company for just over a year and was promoted recently from associate to analyst. This is where everything starts to go downhill. 

So a couple weeks ago my coworkers and I started talking about our salaries because our company had been bread-crumbing us for months with company wide raises because we were recently acquired by a larger company backed by a private equity firm. This had been a long time coming because our company, self-admittedly by our bosses, hr and pretty much everyone, is well below the hiring belt in our area for our industry (leading to us being understaffed and I have been overcapacity my entire time while working here - with no complaints might I add). So I found out that my coworkers with less experience were hired at a higher salary than me (mine being 40,000 and theirs being 43,000) - I was a little upset because I have been working on higher level accounts for a longer time, but I didn’t negotiate so that was on me and I knew I was getting promoted to analyst and the situation would be hopefully rectified then and with my new knowledge I was prepared to negotiate. Fast forward to last week our manager sends out an email saying they are going to be setting up meetings with everyone individually to discuss salary structure change, exciting stuff! Not. My meeting goes well, my boss and I have my review in which he tells me “I’m one of his strongest employees, I have no area of improvements, etc” then I’m told I was promoted to analyst and the pay band for that position is now 50 - 59k and I would be offered 50,000. This is where everything gets sticky because at this point it did not feel like a negotiation, rather I was being told so I say something along the lines of “thank you so much for this opportunity but I was wondering if there would be any room for negotiation as I feel I am an extremely hard working employee and I fear that I will constantly be chasing other employees hired after me with less experience because they were hired at a higher starting salary” after saying this he completely dismisses me and says “well if people have more experience than you then they will be hired at a higher rate” which I obviously understand but that was not what I was talking about, and with a turnover rate of the likes of Amazon maybe they should be more concerned with their current, proven employees happiness. So I asked for 53,000 and he said he would get back to me. The next day comes along and one of my work friend has her meeting (mind you she is the position below me and has significantly less experience than me) and she was offered the same exact amount of money because her starting salary was higher than mine and they did increases solely based on percentages. Now I’m FUMING because this was the exact thing I was worried about, constantly chasing people with less experience than me (and don’t get me wrong I want my friend to make 50,000 because she totally deserves it but I would just also like more money being the position above her because what motivates me to do more if we are being compensated the same, the love of my job? Yeah right). So I call HR very upset &amp; have more back and forth where I essentially tell them hey I know you’re paying the position below me the same amount and when they get promoted to analyst I’m going to be behind them again (just to note I found out other associates salaries too and they were all at or just below mine so my bosses wouldn’t know it was her) (also oh yeah my company does yearly reevaluations). I confront my manager and I told him “honestly I feel very undervalued and quite frankly a little disrespected” which I never stand up for myself and oh it felt so good but maybe not the most professional move but oh well. To which he replied “no I value you so much” and basically blew smoke up my ass which is fine but words only get you so far. The next day my hr rep messages me and has the audacity to say two things that really stuck out to me.

1) “Thank you for bringing to my attention your concern of your updated compensation of $50k, a salary increase of $10k.” Which first annoyed me because everyone admitted that we WELL were under the average for the area and our industry to the raise was necessary and completely dismisses the root of my issue. 

2) “As a reminder on a professional level, we ask that salary discussions be held in confidence between your manager and HR.” And this is the part that really upset me because they would’ve been content with me being undercut and are scolding me for having conversations that I am rightful allowed to have?! 

So they asked me to justify why I am worth 53,000 and so I said actually I think I’m worth closer to 57,000 (the actual average for my position based on location) and listed all of the things that I have done for this company but honestly I’m just so sour at this point and I have another meeting about it tomorrow and I’m honestly at my whits end and a little nervous at what is going to occur."

For those that still do not have an internship, it's still possible. Don't give up.

EDIT: lot of people asking about my background. I’m not comfortable giving too much away since I think I can be identified as there aren’t that many HRT interns

For my prep, I just reviewed my schools OS course. Just know your fundamentals well. Other than that, knowing the details of your data structures and algorithms course and system courses well and practice leetcode.

For my background, I’ve interned at FANG level companies. My grades are decent. My school is decent but not a target, in the top 100"
tki7v9,6,2022-03-22,Do you need a certain degree of “artistic touch” to be a programmer?,BronnOP,AskProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskProgramming/comments/tki7v9/do_you_need_a_certain_degree_of_artistic_touch_to/,"I’m doing a computer science degree, and currently working as an intern as a developer. I get the work done but don’t find I particularly interesting. Nor do I enjoy the “problem solving” part of it. It’s just a hurdle I have to get past so I can get back to doing *anything else* again. 

Other people in the office and at my university get excited when new features or updates are added to a language or IDE… I couldn’t care less. 

People at work or at my university also talk about projects they’re making in their spare time. Other than websites, I have *nothing* I want to build or create through programming in my spare time and even if I do, I know that someone else has already done it better than me so I’ll just use their version instead. 

“Oh but Python is cool, you can automate all that boring stuff!”… Okay, what would I like to automate? Literally nothing comes to mind. 

I’ve used Scala and Java extensively throughout my degree, COBOL throughout my internship and dabbled with Python in my spare time. Throughout all of them I’m counting down the hours until it’s over. It’s been like this for the past 3+ years. 

Is a certain level of “artistic touch” needed to really enjoy programming? I’m pretty convinced it’s just not for me - and that’s fine, but I’m trying to get other more experience opinions, maybe other have been where I am?"

tkigwm,2,2022-03-22,Advice Regarding Learning Programming Over the Summer,jf427,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tkigwm/advice_regarding_learning_programming_over_the/,"I am a senior undergrad studying applied math. I have begun working on a progressive master's degree in applied math and will stay at my university for one more year to earn it. I was not the best student when I began college and it was not until recently that I really began taking school seriously. 

At first, I thought I wanted to get my PhD in math but have recently become more interested in programming. I know (basic) python and some libraries but that is essentially it. I didn't apply to any internships this summer and was originally planning on enrolling in a coding boot camp. However, the more I look at boot camps the more they don't seem worth the price to me.  Would it be foolish of me to just spend the summer really diving deep into python and try to work on some projects? Am I screwed because I don't have an internship? I technically have an internship at a small start-up from my home town but I have interned with them for the past 4 years and most of my responsibilities aren't very technical (and I feel like I am not learning a lot). 

Should I just bite the bullet and pay for a boot camp? Does anyone have any similar experiences? I feel kind of directionless right now and hope that getting more familiar with python will at best give me some direction and at worst give me a new skill. I think I may be interested in software engineering but my understanding of what it actually is is very superficially right now. Obviously, in an ideal world, I would have a better sense of what I wanted to do by now and have some real-world experience but unfortunately I had to spend the first few years of college learning some hard lessons. I am trying to get on track and appreciate any advice I can get. Thanks for your help/feedback"

I was only expecting an internship when I applied, so I was pleasantly surprised when they offered a full-time position. I’m going to be finishing my degree in the next month, which is only an A.A.S, and I’m considering my next steps. I’m considering moving on to my Bachelor’s, but it’s not entirely necessary in my area.

My current position does not pay well at all, so I’m thinking of looking towards better positions. I do love my current position, it’s a small team where I’m the only developer, and they’re all great people. I’d stay as long as I could if it paid a livable wage. With this all said, when I graduate I’ll have been with my current company for 7 months. Should I start applying after I graduate? Or should I wait the extra 5 months to make it a year?

Is there any harm in trying sooner and then trying again at 12 months if it doesn’t work out?

Thanks for your expertise! :)"

I didn't have much programming experience in high school, so I chose not to think about internships until close to the end of my first year.

I notice some people on my class discord servers have linked Github profiles. I just created a Github account today. I'm just learning how it works. Idk what to do in the future like projects.

So far, my programming experience is just python and c++.

The professor did mention smth called Google STEP internship in my first semester. Apparently, it is really competitive, so it's hard to get in. idk if I should try to apply for second year bc i didn't apply last year. idk maybe just for the experience of applying

Another thing is in the second semester, the professor mentioned before that people can be a tutor in the help center for our first semester course. I didn't consider it bc I felt by the end of the first semester, I was confused on how to do some labs. The issue was more like the teacher would never review the homework and only graded the hw at the end of the semester. But he has changed his ways for second semester. So, I feel more confident. Idk maybe in my third semester, I can apply for tutoring for my second semester class.

So..I just checked out Handshake and it's really confusing. Idk what to think about -- my university is kinda in the middle of nowhere. A few hours away, there's the Bay Area and I live there. So, I guess I should think about summer internships. I still haven’t even applied, so I might be too late.

Sorry if I was unclear. I’m just wondering what I should be doing in my year and what pace I should be going at. Like the kinds of milestones"

While I've been in school I've gotten a job as an IT tech where I do anything from networking, software, and hardware related things, I know it isn't related to my field but it was still a tech job, due to financial circumstances I really couldn't afford a low paying internship job pertaining to my field which probably was dumb not to do, but just a lot of things going on at the time. Anyway a couple of my quesitons are:

1) Should I get an internship still or is it too late? Since I want to do something with security what would be a good internship? Also are internships flexible with students? Another reason I haven’t gotten one is the job I’m at is very flexible with me and my classes

2) I would really like to get involved in the security aspect of CS such as cyber security, software security, etc. Where would I start?

3) For coding projects for a resume do they have to be big projects like say a program that decompresses zipped files or can it be a small project like a simple GUI calculator?

4) My GPA is a 2.8 should I not apply to jobs that have a minimum of 3.0 GPA?

5) Is system admin or networking a good start?"

Another thing to take into consideration is that I will be graduating in May and want to try to have a cert by then or close to being ready to take either one. My only worry is that if I go with the Azure Fundamentals, I won't be able to really utilize it because my chances of going into anything cloud out of college are slim rather than getting the security+ and actually being able to leverage it?

since i am majoring in biology, i know that the job market is not very lucrative. i know that many of the better paying jobs will want someone who already has a bit of lab experience, anywhere from 6 months to 2 years. i know that not taking part in any undergraduate research has put me at a disadvantage for this reason. i just feel frustrated that the extracurricular elements of college are not emphasized very much before you get there, and i feel frustrated with myself for being unable to do very much. it seems to take everything in me just to get Bs and Cs in my classes, so i can't imagine doing that on top of several hours of lab research per week. i feel so confused because i can't tell which aspect of college is more important, the material that is making up the foundation of my understanding of biology, or the research opportunities. i used to think the classes and grades were more important, but now i'm not so sure."

The lady started going into specifics on what I did not like about it, and later she said this role has similar responsibilities. I told her about the certain os that our company uses as a cover-up, but she would actually google the os language, and figure out more questions on why specifically I did not like it.  She would later stare at my resume and ask why I did not get an internship, and I told her about the pandemic revoking it. I was very careful when talking to her, but I noticed that she was purposely trying to find flaws in me, and made an effort to try and make myself contradict.  I notice this when I first started talking about the role, and such, she would say is that what you got from talking to the other interviewers on what the role is. 

I was talking and for the hour, I was very careful on how I would respond to questions because I knew if I left an opening she would try to dig in and find a way to challenge me. Did anyone get an interview that for some reason did not like you?"

I am a former student-athlete with little job experience (I worked at a brick warehouse for 2 years from time to time on the side when I could get the chance). I guess I have always sort of leaned towards the petrochemical industry in Houston, Texas and to pursue a career in this field with business. My biggest obstacle as a former student-athlete is the fact that I have no experience (although I would have loved to do that but to keep my scholarship I couldn't possibly maintain practices, workouts, schooling, and then adding an internship on top of that all at once). It also seems like this is the case for alot of athletes after graduating college.

Petrochemical firms in Houston such as Exxon, Pemex, etc all require some form of experience with gas and oil to even look at me for jobs dealing with management, supply chain, or finance. I believe I have all of the qualifications but the work experience. 

Being in the situation I am in and after looking at these non-experienced jobs in the petrochemical industry to give me the experience I would need, it seems like they are paying barely sustainable wages. I would say it is typically $13-$15 dollars an hour and very physically demanding on the body. I never thought I would be subject to this type of work as a person who holds their MBA with no experience. The job requirements are little to none with the highest education required being a high school GED. So it sort of makes me feel like going to college was a waste of time if this is what it takes to utilize my business degree in the oil and gas industry. However, the jobs with experience I really want pay extremely well and alot of people make a great living in this area being employed by these companies. I also see alot of my old friends from college who had the privilege of taking advantage of their internships and getting jobs instantly in the fields of their choice with good pay. I don't know, I guess I just feel super defeated about my whole situation. I loved playing sports my entire life and wouldn't have traded it for the world, but this is dragging me down and making me super stressed about the whole situation I am currently in. This job thing is very new to me and frustrating to say the least :(

What would you do if you were in my situation?

Petrochemical firms in Houston such as Exxon, Pemex, etc all require some form of experience with gas and oil to even look at me for jobs dealing with management, supply chain, or finance. I believe I have all of the qualifications but the work experience. 

Being in the situation I am in and after looking at these non-experienced jobs in the petrochemical industry to give me the experience I would need, it seems like they are paying barely sustainable wages. I would say it is typically $13-$15 dollars an hour and very physically demanding on the body. I never thought I would be subject to this type of work as a person who holds their MBA with no experience. The job requirements are little to none with the highest education required being a high school GED. So it sort of makes me feel like going to college was a waste of time if this is what it takes to utilize my business degree in the oil and gas industry. However, the jobs with experience I really want pay extremely well and alot of people make a great living in this area being employed by these companies. I also see alot of my old friends from college who had the privilege of taking advantage of their internships and getting jobs instantly in the fields of their choice with good pay. I don't know, I guess I just feel super defeated about my whole situation. I loved playing sports my entire life and wouldn't have traded it for the world, but this is dragging me down and making me super stressed about the whole situation I am currently in. This job thing is very new to me and frustrating to say the least :(

What would you do if you were in my situation?

Thank you!"

Found the same HR on LinkedIn, and I need advice on how I should approach this?",BrookieYT,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tkptmx/gave_the_hr_an_outdated_cv_of_mine_which_had_no/,"# Backstory:

My university was having a Virtual Job Fair, where multiple IT companies came to offer jobs/internships. You'd basically just register yourself with a company, and wait for your turn to get an interview. Once your turn came, you had to give the interview on the university PCs. Before the interview, you also had to send your CVs to the company's Whatsapp number. My turn was about to come and I quickly uploaded one of my CVs, without confirming (didn't really have time to confirm tbh). The interview went great and I was 90% certain that I would get an internship role there.

When I reached home, is when I realized that I had actually sent the draft version of my CV. The main difference between my draft version and my finalized version was that my draft version had no contact details at all.

Finding ways to compensate for the mistake I had just made, I had an idea to search the HR that interviewed me. Luckily, I found them and they added me.

# My Game Plan:

Now this is where I need advice from this subreddit.

Since the HR has accepted my request on LinkedIn, I have the ability to get in their dms. I plan on explaining the whole situation and trying to remind them of who I was. Then I am planning to send them my updated CV, while also trying to ask them about the status. Keep in mind, even though I think my interview went great, there is still a chance I might have been rejected.

So can you the people on this subreddit please give me some criticism on my approach and some tips regarding how I should approach the HR via LinkedIn. If you've been in a similar situation as me, or have had experience with DMing HR via LinkedIn, please do also mention that, it will definitely help me and a lot of people. This will mean a lot to me, if someone could help.

It's a four months summer internship kind of thing at a lab at my university (I'm third year undergrad). The PI is super accomplished and I genuinely respect their work in the field. I will be part of the computation group at their lab.

I have been working with the computation group as part of a project course I am taking right now so I kind of know the team already. And I will be continuing beyond the four months of summer until next April, but as a student again as part of another project course. Now, I am trying to make the best impression of myself with the team and the PI so that, when I graduate next year, I wanna keep working here (students like me have previously been employed there after graduation). Are there any tips and suggestions I could keep in mind that could help me create this positive impression? I've never had a real job before and things like professional etiquette, manner and professionalism in general are pretty new to me. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated really, even if it's something really obvious."
tkrfdo,1,2022-03-23,"Dell XPS 13 9360 has a variety of major issues with no fix I could find, please help me it's ruining my life",ees-h,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/tkrfdo/dell_xps_13_9360_has_a_variety_of_major_issues/,"Hi, I have a Dell XPS 13 9360 (i7-8550U, 8GB RAM, Windows 11) I've had for 4.5 years at this point, and after a battery replacement around a year back, I had no issues and everything was perfect, especially considering the age of the computer.

However, in the last couple of months, it's developed some major issues which make it near unusable for my university work, and while I am considering a new laptop, I have to make it past this semester and my summer internship with this device.

The first major issue, which is the biggest one for me, is the trackpad stops working after an hour of use, and can only be fixed by restarting multiple times and uninstalling the I2C HID drivers. When the trackpad stops working, the Device Manager shows no issues whatsoever, and the click mechanism still works. It just does not detect any movement on the trackpad. After a reboot or if the laptop goes to sleep and wakes back up if the issue isn't resolved, it shows a Code 10 error for the I2C HID device in Device Manager. 

This seems to be a common issue for Windows devices, as I found many different complaints about this online and tried every recommended fix. I've cleared the BIOS, reinstalled all relevant drivers, swapped my drivers from Windows Precision to Synaptics, even done the regedit thing, and none of them have made a difference. After using the device for an hour or so, the trackpad WILL stop working no matter what I do, and this is by far the biggest source of my frustration since I'm always restricted to working on a desk with my mouse, which I have to carry around everywhere. Honestly, if I had to choose just one issue to fix and the rest persisting, this would top the list by far.

The second issue is concerning the overall performance of the device. I first noticed this when booting up regedit for the aforementioned trackpad issue, and nothing came up. I tried a few times and gave up and went on with my work, and 5-10 mins later, the regedit windows finally popped up. It's increased now, and my most indicative benchmark is when I play Minecraft- I ran the game at 130fps locked with Lunar Client prior to this and it rarely ever dipped. Now, on the same map and the same settings and basically, everything is identical, yet I don't go above 60fps and mostly have to play at around 30-40; it dips below 30fps very frequently too. 

YouTube videos also take a while to load in spite of my high-speed internet (YouTube stats show 150+ mbps at all times), so I can only imagine this is a performance issue on my device. The videos also have occasional audio glitches. I've checked Task Manager several times and there's never anything draining my resources, and I keep my Windows install pretty clean so there's no bloat or anything either.

There's also an issue with the A key of my keyboard, which I feel might be an unfixable hardware-based issue, nevertheless, I'd like to know if there's a possible fix. The A key fails to respond quite often now, and it's most noticeable while I play games with WASD. It also affects my work a lot, as I make far more typos owing to missing A's in my text. I've popped out the keycap and cleaned it out, with no noticeable effect. Is this just a failing membrane keyboard or something I can fix? 

The speakers have also developed a very noticeable and distracting crackling sound, especially at high volumes. Is this something I can fix by perhaps cleaning out the speaker assembly, or is the only fix replacing the speakers?

I have also noticed my battery life is noticeably worse the last few months, in spite of a battery replacement in April of 2021. I don't know if this is because of Windows 11 or something draining the battery. After my semester ends, I am considering a fresh install of Windows, I just cannot risk it right now in the middle of my submissions, which is why I am posting here. Any and all help would be highly appreciated!

I am a J3 who applied for REP in NTU and the double degree in business management and computer science for NUS and SMU. So far, I have received an offer for SMU since it was an early admissions process. However, for NUS,  I will only receive an offer, if any, this coming month. Hence, I have a few queries on this combination as well as the SOC scholarship. 

For BBM + CS Double Degree (CS as home faculty) :

1. How taxing is this combination? 
2. What is the cut off and how demanding is this combination? (For context, I did achieve 90 rank points.)
3. Any seniors could give tips for studying for this combination? 
4. Is it possible to achieve double honours in 4.5 years? 
5. What are the career prospects and the respective pay range? 
6. Are there overseas opportunities available along with career center support for overseas career options if possible? (I hope to do an internship in university (5-6 if possible, would love more) and then possibly get a job in the company where I did the internship.)
7. Any methods I could use to start preparing if I am offered the combination? (When will I get an offer ,if any, anyways?)
8. Are internships before university useful for this combination? (Say as a programming tutor or something)

Faculty of Computing Scholarship :

1. What are my chances of this scholarship? For some context, I am a PR which is the precise reason why I applied for this. I have 90rp and a raw score of 6 (7 A1s and 1 B3)  for O-levels. My portfolio is average and nothing too outstanding though. (Some research projects, some leadership experiences, some volunteer work and some positions in some organisations for volunteering and student affairs, one magazine I started with my friends as an entrepreneurship experience, some other projects also) 
2. How competitive is this scholarship? 
3. Are there additional benefits other than just the ones stated in the website? (Tuition fee coverage)
4. Will this scholarship cover all the necessary fees for my programme, as well as any overseas opportunities I may wish to undertake? 


Thank you very much!"

I’ve been on the path to computer science when I was little, but throughout my life, many hardships, I often switched on and off about what I wanted to do and where I wanted to go. I graduated high school, of course, currently in school majoring in a major I love (I’m sure you can take a guess), but my GPA is abysmal…it’s a 2.1, to be transparent. 

Now, I know this is bad, so now that I’m a sophomore in college, I’ve started to focus more on using these networking skills I’ve gained from my old theatre days, and it’s taken me very far! I’ve gotten acquainted with new students, new staff and new computing groups that give me many opportunities! I’m even going to my first Hackathon on April 1st and have been studying like mad. 

However, one opportunity that just seems so far out of my own reach is this new ambassador program I’m a part of. It’s for a new company here in Houston (if you’re a part of too, then hello and see you later today!) and I’m very excited for it, but I’m also very cautious. I don’t really compare to the stacked Linkedins of others. I don’t have years worth of coding experience, computer science experience, or internship/volunteering experience. All I have is hustle, a genuine passion to learn and basic Python knowledge. I feel like I’ve gotten here so late and I know that I spent high school enjoying myself and playing around rather than focusing on building my portfolio or resume. Back then I didn’t even know I wanted Computer Science, all I was doing was being a teen, enjoying my time, while it was fun, maybe I should’ve spent some of it focusing on the real world around me, maybe then I wouldn’t feel this way. I didn’t start clicking with my career until Covid, I graduated in 2020 so I had no graduation or anything, just endless time to find a hobby, it made me find my love for the field again. 

Maybe I truly deserve this opportunity because of my hustle, passion and charisma…*ooooorrr* maybe I got in due to pure luck. Hell, maybe I got selected because no one else wanted to…

I’m so new and fresh to this entire thing at sophomore collegiate level, whilst the other applicants who are under me are LOADED with GPAs double mine, and internships/jobs out the wazoo, undergrads with amazing titles and upperclassmen who’ve been working since they could say “up”. 

Overall, I just wanted to semi-vent. I don’t quite feel like I’m deserving of such (an) amazing opportunity (ies) yet at the same time, where I come from, I’m proud to even have the CHANCE to be here. Literally, I’m making people back home proud and yet I can’t feel the same for myself. It’s a terrible combination of combining my self worth to others, and just generally feeling like someone with such a low number as me should make it. (Well, then again, I don’t think GPA is everything either. Deep down, I’ve always been more of a networker, just because I never took my basics serious. I feel like: I came to college to study what I love, not retake high school type classes with college level content. However, I’m still passing my classes this semester, and yes, you guessed it, CS is my highest scoring class, but, overall years combined though? Yeah, my GPA is bummed. I tell myself it doesn’t matter then I realize every opportunity I want is locked behind that little number. Just a label.)

I’ll keep working hard however, just moving forward and pushing up. Gonna start focusing on internships, jobs, experience, and volunteering all right now! I’m going to the first ambassador meeting today, I’ll keep this post updated if anything happens, but thanks for reading, if you did!"
tku94v,4,2022-03-23,Opportunities for International Students In Computer Science at UNSW and in Australia,ZzteeheezZ,unsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/unsw/comments/tku94v/opportunities_for_international_students_in/,"Hello everyone, I’m an international student (currently completing the IBDP) looking to apply to UNSW for the Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and I have a few questions regarding my studies (if I ever make it in) in UNSW specifically and Australia as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I was wondering about the internship opportunities presented here in Australia for international students within the CS field. Would I be at a disadvantage compared to domestic students? Secondly regarding the internship opportunities, I heard that it would be quite hard to work with internships during my studies in University because of UNSW’s trimester and I was wondering if this is true. Can it be worked around (for example prolonging my degree to 4 years and pursuing internship in-between)?

&amp;#x200B;

2.	Adding onto the topic of internships, I was wondering if the university support their students in any way to land their first internship job as I am aware that this is probably the most difficult and is somewhat the most important. I understand that internships are crucial within the field of CS and I really hope to complete at least 1-2 internship periods while pursuing my degree at UNSW. Furthermore, is it easy to land a job as an international student after completing my Bachelors? How is the CS job market in general in Australia?

&amp;#x200B;

3.	Finally, I was wondering if a degree at UNSW is flexible, meaning, would I be able to find jobs or pursue my master’s elsewhere other than Australia in the future if I ever wish too (for eg. In Canada or US). Would the 3-year degree affect much compared to a 4-year degree in let’s say the US or Canada.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that these questions are probably asked quite often but I wanted to be more specific regarding some of my confusions. Thank you for taking your time reading and I would really appreciate it if I could get some more insights regarding completing a CS in Australia."

Essays

(Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)

Personal: worked on this after AP Lit test at end of junior year until October intermittently, used extended metaphor of periaktoi to talk about how theatre helped me adjust in new places as a military child (sides turning and painting my own scenery under the guise of characters). I honestly think it's the best thing I've ever written, really proud of it. 8/10? Idk how subjectively good my writing is lol.

Additional: wrote this for the additional info section bc I'd heard of someone else doing it. Wrote in a week, dry humor/sarcastic tone to talk about how a 7th grade science project (created a lozenge for canker stress that worked!!) made me realize that I wanted to pursue pharmaceutical sciences (and the last sentence referencing that that was Northeastern's draw for me in recruiting). Love this one too, bit more personality and fun. Highly recommend bc they don't do supplements!!


Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)

Acceptances:

Northeastern (ED): Honors!! (30k/yr scholarship)

Additional Information:

Turned down offer from Columbia. Not exact major, didn't have co-op, less school spirit/worse student life overall. Plus I didn't feel like doing all the core curriculum before getting to specific stuff for my major. Best decision I could've made!!

Overall:

Guaranteed acceptance due to being a D1 signee, but I had hope for merit of some kind. Nearly fainted when I saw honors. Genuinely could not have expected that, but so excited to get to campus in fall!! Will update on what they give for NMF :)"

The problem is that most opportunities are either for juniors or seniors and only for the US (but I live in Spain) or are too expensive.

As for now, I know several programming languages at a good level (including Python, C++, Javascript and more). I've learned everything by means of some MOOCS (like two cs50 Harvard courses, 6002 from MIT...).

If someone could suggest me any opportunities or webpages to do my own research I would be really thankful as I'm pretty lost right now."

tkwjiy,2,2022-03-23,Don't be afraid of change,nerd-nihl,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/tkwjiy/dont_be_afraid_of_change/,"I started my career in quality at an American company, I went from intern to technician in a few months due to my performance and willingness to go the extra mile. I was the go to person for minor IT issues since I am familiar with that, as well as excel knowledge.
Everything was seemingly good, there were those days were a lot of work was needed, some weekends, or high pressure moments but I was adamant about moving my way through.
At the beginning the culture was great, my boss actually fought for a raise for me as a technician because she valued me. But then a lot of changes began after moving locations. The leadership changed, and now we had a grumpy old man in charge and I had an inefficient manager on my side.

A year became two, two became three, I saw colleagues receive promotions mostly on the fact that they socialized well with management, I have always been a focused person and didn't use to pay much attention to that aspect.
When the pandemic hit we lost a lot of coworkers either due to leaving or being let go. I was told this was my chance to go for an engineering position as part of a bussiness unit within. I became an 'interim' engineer on the team. Performing all the duties an engineer would do and still providing assistance to clueless managers and coworkers regarding IT.
When I asked for a promotion they told me I needed my degree, when I got my letter of completion they told me they were not able to do it because of the difficult times we were facing, I even offered to get no raise but just the position because I was desperate to be recognized.

I knew what our finances were, I also saw many promotions announced, they had promoted even a friend of mine who would not compare to me in terms of professionalism and expertise and they knew it.

I finally saw the light and started job searching, and found a better paying position, I was afraid at the beginning but I was not able to grow in my current state anymore, gave my notice and left.

Lucky me, this new company was way worse, they had hired me for a position and they wanted me to do a different one. I was willing to make a new contract under the other position but they didn't accept it (my contract stated if I didn't do my position activities I could get fired), I offered to switch positions with the guy that was doing my job (who was hired to do what they wanted me to do) and in a meeting with HR they concluded they would assign me the advertised position. 2 weeks there and I had not received my work station. They decided to fire me.

I had all the evidence, they knew they were to lose if I sued. So they paid me the required reparations (3 months). I took a month off work, bought a personal laptop, went on vacation and job searched again, this time landing my dreamed position as an engineer with a company that I am now very comfortable with, nowhere near the same pressures. From my original place to then, I had pretty much doubled my salary.

Was there a lot of risk in my decision to jump to the unknown? Yes.
Was it worth it? Hell yes. Was I lucky? To a degree, but I knew my value.

Don't be afraid of change. Somewhere out there there is a better place for your skills.

I learned to value myself above all. And this community has given me broader insight on that truth."
tkwn4f,2,2022-03-23,Career Advice after graduation?,Silver_Grand7355,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tkwn4f/career_advice_after_graduation/,"I'm graduating in August with a great degree and have had a hard time looking for jobs. I expected this, but a lot of companies I've talked to have told me they are prioritizing May graduates and have told me to reach out closer to graduation. However, a great company offered me a Co-Op position June-December and I'm feeling a bit lost. I'd have more experience in an industry I'm interested in, along with an extra internship on my resume (I did a summer internship last year), which would help me find a job after the Co-Op. Although it's a great company, it's in a state I have no desire to live in, but I wouldn't be stuck there.

I don't really know what to do, I don't want it to be a stupid decision to take it, because I would technically be graduated for the last 3 months of the internship and it would slow my job search. But I also don't want to be unemployed for 6 months until January and regret that I didn't take this opportunity. If anyone has advice on this, I would greatly appreciate it!!"

What are the implications if I keep a Canadian address to maintain tax residency in Canada so that I can still use my Canadian credit cards and my unsecured line of credit (if needed to supplement living expenses, etc)?

* I will be liquidating my TFSA in Canada before moving to the US
* No spouse/family/dependents in Canada
* No house/car/loans/mortgages
* A PR converting to Canadian citizenship
* No more earning Canadian sources of income while in school
* Asking for OSAP for school fees (\~10k/year)
* Will stop earning money from Canadian sources prior to moving to US - will likely get a tax refund when filing Canadian taxes for 2022
* No money earned in the US for the 2022 tax year (only financial aid loans from the school)"

Option A, SOC Apprenticeship

*Fully remote
*Very Large Enterprise
*Low starting pay, with raises over a year leading up to $20. High likelihood of becoming hired on fully after 6 months to 1 year. 
*People on the interview panel seemed really chill and personable. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Option B, Enterprise Security Admin

*Fully remote

*Contract to hire

*Medium sized Enterprise, doing acquisitions

*Thicc pay, almost 70k a year.

*Lost a lot of senior security people to the hiring craze, they want someone they can train and skill up in ""there own way"". 

*Sounds like there's a big workload, and overtime is likely necessary to get the job done. 




I'm very conflicted on which to chose. The Internship sounds like a safer and more relaxed environment, but the pay is seriously meh. The other job is a real full on security position. Honestly, I'm kinda scared to take the full on security position. I have a lot of basic technology knowledge, several years of support roles, some basic CompTIA certs but I just don't quite feel ready to hop into a serious role. Frankly, I'm surprised they picked me despite my lack of security experience. 

Can anyone share their thoughts with me on their first security job as a noob, and your opinion on my situation? Also, how is working security for those medium sized enterprises, especially since they're doing acquisitions?"

Realistically, what steps should I take to land a CS career? Is additional schooling required? Should I try to do freelance work or land an internship? I am already investing time to get better at Python and I plan on learning more languages.

tl6wv7,2,2022-03-23,At a loss on how to proceed professionally in my career. Should I stay or go?,MemoryDemise,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tl6wv7/at_a_loss_on_how_to_proceed_professionally_in_my/,"Tldr:
Recieved a job offer from a former coworker/mentor who I consider a good friend. Don't know what to do as I feel like accepting it will be a betrayal to my current boss and mentor of 8 years, but not accepting it will lead to me regretting the decision at some point in the future. Help?


I have been with my current company for 8 years. It's the first corporate job I've had. I started as an intern while I was still in college, and was hired full time in a junior position when I graduated. Since then I've been promoted twice and am now at the Senior level and have two direct reports under me. When I first came onboard two people took me under their wings, showed me the ropes and really helped shape me into who I am today. The first person, M, has been my supervisor/boss for all 8 years, I have a really good relationship with them and there's lot of mutual respect and trust. The second person, A, had a similar role to me, and we worked closely together, they taught me a ton about the work environment and really set me up for long term success, we developed a really good friendship.

About 3 years ago, A and M, had a bit of a falling out and A left the company for unrelated reasons, moving into a civil servant job at a government agency. I have remained close friends with A since he left. About four months ago, A got promoted to a management position within the government agency. This left his old position vacant. A reached out to me and encouraged me to apply for the position, saying ""it will be great to work together with you again, and I need someone I know I can count on with your skillset for this position. If you get the job I know you're going to kill it, and I really think you will thrive here.""

So I applied for the position. A recused himself from the interview and selection process due to having prior work experience with me. The only involvement he had was talking to the hiring manager about that past work experience and recommending I be strongly considered for the position as long as the interview was successful.

Over 100 people applied for the position, and were eliminated over the course of two rounds of interviews. I just received the job offer at the start of this week, and I haven't been able to decide at all what I'm going to do.

I make $95k/year now, the new offer matches that. The real differences are the government benefits and pension. Just on the health insurance alone I will be saving over $300/month, then add in the pension which equates to another $9400/year, and a commuting stipend of $250/month.

I took the offer to my current boss, M, and he immediately offered me an extra $10k to stay where I am. He was surprisingly laid back about the whole situation and took it better than I thought. I had another talk with M the next day and he was again very understanding, he even suggested I reply to the offer asking them to increase it since he countered with $10k.

I am completely at a loss for what to do, personal loyalty to both A and M has completely paralyzed me. I know on paper the government position is better. Better financially, better for advancement, better for job security. I can't bring myself to accept it, I feel like I'll be stabbing M in the back. M has always taken care of me, promotions, raises, more responsibility, I've never had to ask for anything while I've worked for him. Yet I also feel that if I don't accept the new job, at some point, I'm going to regret it. My current job with M is government contact work. Our contact is up for renewal every 5 years and needs to be rebid. This means that every 5 years there's a distinct possibility another company will win the contract and I'll be out of a job whether I like it or not. I am under no illusion that M will continue to look out for me if that comes to pass. Meanwhile the new civil servant position has a 1 year probation, after which I essentially cannot be removed.

What would you do if you were in my position?"
tl7n32,2,2022-03-23,"interdisciplinary careers for CS, EE, &amp; Math?",andrhaas,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tl7n32/interdisciplinary_careers_for_cs_ee_math/,"I graduated last year with two degrees: BS Comp Sci with Minor in Electrical Engineering, BS in Mathematics

I am currently working in CyberSec, but given my skills, I feel like I may have taken a pay cut to… for lack of a better phrase, spend most of my time paper pushing.

I focused a lot on compilers, parsers, foundations of languages, etc. so I have experience with the following languages:

- C, C++
- Java
- Python
- OCaml, Scala
- Prolog
- Scheme, Haskell, Ratchet

I know the basics of web programming, HTML, CSS, &amp; Javascript, but I’m not good at it and I’m far from knowing full stack. I have nearly 0 networking or cloud knowledge or experience. I have decent experience with SQL and database design.

With my EE minor I learned MATLAB, Verilog, VHDL, SystemVerilog. I focused on cryptographic algorithms and ASIC / FPGA programming &amp; did an internship on this as well.

My math degree was pretty typical, but my senior year I focused on statistics and learned data science with R. 

I am wondering if anyone has any recommendations on job titles or fields I could look into that would still allow me to use my technical skills but is more interdisciplinary than just software dev, and most importantly would give me a pay raise for the skills I have. I’m not opposed to getting a masters if that would help but I would definitely like to specialize towards something that pays better and that im more interested in."
tl9bds,1,2022-03-23,"Got My Dream Job, But My Current Temp Client is Trying to Hire Me ASAP",loc8thethrowaway,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tl9bds/got_my_dream_job_but_my_current_temp_client_is/,"I’m a law school graduate with an employment law background. I did well in school and had good internships, but after graduation, I went through the absolute hell that is job searching. I couldn’t get any legal work full time that would even let me pay my minimum private student loan payments each month. At the end of last year, I was able to get temp work that would pay my private student loan payments, but nothing else. The work was mainly unrelated data entry and was paying almost what is minimum wage in some states though, so my hours were kind of crazy. As disheartening as it was to get into six figure debt and seven years of post-grad school just to not even make what my high school classmates who didn’t go to college do (along with not have their financial ability to get married, have kids, buy assets, etc.), I kept it pushing and kept applying while studying for the bar and working overtime. 

Recently, I got an HR assistant temp job through an agency, which is a job that is much more related to what I want (employment law) and pays almost double. However, by an amazing stroke of luck, I also got a conditional offer at a JD advantage law job offering double the HR assistant job. The new job needs me to pass a security clearance (public trust). I’m confident that I will pass the clearance as I have never even gone so much as a parking ticket in my life and it’s a very low security background check. However this clearance will take at least 3 to 4 weeks. At the same time, my current temporary employer keeps dropping hints and pushing for me to start and there’s certain things I cannot do efficiently at my job without having access to certain databases that I can apparently only access if I’m a full-time employee (complete bullshit). I’m trying to wait out the remaining 2-3 weeks for my security clearance, but it’s becoming more and more clear that this current job wants to hire me ASAP. I know that they’re only going to pay me slightly more than what I’m already making as a temp for them. More importantly, this job has room for serious professional growth, but it is not ultimately what I would like to do with my life, unlike what I told them during my interview (I really just needed a basic job and HR just made sense for me).

The most important thing to me is keeping a job that will pay for my student loans at all times. I want to tell my current job that I do not plan to stay there, but I’m afraid that I’ll be out of a job if I tell them the truth. On the other hand, I do not feel right letting them spend the thousands of dollars it will cost to buy me out from my temp agency, just for me to quit less than a month later, nor do I want to have that conversation with my boss, especially since this was the job that saved me from the zero-quality-of-life job I had before. This current job pays my bills and gives me a very small, but livable amount of pocket money for the month. 

However, as someone in their HR department, I see that they did lay people off and did pay cuts during pandemic, and they never reinstated their original salaries, despite the company making more revenue than ever. The job I plan to take has the most amazing benefits, is basically recession-proof, and is a dream law job for me, which is why I’m also dead-set on leaving for the new job. But how do I play this with my current job? I’m getting more and more pressure to take my current job permanently as quickly as possible (even though I was told I needed 3 months as a temp there to get hired, which would have worked out well for me). 

How do I keep my current job while keeping them off my back about switching until my start date (I need every week of pay I can get from the current  job)?"

# Background

I am a diagnosed ADHD (biggest issue: slow clerical processing) and bipolar student, set to graduate and receive my bachelor's in statistics next year. I am looking to go to grad school to study the theoretical side of artificial intelligence/deep learning. In August 2021, I transferred to a new university from one I was not learning anything at, with a 3.73/4 GPA. When transferring, my GPA reset. In my first semester at the new university, I bombed all my first midterms, failed a course, and walked out with a 2.7/4 GPA and a 2.4/4 within my major. I am ranked 51 of 55 within my major.

Current medications: Zoloft 50mg and Lamictal 200mg

# Problem

*TL;DR:*

* *I need to go to a good grad school to study AI, but those programs are competitive and require excellent academic performance. I want to avoid working two years before applying to grad school to maintain momentum.*
* *My exam grades are terrible despite spending all day studying. Even when I don't spend all day and give myself breaks, I can't complete my work on time or at all.*
* *I perform highly in personal and career endeavors, despite not spending nearly as much time on those as academic pursuits.*
* *I can't make or maintain friendships. I come off as unreliable and forgetful. My speech runs and is sometimes pressured, which repulses people.*
* *I have to work a lot during school to clean up $8500 of credit card debt from manic spending that occurred before receiving bipolar diagnosis. Because I take so long to study for my courses, I don't as much time to work as I'd need, or vice-versa.*
* *I can't focus on hobbies or personal interests without making everything else suffer.*
* *ADHD seems to be the root cause of all the above. Afaik the only effective way to treat ADHD is with medication, which makes bipolar worse. I have two and a half semesters to keep my grades up before I am responsible for paying for education entirely. However, treating bipolar can take years. I need ADHD medication to alleviate these bottlenecks.*

In order to study theoretical AI, I have to go to grad school. I want to make my investment in grad school worth it, thus I want to study in a good program. However, as you'd expect, a good program is competitive and requires good marks, which is where my bottleneck is.

I got a linear algebra midterm back today. Linear algebra is the basis (pun not intended for those who understand) of artificial intelligence, so I spend as much time as I need to understand the material thoroughly. I enjoy the course and the professor is the best I've had. For this exam, I studied hours upon hours and abandoned assignments from other courses. My grade came back as a 57%.

In all my courses, my homework and quizzes have high grades. Yet, my exam performance lacks. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong for that to be a consistent problem. Half the time, I don't see the light of day because I spend my whole day studying. Yet, everyone I see has time to have a personal life, enjoy themselves, and still perform well. Even when I decide to take breaks, nothing changes-- I just don't finish my assignments on time, or at all.

I really want to avoid working two years before going to grad school, since I want to keep momentum and get school out of the way ASAP. Once I start working, I won't want to pause to go back to school.

Yet, outside of academia, I seem to perform highly. I have a huge portfolio of data science projects I've done on my own time. I am consistently praised for my creative projects. I have an internship at Tesla this summer that came to me effortlessly. There's no imbalance of time between career and academia, though. I spend far more time on academia than career-related and personal projects.

My social life is also suffering. I lost one of my best friends because I was unreliable (consistently forgetting things) and unable to plan ahead. My speech often runs and is sometimes pressured, which repulses people away.

My financial life suffered mainly from a year of manic spending, to the tune of $8500 in credit card debt. By the way, I fraudulently reported my income to get higher credit lines during that time. Now, that spending has stopped since I've dramatically improved, and I am recovering. But I have to work a lot to pay my bills. I can't keep track of all this at once.

I am terrible at making it to places on time. I struggle calculating the time it takes to get ready and out the door, then the time it takes to walk places.

I can't spend time on personal interests without making everything else suffer. I'm a big car guy and like modding my car and working on it (yes I'm one of those douchebags with a loud subaru), which is obviously a time expensive interest. I make music, which is another rabbit hole. I like playing video games. I like going to concerts, which I end up losing any motivation to do anything the day of, since I'm so excited to go. All rabbit holes.

From all the research I've done, the only way to improve ADHD is to treat it with medication. And I can't treat it with medication until my bipolar is under control, which could take years.

# What I've tried

*TL;DR: A lot, tbh. I can't summarize it any more than I have below.*

**Physiology/Psychology**

* Medications to treat OCD and bipolar
* DBT for bipolar
* ERP for OCD
* CBT for anxiety/panic disorder

**Academic**

* Exam accommodations through the university: 1.5x test time and sometimes isolated testing space
* Using whiteboards/glassboards for coursework
* Taking breaks from studying
* Using Excel to note details of all the grad school programs I'm looking at

**Personal/Financial**

* Cramming studies/work before and after a personal day, so I can focus on only personal stuff on that personal day
* Using Excel and Python to line up my debts, needs, wants, and incomes over the next 6 months, to calculate my net income on a week-to-week or month-to-month basis
* Using Envel (a digital bank) to keep track of expenses and auto-budget. Rip Simple bank.

**Scheduling**

* Taking the time to work concepts out when studying
* Asking professors questions during lectures
* Setting all my devices (laptop, phone, and watch) 15 minutes ahead to help with punctuality

**Task Management**

* Keeping track of all assignments, personal tasks, chores, and scheduling using TickTick (lets you set a time for tasks, like they're an event on the calendar). Previously used Moleskine Actions and Timepage.
* Adding tasks to TickTick as soon as I think of them during the day, so I don't forget an idea I had

**Productivity/Focus**

* Turning my phone off for a day every now and then, using iPhone's scheduled summary and a do not disturb mode I made for studying
* Putting all important and relevant tools/apps, and nothing else, on the first page of my phone's home screen
* Using a designated indoor space for work and studying, or sitting outside
* Apple Watch to keep track of calendar events so I don't have to check my phone
* Listening to instrumental music while studying

I don't know where to start, considering everything I've already done. I feel like I've run out of options, and want to give up on school (and hence my academic goals). If the things that make me happy make my future goals and responsibilities suffer, is it even possible to be happy and achieve the goals I want to achieve? **What can I do to stop this stupid ADHD wiring from disrupting my life so much without causing...another disruption?**"
tldi65,2,2022-03-23,My team lead is giving me way less work - Should I be asking for more work or looking for another job?,Parapurp,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/tldi65/my_team_lead_is_giving_me_way_less_work_should_i/,"
I have been at my job for about 8 months - first job from college. I am increasingly floundering and struggling and it just seems to be getting worse. My performance, mental and physical health continue to deteriorate. 
I want to say that I had taken a few computer science courses during college. Throughout college, I learned I kind of suck at coding and my brain genuinely struggles to think in such a perfectly sequential way, or I think in too much of a nuanced way with too many details. I struggled and it affected my mental health, so I ended up not majoring in CS. I decided to pursue UI design when graduating college but I had a lot of work to do on my portfolio, so I took the offer I did get, which is the job I currently have. I am still trying to become a UI designer for now.
When I started this job, I knew virtually nothing about software - nothing about architecture, coding standards, mostly just a bit about web dev, mainly html and sql on the back end from a previous internship. I’ve been working exclusively remotely also.
(FYI because it’s relevant: my project uses an agile workflow, with 3 weeks for a sprint in which tasks (stories) should be completed. When assigning tasks to an employee, they estimate how long it would take by the number of work days (called story points). Each person should get about 12 story points in a sprint).
After a few months of working on one side of the project, I got switched to the UI development side because that’s what I was interested in (I want to transition into UX). Long story short, the lead of that sub-team ended up saying that the time he had to spend guiding/ mentoring me was cutting into his own time to finish his work. I did my best to google and look online and reached out to get help from people on other sub teams. But somehow it just wasn’t enough. I was taking longer to finish the tasks than expected because I was learning as I was going. So the supervising project leads put me on my current team, because the lead of that sub team has more time to provide guidance. 
The first 3 week sprint, I was only given one task to get familiar with that code base, that would take an estimated 5 days. I finished it in about 8.
For this sprint, my sub team lead gave me two documentation tasks that are estimated to take 4 days. He said he has another task for me (est 5 days) if I finish them. I asked to look at it, and saw that it was for coding so I asked him to assign it to me now. He asked “do you think you’ll be able to finish everything in time? It’s best to undercommit and over-deliver.’ I still insisted. My reasoning was that since I suck at coding I should tackle the coding tasks first and dedicate most of my time to that, get feedback etc. 
But I am not sure. So to people with more work experience (or just anyone who is not as dumb as I am):

Was undercommitting the better thing to do? 

Do I need to be looking for another job? I’ve been moved around multiple times, and clearly my ability to provide value to the team in a timely manner is clearly being questioned. Frankly, I’m not confident at work knowing they don’t know what tasks to give me because I might not finish in time. I also feel as though it’s been confirmed over and over again that anything involving coding is a bad fit for me and I am tired of feeling an incompetent clown all the time - this seems to be the one thing that no matter how hard I try, I still can’t do it."
tldqx5,2,2022-03-23,How to handle sharing a room with another person when dealing with overstimulation and ADHD?,GIBBEEYH,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tldqx5/how_to_handle_sharing_a_room_with_another_person/,"Recently I accepted an internship that provides free housing to interns. However, one of the reasons I accepted the internship was that I was told we would not have a roommate due to covid restrictions. Today I received a call saying that there is now a possibility that I will be sharing a room with another person due to a lack of space. I politely said that I understood and to let me know what they decide. 

While I really need this internship and it’s a big opportunity, I’m beginning to have second thoughts because of the roommate situation. I already struggle with insomnia and overstimulation thanks to my anxiety disorder and ADHD, so I’m afraid that sharing a room with someone for months will end up making the experience torturous. I’m just terrified that without having a quiet room to myself I will never be able to relax or sleep. Even throughout college, I have never had to share a room with another person. Simply sharing an apartment/dorm with another person in a separate room was enough to overstimulate me and keep me up many nights. 

I guess I’m asking for any advice you have at all. I’m afraid bringing up this issue with HR will simply result in eye rolls or me appearing to be ‘spoiled’ or ‘unreasonable’, therefore tainting my image with the company. I know nothing about asking for reasonable accommodations in the workplace concerning disabilities and what it entails, or if it even applies to internships or this specific situation. I also feel like regardless if I explain my situation or not I am going to be stuck with a roommate. I don’t know if I can really afford to pass up this opportunity if that happens, so any advice with sharing a room with another person would be greatly appreciated. I know ground rules will have to be laid out, but that alone gives me an enormous amount of anxiety since I fear coming across as bitchy or demanding. I just want a quiet space to come home to unwind and sleep without being sent into a panic attack from being overstimulated 24/7. 

Thanks in advance for any/all advice."
tlek9s,1,2022-03-23,Will a CS minor paired with an engineering degree qualify me for CS jobs?,sesame-player,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tlek9s/will_a_cs_minor_paired_with_an_engineering_degree/,"I'll be entering university this fall and I'm very interested in pursuing a major in engineering (likely the electrical or computer branch) but I also have a lot of interest in computer science. I've completed many projects at varying levels of difficulty and also worked on an internship (primarily web development). 

Looking ahead of my undergrad years when I'm searching for a job, if I want to work in the CS field for jobs such software development, would a minor in CS be sufficient? 

More importantly, for the internships and research I work on during my undergrad, if it is not oriented toward the CS minor and instead my engineering major, am I at a disadvantage? If so, should I approach opportunities that have a CS aspect?

Finally, I've looked at job requirements for CS positions at several large companies that I would really like to work at (FAANG and some others) that accept engineering graduates. I'm wondering how common this career path is and how companies view these types of applicants (if it is any different from the typical CS grads)."
tlgmas,1,2022-03-23,Should I withdraw my Amazon Internship Application?,Wolfpanion,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tlgmas/should_i_withdraw_my_amazon_internship_application/,"A little background. I'm a second year CS student, and last week I applied for a software development internship at Amazon. In my mind I thought for some reason that I'll have the time to prepare, but after 2 days I get an email for the OA test that needs to be completed in 5 days.  

I am just beginning the process of preparing for technical interviews and I don't feel ready for the coding assessment either, and am also starting another busy semeseter... anyway it seems i've applied too early.

My question is - what do you think would be the best way to approach this? I don't feel good about taking the OA now and killing this oppurtunity. On the other hand, I can ask for an extention, but i'm not sure how much time they would give me. An addition 5 days for example, won't be enough because I've just started another semester. 

Is it possible to withdraw the application and reapply later? Is it possible to apply as a third year student, or later this year? And if I take the test and fail or something, reapplying is possible at some point? I'd love for some clarifications if anyone knows."

Had an interview for an internship, asked me 7 technical questions. Questions were mostly circuit diagrams (op-amps, transistor etc.)

Two questions truly stumped me… first one was asking how fast a capacitor charged and I completely blanked. Second circuit had a relay which I have never worked with. I pretty much had to say “I don’t know” (I didn’t actually say that). Explained as much as I could but wasn’t going to talk out of my ass

For those who have had technical interviews how did it go? Were there questions you didn’t know and still got the job?"

I really don't know anything and would like some advice.

Here's my current situation: I have a full time offer at company A that I definitely want to take, and a part time summer internship offer at company B.

I can either start at company A in June and forgo the summer internship or I can do the internship and start at company A in September.

Company A is strongly incentivizing me to start in June because it would allow them time to evaluate my performance and offer potential end of the year bonuses, and it would give me more of a jump start in my career at company A.

Personally, I don't really care about pay and career growth right now and I just want to do a good job wherever I work.

Currently, I have zero working experience. I feel like working at company B first will give me more experience and will also better prepare me for a full time role.

How important is different experiences vs a jump start in a career at one company?"

So I am currently a graduate intern right now while getting a masters in Economics. I live in the US. I just recently made it to the final round of interviews for a very good position that would look amazing on my resume. It’s not my dream job but it would help my career greatly. 

However, I recently received news that my grandmother is very sick back home overseas. Because of this, I have been planning to go over to visit and spend some time with her and my family as well take care of some legal matters related to the situation around June or July.

The issue is, is that the job I am interviewing with asked if I can start in May. Due to current work and school obligations, I would only be able to go back home in June or July.

Given the scenario I am offered a position, how should I go about asking for a later start date? Should I wait for the offer and then start negotiations regarding the start date or bring it up in my final interview if asked about the start date. Is the pushback too long?Should I ask instead if I can take time off around the dates I planned to go?

I am so conflicted because it would be an amazing job to get but I have to put family first. I have not been back home since 2018 and once I start working full time it will be extremely difficult to travel again. Any advice would help greatly appreciated."

Thanks for reading and chiming in on this. Sorry in advance for the length! Also on mobile so, apologies for the formatting. I’m looking for some advice in pivoting to a meaningful and impactful career. 

INTRO
Have some experience in several different industries (see below) but have consistently found myself frustrated that the systems I’ve worked in seem unable to provide actual socioeconomic empowering change due to a number of issues. IE
- worked in Education to see if I wanted to get a masters and become a teacher/admin. I saw that nearly everyone is overworked and underpaid, and the quality of education received really depended on the students home environment not the schools influence, at least in the primary years. 
- Worked in community mental health for a very well funded entity. Though the higher-ups never admitted it, it appeared that having people caught in the cycle of poverty and mental health struggles equalled funding security and so empowering clients to actually find stability wasn’t the ultimate goal.
- Worked in religious based community work but was turned off to it as I felt like mixing faith and assistance is not genuine. Though I did appreciate the freedom in this role.
- IT has been a nice emotional break from the taxing roles but it’s too far removed from people for me. I enjoy that I keep things running but I really miss building relationships with people. 

CORE AIM
I have a strong desire to bring meaningful change to the systems that empower upward mobility on the socioeconomic latter. This includes stable housing, access to mental health services, quality education, access to healthcare etc. It’s no secret that the systems in the US for achieving these are fundamental flawed. I’m trying to not be a pie-in-the sky dreamer, I know whatever I do will take back-breaking work but am I naïve to think I can bring change to any of these areas? 

METHODS FOR ACHIEVING THE GOAL
- Masters in social work (I had previously ruled out this out as most social workers I’ve met are working in the broken systems and thus confined by them. But I’m reconsidering it as a place to start and pivot again into something else such as politics as the nature of social work is really where my heart lies) OR
- Master in data analytics (Data analytics seems like it would put me back at a desk by my self like my current role, where I’m bored out of my mind but it does help solve problems) OR
- Masters in public policy or public administration 
- Local/state politics
- Working for a non-profit in housing/policy change/mental health
??

ABOUT me
- Mid-20sM. US citizen. I learn quite quickly which means I get bored quickly too. Few roles have kept me on my toes past 6 months. I crave variety, find fulfillment in personally relationships, and love researching and solving problems. Debt free. 15k savings. 60k salary currently. 

Education 
- BS in Business Administration. Majored in new venture creation and process of innovation. Buzzwordy major that I opted for due to needing an online program while living outside the US.

Experience 
- Community Case Worker for religious org (2 years in Australia)
- Intern Project Director for non-profit focused on personal wellness (8mon in Australia)
- Carpenters Assistant to put myself through most of college (3 years) 
- Clinical Associate in community mental health, specifically homeless (1 year) 
- Behavior Specialist in Elementary Ed (6 months) 
- IT System Administrator (1 year, CURRENT)

CONCLUSION
I know this is long and somewhat complex but can you offer any advice on what I might pursue? Also I know I have not mentioned finances in this to make it slightly less long but I don’t find it wise to put myself in poverty in an attempt to fix it. This said, impact &gt; wealth. 

TL;DR 
Tried lots of industries. Frustrated that systems are broken and don’t actually help. Seeking ideas for actual positions of change in the US and how to get into them."

- Mid-20sM. US citizen. I learn quite quickly which means I get bored quickly too. Few roles have kept me on my toes past 6 months. I crave variety, find fulfillment in personally relationships, and love researching and solving problems. Debt free. 15k savings. 60k salary currently. 

Education 
- BS in Business Administration. Majored in new venture creation and process of innovation. Buzzwordy major that I opted for due to needing an online program while living outside the US.

Experience 
- Community Case Worker for religious org (2 years in Australia)
- Intern Project Director for non-profit focused on personal wellness (8mon in Australia)
- Carpenters Assistant to put myself through most of college (3 years) 
- Clinical Associate in community mental health, specifically homeless (1 year) 
- Behavior Specialist in Elementary Ed (6 months) 
- IT System Administrator (1 year, CURRENT)

CONCLUSION
I know this is long and somewhat complex but can you offer any advice on what I might pursue? Also I know I have not mentioned finances in this to make it slightly less long but I don’t find it wise to put myself in poverty in an attempt to fix it. This said, impact &gt; wealth. 

TL;DR 
Tried lots of industries. Frustrated that systems are broken and don’t actually help. Seeking ideas for actual positions of change in the US and how to get into them."
tlmf3m,2,2022-03-23,Received a good new great offer but feel like I could do better,samuraiscramble,cscareerquestionsCAD,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsCAD/comments/tlmf3m/received_a_good_new_great_offer_but_feel_like_i/,"Hi everyone,

So I've been interviewing for a few months now and just received a new grad offer for low 100's at a small company in GTA, with a start date 6+ months out. This is an incredible amount of money, especially for a new grad, but at the same time I feel I could do better.

For context, I'm a CS major with 5 internships + part time experience. My current internship pays the same amount for interns as this place does for full timers. I'd like to try for a return offer, but there are no guarantees.

One side of me wants to reject this offer and grind the hell out of LC to go for FAANG/unicorn/etc for mid 100's TC. Another side sees that this amount of money is already incredible and job hunting is a pain in the ass.

I seriously don't know what to do. I'm not asking for my decision to be made for me - but I just want to know the pros and cons of going either route.

Thanks :)

tlphme,4,2022-03-23,I hate exercise and I hate how it's necessary for weight loss,lexi_the_leo,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/tlphme/i_hate_exercise_and_i_hate_how_its_necessary_for/,"Don't want advice, don't want to hear what I'm doing wrong, I'm literally just here to rant. 

I'm 5'6"" at 180lbs. I want to get to 140lbs. I'm not going to meet my goal weight at my goal date in May. Simply not gonna happen. 

I cut sodas, coffee (and creamer), and drastically dropped how much fast food I ate. I started drinking almost solely water. I cook/eat lean meats and veggies with minimal butter/oil/fat. I even made smaller portions for myself and let me feel 70% full for most meals. I realized I needed something in the mornings so I wouldn't pass out at internships (hooray for iron deficiency!), so I got the Carnation instant breakfast things. I take a multivitamin daily. But no, nutrition isn't enough to lose weight. 

Exercise fucking hurts. I know it's because I'm wickedly out of shape. I get that. But when it hurts to much to even bench press 10 fucking pounds, it doesn't feel worth it. I've been sore for days. I've taken Advil, Tylenol, even a combination of both. I stayed hydrated and I took Epsom salt baths afterwards. I did warm ups and cool downs and stretches. I am too goddamn sore to lift my arms over my head to put a shirt on. I feel like my legs are going to buckle every time I step. 

Not to mention the fact that my lungs hate it too. ""Oh, you need more oxygen? How about we constrict ourselves and force you into an asthma attack instead!"" Yeah, thanks a fucking lot, body. 

A giant part of me wants to throw my hands in the air and accept that I'm not going to lose weight. But when I am restraining a large dog on the floor and I lose the circulation past my knees because there's too much weight on my legs, it reminds me of the fact that it's not sustainable to be at this weight. My future career will be impacted negatively if I don't lose some of this. And I think about the guy at the gun store who said I appeared pregnant a little bit too often. 

Fuck you, body."

tlucn4,1,2022-03-23,Advice for Decision Regret,JosephKavalier,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tlucn4/advice_for_decision_regret/,"Hi, I'd appreciate if anyone had advice to share for this situation as I'm having a tough time handling it.

I was very fortunate to receive summer internship offers from two different companies; I enjoyed getting to know both teams but I felt I clicked with one team better than the other.

The roles were quite different too, one was a technical role more related to my degree and the other was a non-technical privacy analyst role. I'm very interested in both, but neither were able to be moved off-season so I had to choose.

I chose the role that was more related to my degree; I spoke to a few people about it and the gist of what they said was that this role was in higher demand, there would likely be more related jobs available in the future, etc. I'm a junior in undergrad hoping to convert whatever I do this summer to a full-time job, so these reasons were convincing enough that I chose that role.

However, I'm having a really hard time moving on from the role I rejected. I've never had the opportunity to explore the tech privacy space or a non-technical role before, and to be honest I've never been at the top of my class so I thought I might even be better suited for that role. I really liked that team and based on their feedback they seemed to really like me too.

I'm tired of getting bummed out whenever I think about this situation, and I really want to get excited about the role that I DID commit to. I believe ""regret"" or ""remorse"", not really sure what to call it, is holding me back from being invested in the company I DID commit to for this summer. I really don't want to half-ass my job this summer; I want to get to know my team, I want to learn a lot, and I want to commit 100% of myself to this.

I'd really appreciate any advice at all from how to shift my mindset. I know I was in a privileged position to have even had to make this choice and I know that ultimately the decision was mine and I'm not trying to shy away from responsibility for my actions. I'd like to move on from this dilemma and have my eyes on the future instead of the past."
tluf2j,19,2022-03-23,Glassdoor vs. Nike vs. Walmart,arham4,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tluf2j/glassdoor_vs_nike_vs_walmart/,"Glassdoor: $40/hr, 12 weeks (adds to be total $19,200), fully remote, tech company, my friend works here and enjoys a great work life balance, Java backend

Nike: $18,000 for 9 weeks, $4,500 for relocation to Portland, Oregon, not really a ""tech company,"" Node.JS backend

This works out to be $50/hr, or $62.5/hr if you include the relocation.

Walmart: $14,000 for 10 weeks, fully furnished apartment + transport shuttle, located in Sunnyville, CA, not really a ""tech company,"" Java backend

This works out to be $35/hr.

My considerations: 
1) the return offer of each company and how it will help me in the future (my opinion: Glassdoor &gt; Nike &gt; Walmart)
2) how the company looks on a resume (my opinion: Glassdoor &gt; Walmart &gt; Nike)
3) ideally I want to move out for a little from my city with my first job after an internship and Nike allows me to be inclined to do so, however Glassdoor being remote means I can still do so. But I think I would be less inclined (my opinion: Nike &gt; Glassdoor &gt; Walmart (Walmart has an office in my city))

**Important note: Due to time constraints, I had to accept the Nike offer.** This means I have to burn the bridge possibly with Nike for the future if I do accept either Walmart or Glassdoor. It sucks because Nike was amazingly kind and personally geared to the individual they are hiring throughout the entire process.

Thank you for the help everyone. :)

I started as an analyst role at a major bank soon after, where I also did an internship. Have been working there for 9 months now but don’t like my role, work life balance, and definitely not my compensation. My friend works at a large firm in a nearby major city and loves his job. He sent me a referral and I applied. Long story short I’m about to have my final interview for an associate role that pays 35-45% more than my current role. On top of that I’ve heard the work life balance is great and the role sounds way more interesting to me.


I know not to count my eggs before they hatch, but I do want to be prepared should I get an offer.

Having said that, I have accumulated nearly 20 days of PTO at my current role that I will not have used at this point. Company policy only pays 5 days if you leave. 


Would it be a bad idea to ask about pushing my start date back 2 months so I can use this time off if I get an offer? Should I reconsider leaving my current role in general considering its been only 9 months since I’ve started? Didn’t expect to get this far so soon and am questioning a lot so just wanted some advice if anyone has had a similar experience.


Appreciate any input"

I'm a Student pursuing masters in Data Science and Analytics in Ireland. I've had work experience in Computer Networks for 3 years and I joined the course to change my field. I'm really enjoying the modules but I lack a little bit of programming skills and haven't built on many projects. Since it's a one year course, I've not been able to do justice to the modules. 

I wish to learn and apply for summer internships and get into Data science as statistics and machine learning algorithms truly motivate me to do more. I understand why we do the various processes in data science n machine learning fundamentals clearly. I'm good at Statistics and can manage programming. Since the time is limited, I've not been able to develop any hobby project.

Could someone advice me on the below questions:

1) Could you please me some share some advice on what jobs I should be looking onto? 
2) Can I get into Intern positions without prior experience? What do recruiters mainly look in freshers resumes?
3) How is the market in Ireland for fresher Data analyst or scientists?

- Any other advice on career is welcome.

-thanks in advance"

This post is mainly for current juniors looking to apply to Northeastern next year, those that received a waitlist from Northeastern and wondering if it's better than their top choice, and lastly those that received offers and are wondering to commit. Or anyone else can feel free to read this post as well I'm not gonna stop you. Here are the things that I wish I knew before coming to this college. 

1. Starting off with something this subreddit obsesses over, Northeastern gaming the rankings. To this I say who cares. Northeastern has turned itself from a commuter school to an amazing institution, educating young minds and changing their lives for the better, placing students in terrific jobs. The companies I'm going to be co-oping with pay 150k+ for entry level full time, I strongly believe I would not have been able to do so at any other university. If anything I think Northeastern is at a lower rank than it should be but I could not give less of a fuck about what people care about this university and neither should you. Northeastern's a top college and you will likely graduate with your dream position, that's all you need to know. 
2. A lack of traditional college experience. When I enrolled into Northeastern I fully knew this fact but believed that it wouldn't affect me for I wasn't really the party/socializing type to begin with. Seeing high school friends go to parties at their colleges low-key made me regret choosing Northeastern but I found my way through the social culture and now know some pretty great people. Unfortunately even though I'm a Junior this will be my last semester at Northeastern as from May - December I'll be interning at two out of state cities and then Jan - May I'll be in a different country studying abroad. It's probably my fault for putting career first and going out of state but these are decisions most people will have to make when choosing what co-ops to take / if to study abroad. But its also exciting getting to travel this much in college. Surely an experience my friends from high school would never have.
3. Northeastern co-op connections/curriculum are worth the hype. HIGHLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW, YOU CAN DO A CO-OP AT ANY OTHER COLLEGE. CO-OP IS BASICALLY JUST AN INTERNSHIP DURING A GAP SEMESTER. However Northeastern's power lies in the connections that Northeastern provides students who have none of their own. I had no CS experience prior coming to Northeastern. Through coursework, TAing, and personal projects I was able to land a first company that's very recognized, helping me land my second and third internships at a big tech and recent IPOd company. I'm living my dream life all due to the first connection that Northeastern provided me and I can't thank the university enough for it. The way Northeastern shapes their curriculum around gap semesters is beautiful as well, allowing many students to use ap credit and test out of courses so they can go on co-op for a greater period of time. They offer courses year round in the event you want to take classes during co-op or worry about not graduating with enough credits. Classes also usually tie into your co-op experience as professors know everyone has exercised some form of work in the field.
4. The need to be individualistic and preprofessional. Interviewing, job searching, living in a city, finding housing in boston &amp;amp; potentially in a city you've never been before, job hopping, etc. This kinda follows point 1 I guess. Shits tuff. But I think you get a huge grasp of what life is like after college and you come out a stronger person. Things get realllllly stressful tho (i know it did for me) so make sure you have a decent mental health before coming here cuz I know many people get stressed out by it all
5. This shits expensive dawg. Not only Northeastern, but living in Boston itself. If you did not receive scholarships, aid, or don't have parents who can support you through it all I wouldn’t bother. This college is probably only worth 15k in loans per year. Boston housing and food is prettyyyyyy expensive and luckily I was able to pick up TA jobs to help me until I got a co-op. Now I'm riding off my co-op savings which is a blessing to say the least. But yea, definitely know that Boston is highkey expensive. 
6. Jealousy, Jealousy - Olivia Rodrigo &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Imposter syndrome. This could just be a me issue but feeling jealous of your peers when they get a co-op offer from a company that rejected you. It's like the college process, what do they have that I don't? Even though I have great offers there's that feeling of not being good enough which strikes something in me and could potentially be an issue amongst you as well. You get used to it tho, and I'm sure this is something at all colleges with internships. I also feel a huge amount of imposter syndrome after going on a LinkedIn stalking crusade and seeing people will multiple top companies. I always wonder why these people came to Northeastern instead of an Ivy and it really makes me feel bad but I just always try to remind myself that life is a personal journey.
7. Underrated aspect, knowing your peers will be happy and successful after graduation. This college is verrrrrrrry focused on career and so are the students. Most people come to Northeastern with some sort of goal in mind and multiple people actually fulfill these goals, graduating with their desired internships and finding their fit in life. It's like seeing a caterpillar morph into a butterfly right in front of your eyes. It's a wonderful sight to see and something I've really grown to appreciate as my time here comes to a close.
8. Some very rich people. Its not the biggest issue but some people just feel really entitled / you feel like a poor bitch compared to them. Going out all the time / dropping money on ubers / spring break at bougie ass places, its kinda crazy how rich some people are but that's life. Not everyone here is rich though for sure, just prepare to be shocked if you come from a low income / medium income family. 
9. Heavy focus on STEM, lacking on humanities front. This is closely tied to Northeastern's rise as a college. Research is what gives the university the most money and currently Northeastern is trying to improve their endowment. They've built two huge research buildings recently and are likely going to build more. STEM has the return on investment for Northeastern, and they usually invest the most in STEM students in turn. If you're a humanities major Northeastern could still be a great option. I know plenty of people end up getting great paid experience out of co-ops and having a leg up on students from other colleges that were never able to land any experience due to it being unpaid and deciding to work a regular summer job instead.

Points 4 and 5 are my biggest complaints with Northeastern, and I feel like Point 1 is why most people might transfer out of NEU, but overall I'm very glad I enrolled here. No other college that I was admitted to would have come close to the return on investment I have had here. Even with all the talk about the school on this subreddit I still think this school is greatly underrated. I honestly can't think of many negatives about Northeastern other than the cost. This school definitely isn't for everyone, however, if you're in the slightest bit interested in a preprofessional experience Northeastern should be ur go-to.

Ask any other questions in the comments section, open to answering them. Also plz ignore my spelling I just kinda threw up all my thoughts."
tlynge,2,2022-03-24,Becoming proficient in programming,dirthawger,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tlynge/becoming_proficient_in_programming/,"Hey everyone,

So currently I'm a student studying CS and I'm pretty sure I got hired as an intern for backend dev with PHP/SQL. Very exciting because this is the sort of work I want to do. Not a big deal, but we use Java in school but I'm taking a Udemy class to learn PHP and SQL. I have been constantly questioning whether I'm learning to program or just how to memorize code. I'm doing quite well in it at school but I'm just sometimes stuck wondering if I'm becoming proficient. With this PHP class I'm basically following along and typing all the code he does and making it work. Though I do understand what the code does as I'm writing it, but I know I probably wouldn't know how to do these projects without following along. Am I learning the right way? Is there something else I could do differently or is this normal frustration from learning something new? Perhaps I'm putting to much pressure on myself but I really enjoy doing this and want to get quite fluent at some point. What was your secret to becoming proficient? I know the standard advice is to think of something  you want to build and build it. My problem is I wouldn't have a clue what to build and definitely wouldn't be able to do without pretty much googling the entire thing. Maybe this is impostor syndrome that some people get. If it means anything a few people in my class come to me for help in programming our class projects."

I will be completing my Masters in Computer Science with a specialisation in Data Science this summer. I am in the process of looking for data science and ML jobs in the Netherlands and I had a few questions about the application process so I can prepare myself better and go in with the right expectations.

Background - Non-EU student with no full-time experience. I have done 4 internships, totally comprising 12-13 months.

&amp;#x200B;

*   What do they typically ask in the technical interviews? Especially for  ML-based questions and to what depth do they expect you to know them?
*  What kind of coding tests are usually given?  
*  Are they more like Leetcode assignments or is a dataset provided and you need to perform a classification or regression task?
* Apart from Python/R/SQL are there other languages that are an equally high priority to know?
* Apart from technical knowledge what other hard or soft skills stand out.  


I know this can be different for every company but I just wanted to know what your experiences have been like.

I'm 25. I really enjoy programming. I am self taught and never worked professionally at all. I learned some python via udemy and have made sorting algorithms, command line blackjack with betting, a program that prints the Mandelbrot set, and a bunch of other random projects for fun. I've also learned some javascript and git, read books, listened to tons of podcasts, and on many occasions have coded for 12 hours straight with joy. Obviously I haven't built the next Facebook in my garage or anything but I do think I have a knack for it and really enjoy it. When I meet someone and they tell me they are software developers I am instantly fascinated and intrigued.

So, I guess I just wanted to vent all this and see if anyone has any suggestions on where I can go to explore this interest. The programming journey has been very solitary for me. I know that my passion for coding and problem solving ability could be valuable to someone or some company and I would love to code for work - I would honestly do it for free to learn. But, I don't know if I'm in any position to apply for a job or internship, and it's intimidating thinking of competing with people that have gone to college for this. 

I am traveling to SE Asia soon to look for English teaching jobs (resuming something I started pre covid) but have just been thinking about coding recently. Any words of guidance or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading."
tm494y,14,2022-03-24,Need help in taking a decision between these 3 Universities (MS in CS),away777throw,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tm494y/need_help_in_taking_a_decision_between_these_3/,"So far I have an admit from Rutgers NB, Northeastern Boston and ASU Tempe. I need to choose one out of these 3, and need help deciding between them.

I prioritise quality of education, job opportunities post graduation, internship opportunities during the course, and the overall general prestige.

My research:

- ASU admits too many people and the bar is relatively low, there are a lot of international students, thus increasing competition and reducing opportunities, and the overall ranking is also not too great.

- NEU is known for its Co-op program, which is very useful for getting industry opportunities as an international. But they've reduced the i20 length, which means the full potential of doing a co-op without taking a course is no longer an option (need to complete in 2 yrs, previously used to be 2.5 i believe)

It also has a large batch size, and being in Boston leads to a high cost of living. But it also has a decent ranking on various websites including csrankings (for AI).

- Rutgers I've heard is slightly more prestigious than the other two, but is more focused on research and core CS, whereas I want to specialize in data science. New Jersey I've heard is also expensive, but not sure if it's worse than Boston. The rankings I've seen also seem good. But I'm not sure how good the post graduation job opportunities are, as i want to head to the tech industry upon graduation.

Any other information I can get between these 3 would help me a lot. Thanks!!"

tmry1k,0,2022-03-24,[Rant] Getting an internship is hard,yz20,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/tmry1k/rant_getting_an_internship_is_hard/,"The title is not meant to scare you but it is just easier for some to get internships while harder for others to get an internship. 

The purpose of writing this rant is to 1) obviously rant about what I am going through for the internships 2) letting others who are in the same situation as me (private uni and difficulty getting an internship) to know that they are not alone 3) maybe suggest a better way for recruiters/managers to reject applicants. 

My rant:
So I have been applying for an internship since the start of uni and have not been able to get an interview with one except for those which I have been referred to till now. 
Last year, my tutor advised me to find a part time job related to my interest instead of finding an internship because I am obviously not getting any. So that’s what I did. After getting back from the part time job, I started job hunting again early this year but to no avail, I still can’t get an internship and worst of all, the rejection emails always begins with “dear xxx, thank you for your interest in xxx role. We are unfortunately…” something along those lines and I’ve seen it so many times till I probably can memorise the format of it. So I don’t know what to improve on and if I were to ask my tutor, he would be clueless too! And this will be further discussed in the third section. 
Without going too much into details, I feel like a victim of Singapore’s education system (maybe some of y’all are too and we are in the same boat). With hell to meritocracy, climbing up the social ladder and all. The poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer is more evident to me now more than ever. I feel that companies are still bias against private university students and can anything be done about it? 
There was this company which I got referred to and worked really hard (over the weekend and used up the time which I could have been using to study for my next week assignments) for the interview but to only know that I got rejected. That was only the tip of the ice berg. The second part to it was that the other candidates only took very little time to prepare for the interview and they got it instead of me? And lastly, I felt that they tested something really unfair in the interview. Maybe it was meant to be that way because that is what they expected out of students but I don’t know…I just didn’t feel like I should be faulted for it because it was content which I have not learned. 

Moving on to the last section, I think recruiters and managers should attach a (detailed) reason as to why they rejected the candidate and this should be mandatory. Just sending out an email to say that you have been rejected DOES NOT HELP the candidate to know what he/she is lacking in or where he/she can improve on. That’s the frustration I get everytime I get a rejection letter because I have no idea why I am rejected and have no direction on how I should improve myself. They sounded so nice and they were really encouraging but I ended up getting rejected? Why?

I think I will end here for today. The only thing that gets easier when applying for internships is the application process. For me, getting the rejection emails never gets easier because you feel like no one wants you and you have no direction at all. What is the difference between local and private u? What is so much better about local students than private students? And people, if y’all are about to say leadership, experience etc, imma tell y’all that we don’t even have the opportunity to do that. We do but private uni life is extremely dead till the point the only thing you do in the 3-4 years is to go to class and go home. And that’s EXACTLY why the poor gets poorer and the rich gets richer. 

If you have read through my nonsense this far, thank you so much. I’m really sorry if I don’t sound irrationale or sound spoilt and aloof. I’m just really trying my best here to accomplish something in life and get a job like everyone will have to but it’s not turning out well for me. I need to get it off my chest and I usually try to not talk about my rejections because it hurts everytime it has been brought up. Just give me a decent internship and I’m happy. 

Thank you!"

I've been admitted to the CO-OP program and I'm getting more antsy as the semester comes to an end. Here's a short resume of my background, I have a bachelor Science in Biology and haven't attended school for more than 5 years and decided to go back as I wasn't enjoying my field so much. Going back to school and learning math all over again scares me as I'm very rusty.

  
I'm currently taking 2 courses for Winter 2022 and I'm struggling as this is my first time programming.

My purpose for this post is to give me a scale of difficulty for each course on 10 with its reasoning. I'm sure this post could help lots of people as I've been told many CS students spend lots of time researching courses on Reddit.  


Here's my current program schedule template with their current difficulties:

Winter 2022:

Course 1: Comp 248 - Object Oriented Programming I (7/10), I spend lots of time learning and since this is my first programming experience, I find this course extremely difficult to pace. Not only that, the labs are terrible, since they are pass/fail.

Course 2: Comp 232 - Discrete Mathematics (with Gosta Grahne), (6/10), the material is easy but the midterm was a slap to the face and let's be honest, if you had Gosta, he's not the greatest professor out there. However, he understands the pressure of students and appreciate for extending his assignments etc...

Course 3 - ENGR 213 - Differential Equations (dropped since I spent too much time reviewing my Cal 1 &amp; Cal 2) (10/10), I've been told by my fellow friends who have taken this course as an easy A, but according to people, I've heard they increased the difficulty due to last year examination. People have been using Chegg to answer the questions on the final...

&amp;#x200B;

Summer 2022: Summer 1:

Course 1: Comp 228 - System Hardware (what should I focus on when taking this class?)

Course 2: ENCS 282 - Technical Writing and Communication (I hear this class is a joke, not sure during the summer though)

&amp;#x200B;

Summer 2022: Summer 2:

Course 1: SOEN 287 - Web Programming (very intro class, I think It's a great class to take it also with Comp 249)

Course 2: COMP 249 - Object Oriented Programming II (this class scares me the most during the summer since I'm struggling with Comp 248 and we will be learning the whole material in 6-6.5 weeks)

&amp;#x200B;

Fall 2022 : 

Course 1: COMP 348 - Principles of Programming knowledge (I've been told this is a heavy class)

Course 2: COMP 352 - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (I heard this class is better when taking it with Hanna)

Course 3: Math 251 - Linear Algebra I (I heard this was the easiest math elective)

Course 4: Elective (If you can recommend a general elective that'd be great)

&amp;#x200B;

Winter 2023:

Course 1: COMP 346 - Operating Systems (I hear this class is heavy)

Work 1: I'll be doing an internship

Is comp 346 a difficult course especially while being in a work term? I purposely took this class as the class start later in the evening and is scheduled on twice / week.  


Feel free to reach out and please comment on the course level difficulty as I might strategize this course sequence better."

I was one of those students who did very well in high school and made the naive assumption that college would be just as easy. As a result, I went straight to university right out of high school. Things were going well, I received scholarships so tuition and housing weren't an issue. Things were going well until I realized that I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life.

I was so excited to go to college, that I never stopped to think about what I wanted to study or where I saw myself in 10 years. I went to university as a Psychology major, then I switched to Computer Science, then History, then I did Neuroscience for a bit. I bounced from major to major, never truly feeling satisfied. I knew that my true passion was Data Science and Statistics but I felt like I couldn't justify studying that in college. I'm a first generation student so I wanted to choose something that I thought my parents would be proud of. Never once did I really think about myself. I stuck with Neuroscience for over a year but I was very disinterested in the biology courses. As a result, I put minimal effort in my classes and lived by the motto ""C's get degrees"". It wasn't until I actually failed one of my biology courses that I realized that what I was doing wasn't correct. I wanted to finally do something for myself. At this point it was too late.

Remember when I said that I had scholarships that helped pay for my university? Those only lasted 4 years and at this point, I was at the end of year 2. I knew I wouldn't be able to afford paying for school out of pocket. As a result, I wouldn't have enough time to take all the prereq's needed to get a degree in Statistics. As a result, I settled with Earth Sciences (ES). ES was cool. It was fun learning about astrophysics and planetary formations, but I knew this wasn't made for me. I still remember being in an ES lab where we had to analyze different minerals. All the students around me were super excited to get their hands on the galena and cristobalite samples, but I just couldn't reciprocate those reactions. I will say, I made some great friends in that program and I also took a few interesting statistics and Python courses that I would use to help leverage my CV.

After it was all said and done, I graduated with a degree in ES with a 2.97 GPA. I knew my academic journey wasn't done and I would want to get a Masters in Statistics/Data Science. Two years later and I just got my first acceptance letter for a master's program. How did I do it? Here's how:

* **Don't Stop Learning:** After it was all said and done, I ordered a bunch of books relating to AI/Machine Learning/Data Science and got to work. If I wanted to have a chance at a master's program, I of course had to learn the basics.
* **Projects! Projects! Projects!**: I knew I didn't have the academic background that most jobs or universities would be looking for, so I decided to overcompensate with projects. I created a bunch of projects using Python. I would then use tools such as Tableau to create nifty visualizations and then post the results on a github webpage. Also, I chose things that genuinely interested me such as basketball stats for these projects. The projects don't have to be super complex, as long as they demonstrate a good understanding of data analysis. Which leads me to my next point
* **Have a Portfolio:** I knew that if my resume wasn't going to shine me in a good light so I decided to create a data portfolio via Github pages. I downloaded an HTML template and start customizing it to make it my own. Not only did I  have a place to show off all your projects, but I also had my own website!
* **Internships/Jobs:** This is probably the hardest step. I applied to multiple internships and entry level data science jobs every day. After months of applications, I was able to land a summer job as a Quantitative Analyst. This summer job would then turn into a full time job. I'm convinced this is the job that let me get into grad school.
* **Letters of Recommendation:** Before I finished my time at my university, I made sure to get close to some of the professors and even worked as a TA for a year. Pair this with my boss from the aforementioned job, I had a pretty nice lineup of people who were willing to give me positive letters of recommendations.
* **Have Fun:** I didn't get burnt out working on these projects because I genuinely enjoyed the work. I loved looking at basketball statistics and learning how to create AI. This was all super exciting to me. There was never a moment where I felt like I was forcing myself to do something I didn't want to do.
* **Extra Courses:** Don't be afraid to take a step back. Earlier in the year I took classes at my local junior college to take a Linear Algebra class which would be needed for my application, in addition to a Differential Equations class.
   * Funny story! I actually took a Linear Algebra class at my previous university. This was at the beginning of the pandemic so I took it Pass/No Pass. I passed it! When applying for grad school however, I felt it would be better to have an actual grade so it's for that reason I retook the course at my local junior college!
* **Applying with Managed Expectations:** It was now time to apply. I had my projects, my work experience, my letters of recommendation, and time on my hand. I knew that even after all this hard work, I probably wasn't going to be accepted into Stanford or anything, but that wasn't my goal. I just wanted to go to a decent university that had my program and would allow me to have a ""fresh start"" in terms of my grades. I applied to middle of the pack schools only (with a few reach schools). In the end I applied to around 6 universities. Got rejected by 4, got accepted into 1, waiting to hear back from 1.

This was REALLY long and I apologize. If anybody has any questions or wants to chat, DM me! I hope this helps someone or at least gives someone the hope that they were needing. I'm just finally relieved that this hurdle is over, now it's time to work hard and prepare for the PhD ;)"

I would like to do 1 more software development-related internship before I graduate (4-6 months). However, and this is where my dilemma lies, I am very interested in the finance field. Particularly in investment analysis and investment banking. Now my degree has nothing to do with this, however, I have learnt a lot, read a lot, practiced, and feel like with a few months of proper training I would be a much more valuable asset to an investment firm or investment bank than 95%+ of business students.

So the problem is, I would really like to try an internship in the finance field. However, don't think parents would approve of me doing a 4-month internship for something that isn't related to my degree.

I also can't do the investment internship after I graduate because when I graduate I'd be looking for a full-time job as a software dev, wouldn't be able to intern then.

Any tips, advice, comments, are greatly appreciated. Cheers y'all."

I’m a sophomore currently studying CS at a mid-tier university (at least for CS), might tack on Philosophy or Math. One of my more ambitious goals is a solid software engineering internship the summer before senior year. But I’m not certain about it, and willing to explore other paths too, like law, consulting, etc.

Pay is roughly the same ($2/hr difference), and I’m fortunate to have parents that’ll pay for housing in either location. On one hand I have,

Company A

Pros:

-Very large diversified global investment firm, good name

-Would give me a lot of experience working with systems in financial technology

-Probably more suited to landing that third year sw eng. internship

-expecting work from home monday and friday -&amp;gt; more time for random stuff on the weekend!

-i can live in my apt in my college town without having to deal with subletting over the summer

Cons:

-gave an exploding offer, I’ve heard people treat that as a red flag but I’m aware it’s common in tech and I’m not very peeved

-1000 miles away from home and my family. my girlfriend from home might come with, but I don’t want to isolate her too much

-Probably more time alone typing at a computer rather than collaborating with coworkers

-could potentially replace by doing research for credit at school, which can’t be said for consulting

On the other: 

Company B

Pros

-Considerably smaller consulting firm in the NY market, does a lot of work with PE companies and has a bit of a tech bend

-back in my home state

-just seems to do a lot of diverse tasks and would be an interesting place to work

-would be great for networking in my home market - everyone was really nice and accessible, including the CEO.

Cons

-somewhat lengthier internship, although that’s not the worst thing in the world

-longer commute (90 minutes one way) and no WFH

-i’m still not *quite* sure what i’d actually be doing 9-5, the description has been pretty general

-has hinted at some long hours… ever so subtilely

Regardless, I think they’re both great choices. But perhaps you have some insight!"
tn7d6e,23,2022-03-24,How can I more effectively read hardware and software documentation?,dcfan105,embedded,https://www.reddit.com/r/embedded/comments/tn7d6e/how_can_i_more_effectively_read_hardware_and/,"So I'm a firmware engineering intern.  I started in January and one of the my biggest struggles has been learning how to effectively navigate technical documentation.  At this point I've been referencing the same two documents for a couple of months and I feel like I have a decent understanding of the general layout and structure, and yet I still keep missing stuff.  So many times I've asked my mentor for help, saying I searched the documentation for something (which I did) and couldn't find the information, and then he finds it in like a minute and points it out to me and half the time it's in the same small section I was looking at myself, but I managed to miss it because I didn't read everything super closely.  

The obvious answer is that I just need to read more closely, but when I first started I was reading everything super closely but not absorbing much because it was just too much technical jargon.  And my coworker, who was assigned as my ""buddy"", said not to do it that way, to just search for the information you need and not to try to read everything.  I feel I just don't know where to draw the line.  How closely should I read to actually find the information I need without having to ask for help all the time, but also not wasting time looking for information in the wrong place or that just isn't there at all?  

Also, if it makes a difference, since there are different types of documentation, the documentation I'm currently using are two different manuals on manufacturer provided driver functions for FTDI SPI/I2C evaluation modules.  

This is one of them: http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/AppNotes/AN_329_User_Guide_for_LibFT4222.pdf 

And this is the other one: 
https://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/ProgramGuides/D2XX_Programmer's_Guide(FT_000071).pdf 

I'm looking for general advice though, that I can apply in the future as well as to my current project."

This is gonna be a bit.... well... odd, but I'm looking for some professional advice from the more experienced sysadmins and IT managers out there.

If you follow my post history on a few tech related subs, you'll see that I made the transition from working in retail to working for an MSP. In terms of experience, I have been a lifelong tech enthusiast, and the go to ""fix-it guy"" for all my friends and family. I worked for a while as a Sysadmin for a small company. Nothing serious; a few computers in a workgroup, some macs, a simple fileserver computer (sharing, not Win Server) with an FTP. I also did hardware and software upgrades. In addition, I also worked as a freelance consultant, and did housecalls for users.

Fast forward to today, and I am A+ and Net+ certified, am currently enrolled in a BS program for network ops and security, and..... am the ""IT Director"" for a local MSP (two person shop after the previous tech left the area).....

Don't get me wrong, I have stepped up to the plate and done EVERYTHING that the clients and MSP needed from me. In a few short months, I've attianed working knowledge of Sophos, pfSense, JumpCloud, Sharepoint, Autotask, IT Glue, PuTTy, in addition to a LOT of knowledge gained about MacOSes, etc. Firewall setup and management, computer speccing, building and configuration, RMM, writing up tech proposals, consulting with outside professionals, etc. And this is managing 6 clients and around 80 computers.... 

Thing is, we JUST got another contract, which is adding another 40 computers, and another contract (the one I had to learn JumpCloud for) will be adding another 30 computers in about 2 weeks. So obviously, we're gonna need help...

&amp;#x200B;

This is my question for the more experienced crowd, and its a two-parter:

1. What other tools, skills, software, forums, etc, can you recommend to me to get up to speed with what is expected in the market of an ""IT Director""? There's obviously A LOT of actual skills I need to acquire (hence the schooling), but some broad strokes would be most apppreciated. Also, what sorts of skills/talents/knowledge should I be acquiring in order to stay relevant in the future? I'm planning on working in IT until I retire.
2. What sorts of advice, maxims, stories, etc. do you have for me in terms of managing an IT team? We have the opportunity to have some interns work for us for school credit, but this will be my first time managing other people in the tech world (I've been a manager at most of my jobs, so have some experience), so I'm looking for again, any advice or tips you may have that will help.

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciate any advice you may have. Just trying to do the best job that I can. Thanks so much!"

So I studied programming and data science with a focus in ML in college and am currently working in a data science internship. Things are going decently well and I’m learning. But something has been on my mind and I’ve been thinking about it for a while.

It feels like while I try to learn a bit here and there about how computers work and what not, when I’m doing my work it feels overwhelming that there is always a multitude of things within the world of CS that I have no idea work at all. I know the ethos in software engineering is to google till you find a fix but I get very intimidated at just putting in random commands into terminal that I have no clue what they actually do. And when I watch processes run in terminal I watch the mounds of log output and have no idea how to read it? Maybe this is a naive question but for a front end software engineer or data scientist is there ever a point where for the most part “you know what’s going on” as in you can read any terminal error, or output or general system message on your computer and know exactly what it’s referring to with regard to the lexicon and output? Or is the career of Cs just one where you’re usually always kind of playing guessing games with a process ?

If anyone recommends an online course or YouTube series or something that explains very well how computers work (what is terminal doing, how os and hardware interact, what containers and servers are etc.) would appreciate as well."

I'm a senior in high school right now. I slacked a lot throughout my underclassmen years,  didn't do as well as I would've liked. But since then, I've gotten straight A's in difficult AP, dual enrollment, and honors classes and have recovered my GPA (3.7).

Over last summer i researched both the buy-side and sell-side of finance and Investment banking seems like a great medium for me to get into the buy-side of finance. I know it requires tons of hard work and dedication, but i feel like I'm more motivated than ever and think i can reach my goal. 

I got into IU Kelley for finance and am going to go there to get my education. I know it's not a target school, (it's a semi-target; around 85 people land jobs in investment banking out of college) but it's the best college my current grades can get me into. I'm also thinking about the possibility to transfer after my Sophomore year to a more desirable school for these companies. (like NYU, UMich, UBerk)

Now that my background is done, I'll come to my questions:

1. I know networking is crucial to get in the radar of banks. I created a LinkedIn and began adding my qualifications. Do you guys have any tips on networking for Investment banking specifically?
2. Are there any specific internship roles that would help me to land a summer analyst role at an Investment bank in my junior year?
3. If there is one thing that you would have done differently/ do better during your 4 years at university, what would it be?
4. Is there anything you suggest i look into/begin doing before i get to IU this upcoming fall?
5. Literally, any type of general tips or advice would also be appreciated!!!

IM READY TO DO THIS. LETS GOOOOOOOOO

Thank you for taking the time to help me out. Hope you beautiful people have a great day/night!"

So should I buy a pc? or should I spend it on something else/save?"
tnbs25,22,2022-03-24,NEU controversy - some advice,nh1701a,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tnbs25/neu_controversy_some_advice/,"Hi - I am a 2016 NEU graduate (applied in 2010, freshman in 2011). 

Today, I am one of 3-4 individuals responsible for hiring for the Boston branch of a national engineering firm. To prospective students caught up in the application process, and dealing with the low admission rate of institutions like NEU, I thought it might be helpful to offer some advice:

1. Northeastern is not an “overrated” school. If you are accepted, you should attend. When I applied in 2010 the admission rate was ~30%, and NEU did not have the same reputation it does now. Regardless, the co-op program was, and is, invaluable, and potential employers will always chose experience over a degree, with some fringe exceptions. In addition, northeastern professors are well connected in industry, and their research is well funded. 

2. Your ability to succeed does NOT depend AT ALL on attending a school like NEU, or ANY other “top” university. In my case, northeastern certainly made my path easier with the excellent co-op program, and coordinators who essentially found me the co-op that became my career. However, as someone who is now responsible for hiring, most managers and senior employees do not care about what institution you are studying at, or have a degree from. 

The reason the co-op program is so successful is because it makes it easier to get your resume in front of potential employers. This is something you can do on your own. Research companies/institutions that work in the field you’re interested in. It does not matter what school you’re at. Find someone who works there, email them or contact them on LinkedIn, state your interest in an internship, and attach a resume. Chances are, if you invest the time and energy into reaching out, you can replicate the benefits of the co-op program, no matter where you go - even if it’s a low ranked school, community college, etc… those things are NOT a barrier to professional success, despite what it may seem like to you now. 

In summary, if you are accepted to Northeastern (or some other similar school) disregard the naysayers and go for it without another thought. I chose NEU over Dartmouth and McGill and have never regretted it. You can write your own ticket. 

BUT if you are not accepted… it truly does not matter. You can replicate the benefits with a little more effort. If you take the initiative to reach out to potential employers (for full time jobs or internships), your school does not matter at all, wether it’s northeastern, MIT, tufts, or a community college. The “top tier” schools make it easier to apply, but are not a requirement in anyway. 

Wishing you all good luck. The current college application environment is far more stressful than what I dealt with almost 12 years ago (how the hell did that happen) and it was bad enough then!!"
tnbyzu,226,2022-03-24,I'm Done.,Content-Rope-55,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tnbyzu/im_done/,"3.8 UW 4.68 W. In-State Cali resident.

I started my college application process in the summer, making sure to narrow down my college list to the ones that I wanted to attend. I worked on my essays, making sure to not make any grammatical mistakes, ANY slip-ups, to **make sure** that I was proud of each of my college applications.

Yet, here I'm with 10 rejections out of the 16 that I applied to. Not placed on any waitlists, all rejections.

Pulling all nighters in order to complete my homework, projects, studying for tests, after a draining day of school which were followed by hours of extracurriculars filled with meetings, internships, etc. 

I'm done. All of the constant effort and time that I put into everything, went wasted. Each time I open up a rejection letter my futile hopes of opening an acceptance letter quickly disappears, followed with a hollow feeling. I say I'm fine to my parents. I see their efforts on reassuring me, even though I see that their worries are mounting that much more as well. 

I could say I'm sorry for myself. But I feel most sorry for my parents. They immigrated here, made a business despite their limited English, pushed through despite the hit that the pandemic had on them, cared for me and my siblings, and always sent money back home to their family. 

I heard my mom crying when she was talking with my dad at night, worried about how I might not get into college. The fact that my mom was crying not because she was mad that I didn't get into any college but it was because she was upset and worried about how I felt because of the hard work that I put into everything, broke me. My mom's also been sick lately, so I've been wanting to surprise her with an acceptance. She didn't even show me how worried she was, instead choosing to cry to my dad at night, broke me. 

I'm done. I tried so hard, yet it's all over. I'm not even going to wait for the 6 left because they're all reaches."

tnc40b,4,2022-03-24,UofT CS/ECE grad school chances without decent undergrad academic research experiences.,[deleted],UofT,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/tnc40b/uoft_csece_grad_school_chances_without_decent/,"Hi,

I am a third year Machine Intelligence EngSci about to go into PEY. I intend to pursue grad school at UofT's CS or ECE departments after graduating but am a bit worried about my chances. For context, I've only had one summer of research internship in second year, which was remote and international and overall kinda sucked. I was mostly given busywork and didn't really accomplish much over that summer.

I am currently going into a research position for PEY at a relatively well known tech company, I initially accepted the position since I figured it will be good for grad school applications. I have since heard that professors generally care less about commercially funded research, and that recommendation letters from company managers don't really count for most professors looking to take in grad students. I'm a bit worried since I won't really have time for further academic research internships in 4th year after my PEY.

I understand that both CS and ECE grad schools at UofT have very competitive admissions, and I have worked pretty hard over the last three years to maintain a 4.0 GPA to stand a decent chance for admission. But I am now worried that my lack of good research experience will hamper my chances.

If anyone here on this sub have had experience applying to either of these grad schools, could they please share some advice on what my best course of action hereon out would be. Any input would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks for reading this post and have a great day!"

I would like to say I'm generally really good at reading the room socially, but  I've never interviewed for a professional job (even low level  internships) before, so this is foreign territory for me. I thought I absolutely crushed it, but they never said anything along the lines of ""We'll be getting  together to discuss the next steps and get back to you in (x time) with  your answer."" I asked my questions, they answered, everyone said thanks  it was a pleasure, and the call ended.

I  know in all fairness I also should've asked though it completely  slipped my mind. But is this a bad sign that they didn't even vaguely  say they'd get back to me, let alone when? I already followed up  immediately after the call ended with a thank you email. 

""You welcome, it was  pleasure interviewing you this afternoon.  I also enjoyed our  conversation.  I hope you were able to learn some things about \[redacted\]  and the IT departments.""

Should I wait a normal amount of time to ask on an update? I was planning on waiting a week to send another email. If so, who do I e-mail? Do I e-mail my recruiter, or the people technical recruiters who conducted the interview?"

I am going to work on getting an Excel certificate, learning Python and SQL as well as getting some projects done. However, I was thinking of maybe getting a finance certificate too, the market is highly competitive so I am looking for ways to stand out. 

I am interested in financial assets, working with clients and the financial market so I was thinking about the capital markets sector? I am also considering the FMVA certificate with the CFI

What finance certificates would you recommend?

I've always hated school and the teaching format for course lectures in both public and higher education but decided to go to college just for the sake of getting some internship experience and a piece of paper to show for employers(to add to my personal portfolio I've been building on for a while), even though in my field of major(Software Engineering/Computer Science), it isn't necessarily required to have a degree to get a job but it definitely makes it a bit easier to get my first job in that field. I've also made many stupid life decisions in my very late teenhood and early adulthood that it has cost me so much money that now it's been difficult for me to give my 100% in my University education because I'm always stressing out about catching up on all of my bills. On top of that, the ridiculous gas prices right now have been making my bill payments even more difficult.

My GPA right now is very crappy too(2.4 Cumulative GPA) and my passion for higher education just keeps gradually burning. Now college just feels flat out miserable for me with no money nor scholarships to pay for my remaining semesters."

However, I have still not received an official written offer letter from HR. During the verbal offer, the hiring manager told me she was gonna alert HR but I haven’t received any updates from them. 

After 3 weeks of no word, I got worried and did an interview with a “bigger” Big 5 firm and I received a written/verbal offer about a week later. I obviously accepted this offer and signed the written offer because at this point I think that the other bank rescinded their offer as I haven’t heard from HR. Also, the start date for internships (May 2) is quickly approaching and I didn’t want to be left without an internship if the first bank changed their mind.

The Hiring Manager during the verbal offer told me that she is getting promoted and she won’t be working with me, but instead I’ll work with someone new. 

So my questions are:

1. Do you think my first offer got rescinded? 

2. The only email I have is the recruiter’s email. Should I send her an email letting her know I accepted another offer since I haven’t heard from them in over a month? Or should I do nothing?"

I’m just feeling quite anxious these days and didn’t rlly have anyone to discuss on this topic so please hear me out.

I am a fresh graduate poly student with IT Diploma and my gpa for 5th sem is just a Low 3.22.. I know it’s kinda garbage but I still tried to applied for university admission. In fact, I applied for all 6 local unis. I participated in tech competition with some award, joined both local and overseas internship (1 month). I do have experience on both programming and data analytics in case some of you might wanna know. 

I know the fact that to even land an interview for the big 3s and SUTD is impossible so I don’t expect much for the outcome. Therefore, I only hope that I can land an interview for SIT and SUSS. However, I haven’t receive a single interview email ever since I submitted my application. I applied for SIT around mid-Feb (UoG Computing Science 1st choice) and SUSS (BA 1st Choice) on the last day of application. To be honest, I’m kinda doubt that I will even receive the interview email at this point so I just gonna assume that I will get rejection from all unis. 

Anyone of you that has the similar experience whether it’s current one or past mind giving me some advice? Or maybe rate the chances of me getting an interview ? Any advice is fine ! I just need to hear the thoughts of others… as I am kinda lost right now. I do consider applying SIM degree and apply master in local unis after completing my private degree..but I don’t think my parents would like this idea.. the fact that I am gonna get a private degree kinda upset them I guess.."

My question is: If I accept this job will my opportunities for other types of jobs like web development disappear and will I be regarded as only a CRM developer from that point on?

I'm a bit scared of the consequences of working with this company for a while and then trying to get other opportunities and automatically be disregarded because of my only real world experience besides internship is with a CRM technology.

I am 26 years old and have been working in jobs completely unrelated to IT up until two years ago. I am finishing up an online associates degree in computer science &amp; networking but I feel like I haven't been learning anything or retained any important information. I have found it impossible to obtain any certifications due to laziness, lack of time &amp; money.

In 9 days I begin as a junior IT tech for a office of 40 people working with one other IT person who has been hired about a month ago. The office I am working in is very new due to company expansion. The rest of the IT team works out of office. The problem is I am not confident in my skills &amp; knowledge at all. It's safe to say I've been coasting the past two years just trying to gather experience. All of the experience I've had has been me solving trivial problems for people who can barely turn on a computer. I emailed my soon to be boss a couple days after I signed the offer letter and still haven't received a response. The company I was hired at sells &amp; manages software for hospitals and health care companies so I am assuming everyone I will be working with is very smart. The CEO, CFO and a ton of highly regarded co workers will be in this new office.

I thought I landed the job because I am very well spoken, have great customer service skills and had a nice resume. My role in the company will be manage inventory, help around the new office, on boarding and managing user profiles in active directory &amp; O365. My big question is how do sell myself to my co workers as someone who is actually has the skills &amp; is knowledgeable? What kind of questions should I be asking? What should I expect? What IT systems &amp; concepts should I get acquainted with? I really want excel on this career path and want to make a good first impression.

tnmznm,1,2022-03-25,Subtle things that deteriorate your mental health,Suman_Mishra,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/tnmznm/subtle_things_that_deteriorate_your_mental_health/,"Mental health has been a topic that many people tend to avoid or look at it with doubts, and the very little that we do can create ripples in the long run. 

I'm sure you know about bad habits affecting one physically but here are some things that we do that affect our mental health negatively:-

•Poor Posture

Many studies have shown that sitting straight not just helps with depression and reduces fatigue but also increases positive attitude, focus.


•Perfectionism

It is a healthy habit to go after excellence but the need to be perfect in everything you do can in reality undermine your efforts. Psychologists divide perfectionism into two: positive and negative. While the former allows things to be at a healthy boundary, the latter leads to dissatisfaction, overthinking, anxiety, being preoccupied with failure and looking at small mistakes as failures.


•Lack of Exercise

Endorphins are released in our body which relieves depression and temperature rise enables calming. 


•Social Media and Smartphones

Overuse of social media can be a component for sorrow, uncertainty and resentment due to contradicting one's life to others, recognize that everyone is distinct in their way and not all that you see online is factual. Obsessional or excessive use of a smartphone can lead to indications of chronic stress and reduced self-esteem.


•Guilt

Being guilty about the things you did wrong could be a good way to not repeat them but being guilty over everything or things that are not in your discretion directs to degradation of cognitive health, we must understand and forgive ourselves and be less hard on ourselves.


•Regret 

If not a habit, regret could be good but with daily practice, it could make you depressive, anxious, leading to insomnia and problems in concentration.


•Bad sleeping habits

Sleep not just helps you to recover physically but mentally as well. Not sleeping for a day or two can make you feel grumpy but if poor sleep becomes a habit it could be taxing on your mental health. A study shows that many who suffer from insomnia, also suffer from depression, psychological stress and anxiety.


•Co-dependancy

The pattern of co-dependency and people-pleasing behaviour can lead to the damage of your mental health, as it could suggest forfeiting oneself for the other, prioritising others over self, ripping off your individuality.


•Negative mindset

A few thoughts of failure now and then does not pose danger to your mental health. But it gets worse when it discourages you to create goals, magnifying your mistakes, thinking that you'd fail no matter what, not valuing your talents or skills. 


One must try to identify and cope with these above mentioned subtle acts but if you feel that things are unmanageable make sure to reach out for professional help.
Sending love 💙

I just want to prove myself and sharpen my skills along the way. But I see that almost everyone is saying that I need to pick for it to be easier for me to be recruited. The thing is, I don't know yet, I enjoy doing both. Is it possible to be a self taught full-stack developer straight off the bat??

I would appreciate if someone could steer me to see the ""right"" or logical direction.

I am currently a sophomore so this decision is pretty difficult for me as I don't know the industry very well. I recently decided to pursue consulting instead of investment banking so I am pretty unknowledgeable when it comes to Big4 opportunities, career arch, etc. Also I already extended the deadline to accept my EY offer to April 1 (they said well check back with you then) so I feel obligated to make a decision by April 1 . Deloitte's deadline is June 6 but that's pretty irrelevant given the EY decision precedes it. In terms of the two offers, I am really stuck on which direction to go. I know junior summer internships lead to full time offers so I want to make sure I make the right decision since this could be where I work long term. Both have basically the same pay and are both located in Houston (where I am from) so neither has the advantage in those aspects. 

Structured finance is very interesting to me due to the concept of securitization and being able to work with Investment Banks, but I am not sure about how good EY is as a company. I have read a lot of things saying they overwork employees and don't have adequate pay adjustments over time, However, I really like the position and the people who interviewed me so before Deloitte I was essentially ready to take the offer.

&amp;#x200B;

When it comes to Deloitte, this is where I am really confused. A recruiter actually contacted me to apply for this risk and financial advisory position and I decided to apply thinking might as well. I tried to ask what exactly my role will be but they wouldn't specify saying my assignment is not known at the moment. I am really interested in certain aspects of Risk and Financial Advisory like M&amp;A/transactions as well as regulation/compliance but am not at all interested in audit or a highly IT based role. I am trying my best to email the people who interviewed me and the recruiter to find out about my role but so far no specifics have been mentioned. This worries me as I don't want to engage in work that doesn't interest me at all. However, I know how strong of a reputation Deloitte has and the opportunities interning got offer me moving forward. Additionally, things like Deloitte University and other aspects of the culture really stand out to me and make it a highly appealing place to work in my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone can offer insights on either of these two positions or has suggestions on which offer I should take, that would be really helpful!"

I (23m) have a strong desire to leave my current employer. I have been here for about a year now (counting my prior internship), and have slowly come to the realization that this is not a place I want to stay any longer. My former boss left, and he was amazing, as someone who is a new grad, I couldn’t have asked for a better mentor. However, nowadays I have come to realize why my former boss left, as he sheltered me quite a bit from the toxic work environment. I have had to work overtime, weekends, and even on holiday breaks and I am scared that I am currently going through burnout. The leadership of the company is incredibly hostile, they have unrealistic expectations, and some of my coworkers always say things like “you are gonna get yelled at” or “\[Manager\] is gonna lose their shit”. I understand people have disagreements and get upset when expectations aren’t met, but I always felt that this sort of behavior, especially from those on the leadership team is unprofessional and unhealthy. At the same time, I don’t feel like I am developing my skills effectively, especially without a solid mentor, after all this is still my first real job out of college. 

The issue is that I simply don’t have enough experience under my belt, and I have applied to other positions, but I feel like the question of “Why are you leaving so soon” will inevitably come up. I keep telling myself that I should just suck it up for another year, but everyday I want to leave this company as soon as I can. I am worried that I am not learning the things I should be learning to advance my career, and it is setting me back from developing the necessary skills for more desirable positions elsewhere. 

I’ve somehow managed to get through all the new responsibilities that I have had handed to me, and to a certain extent it has been fulfilling, but it’s gotten to an unhealthy point where I feel constant pressure from work, and I don’t know how much more I can take, alongside the fear that I am not growing in the areas that I want to grow in. 

I need to leave this job as soon as I can both for my well-being but also for the sake of my career growth. But I am unsure of how to do it, should I suck it up for another year and get more experience or should I just go ahead and apply for other positions? 

Would greatly appreciate any insight into this! 

Thanks"
tnoxiz,1,2022-03-25,If you had to become a software engineer without a degree,Redditor_19879,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tnoxiz/if_you_had_to_become_a_software_engineer_without/,"Ok, so I have (kind of a loaded) question to people who are pursuing their Comp Sci degree. There’s obviously a big push for software engineers to be obtained by companies through bootcamps and/or people who go the self-taught route. I went through the “traditional” route of getting a BS in Comp Sci, but I’m curious to hear what people think about their majors? Do you think it’s super vital that you need to go to college in order to be a good developer - or is it more of a societal pressure to get a degree in order to seem like a legitimate candidate for the industry? And if you do think your degree is really important, what specific classes do you think you’ll use when you are working in the industry? What percentage of classes are relevant to what you’ll be eventually doing during your day-to-day?

The reason I’m asking is because I want to know what people’s perception of the industry is based on what they’ve learned in school. If you’ve had an internship before, you’ve probably gotten a taste of similarities and differences between the curriculum/coursework versus practical applications in the corporate world, but regardless, what are THE most important things you need to know?

My list is:
Object oriented programming
Data structures and algorithms
Testing fundamentals
System design (maybe OS)
Learning a language and building apps

This is what I think is important to know in order to be successful. (I’ve also included more info here - totally optional if you’re interested https://youtu.be/bfRgXChfnt8 )"

I received internship offers from KPMG, PwC, EY, and Deloitte and am having a hard time differentiating between the firms. The offers are all for Summer 2023 Audit Internships in San Jose and will (hopefully) lead to a full time offer as long as I don’t majorly screw up.

The main advice I’ve received from people is to choose the firm with the people I can see myself working with. However, I recruited out of a school in LA and networked with LA firms and professionals, so I don’t really have a grasp for the people working in SJ B4. 

My main goal is to eventually have work life balance and be able to live comfortably (which most likely means I’ll do my time in B4 for as long as I can endure then get out). From my research, it seems that one of the main selling points EY pushes is that they have all the name brand tech clients, but I’m not sure if this translates into better exit opportunities or not.

Is there anything about any of the firms I should know/consider when making my decision?

tnqaip,27,2022-03-25,"Look at your town's public library for free resources! like udemy/treehouse/udacity. Also, other programming/Software Development/Web Development resources.",timothy_mcmasters,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tnqaip/look_at_your_towns_public_library_for_free/,"Hi guys!!!!

I'm currently learning to program/software development being self-taught right now but possibly going off and doing a BootCamp or Degree...But that is off topic!

# But I wanted to recommend some resources that you might be looking for!!

*Note: I am not affiliated with any of these resources.*

*Note: I listed these in importance of what someone should look at. Public library is first because often people overlook this. If you can get courses that tend to cost money but are offered free through something like the public library, sometimes that means that you will find some of the highest quality content.*

&amp;#x200B;

1. **YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY =&gt;&gt;** It might seem like all they offer are books, CDs, and movies. But, often I have seen that they offer websites for completely free. For me, I was able to get the entirety of **UDEMY for FREE.** All you needed was a library card...which was free...and live in my area. Fort Wayne, IN, Allen County. So I highly recommend looking into your local public library website and resources. Here is proof that I'm not making my situation up: [Allen County Public Library | Research And Databases](https://www.acpl.lib.in.us/research/research) I have seen other areas like Indianapolis that offer Treehouse through their public library. Here is a list of library's that make it free: [https://teamtreehouse.com/libraries/find-your-library](https://teamtreehouse.com/libraries/find-your-library)
2. **CODE.ORG** =&gt;&gt; IF you are looking for ALL SORTS of free resources/ lists/ Internships/ Apprenticeships/ Courses/Certificates/ etc. This website is an amazing addition to your resources!!!! I highly recommend starting here for anybody 18yrs or older: [https://code.org/beyond](https://code.org/beyond)
3. **APP ACADEMY OPEN =&gt;&gt;** You may have seen this Bootcamp advertisement everywhere!!! Well... IT appears that have their ""Entire Curriculum"" for free. Whether that is true or not, I won't know because I'm not going to the bootcamp. But if you are looking for an interactive course with videos and more. Here is the link : [https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/](https://open.appacademy.io/learn/full-stack-online/) This may be more advanced for the straight beginner so look below for more \\/\\/
4. **FreeCodeCamp/TheOdinProject/W3 =&gt;&gt;**  I listed these all into the same category because these are probably the most well known starting points that any developer should take. All of this is free. What can one ask for more? Also, check out FreeCodeCamps Youtube... Really good stuff. Here are the links: [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) , [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) , [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)
5. **STRINGBOARD/BENTO/RITHM =&gt;&gt;** I listed these all into the same category because these tend to be less interactive and two of these (springboard/Bento) just use already free resources but put them into a dedicated paths that you can follow if you need guidance on navigating these resources. Links are here: [https://www.springboard.com/resources/learning-paths/](https://www.springboard.com/resources/learning-paths/) , [https://bento.io/tracks](https://bento.io/tracks) , [https://www.rithmschool.com/courses](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses) . Some of these places are straight boot camps that just give free curriculum as well.
6. **CODEWARS/EXERCISM =&gt;&gt;** I listed these into the same category because they are very problem driven, learn by solving problems. Lots of reading and no videos. Also good interview prep. If you are into that then links are here: [https://exercism.org/tracks](https://exercism.org/tracks) , [https://www.codewars.com/dashboard](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) . 
7. Lastly... There are lots of **OPTIONS** out there and if you have **ANY OTHER RECCOMENDATIONS** then please **REPLY TO THIS POST.** Also, please leave reviews of these websites, and I know that I am not a seasoned developer, so if any of the listed websites are bad... please inform me and I will remove them from this post!

***NOTE:: I want to reiterate that I am not affiliated with any of these websites...But I just wanted to provide the best platforms for anyone to begin learning... Thank you so much!***"

I did the normal hours but didn’t stay late. I was even told one day I could leave at 4:45 so I just got the impression it was okay to leave around that time. I was not told how long to stay and how late to stay either. It was actually supposed to be a hybrid role and I made it clear in the interview I preferred to be remote and they said that was fine but they switched up on me and said they wanted me in the office for a least two weeks to get acclimated to the company. I was very upset about this but I was willing to keep an open mind so I went in the office the next two days. I had even started on some projects and created a whole new page for them on a college hiring platform so we could start hiring interns and was actually excited about doing the work but they told me that it didn’t “seem like I was into it”. They even fired the person that was supposed to train me for the same reasons so essentially there was no training structure, and I just worked with what I was given. The office was super small and cramped, smelled like cigarettes and no one wore a mask so the environment made me uncomfortable so I don’t know maybe it was a blessing in disguise. I understand there are certain expectations but I think if there was something wrong they could have told me and I would’ve corrected it like every other job I’ve had. I’ll be okay but really I think the company needed me more because now they have no recruiters to hire summer interns and there job postings have been up for months. I don’t know how they expect to work with interns tbh. One last thing worth mentioning is that I was visibly the only person of color and the person they fired was also a person of color. It’s so annoying because they say “no one wants to work these days” but people do wanna work, employers just aren’t willing to put in the effort to work with different kinds of people and give proper feedback"

I have no internships, portfolio, or tech related work experience so I am very apprehensive about finding a job once graduated.

My primary fears are that my lack of experience will make finding a job extremely difficult, and my age will mean I will be a Jr Dev through my thirties when I could be moving towards Sr. level.  I am also concerned that my age may hurt me in interviews (illegal ofc, but subconscious biases do exist, though this may be my own insecurity), when combined with my lack of experience.

I'm thinking spending the extra time and getting an MS could give me the experience that I'm otherwise lacking, making finding a job easier and professional advancement quicker (?)

I've read a lot of posts on here from people asking about getting an MS, but most of the responses are based around already having experience / currently employed in the field. 

I do want my masters eventually just because I enjoy school and hope to teach eventually, but that would be a lot looser of a timeline and I would ideally find an employer offering tuition reimbursement.


TLDR: What's the best thing I can do as an older student finishing CS BA w/ no experience: get masters or something else"

I got cold-called about a work opportunity with a large semiconductor company in San Diego. Fast forward a few interviews and I received an offer to work for this staffing company as a Software Engineer for a project by this semiconductor company. The kicker is it's an \~8month contract for a job on the other side of the country, and I have no relocation assistance but the pay is notably higher than my last offer, about 40 an hour. But I still need to move from the midwest to South California within the next 2-3 weeks. Is this worthwhile?"

I graduated college in 2020, and spent 18 months job searching before I finally got an internship. That ended, and now I'm on the hunt once more. Unfortunately, I haven't been getting many interviews aside from a few jobs I'm not interested in, or am over-qualified for.

I'm trying really hard to break into the software engineering field, but I think I might be getting filtered out by ATS.

Edit: I guess I should add I'm in the US, applying in the US, if that matters."

- Risk assessments
- Vendor Management
- Incident reporting
- Cybersecurity training and phishing tests
- Coordinating audits and ensuring audit findings are remediated by IT
- Reviewing user and IT employee activity to check for suspicious actions


Basically, the more ""paperwork"" side of infosec and NOT what I want to do forever. I have a decent grasp of technical IT concepts, but not much experience. Here's my resumé:
- 2 years at my current infosec job
- 6 months of Help Desk internship
- Associate's Degree in IT
- A+, Network+, and Security+
- Currently enrolled in university pursing a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity


My next job is going to have to be remote since I live in a rural area (w/ fiber internet!), but there are literally 1000s of ""cyber security"" jobs on Indeed. Does anyone have any tips for what I should be looking for to get my foot in the technical cybersecurity door? Internal/Customer-facing SOC Analyst, another Information Security position, consulting, pen-testing?

tnwaf7,0,2022-03-25,Looking for guidance on how to progress through freshman summer,Sufficient-Summer-88,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tnwaf7/looking_for_guidance_on_how_to_progress_through/,"Hello,

I am feeling a little bit stuck as to how to continue progressing in computer science.  I am finishing up the end of my Freshman year after having taken an intro to CS class last semester (python) and a data structures class this semester (c++).  I have a passion for computer science and want to continue learning over the summer, but am a little bit confused as to where to look.

From what I've read, it's very difficult for freshmen to get internships (and it's also probably way too late).  So, I would like to continue learning in another way.  I've looked at coding bootcamps, but I am wary of how everything I've seen focuses on Javascript when I'm more interested in software engineering than web development.  When I'm just looking to learn instead of for employment at this point, it seems like that would be an overly expensive option.

So, do you all have any advice as to what I should be learning over the summer to progress towards having more resume-ready projects and an amount of knowledge that would make me an appealing candidate and valuable intern next summer?  I love to learn, but I just feel like I need a little bit of guidance as to where I should direct that passion.

Thank you!"
tnws9k,53,2022-03-25,Passed CySA+!,Luikipad,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/tnws9k/passed_cysa/,"Just passed CySA+ and it was quite a journey. Some background information: second year university student with minimum experience in Cybersecurity, mainly worked on some GRC compliance for my internship. Studied AWS SAA and stopped after a while and decided to go for CySA+. Had one week to cram during my spring break and hopefully pass. 

Resources used: Jason Dion’s Udemy course, His 5 practice exams, the Sybex book, and a home lab.

- As far as study materials used, I mainly watched Dion’s video on 1.5x, took his practice exams, and filled in any knowledge gap with the Sybex book. Gaining experience with the tools definitely played a huge role in passing. 

-As far as the actual exam goes, I was not confident at all. There were 4 PBQs and 63 MC questions. The weird CompTIA wording along with the BEST possible answer made me think as an analyst. Sec+ was definitely more straight forward. Definitely a challenging but fun exam. Really makes you think about what you’ll do in the real world.

-My biggest tips would be to read the questions slowly, create a home lab to use some of the tools, and take your time with selecting the answers.

Finally, a rule I usually go by is when you study so much that feel like you don’t know anything… Just take the test!"
tnx5sa,1,2022-03-25,Internships vs Certifications for a CIS graduate with minimal prior experience and a 1+ year work gap?,CuckooMetal,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tnx5sa/internships_vs_certifications_for_a_cis_graduate/,"I've been working with a career guidance guy and he brought up the idea of internships recently. Last time I checked internships for someone who's graduated 1+ years ago aren't usually a thing but I could spend the time looking for some. Though I thought a possible alternative could be maybe trying to acquire a cert or two.   
Like maybe Googles IT Cert (cause it's kind of cheap) or maybe another CompTIA A+ as my old one is expired and I can't find the cert paper.  
*I did take two while in college, the CCNA and Security+ but I failed and then got swamped with class work to be able to retake them with my voucher.*  


My hope is to possibly fill this work gap with something other than just me saying ""I've been practicing and keeping my skills sharp"" and hope they believe me.  
Because it seems that as long as I have this work gap I'll get no where anytime soon.  


*Some background on this question.*

I graduated with a **B.S. in Computer Information Systems late 2019** and ended up having 2 ""sure hire"" positions straight out of college change their minds due to unforeseen events. Afterwards I've only managed to get a few interviews which sadly none have gone further than the initial phone/zoom interview or the second set of interviews at amazon.

I have **roughly 6 months of working experience (via externships)**. The college I went to was a year-round kind that went on even during the summers, so they did externships (internships but the students are rented out to companies through the school). 

**I've ended up with this 2.5 year work gap as well.** I've been going from late 2019 to now unemployed and looking for a job. I've gotten everything from ""Sorry not enough experience"" to the confusing ""Sorry but you have too much experience"" when trying to find both a career job and just trying to land a job at the nearby businesses.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advanced."

I'm in a position where my husband could probably take care of the bulk of our household expenses with me working part-time (about 20hrs/week up to a max of 30), but that obviously sucks for him in the short term. 

If there's an upside to finishing as quickly as possible (while being able to maintain good grades and work on outside projects, of course) it's something I'd definitely consider, but I've been reading through older posts and it seems most people recommend holding out for the two year mark to get internships.

My main question is that is it better to hold out for an internship or just graduate and see what I can get out of college? My degree will be in IT and I currently hold a CCNA certification. I could take the rest of my classes this summer and graduate at the end. Any suggestions help, thanks."
tnypxy,0,2022-03-25,Which internship offer should I take?,Data_Thug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tnypxy/which_internship_offer_should_i_take/,"I am a masters student with 2 years of work experience, but I don't know which software engineering internship to accept for this summer.  The pay is around $9000/month for each job, but I'd rather focus on long term career opportunities in case get a full-time offer.

**Amazon**

The role is based in Seattle.  They have more prestige, and might look better on a resume.  I have no team or project info.  Intern team matching could even be completely random!  There are many horror stories about the toxic work culture and PIP practices here.

**Verily**

It is a healthcare tech company (formerly Google Life Sciences) in south San Francisco.  As an Alphabet company, they get the same perks as Google.  I would be on a cloud engineering team, which is a familiar area but unrelated to my MS studies (ML).  Unfortunately some Glassdoor reviews suggest it might also be a rough place for developers.

I know, I'm sorry, I hate this question too.  \`I'm pretty sure the standard response will be ""whichever language you are most comfortable with"" (for me personally, its Java by far as it's been my main language for the past \~3 years). However, I am getting to that stage of college where I want to be prepared for coding interviews post-degree and when applying to summer internships next year. The reason I am asking this *specific* question is due to some people making the argument, that it's much better to use a language like Python for coding interviews. As using it will result in a much easier and more readable solution to implement a particular algorithm with.

Any input on this would be greatly appreciated :)"

I'm looking for career advice because I really don't know what to do.

Now in geography bachelor  I'll sridy next year in a GIS master in apprenticeship (not sure how to say this, a master where I'll work in a company half of the week), I started to learn python and database programming on my own to be sure to get a master, I now have basic skills in python, postgresql, pandas.

Thanks to this I found a pretty good summer internship where I'll do python programming in qgis, make some plugins, real time maps with python using an API, standalone GIS scripts, a bit of database management... 

It will be a state internship, and they proposed me to do my apprenticeship at their place next year, probably doing the same thing, so a lot of programming, database etc..

I also got another porosition from a major electricity company for an apprenticeship, I talk with a student who did the same master and worked there and told me that most of the job will be project management : reaching out to different people to program the ground work, doing a lot of follow up, following costs and everything, and a bit of database management but almost no programming.

I don't really know where to go because: 

-  I'm interested in programming and I think I'd learn a lot at the state one (the master is open to poeple with 0 programming experience so I'm afraid we'll go pretty slow) but I won't learn much about project management and I can't get a job at the end of the apprenticeship as I'd have to apply through state offers first 

- I don't really know if I'd be interested in project management, but I know it's the kind of stuff you can't really learn at school or by your own (whereas you can learn programming by yourself, just slower) and usually they hire the student who worked for them at the end of the apprenticeship.



Which one between programming and project management skills do you think is the most valuable when starting a career after a GIS master ?"

I've been in a bad financial spot since. Had a major medical event happen at the beginning of the year which made me even more worried. I didn't have any internships and my grades were good, but they could've been better. I've applied to hundreds of jobs over multiple different sites/apps, interviewed multiple times, and ghosted each time. I got an interview opportunity for a position and bombed the interview, I was exhausted and didn't take it seriously at all. I didn't even ask follow up questions. They sent me an offer a week later with better pay than I expected.
For anyone needing good vibes, hopefully this post gives it to you. I got into college late and was a high school dropout. I've had imposter syndrome since day 1. But I can finally call myself an engineer! Keep pushing on and let's go!"

Humanity was a... newer species to the galaxy. They still looked out at it with a degree of distrust. Their closest allies, the Wexiks, still had yet to so much as learn the coordinates to their homeworld. As such, any human aboard a space station was seen as a learning experience. The concept of pets, pack-bonding, infighting and war games existing under the same species was practically unheard of in the galaxy, and the alien governments and races wondered what other oddities the species could generate...

_

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which was fucking AWESOME. Wexiks made for good company, if a bit easy to tease and confuse from time to time. But, they had lower gravity. Which meant exercises. LOTS of exercises. He strapped the weights to his limbs and left his room for the gym. Many Wexik soldiers were doing their basic PT, lifting weights or doing crunches or the like. There were a few human people aboard the ship too, doing weights at the moment. Ryan decided upon his favorite; cardio. 

""Uh, hey, Rykil, was it?"" The wolf-kobold creature in question looked at him. ""Do you know where the treadmills are?"" Rykil pointed him in a direction. ""Thanks, li-... Rykil,"" Ryan said, catching himself before he caused a diplomatic incident by calling him ""little guy"". Well, Wexiks were generally pretty understanding, so in reality, at worst it probably would've just been slight indignance that Ryan would have to face. But still. Ryan trotted over to the treadmills, investigating the buttons. Where was the... Ah! The jog setting was in small print at the bottom. That was strange. Did Wexiks not jog? Eh. It was whatever. Ryan writ off the oddity as a cultural thing and began his exercise. Oh! He nearly forgot his music! As he jogged, he pressed his earbuds in, letting Mr. Blue Sky motivate him.

_

Rykil huffed in annoyance. Someone left a treadmill on again. It had been going for a full hour on the ""medium speed"" setting. Noone used that setting. The Wexik grumbled his way over to the treadmills, spotting... a gathering of Wexiks around the treadmills. That was strange. Who would be interested in treadmills? Did someone set up some weird game on a treadmill? It would have explained the medium setting for an hour. He shouldered his way through the crowd. He spotted the human, Ryan. On the treadmill. The human who had asked him where the treadmills were an hour ago. No... not a chance...

""He just keeps going,"" muttered someone in the crowd. The abject terror in their voice confirmed it. Had Ryan really been on the medium setting for an hour???

_

Ryan was jamming out to another classical song called ""Running In The 90's"", ignoring his surroundings. The music suddenly paused. He grumbled in annoyance, pulling out his phone and telling the music to continue. Ryan was starting to get a bit winded. Well. Time to crank things up a bit.

_

Rykil stared in utter horror as Ryan set it to Fast, and kept running. And kept running. And kept. RUNNING. It was like something crawled out of his nightmares. He hardly even showed any signs of exertion! As the thought entered his mind, the treadmill shut off automatically. Ryan ran straight into the handholds that Rykil realized he didn't even bother to use. 

_

Ow! Ryan looked at the disobedient treadmill, kicking the defunct machine. He'd have to file a complaint with... everyone was staring at him. 

""Uhm... hi?"" he questioned with uncertainty. ""What did I do?"""

To do this I had to put in 12-hour days of continuous work managing many different things at once.

It has been approximately 20 days since my last exam and I have put in little to no work in studying. I am falling behind on classes (final exams are in a month) and am essentially digging my own grave that could impact the results of what I already completed this term.

From the other posts here, it seems like reviewing basic data structures should be a good start - however, I’m not sure if the questions are more leetcode-y or related to what they do. In terms of prep, would reviewing blind 75 + some DS specific questions be enough or is there a tagged question list somewhere that I should focus on? Also since the interview is for an hour, how many questions are typically asked? 

Also a bit unclear about if there is a system design question for intern interviews.

Any/all help is very much appreciated :-) have a great day!"

I made the executive decision to get off of these meds (venlafaxine, lamotragine, and vraylar) due to the fact that they were simply not working. I have made a few attempts on my life whilst on these medications. My depression Symptoms never really got better after all this time. I was a cutter in Grad school (I was 28 when I went back to school, was working, and had an internship. I was going 7 days a week for like 12 to 14 hours a day for 2 years). My depression was really bad and I did not have a support group I could rely on, I was very stressed, and actively and steadily decompensating the whole time I was there. I was able to muscle through it and get my MSW and eventually got my therapist license. My most recent attempt was about a year+ ago and that was when I made the decision to get my psychiatrist to put a plan in place for me to wean off my meds because things were horrible on the meds and it was worth a shot because I didn't really have anything to lose. If things are as bad as they were on the meds than off the meds, then at least I could save some money on prescriptions and psychiatrist sessions. Anyways the weaning off process for the venlafaxine was fine, no real negative effects on my mood, though processes, or emotional regulation. Now when I was weaning off the Vraylar, things were pretty hairy. Basically all of the symptoms I have experienced during a depression meltdown that led to an attempt, I was experiencing again. It was pretty brutal and it feels like things are getting somewhat better as, even though I was dealing with the same symptoms, there was no impulse to harm or attempt. I just finished the weaning off period and the subsequent 1 month ""cool down"" for the meds to fully get out of my system. I'm still dealing with a lot of symptoms related to what I think is what withdrawals feel like for an addict. I get ""brain zaps"" (google this to get a definition), I still consistently think, fantasize, dream, and plan ending things on my own terms (it actually makes me feel better about my situation fantasizing about ending that pain), I've also been dealing with a lot of anger (I'm a very patient and tolerant person, and I'm not used to having this constant level of anger/frustration lurking underneath). I've been self medicating with lots of weed and going on morning and night drives where I basically vent all my anger and frustration whilst driving (just unloading negative thought after negative thought). A lot of what I think about is previous issues I've had with people who have treated me unfairly and I fantasize about what I could have said. I take the diplomatic route whenever I have a conflict. But these internal narratives about what I should have said are very mean, blunt, angry, and vicious. My temper is much more labile than it has been in my life.  I'm used to turning the other cheek when people (usually my family) treat me unfairly, are mean or judgmental, are just plain rude. Now I'm more likely to go on a vicious and mean tirade when someone says something mean or ignorant. I don't know if this a good thing or not. On one hand I'm standing up for myself (I've spent most of my life getting shit on by my family and I and no recourse  but to grin and bear it) but on the other hand I have the capacity to be very mean and in extreme detail (I've been fat shamed pretty much by my entire family and the most recent family member that gave me shit, I went off on and basically used my keen observation skills to put this whole family member's life on blast). Of course my family is acting like I'm the crazy one and am out of line for defending myself. Anyways, I'm on week one of the weaning off period and I'm still dealing with emotional disregulation (openly sobbing combined with negative thoughts, anger, anxiety/panic attacks etc.). My question is has anyone had any personal experience with weaning off of anti depressants after a long period of time? And if so, how long do these withdrawal symptoms from not being on meds last? Will it get better after everything is completely out of my system? 

Thanks for reading my mini biography. I appreciate it By advice anyone has"

Isn't it another feasible route that while being self taught, to also get exposure to a real life environment on how things are actually done?

The internship itself could give you an edge when applying for a full time job (or even a full time job at the company that you interned at), rather than spending months trying to craft a portfolio of applications that would have minimal real life value,if any.

Thoughts on this?

NOTE: I am NOT saying that you shouldn't apply for full time jobs from the get go, but just curious on the internship route which is less frequently discussed here."

There is some sort of ambiguity about this, as another newgrad that was hired with me got hinted that that might not actually be true.

I also plan to go back to University for a Data Science Bachelor+Master in Finland, which is a place I absolutely love and where I want to live. I took a test for it and scored very high, so it's very likely I'll get in. I'll know it for sure in June. 

Now, I got contacted yesterday by a Finnish company, which is offering me a position as a Data Analyst trainee during the summer. 
We will have a call next week to discuss a possible starting time and lenght of the internship, which could potentially last until I start my classes. I'm also doing a part time, 1-month long trainership as a Data Analyst, so I know I like that job too, but I absolutely love Data Science. 

My initial plan was ""if I get hired in June I will ask for remote work and/or will follow lesson remotely and maybe go in Finland only to take the exams. The first year of classes will be easy, and I could take part of the second year classes too. After the first year I planned to move permanently to Finland and find a job there.

I don't want to put the Finnish company in a bad spot in the case I was hired here and had to ghost them last minute. But I also want to do my best interest.

Master in CS in Europe specialising in Data Science. I have three internships, two in R&amp;D (one in an european multinational, one in a legacy tech company from Finland) and I am due to start one now at a FAANG (not Amazon but also not Google) in Europe (Switzerland) in software engineering (Machine Learning (NLP)). My internship will end in September.

All of my internships are highly technical. I am considering applying for Google's APM in autumn as I am not a huge fan of being a software engineer. However, I don't know what I could do to help improve my chances since my CV is too technical. When one doesn't have enough tech in a CV, usually a project or two solves this problem; but what can I do when I lack a sort of ""business"" aspect of the CV? The way I see it I have a zero % chance of passing the resume screening because of this. I am sort of familiar with the interviews of APM as a friend of mine went through it and I interviewed for a MBB tech-related job (not saying its the same but I guess its closer than the leetcodes I did for my current internship) but would also appreciate tips on that, although for now my biggest concern is the resume screening.

Also: Can I apply for the APM in the US? I am a EU citizen so it would undoubtedly be easier to apply here, but I would very much like to experience the US once while I'm still young. I don't know what the visa procedure would be in this case? If I would depend on H1B I consider it zero chance too."

toojrz,122,2022-03-26,ever wonder how those kids do everything? let me tell you something,Dry_Mycologist9431,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/toojrz/ever_wonder_how_those_kids_do_everything_let_me/,"ok so before i start this post, please do note that not everyone is like this. but a lot of them are.

do you also wonder? how those kids get 4.0+ GPAs, took college classes with straight As, incredible ECs with global reach, compete internationally for a sport, nationally recognized for something multiple times, and insane research internships all at the same time?

i'm actually in a close circle with a lot of those people. before, i used to hate on myself for not being as accomplished as them despite having the same 24 hrs (technically). but after actually working/knowing those people, it made me feel good about myself for actually being honest with my work.

those people are indeed smart, very smart. if you ask them on how they could do so much, most just say ""time management"", ""balance"", or simply ""im so passionate in what i do that i sometimes skip meals working on it and i dont notice.""

how do they run that super massive NPO (partnered with govt departments, ivy leagues, international reach) while doing research and doing so good in school? very fucked up leadership system. most of these students are the founders of these NPOs. i actually worked under someone with the same profile and its literally a mess behind the scenes. if you view the NPOs instagram page/website, you're going to think that its so professional and the numbers displayed on their website are so amazing. but in reality, those events are so awful that the founder just ghosts the program (and appear once in a while) and let the people under her do all the work. one time i worked under an NPO of a very accomplished bay area kid and that person pressured us to recruit a lot of people overseas just so we can claim that we have a big international reach. but hey since they're the founder they can use all the achievements done by the people under them for the resume right? yeaah that's what they do.

for some of them, they host events once every 6 months but with great attendance numbers. so if they ran that NPO since freshman year and each event has around 200 attendees, they can put on their resume that they ""reached"" 1200+ students by the start of senior yr and call it a day. they put it on their application that they work on their NPOs at least 8 hours a week but they literally only do that on the weeks or months of their event.

so speaking about ECs, most of them only spend a couple of hours on ECs but spend a lot of time on research/academics/community college classes. most of the work for those NPOs are not by done by them (cant stress this enough. not saying they dont do anything though). but they can use it on their resume because they're on top of the organizational structure. all the people that i've met who are actually very hands on on their organizations and ECs don't have a lot of research and college classes on their resume. because it's just nearly impossible to pull it all off.

ever wonder how that kid got amazing research opportunities? if you look into it pretty well, they have relatives at stanford, harvard, or something. how do i know? im acquainted with someone who just said they ""cold emailed"" professors  but the lab of the PI they worked in is literally a friend of their dad who's a professor at stanford.

also a big common denominator among these people is that they live very comfortable lives, and most of the time, have very stable support systems. so if you think you are not doing much compared to them, please be kinder to yourself. those kids could literally only think of school and college and resumes without worrying about how to support the family or how to pay for those expensive summer programs.

i wrote this post just to remind everyone that not everyone who just says they are ""passionate"" are truly passionate. high numbers don't equal passion. prestigious awards are not passion. the system is fucking shitty. as much as AOs keep saying they focus on ""passion"" but the truth is, they can't determine pure passion from essays, extracurriculars, and stats. and please, some people say you can see someone's passion through essays. yes, in some. it is indeed a better indicator of passion than numbers but it can still be faked.

so to all those people who feel that they're not doing enough, we were just not given the same parents, living conditions, etc as those people. please give yourself a pat in the back :)  


edit: just want to add, a couple of my acquaintances with the same background are now in college and the NPOs they started are now dead and inactive. that says something"

There’s obviously a big push for software engineers to be obtained by companies through bootcamps and/or people who go the self-taught route. I went through the “traditional” route of getting a BS in Comp Sci, but I’m curious to hear what people think about their majors? Do you think it’s super vital that you need to go to college in order to be a good developer - or is it more of a societal pressure to get a degree in order to seem like a legitimate candidate for the industry? And if you do think your degree is really important, what specific classes do you think you’ll use when you are working in the industry? What percentage of classes are relevant to what you’ll be eventually doing during your day-to-day?

The reason I’m asking is because I want to know what people’s perception of the industry is based on what they’ve learned in school. If you’ve had an internship before, you’ve probably gotten a taste of similarities and differences between the curriculum/coursework versus practical applications in the corporate world, but regardless, what are THE most important things you need to know?

My list is:
Object oriented programming
Data structures and algorithms
Testing fundamentals
System design (maybe OS)
Learning a language and building apps

This is what I think is important to know in order to be successful. (I’ve also included more info here - totally optional if you’re interested https://youtu.be/bfRgXChfnt8 )"

Spring Break is over tomorrow, and despite having my lesson plans together, I really have no idea what I’m doing. I don’t know how I’m supposed to teach grieving students while still I’m grieving.

We were doing pretty well last grading period despite students getting used to the fact that I actually expect them to do work, but now I have no idea how the rest of the year will go.

tor6kn,2,2022-03-26,Choosing between CMU ECE and ETHz EEIT for MSc (Fall '22),smj_007,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tor6kn/choosing_between_cmu_ece_and_ethz_eeit_for_msc/,"Hey everyone, I'd like all your opinions on choosing between CMU ECE and ETH Zurich EEIT for MSc this fall. After my master's, I plan to work in industry (preferably a research engineer role, or just as an SDE and transfer internally), and grow in the research division of a top company.

Some important points to consider:

1) The tuition fee at CMU is very high. The CMU ECE program lasts 1.5 years, costing around $115k, with the option of doing a summer internship. However, ETHz is very cheap and comes to around $28-30k all included for 2 years, and won't come with heavy debt/loan repayment.



2) As of now, I hope to get a job after I finish my MSc (ML research engineer roles hopefully, but I might have to start off with SDE). For CMU, given that it's in the US and it has a brand name, it's easier to get a job and usually pays a little more than well-paying EU jobs. For ETHz, the brand name helps a bit too but it's tough to get a job in Zurich: people often go to Germany, the Netherlands, etc for a job. The fact that it's a bit tougher to get a job in the EU compared to the US is also a point of concern.



3) I plan to graduate from ETH Zurich in 2 years (might extend to 2.5 for an internship). CMU ECE lasts for 1.5 years. I would be $30k in debt for ETHz, and $115k in debt for CMU ECE. However, I can also earn from a job in the extra 6-8 months after CMU ECE, possibly bringing my debt down to $70-80k at the two-year mark.



4) To start off with, my long-term interest has always been to settle in the US as I have a lot of relatives there. But on the contrary, I hear a lot about work-life balance being better in the EU. Is this a significant factor I need to take into account in my decision?



CMU ECE has very good placements from what I've heard, considering that they have common job fairs with CMU's CS Department. However, there are barely any placement stats for ETH EEIT on LinkedIn/online, so in case any ETH grad student is reading this, do let me know in the comments section or via DM about how job prospects are for EEIT grads in the EU. I would love to hear your views on this. Thanks a lot in advance!

I’m looking for some tech internships for this summer (or the fall). Im mostly looking into AI /Machine learning internships, but haven’t been able to find any for high schoolers. I’ve seen a lot of people on this sub talking about getting a tech internship, and was wondering how you guys are able to find some for high schoolers. Any guidance or information would be highly appreciated!

Thanks!"
toya43,4,2022-03-26,How do to get out of the rut of my IT Career? Advice Needed.,kleptokitten106,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/toya43/how_do_to_get_out_of_the_rut_of_my_it_career/,"Background: I've been in the IT field for 4 years. I've had a range of IT jobs from Desktop Support and Printer Support to Application Packaging and Deployment Technician (think SCCM and Active Directory) and Jr. System Administrator. I am currently a Jr. System Administrator. With every new IT job I start, I start at the bottom and have been promised I'll move up to the position I was hired for within 6 months time. All of the positions, I don't move up at all. When I find out I am going to be stuck on the bottom without a chance to prove myself, I quit the job.

Why stay there if I am not going to do what I was hired for?

Problem: I'm not getting any closer to my career goal. I have the skills to be at a higher position. I don't have the certs or degree to prove it.

Career Goal: Digital Forensics Analyst or Incident Response Analyst

Education: IN PROGRESS- Bachelor's degree in Digital Forensics and Computer Investigations with a certificate in Cybersecurity and Forensic Accounting.

Expected Graduation: May 2023.

Certifications: A+ . I've been looking into online courses that give you a piece of paper to prove you know the skills, like Udemy or ECC's Codered. Don't have time with my full time job and full time classes to dedicate to certs at this time. Even if I did, I don't know where to start.

Resources like  [https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/)  are great to see what's out there, bad if you don't know where to start to get where your goal.

Job Exp: Mostly hands-on Desktop Support and Printer Support, Application Packaging/Deployment, Jr. System Admin.

How did I get these without a degree? Most of them were desperate for an extra pair of hands. For the ones that I needed to prove myself in an interview, I answered the questions the best I could and said ""I don't know, but I can research and learn about it"" for things I had no clue about. Taking the initiative is key.

Options:

Do I keep my job as long as possible for the title of Jr. System Admin for my resume in hopes it will have more value than other technical requirements?

Do I quit my job and dedicate my energy to completing my degree and certs? (I have the financial means to do so)

Do I quit my job and get an internship relating to my career goal instead?

Anything else that would actually help move towards my career goal?"
tp2qxo,2,2022-03-26,Should I stick it out or quit?,marysame,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/tp2qxo/should_i_stick_it_out_or_quit/,"So, August 2021 I graduated with a Master’s degree in Human Resources and Employee Relations. In September I started a new job as a HR Generalist for an insurance company that sells group insurance. The reason I was so quick to snag this job was because I had zero experience in HR. Internships weren’t allowed during my time in grad school because of covid. Upon getting hired, they stated that after Q4 they expected me to get my insurance license which I agreed to do because I was just happy to get a job and open for anything. 

Fast forward 6 months, I hate this job. I don’t do anything related to HR and I’m pretty much the bitch for the people who sell insurance to the groups. I’ve stated so many times I went to school for HR and that it’s the path I want to go down. However, they always come back with that Benefits is part of HR and that I am doing HR. While, they are somewhat correct, I don’t believe that selling insurance is the same as HR. They also keep saying I’ll be on the HR side of things soon but it’s been months. They keep referring that I’ll eventually be an account manager for the groups. 

Anyways, they expect me to take my test for my license in the next few weeks but I haven’t studied or put any effort into because I have ZERO interest to take it or go down this route. 

While you may be thinking it’s obvious I should quit but I don’t have any jobs lined up. I’ve seriously debated going back to my bartending job while I look for a new job because the money is damn near equivalent, but I wouldn’t have health insurance. And I am getting some experience related to HR, just not what I’m looking for. 

They also are very short staffed and I like everyone I work with. I know I’d really let them down if I left, but I just know this career isn’t for me. I feel like I’m wasting my time. 

Should I stick this out?"

tp38en,4,2022-03-26,How much does the peer group matter while selecting a Master's program for CS?,banenvy,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tp38en/how_much_does_the_peer_group_matter_while/,"So I have 2 options for my MS. Purdue MSCS and JHU MSCS. Finances are not an issue which is where I think most people draw the distinction. Here is what I've noticed.

JHU pros:

* Great school in terms of innovative research
* Small teacher student ratio (total number of students is 30). Not sure if this proves to be an advantage at the career fairs.
* Subjects of my interest (application of computers in genomics, in neurosci)
* I think faculty is also better because it's private.
* closer to big cities like NYC and DC than Purdue 

JHU cons:

* Acceptance rate is high (as high as 41%, so many students I've interacted with have scores  and undergrad GPA less than I do, but more experience in the industry than I do)
* I can't find the employment statistics anywhere.

Purdue pros:

* many students have higher scores and experience than mine.
* is a good school too! Employment statistics clearly show students are doing well.
* acceptance rate is lower than Purdue, as low as 20%

Purdue cons:

* is far from all tech hubs
* cohort size is 40-60 students per class. Number of enrolled students is as high as 500.
* I've heard that the department doesn't make many AI courses available. Only basic ml and stat courses are made available. 
* I'm an Indian and I will be surrounded by more Indians at purdue, and I won't get to experience a new cultural environment. 

About me:

* I'm passionate about AI in healthcare, my research work so far aligns accordingly as well. But I haven't explored working in the industry, which is what I want to try after graduating. I want to work for a few years in the industry and then decided whether or not I want to pursue a PhD.
* GPA: 9.35 (from a tier 3 university) graduated in '21.
* GRE 319 165Q 154V
* TOEFL: 112
* 3 research internships and 2 publications.

So ultimately it comes down to the fact that I at jhu I'll get a good time exploring what I like and interacting with the professors, while at purdue I'm definitely going to get a good set of peers who might push me to be better, but professors might be overburdened to pay more  attention towards all students."

Now I am an intern in engineering company but I couldn't find what I expected from engineering I mean I can't live like this same place same people struggling for what?

Actually, I think I don't like working life. using transportation to go work. Sitting at work trying to be nice all the time. Trying to look like working hard when you had done what you have to do. Faking when you are not in mood.

So, I want to live like travelling while working I think I can live like digital nomad forever. But it doesn't look possible to work like that with engineering. Also world economy is fucked up due to war etc also I live in Turkey its also fucked up.

So, to sum up I studied 4 years engineering at the end of my study I found out I don't like. Generally working life. I can work like remote. But it looks not possible with engineering. I have little back up with programming but still I need to study a lot. I think I can't get hired 3 months later with this knowledge. Any advice?"

This has been something I've worried about for years now. Ever since I started coding, I've always had the habit of including profanity in my function names or specifications. It never impacted me because I always just wrote code for myself and school assignments didn't really check that kind of stuff. They just checked if it passed test cases. Now, I've begun applying to a fuck ton of internships this year and this means a handful of OAs as well.

I realized at a certain point my profanity was inappropriate in a professional environment and that I would have to either force myself to stop or check before submission. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. Unfortunately, due to the rather incredibly high volumes of profanity in my code, I always miss a couple when I submit stuff. This has rather not worked out for me. I've received responses from a couple of my assessments detailing their strict regulations of being professional which has led me to be rejected. Some companies didn't seem to mind with some recruiters not blinking an eye during my in-person assessment.

Now, I am curious if profanity is rather accepted in the professional environment. I don't want to offend anyone and I don't want to ruin my chances in future opportunities. I have tried countless times to stop but I can't. Do I need to go to therapy? Or is this okay?"

**Essays**

CommonApp Essay: wrote about piano, talked about how I enjoyed creating something that was beautiful. For everything except Harvard, I connected playing that music piece to a surgery. For Harvard, I connected playing that music piece to creating technology. Showed it to a few of my friends and my AP Lit teacher, and they said it was written really well (idk if they're just making me feel good or if they were actually being genuine lol)

Harvard Supplement: pretty much gave a whole autobiography, but I think I wrote it pretty well. I talked about my identity as an Asian Christian, my community, friends, family, etc. Showed it to a few of my friends and my AP Lit teacher and they said it was written hella well (again, I can't tell if I actually did a good job lol)

In the Harvard update, I mentioned that I had been set for ISEF (at a branching science fair), confirmed to be working directly with that group of business owners, and mentioned that we got 3rd in the state for Science Bowl (results only came a few weeks after I had submitted my application)"

* UIUC for their MS Statistics program, concentration in Analytics
* GA Tech for their MS Analytics (on-campus), concentration in Computational Data Analytics

However, I face the (sweet) dilemma of choosing between them, and I'm terrified of making the wrong choice. Here are a few criteria that I'm thinking about:

1. Statistics vs Analytics: I think getting a Statistics program has its own merit, hedging the risk of the data science hype dwindling in the long run.
2. Access to computing classes: Both UIUC and GA Tech are very reputable for their engineering/computer science disciplines.

* GA Tech's MSA, esp. my concentration, gives better access to their CS classes, up to 6/10
* while UIUC's one focuses mainly on Statistics (\~3/10 CS classes max), which the school's department rank significantly lower (top 40) compared to its CS department (top 10).

1. Employer's perception: Not sure about this one. However, with the surplus of GA Tech's OMSA (online MS in Analytics) up to 600 graduating every year, without the ""online"" part in their master's diploma, I'm worried GA Tech MSA, even on-campus one, will be considered less selective by employers. Anyone could shed a light on this one?
2. Career support, internship chance, and other criteria related to job placement?
3. Cost: GA Tech is more expensive per term, but if I can finish the program in 1 year, which is intense, the total cost would be around the same for UIUC's 1.5 - 2 years.
4. Location is not a problem for me since I'm an international student and will have to relocate anyway
5. Any other criteria that I'm missing?

&amp;#x200B;

My background: International student; Bachelor in business/econ; 2 yoe as Data Analyst, 3 years as Data Scientist in my home country

My aims: Solidify my fundamentals, get a Data Scientist job in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

Would appreciate it if you guys could provide any insights to help me make the right decision. Thank you very much.

Edit: Since UIUC still gets a decent amount of votes, but no comments (UIUC 23 - 26 Gatech at time of edit). If you vote UIUC, could you please also provide some reasoning? Thanksss

First of all, I started my developer career by getting an internship position as a full stack developer 2 months ago. Currently we have four members including me in the team. Two of them are tech lead engineers who mostly work with backend. And the another one is a junior developer who has some experiences. (He mostly work with frontend). and I'm a newbie. 

So far, I've been achieving/doing tasks without any problems. Ofc there have been some obstacles while doing the tasks but I did it anyway. However Idk why worries and negative thoughts keep coming. It makes me keep doubting myself and wanna give up in the middle. It's like 'Dang... Idk how to build APIs using Nestjs  and I have no idea how to write test code. It looks like I'm the only one who has no idea how to do this. I feel so much stupid.' 'Dang.. there are too many things I have to study ... (sigh...)... but it seems my learning speed is toooo much slow.... compared to the task I should do later..'

Have you ever felt such these feeling before too?? If you have, how did you overcome it?? 

Can you give me some advice/encouragement so I can keep going forward??

I've seen anecdotes about people leaping to FAANG or adjacent companies, after achieving a 3.5 or lower GPA. My problem is sort of the reverse - I get decent grades at school (averaging a 3.92 on a quarterly basis), but I struggle with pulling myself to work on projects or grinding out LeetCode. I don't believe that it is a time constraint problem, as I do find myself with pockets of free time across the weekday and even more so on the weekends, so I'm not a ""grind"" as a certain Cal Newport would put it. I find it doubly difficult to find the motivation as we're nearing the end of the traditional recruiting period for Summer 2022.

At the same time, I *know* that if I can bring myself to improve over this period of time, I'll be setting myself up well for next year. And at this point, I need to, given my graduation next year and lack of any internships.

So beyond the traditional motivation question, **for those who did well in school, how did you structure or bring yourself to grind for the next step beyond?**"

Need ko po ng tulong about sa direction ko after graduating this December 2022. I am a senior BS Accountancy student currently taking my internship in one of the Big 4 Firms. The workload is fine and Im not pressured naman but I dont know if I want to pursue a career in audit firms in the long run. I tried applying din sa private companies and FMCGs for an internship to test the waters but they didnt reply (im not accepted) sadt. I am an average student lang kasi and I only have 1 leadership position which is nung sophomore year pa. Isa ko pang dilemma is if I really need to strive for that CPA license. Many people nagsasabi na hindi naman ganun nagmamatter CPA license and ang important is technical skills and work experience. 
I just want to know your opinions about my situation. My goal is to be a 6-digit earner by Year 2 or Year 3 after graduation.  I outlined yung mga possible paths ko after December 2022 and here they are:

Option 1.) Audit firm associate (Big 4) -&gt; Take May 2023 CPALE -&gt; Apply in a private/fmcg company in 2024
Pros: Foundation and CPA license
Cons: Very low salary sa start and stress sa preparation sa boards kasi sabay review and work; heavy workload din daw kapag associate na talaga huhu
(Personally alanganin ako as of the moment for this option as I dont know if makakasurvive ako sa low salary since I will be a breadwinner next year) 

Option 2.) Freelancing sa Upwork or OLJ -&gt; i wont take CPALE siguro? 
Pros: Medium to high salary, WFH, multiple clients pwede
Cons: Mahirap maghanap clients; I need to upskill pa and know Xero and QB and IDK how, need ba may certifications yan or course? Not sure rin if need ba to have that CPA degree to have foreign clients

Option 3.) Apply sa BPO like AR or AP specialist -&gt;  Apply to other companies after 3-6 months (Basically this option is job hopping from one position to another) 
ps. IDK if necessary ba CPA license for this option
Pros: Relatively higher salary compared to Option 1
Cons: Toxic daw sa BPO; less room for skill growth

Option 4.) FMCG entry level/managerial position -&gt; Take CPALE May 2023
(To good to be true for me) 
Pros: Medium to high salary; good opportunities for career growth
Cons: Toxic corporate culture; Mahirap makapasok, internship pa nga lang di na ko tinanggap :(

Option 5.) Take MBA -&gt; Take May 2023 CPALE -&gt; Then saka palang magapply for job
Pros: Built my resume well
Cons: katamad na magaral; no income siguro kasi need to focus pa ulit sa study and review


Please feel free to add options po if may naiisip kayo if youre in my position. I badly need help po and IDK what path to take. And possible pa rin kaya to reach 6 digits during my Year 2 or 3? huhu
Please tell me ano po kaya the best among the options huhuhuhu
I will really appreciate your thoughts and advice!"

I don’t have any familial ties to the EU so no potential route to citizenship/visas that way. I have 21 months of full time work experience at a public health non profit in between my undergraduate and graduate degrees. My internship this summer is at a big 4 consulting firm in healthcare consulting and next summer I’ll have another internship before graduating in 2024.

So far my plan is to either blindly apply to jobs in the UK for upon my graduation or hope for a return offer from an internship, work for a few years, and then ask about transfers to positions in international offices. I’m also open to other countries in Europe like the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Germany to name a few.

tpfttk,9,2022-03-27,How to choose?,distaf,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/tpfttk/how_to_choose/,"I have only Tufts left for decisions and out of 15 schools I gave only gotten into safeties: Arizona State, Montana State, Oregon State, and Chapman. I am essentially set between Oregon State and Chapman.

I was also offered guaranteed transfer admission to BU for September of 2023, which is a likely choice that I will end up taking. While I will most likely end up transferring, I might not and so I want to choose the college that’ll give me a good first year experience but also the potential to have an amazing four years there if I do remain to stay.

For Chapman I am going in undeclared but I have expressed interest toward Math and for Oregon and BU I applied Mathematics. If I were to commit to Math I would choose Applied Maths with a focus on data science and a minor in CS. However, I’m not 100% set on Math and also want to explore civil and industrial engineering courses.

I received scholarships for both Chapman and OSU and i’ll be paying around 55k for chapman a year vs. 35k a year for Oregon. So even though Oregon is OOS is still a cheaper option than Chaoman, although cost is a not a huge factor in my decision process.

Chapman Pros: 
* Prestige, post grad opportunities, internship opportunities 
* Dining 
* Small class sizes + student teacher ratio 
* Close to many different places, including Irvine, Disneyland, LA, the beach 
* Orange is a really quaint and cute town

Oregon State Pros: 
* Large Campus 
* Great on campus services + activities. The recreational center is much better compared to Chapman and there seems to be more clubs and events 
* Corvallis is a great college town (top 10 or smth) 
* Better math and engineering department 
* More diversity of courses and majors than Chapman -Large amount of funding and land grants 
* Naturey, granola vibe. I love to hike, smoke weed, ski, and it seems like I’d fit well in Oregon. 
* Cheaper 
* Big (35k students)

Chapman Cons 
* Upper class white greek life douches 
* It seems like you must join greek life or athletics to have a social life 
* Small athletic center, smaller amount of student services and activities than OSU 
* Small (7k students) 
* Less developed engineering and math major, the school seems to mainly be focused towards business and film 
* Expensive

Oregon Cons 
* White greek life douches 
* Whiter than chapman (61% vs 51%) 
* Somewhat isolated, it’s like an hour from the coast and 45 min from Portland 
* I’ve read the dining options aren’t great 
* Larger class sizes 
* OSU being a research school will have professors focused simply on research, quality of instruction is inconsistent between classes and professors 
* Not many career choices in Corvallis

Overall, it really does feel like choosing the lesser of two evils :( and I am not sure how to proceed. I am so scared of choosing bad and being stuck at a college I heavily dislike for a year."

To top it off it turns out I don't even want to do CS, I want to work in IT but 18 year old me never knew the difference and I've spent too much aid on my track to switch over now when CS will qualify me to pursue an IT career anyway. 

Anyways I don't really know what to do as a backup plan now. I'm trying to slog through this last stretch for college but I'm burnt out and running on fumes. I've got no problem pursuing a trade certification instead, joining the military, or even working in a warehouse while I take some time off from school. I honestly want to succeed and put enough food on the table to support myself, but everything in my program feels designed by intention to sabotage my education. 

I figure if I pursue trade certifications for IT that will get me to the same end point I actually desire, or if I joined the Air Force I could find similar opportunities in tech specialization there. None of this is an issue of laziness, I just feel like I exist in a culture that doesn't want to foster or support my success. The nature of college as an extended adolescence doesn't help.

What should I do?"

I've been learning about programming for more than 1 year and have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and javascript, and already made some mini projects with it. Now I'm currently learning to react. I'm actually following the frontend roadmap from kamranahmedse, but I'm still confused about what to do after all that has been studied.

So, this is my problem that makes me overthink all the time :

1. First,  I'm confused about what kind of project to make that can be useful (I mean really useful for myself and other people) and how to implement my programming knowledge to it.
2. Second of all, I want to make money from my programming knowlegde by making stuff. I mean, if the way is to make web applications, what is the right way to build and get money from it?
3. Last, I'm only 16 years old so I can't do an internship or work as a freelancer on websites like fiver, Upwork, etc.

So, all the problems above can be simplified into this question: What kind of knowledge should I learn by this time and what step should I take next to make it a project?

 It would be great to actually get feedback from what I've been doing throughout this time.  BTW, thank you so much for helping me, really appreciate it!"

Hey guys, im still new in this programming world, i only know C and some python so far, out of all of the fields I’ve read about i think Data Science (specifically ML) is what im most interested in… what would you guys consider a good path to follow to get into that field? For some reason it feels like i will need to know a lot of ML and Data Science to start getting jobs, but maybe there are some little projects, internships and stuff that can teach you and give you experience? Thanks!

I recently bought a ML course in Udemy, hope that gives me enough tools to get entry lvl jobs?

Edit: would you guys say Anaconda, Jupiter labs is needed or essential for it? I keep reading about it but im not a fan of it, so if its not necessary i would just continue using Pycharm"
tpk0kn,4,2022-03-27,Hard to change jobs due to benefits?,resko99,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/tpk0kn/hard_to_change_jobs_due_to_benefits/,"Hi all,

I have been working in the same company for over 15yrs. I like it for the following reasons:

1.Good pay($87k) I consider that as good pay.

2. 7.5hrs workdays

3. 4miles to my house (8 miles round trip)

4. low stress

5.Good benefits, I mean really good  (I have 4.5 weeks of vacation, and over 1000 hours of sick time available which I have accumulated, yes over 1000). Health insurance is not the high deductible, just $15 or $20 copay...and of course, the weekly premium, which is not high at all, compared to friends at other places.

Negatives:

1. Employer almost never wants to promote from within
2. Opportunity to move up, grow professionally, almost none existent
3. I like what I do, but it has become boring and I feel like an assembly line, even though it is an office job...I have 2 master's degrees, and I am currently being told to go out in the field and do intern level work... I am all game for helping, but this project will take over 8yrs that I am being asked to do and it will end my career progress (which I didn't have to begin with, but this will K.O)
4. I am not miserable, but I feel like I have overstayed my welcome by about 10yrs.

Now, I just received an offer from another company, as I am applying to see what is out there. The job I am being offered offers:

1. New job title, it is a career change, which I actually like... a project coordinator position at a huge company.
2. Pay is the same, but room to move up about $20k
3. Also, this position within 2yrs. will open other doors for me.
4. Commute goes from 8miles round trip to 40miles.
5. Health insurance will be high deductible ($3500)
6. Vacation from current 4.5 to 3 weeks
7. Sick time from over 1000hrs to 10days.

I would love to leave for a new more challenging opportunity which long term will benefit my career, I think. But these side perks, vacation, sick time, commute...just make it difficult for me to decide.

Sorry for the lengthy post, but any suggestions/advice... please feel free to share."

tplsm6,3,2022-03-27,Need advice: AP does not like me and it’s negatively effecting my evaluation score (this is long i’m sorry),ragekay13,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/tplsm6/need_advice_ap_does_not_like_me_and_its/,"Background: i’m a second year teacher, 24 (f), im a class sponsor and im very active around school, i’ve developed relationships with people from basically every department (teachers, admin, clerical, guidance, facilities, security) and the students are fantastic and love me and my class. I work at the #1 high school in my district and I have loved every second of it. Everyone is very nice and helpful, im supplied with all the resources and supplies I need for my classroom, and we have a 4 day school week so I have fridays off. This year I have started to not like working there because there is a new AP who does not like me at all. At first she liked me but all of a sudden things randomly changed.

I’ve had THREE observations with her since October- the first she liked but wanted me to redo so I could get a better score, the second was a shit show due to her not communicating with me at all (I will explain later), and the third she lied about everything and gave me a bad score. 

Second observation: In my contract she is supposed to ask me for a pre conference and email me a reflection/planning sheet that I need to provide at the conference. I never received any of those and she never asked to meet for a pre conference. She also never asked for a lesson plan so 5 minutes before the observation, she asked me for one and then got mad at me when I told her that I don’t have one to give her. Because she never asked me for one, she ended up not being able to give me points for half of the sections in my evaluation since she “didn’t know what I was doing and I didn’t seem to have planned.” That gave me a really bad score and the district said I needed a support coach, who is actually amazing and helpful. 

Third observation: I wrote a lengthy pre conference reflection paper, I initiated a pre conference meeting, I provided a lesson plan and copies of my lesson materials, and I had my mentor look over everything prior and she approved of everything as well. In my pre conference, my AP suggested I tweak some stuff and approved of my exit ticket (kahoot at the end of the lesson). I took her advice and edited my lesson accordingly. The day of, she comes in and stays for about an hour. My lesson was about natural resources and how everything we use essentially comes from natural resources. To start my lesson, I asked students to give me a run down of their morning routines and I wrote them on the board. After I got a few, I chose random items from the list and asked the class where they think that item originally came from. After that I handed out 40 index cards with pictures of every day items to each group. I told each group member to randomly pick a card and complete a concept web identifying 6 associations they can make with that item (how it’s made, ingredient, material, etc). After that, each group had to categorize the items by its source: farms, factories, stores, natural resources. Once they completed that, we categorized them as a class and talked about which ones they didn’t agree with. Then we did the kahoot. 

Well during my post-conference she said: 
-she didn’t understand the lesson and how asking their morning routines was relevant. 
-She didn’t understand how i checked for student comprehension and i told her that is what the graphic organizer and concept wen was for, which she approved of prior but now she said she doesn’t like them. 
-I should’ve explained what farms, stores, factories, and natural resources were to my 14-15 year old students and that they didn’t understand the lesson because they didn’t know what they were. My students knew what each one was and they weren’t confused at all… She even asked a group if they were confused because of it and they said no it’s self explanatory. 
-She didn’t approve of my kahoot and didn’t think it properly identifies student mastery of the learning target. She literally told me she liked and approved of my kahoot questions in my pre conference so when told her that, she said that she “didn’t tell me to do anything, never said that, and she didnt make me do anything.”
-In my pre conference, she liked how the group assignment allowed for group discussion, academic conversation, and debates using their prior knowledge. But after, she said how it was pointless to have students debate with one another over the sources because half of them said stores/factories while others said natural resources/factories. The whole point of the lesson was to have them come to an agreement together by discussing their opinions/arguments. I knew half of them would have the wrong answer but once they discussed amongst each other, the same students would change their opinions. -She said I didn’t provide evidence and she couldn’t tell if students understood the lesson so she said to give her the evidence at the end of the day and she would change my score for that section. I gave her the evidence an hour after but she never ended up changing it. 
-She said I don’t plan and didnt know how to. My major is secondary social science education. I’ve had two internships and wouldn’t have been able to pass my classes and graduate if I didn’t know how to plan. I’ve written so many lesson plans and probably 10+ 30 page lesson plans during my last 2-3 years of college. If you are an education major you know how tedious lesson planning was. 

Its been over a month since- i’ve emailed her twice about my observation asking if she has reviewed the evidence and she hasn’t answered a single email. She completely went against everything she said to me in my pre conference. Why approve of my lesson but then say you don’t like what I planned after I had my observation? My support coach and mentor have observed me multiple times and have even reviewed that lesson/score and they both disagree with everything she said and that the score she gave me does not reflect my teaching and what they’ve seen. They’ve  told me to start documenting everything and to be my own best advocate. My support coach told me to read between the lines of what she was saying because she couldn’t directly say that didn’t like what my AP was doing. I even told my aunt, who is an AP in another district, about the situation and she was appalled by the situation and agreed with me. 

Am I overthinking this? Am I wrong to think that she is purposely trying to give me a bad score? Im stressed because my 3 year contract is up next year and I don’t want this to cause my school to not want to extend my contract all because my AP has something against me. 

 I’m sorry this is so long but I would love to hear everyone’s thoughts."

tpm867,2,2022-03-27,degree choices for non game entertainment technology development/research?,bdai4,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/tpm867/degree_choices_for_non_game_entertainment/,"Hello, at the moment I am a high schooler interested in research  for the technology of animated and live action films after initially just aiming to become an animator. I apologize to intrude on this forum but I had some questions on how one should choose their degree and how it may differ between different sectors of entertainment. 

I initially thought of computer science because I felt it was the science closest to production film technology already with computer graphics, but I began to get nervous because there isn't a lot of information on structuring a computer science degree aiming for the film industry, what kind of internships one could do near the film industry, and the fact I'm not sure what applications/projects  I would do outside of class since some of the few forums I could find say that they became tech artists on the job after experience with the animated film industry, so I thought that it would be better to learn them in sequence such as becoming a production animator first then studying the underlying science on the job or returning back to school for computer science or any other science used in the field, but
I equally worry about the returns of an animation major as well, what opportunities I will have if the industry doesn't think I am ready after graduation, but I will likely have the same amount of competition in a CS major at least where many people have been studying for traditional paths in software engineering with clear projects they have been working on after class and I have just been trying to waddle towards film software and technology.

It's hard to know the 'broader' degree to pursue because it's hard to find any resources on what this job looks like and so I don't know how I would balance my industry-focused studies on the side. For now my industry focused studies seem entirely different to my major: just animate till you are experienced enough to come up with any tools and know what tech the industry is working on, I don't know how my curriculum is going to work and even thinking on the basis of a backup plan how I am going to compete with all the people firmly studying to be traditional software engineers and analysts whereas I am just playing with theory. 
What should I do?"

In the last couple months I have been trying to assess what I have learned in the last 3 years and where I am in terms of getting an entry level job in Software development/engineering. I come to the conclusion that my degree covered a lot of theory but unsure whether it has prepared me for a career. I have applied for a few internships but struggling to hear back... I know this is a common issue with CS graduates so that's why I'm wondering what I can actively do to get into software engineering.

I've learned bits of everything at university: data structures and algorithms, OOP, data analysis, cloud technologies, even project management and conceptual modelling, etc. but tbh don't really know how it all connects in the real world and I also know that I am lacking knowledge on a bunch of things. I haven't mastered a programming language either (python's been my go to but I still have so much to learn). The workload has been heavy and as I also work pretty much full time, I haven't had the time to learn git and participate in projects - this means I have been exposed to a lot of information but I have no actual experience.

I've heard about free sources like The Odin Project which offers a full stack curriculum. It seems to make sense out of everything and it teaches how to contribute to real projects, which sounds very appealing.

However, there are two things about this course for me: 

Firstly, I am unsure as to whether I want to dive deep into front-end (although it says full stack, it seems to focus a lot more on JS, CSS and HTML), as I found myself enjoying the logic behind backend more in my degree (yes I know JS can also be used in backend with Node.js). I also found this:

https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university

This seems to have a similar sort of content as my CS degree (albeit more in depth and with further resources) but they do not cover any front-end, which I think any software engineer needs. It could also be overkill, since the fundamentals behind Big-O, algorithms and data structures have already been covered in my course (I could simply refresh/refine my knowledge in these areas if needed).

The other thing is whether completing The Odin Project, which seems to cater for self taught developers, is a good decision for a CS graduate who wants to get into the job market (I'd hate to get stuck in tutorial hell).

I have a lot of questions and doubts and sadly my University is not that great at providing guidance on this. If anyone could give me some advice based on their experience I would really really appreciate it. The amount of information out there and different resources can be very overwhelming.

Thanks a lot.

1. Get a solid, basic grasp on statistics and research design. Know when to use certain tests, what controls you may need, etc. 
2. Get familiar with Excel and it's functions, file types, and formats. Yes, yes I know...excel can be really clunky and confusing. That doesn't mean that you avoid it altogether. 
3. Pick up coding (R or python, whichever suits your needs)
4. Establish a habit of good note taking. Whether you're in STEM or humanities, try to keep track of what you did , you're saving yourself in the long run. And let's be honest, you're gonna forget about that napkin note. 
5. Talk to people in your department. Seems obvious but you have a variety of experts around you that can also help you solve other problems, even if they aren't in your committee. You may even gain some allies along the way if things go astray! 
6. This seems odd, but know how to find information on your own. This is a skill that you pick up overtime but I've found that meetings and study groups are more productive when you have some level of understanding off the bat rather than starting from ground zero. 
7. Talk to the other grad students. If something seems off or like they're hiding something, go with that gut feeling. This is especially important if you're choosing labs
8. This is your degree, time, and life, no one else's. Yes, your PI determines a lot. But at the end of the day, you are the one that's going to have to go out into the world after this is all over, not them. Take that internship. Do that mentoring. Sign up for that workshop. Take care of yourself and feed your soul along the way. 
9. Don't forget about your support system, whatever that looks like. It's easy to get swept up in all the grad school BS, don't forget about the people who have been with you from the start. 
10. Finally, please don't waste large amounts of precious time on toxic rumination. I so, so much wish that I could get all the time back that I spent feeling stupid, incapable, wondering why I couldn't answer a question. Even though I thought it was ""good because it shows I have high standards"", it's not. I was just driving myself into despair. This can be an exciting, terrifying, life-changing, experience, don't spend it beating yourself up.

Edited to add: People have also mentioned a reference manager, which I somehow forgot so thank you for bringing that up! Definitely have a system in place to keep track of papers you read throughout the years. When it comes time to write, this will make life a lot easier"

tpps3h,24,2022-03-27,Almost/Soon to force to be fired at a startup. What should I do?,ArmoSchwarzenegger,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tpps3h/almostsoon_to_force_to_be_fired_at_a_startup_what/,"I joined the startup 5 months ago with no experience (no internship) before. The pay is great, the tech stack is good (even though I had a really hard time to learn erlang and Haskell since I never done functional programming before) and I did enjoy learning a lot from other devs here. The company looks promising and definitely has a bright future.

However, I never received any training nor having a mentor to help me. I kept making some stupid mistakes due to lack of experience such as failing to write a comprehensive test, bad coding style (duplicate code, unnecessary comments/logs, inefficient use of data structure, etc), but mostly I failed to finish tasks on time. 

About one month ago, my supervisor told me that the upper levels were not happy about my performance that some tasks were hanging much longer than expected. So we discussed some plans on how to increase my production in a given time period. For instance, having a 1-1 meetings regularly with one of the other dev in our team (but we are in a completely different time zone. I’ll explain the structure of our team later..). (I think it’s kind of being in PIP, but we didn’t have any evaluation form)

Fast forward, last Friday, I was asked to go to his office to have a 1-1 meeting, and he said that after these time, he felt I was not productive enough. He gave some examples of other devs (who were new grads at that time) that they accomplished a big project in a few months after joining the company while I clearly had nothing in comparison. I even got questioned about being slack-off (since most of the time I’m still working remotely), but in fact I always worked more than 8 hours per day since I know I’m slow and I should spend more time to get things done. He concluded that I am likely not ready to fit in this fast paced working environment based on my current ability. He asked me to think about whether I should stay in our company (I also admitted to him that I have been stressed out and burnt out lately in that meeting). He said he will give me one month notice or something (i almost collapsed at that time. I’m not sure he said one month PIP or one month notice period)

I thought back myself after the meeting. I understand and acknowledge that I did a really bad job in communications. There are only 4 devs in our team, and besides my supervisor, the other 2 are located in Asia with a different time zone. In the beginning of my job, I always asked questions to my supervisor, but he was always busy. So he asked me to ask one of the other devs for help. Thus, I have a bad habit that I always asked my coworker for helps instead of him.  When we are doing code review, my build always needs changes (most of the time I have to rewrite parts of the code since my supervisor always gave me suggestions on how to improve the quality of my code), and that brings down the speed of the code production. 

I don’t know what to do now. Honestly, I totally agree that I’m a bad fit for them, and I should definitely start looking for the next job now. However, I totally don’t know what to reply them now. I feel like it would be bad if I told them I want to stay because I feel untrusted and have no way to suddenly perform well enough to survive another month (I’m totally stressed out now and having insomnia recently) which could possibly lead to me be actually fired. But if I gave my 2 weeks notice to them now that means I’ll only have 2 weeks to find a job in order to not having an unemployment gap, but I haven’t practiced leetcode for awhile. Also, I don’t know what to say to the recruiters in the future when they have questions about me leaving the company after staying for only 5 months. 

Any suggestions or even some career advices would be appreciated!"
tpquz0,14,2022-03-27,Am I not cyber enough? My 2 years helpdesk experience does not seem to interest recruiters.,DystopianDeliveryBoy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/tpquz0/am_i_not_cyber_enough_my_2_years_helpdesk/,"Background: Hello all, longtime lurker here. I know this isn't a resume review sub, however I cannot for the life of me land an interview for a part time cyber/cloud job. I am looking for a part-time position, willing to work full time hours however I do have in person classes that would interfere with a traditional 8-5 until spring of 2023.

I live in a decently sized midwestern city and my last position paid decently, however I was getting tired of fixing printers, crawling under desks, and driving 1 hour to restart a machine(Doesn't happen often, usually with folks who can't take instructions over the phone). I did gain experience working with windows server and many different vendors of firewalls. Even got some vendor-specific certs.

There are a decent amount of part-time cyber positions being posted. And I have been applying to every last one. I have been focusing on school for the last couple of months and got my pentest+ just for something new on the resume. Do I need more certs? Should I change up my resume?

I am looking for anything cyber/cloud. Do I have enough experience to make this transition from helpdesk?

Here is my blanked resume: [https://pastebin.com/L5Dy23VJ](https://pastebin.com/L5Dy23VJ)

tprvxn,16,2022-03-27,I got accepted to an internship but I have heavy imposter syndrome,Pianist-Artistic,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/tprvxn/i_got_accepted_to_an_internship_but_i_have_heavy/,"I had one of the worst interviews ever (had 8 so far) and that interview the interviewer (future boss whom I will work under) straight up critiqued my resume, told me I didn't seem to have enough experience and kept asking me a bunch of questions about my major (ECE). Just to clarify I was CE for 3 years, then switched to EE so I didn't have a ton of EE experience but that internship was EE. Anyways, he kept asking me if I can use Matlab, build circuits, etc. I answered honestly with ""not very proficient"" and some things I said I could do. However, I'm like a B student, I have a pretty good understanding of everything we do in college, but I somehow still feel under qualified like the interviewer made me feel. Now it's all in my head because he didn't seem to think I was good enough. Somehow 4 days later I got an offer letter and now I'm even more scared (but grateful). What if when I start I am inexperienced as he said or not good enough? I know I'm taking this internship to gain experience (which is what I told him), but almost every interview I've had, they've seemed to want you to have previous experience before in internship (?). Anyways, now I'm a little scared about starting, so does anyone else feel like that or am I too in my head because of the interview?"

I'm really luck to be able to say that I've accepted an internship as a technology consultant intern at EY. 

Right now, I'm really grateful to have this opportunity, because it's the perfect place to learn more about how to work as a consultant while doing work that I have experience in. 

I really like tech, as I feel I have a lot of overlapping skillset and background, but I've always had an interest in strategy and management consulting firms such as EY's Parthenon arm, Deloitte's Monitor, as well as MBB. 

Has anyone had any experience in transitioning from tech consulting to strategy? Any and all advice would be much appreciated!"

tpu252,9,2022-03-27,Considering leaving PhD after 2 yrs,gorillacourt,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/tpu252/considering_leaving_phd_after_2_yrs/,"So, I'm a PhD student in a STEM field that I used to be quite passionate about, and I entered grad school with the intention of going into academia. I started my PhD almost immediately after getting my BS, and this might not have been the best decision in retrospect. I've been busting my ass off since I was a kid to do well in my academics. I graduated with a 4.0 in HS, summa cum laude in uni, and was very involved in undergrad research, which helped me land an internship afterwards at a prestigious institute.  I never had a real break from it all before grad school, and tbh I'm not even certain this careerpath was something I wanted, as opposed to something I felt obligated to do.  So, for almost a year now (maybe ever since I started PhD) I've been feeling incredibly burnt out, and simultaneously feeling like I've made no progress in my research.  It just constantly feels like I'm fighting to get things done.  It doesn't help that my advisor is also incredibly hands-off. There are times when he'll admit he can't help me past a certain point because it's out of his field of expertise, and I have to reach out to numerous other people for guidance in my research. It's also quite obvious that he himself is not sure how to help me focus the project into something more meaningful. So I constantly feel like I'm floundering. I've had an incredibly amazing research advisor in my undergrad, so I had my expectations, and my current advisor is not nearly at that level. On top of this, I'm the only student in his research 'group' and I rarely ever see my cohort on campus, so I just feel very isolated.   
My advisor will soon be taking a sabbatical for a yr, and I fully expect them to be too preoccupied to properly guide me. 

These past few months, I've spent a lot of time thinking about what I want out of this program, and I've come to realize that I really don't want to be in academia anymore.  Aside from my advisor's mentoring style and general feeling of isolation and lack of support, I realized that I really don't like the academic environment, and I don't like that I have to look forward to constantly grinding out proposals for funding that's already hard to come by. It just isn't for me.. So lately I've been heavily leaning towards taking a leave of absence to explore my interests (I've contemplated leaving but I don't want to make any rash decisions just yet). Recently, I've been thinking of pivoting into tech, starting with a software eng bootcamp. It's something that interests me and I'm especially attracted to the work/life balance that my friends in tech boast about. I understand that it'll be a rigorous journey, but I'm fully confident that I can do well in this field. If I do take a leave of absence, I'd like to spend that time taking some online programming courses and eventually apply to a bootcamp. With that said, I'd just like to know if anyone's gone through something similar and pivoted towards tech -- whats your journey been like? If anyone at all has any insight or advice, I'd really appreciate it"

tpugna,7,2022-03-27,Advice on whether AET at UT Austin is a good decision...,Main-Perspective1288,UTAustin,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/tpugna/advice_on_whether_aet_at_ut_austin_is_a_good/,"Hi everyone!

I was accepted out of state for AET at UT Austin this year! Currently, UT Austin is one of my top choices, but I have to admit, the reviews I have been seeing about AET as a program has me really worried. A lot of the threads I have read seem to be from a few years ago, and mention the program is getting better, but I'm still a little iffy.

I really liked the program when I read about it, and I still stand by that I think it looks like a very unique and cool concept for a major. However, I'm worried about future prospects in regards to careers and internships after graduation.

I've been looking into how transferring might work between majors in the Fine Arts school (specifically from AET to Design), as well as simultaneous majoring in AET/Design and something like Marketing. Also, I have been looking at the whole Elements of Computing certificate thing that is offered, should I stay in AET.

So, I guess the boiled down version of my questions are:

\- How is the AET program currently (would love some feedback from current AET students)?

\- Are there good internship/career offerings that you might have heard of for AET students/graduates?

\- How difficult would transferring within the Fine Arts school from AET to something like Design be? Would it even be worth it?

\- If I added on a major in something business-related, could that be manageable/helpful in the future? Same question regarding an Elements of Computing certificate.

I could really use some advice on whether UT Austin is still worth it if I'm going for AET. Thank you!"

Along with that, if anybody has any tips or important information regarding recruiting for this field I would really appreciate it.

tpv1go,3,2022-03-27,Help me choose: UCSB or UCSD for CS,DaGarbageMan01,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/tpv1go/help_me_choose_ucsb_or_ucsd_for_cs/,"So I didn’t get into either school for CS. I know transferring into CS at both schools is very hard.

At UCSB, they consider your GPA in the screening classes when considering your transfer application. I am confident that I can get a very good GPA in these classes and successfully transfer to CS.

At UCSD, they don’t consider you GPA in the screening classes. So everyone has the same chance if they get the 3.3 GPA or whatever it is, it’s a lottery. So if I went to UCSD, I would probably do the Math-CS major.

I’m worried that if I do Math-CS at UCSD, I won’t have very many relevant CS courses on my resume and I will just have less CS knowledge which will hurt my ability to leetcode and do projects. I also feel like the additional math classes I will have to take will be brutal, although I think I can handle them.

Which do you think is better for getting SWE internships?

Thanks :)"

The title is ambitious. Yes. My GPA is horrible. I'm still going to shoot my shoot! Here is what my profile is for when I apply next Fall:

Looking to aim for Robotics labs with an application towards space exploration such as Caltech GALCIT or MIT EECS

Undergrad: EE at a T10 Ivy with a low 3.4 CGPA. 

Research: 1-2 years of experience at my school with hopefully a future publication. 3 years of industry research spread between work with NASA, Blue Origin internship, and SpaceX internship. 

GRE: Planning on taking it this Summer. Would getting a higher score compensate my GPA? 

I'm worried about my GPA mostly and the fact that I'm rather industry heavy but I am also hoping that helps show how much I wanna benefit the space exploration field!

Would it help to also reach out to professors beforehand to do a bit of work in their labs if I'm in the area for the Summer?"

**Standardized Testing**

* ACT: 34, submitted to all
* AP/IB: 5's on all exams except a 4 on AP Lang

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

I think most of these are fairly self-explanatory so I'll keep them brief. I think my biggest strength with these was that I intend to go into public/global health and most of my extracurriculars relate to either healthcare or law.

1. *HOSA - 9-12th -  made school's chapter officer junior year, elected state officer beginning of senior year.*
2. *Mock Trial - 9-12th - 3x state competitor, made captain senior year and won multiple tournaments this year and ranked high at state Mock Trial Competition. All-State Attorney this year.*

10. *Freshman Orientation Leader - 11th-12th*

**Awards/Honors**

2. *'Best Attorney' award from my Mock Trial Team* 
3. *local Rotary Club student of the month*
4. *AP Scholar with Distinction* 
5. *NHS* 

**Letters of Recommendation**

*AP Human Geo Teacher/ Mock Trial coach: 11/10. Known them since 9th grade, helped them around their classroom during my free periods throughout school, saw them 4x a week every Mock Trial season, amazing relationship and genuine connection.*

*AP Euro Teacher: 9/10. Really good relationship with this teacher, and see them often for senior class officer-related tasks.*

*AP Chem Teacher: 7/10?? Not sure, but good connection with teacher and felt okay. Kind of had to ask because I needed a science-related recommendation.* 

*Counselor: 10/10. Described me as one of the best students they've ever had.* 

**Interviews**

*Georgetown: 7/10. First interview, plus this was my 'dream' school and I was just super nervous. Got along well with interviewer, just think I could've relayed my accomplishments better.*

*Princeton: 10/10. Amazing connection with interviewer, good conversation flow, had a lot in common with her, told me I was an amazing candidate and she would push my application as well as she could.*

*Dartmouth: 9/10. Good connection with interviewer expressed myself well. It was in the middle of finals week, so I think I could've fine-tuned what I said had I not been a little preoccupied.*

**Essays**

*Common App: I wrote about how my favorite Marvel Character is Captain America and connected it to my shaky identity as an Asian American. I talked about the character's nuance and how that relates to who I am/ who I'm becoming. Literally everything I read online said NOT to write about identity, so I had that working against me, but I think (plus the teachers who read it for me) that I wrote it well and creatively, and honestly I think that my personal story of finding my identity is too big in my life to not have been a focus in my college application.* 

*All Supplements in general: I found the supplements SO hard to write and procrastinated them so much. That said, I was fairly happy with everything I wrote and had most of them looked over and approved by teachers, friends, and family.*

Didn’t apply anywhere ED due to financial concerns.

*Sorry for making this a little early since I'm missing the major reach schools, but I've gotten decisions from all my 'realistic' schools, and I'm super proud of getting into UMich and felt like sharing! I can update with the rest, but my outlook is bleak hahah. I know nothing on my application is particularly remarkable, but I'm proud of my accomplishments and I truly feel like I expressed who I am and who I am becoming really well in my application.*"

**Interviews**

(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*

&amp;#x200B;

Northwestern: 7/10 it was my first interview so I wasn't super comfortable but a lot of her questions were stuff I wrote about in sups so I had decent answers. She didn't seem to interested in staying over the 30 minute mark tho

Georgetown: 8/10 She was kinda old but nice and we talked for a good while. She seemed sorta out of touch with the school and she rambled a lot but seemed to think I'd be a good fit.

Tufts: 10/10 He was kinda rough at first seemed a little like he wanted to get it over with but we had a great discussion and had overlapping interests (History, movies from Tarantino, sports, etc) and we ended up talking for nearly 50 minutes. He told me Id be fine and successful wherever I went which was reassuring. He gave me hope for Tufts which I definitely shouldn't have lol

Princeton: 8/10 It would be higher since we had a good discussion but it only lasted like 20 minutes at most. I was surprised when she cut it so early but she said ""well I've got everything I need to know"" so I guess that's good.

**Essays**

(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*

common app 8/10 I think my personal statement is well written and I tie into my aspirations well but its not something rly over the top at all. It's sorta small scale. 5 hrs

Had a kind of weak Junior year due to covid (89 uw average, 91 weighted) and didn't submit 2 ap scores (cuz I didn't take them) which seems kinda sus I guess. I had like a 97 in my senior first semester and its so annoying cuz I feel like I could've done that last year but I had 0 motivations because of zoom. All in all my gpa is probably my weakest asset and my ECs aren't great either. Hoping to get off the Middlebury waitlist, but Brandeis/Fordham/GW are looking good too (assuming I get into GW.

Seeing as I'm not getting into my favorite target schools (BU, BC, etc) did I shoot too high? I wish I could've just played it safer and done a more realistic ED. We move tho"

Hello Everyone,

I hope you are doing well! I think I posted this question on this discussion before, but I want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. So currently as a high school senior, I have narrowed my choices down to UC Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington’s CS program as a Direct Admit (my in-state school).

Previously, everyone advised me to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? Overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make YOU choose one over the other?

I am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!"

The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead. 

I know some may think this is a clear-cut choice (Berkeley), but I was wondering if you guys could provide me with some honest thoughts and advice. For example, does one have better internship opportunities than the other? Will going to one look better on resumes and improve my chance at finding tech opportunities in the future (I have heard from many that experience matters more than education)? What are the major differences between each of the programs (prestige and difficulty)? Overall, if cost isn't a factor, what would make YOU choose one over the other?

I am the first in my family to go to college, so these are things that have been stressful and any help would be appreciated!"

Hello Everyone,

I hope you are doing well! I think I posted this question on this discussion before, but I want to receive people’s thoughts as certain things have changed monetarily. So currently as a high school senior, I have narrowed my choices down to UC Berkeley EECS (direct admit) and the University of Washington’s CS program as a Direct Admit (my in-state school).

Previously, everyone advised me to choose UW due to the financial risk of debt going out of state, but quite recently I learned that I was accepted for the Regents and Chancellor’s Scholarship at Berkeley. This scholarship now makes UW and Berkeley cost the exact same for me. However, I am still having trouble deciding which program to go to, as both are very good options and it's hard to turn down one. The only reason I am considering staying in-state with UW is that as a Dual Enrollment student at a community college, a lot of my college credits are guaranteed to transfer, I will be closer to family and friends, and can possibly finish my degree in 2-3 years along with a double major or minor with UW CS. At Berkeley, I understand that EECS is difficult itself (double majoring would be rough) and that I may have to attend university for 4 years instead.

What should I pursue in my last semester for a master’s degree: applying previously learnt knowledge about ML in real life industry settings or learning advanced skills eg Deep Learning/Blockchain? 

PS: I’d prefer learning new skills and gaining industry experience during a summer internship.

I lucked up early on and was offered an electrical and instrumentation position with a paper mill. Being that it was my 1st offer after so many rejections I took it. Prior to my start date, I've been doing an E/I internship with a different paper mill and I've found that this line of work isn't for me. I'm not able to perform the kind of work that I'm really passionate about, designing, researching, and prototyping hardware and software for microcontrollers and microprocessors (and possibly biomedical equipment, I'm still testing the waters). 

After I can to this realization, I started looking for opportunities that would better fit my goals and aspersions. I've luckily found and accepted another position where I'm able to work on the tpyes of projects that I enjoy. Now that I have this other position, I'm not sure about how to properly inform the paper mill that I'm no longer interested in the position that I've already accepted. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

My bank has hired a lot of analysts with a few years work experience in the past that also start in summer before so I am hoping to just blend in with them they do have a start date that differs by about a month though. However, I am officially losing sleep over this issue. I have the right degree and grades from undergrad but took this MSF program to enable me to be competitive again. 

I interned last summer and had among the best feedback for interns that year so I am hoping if it does come to light a senior banker would speak up for me but nothing is certain and to be fair that is simply wishful thinking as they most likely have forgotten about me already. 

Would this show in my background check? My offer letter **ONLY** states a bachelors as a prerequisite but I am still very scared, if this offer is rescinded I am pretty sure my career is over and I don't want pity points so I wouldn't go into all that.

What do you guys think of all this, would my bank care or will it be picked up in my background check?"

My parents thinks the things they say are absolutely right and that everyone around them are wrong and are terrible people. So they are the supposedly safest people to be with. They act like as if they care....and then turn around to bite you once you disagree with them. 

My brother (18) was forced to work at their small business and wasn't allowed to work any other job besides theirs going into college. He couldn't move out because the apartments within the state had to have parent or guardian signature in order for him to move out.  My brother actually got an internship out  of state and was only going to be out for 3 months to meet school requirements since he is in trade school (also my parents idea...not really his). Not alot of opportunities where we live.

Despite him following pretty much what they wanted him to do....they threatened to kick him out just because he wanted to do an internship at a big aviation company. So, my brother had to leave because of how the situation was and it pretty much escalated... because he pretty much was isolated from other people his whole life and most of his friends lived with their parents....he couldn't find a place to stay and was in a dangerous situation.

Me living, 7 hours away from another state had to come and pick him up in the middle of the night. And drive him up here.....we didn't have any other choice. A total of 14 hours of driving....this kid pretty much lost his family and was forced to drop out of school nearing the end of the semester....just because of him needing to do an internship. He pretty much lost his full-tuition scholarship...I'm just doing my best to care for him now....but I'm pushing him to finish school so that he can graduate with a reasonably job on his back.

As the oldest sister I went through the same abuse....I don't know what I'm doing is good enough. I'm currently working on my master's and doing full-time work. If my parents loved us...they wouldn't have forced us to be in this situation."
tq88i5,1,2022-03-28,"Feeling discouraged, job hunt/thought of my future gives me anxiety — any advice?",uhhh-fish,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/tq88i5/feeling_discouraged_job_huntthought_of_my_future/,"Please remove if it doesn’t fit in the subreddit —(23/F) — I graduated from a very well known university in May 2021 with a double major. However, because of COVID, my field of study (political science/sociology) wasn’t really hiring/open to taking in anyone new at the time. That’s fine, I assumed I’d find something later as I had a pretty sizeable resume as I have always had a job since ~16 years old. 

After months of job searching, I just couldn’t find something that sat right with me or I would get rejected/ghosted, so I applied to a tech school. Currently doing a 2-year marketing program as that’s something that I think would suit me better — a marriage between analytical and creative thinking.

I find that my peers in my program are already finding internships and relavant marketing jobs and I still can’t get a response back from the internships I’ve applied to, heck — I can’t even get a response from PT job postings I’ve applied to.

I felt discouraged before starting this program but now I really feel like I’m a failure and will never find or be accepted to anything. 

Is there anything I can be doing better? Is it just a spray and pray thing? Should I just wait a bit longer? Am I actually just hopeless and no matter what I do, it’s pointless? 

It’s 5am and I couldn’t catch any sleep for days because I’m worried about my future and disappointing everyone around me."
tq9454,16,2022-03-28,I feel like I'm not doing too well with my internship despite what manager and co-workers say,Baggzio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tq9454/i_feel_like_im_not_doing_too_well_with_my/,"So this is a bit of a weird one. I'm currently almost 3 months in to my internship at a big company, it's not FAANG but still massive. I feel like this company and job were probably far above the level I feel I'm at, it's also in the back of my mind that it was said during the interview that they try to retain their interns where possible and that if that could be me potentially going full time with them in a few months which kinda makes me second guess myself more in my head too to whether I'm good enough or not, more often leaning on the ""not"" side.

When I started after the onboarding and all that I began working on this web app for the most part which was something that was already in place but generally was unusable for the team due to it being put together poorly and was seen as an afterthought. I also in that time have started doing Jenkins stuff and writing scripts for this same project, usually not from scratch either but I have a lot of my own bits to add.

So today I feel like I've closed the book on that project and I don't know how to feel about it. My co-workers have been pretty positive to me throughout and my manager has praised me for the work I've done on it but I can't help feel that it's in some way not genuine or something like that. I'm sure anyone else on the team could have gotten done what I did in a fraction of the time and without having to have to waste other's time by asking questions about it. 

I try to ask questions and things like that as much as possible and I do genuinely think that I get on really well with the team and everyone, which is part of the reason I think the praise mightn't be totally true just because I feel like at points they're being nice to me rather than giving an honest opinion. 

I don't know, I've always thought of myself as like a poor to average level in terms of programming but I somehow seem to be getting on better than that despite the fact that I don't feel like that myself. I always ask for more work and things like that, sometimes they don't have much for me and I'm kinda left with not much at all to do but even then it seems like no one minds what I spend my time on as long the work is done, is this just the way it is in work in general? It might be worth noting that in college I worked basically in fast food takeaways which was kinda working constantly from the time you get there to the time you leave whereas here I feel like it doesn't seem to be like that and it throws me off a lot.

Frankly to summarize, I feel like I was lucky to get this job as I felt I wasn't good enough for it and that feeling has continued into the workplace despite positive praise from others. Also to be clear I really love it and I look forward to working everyday which is totally new compared to my last jobs, I just feel like I should be doing more or doing better. Does anyone have any advice for me or have been in a similar situation before?"

Iam a german university student in my 4th semester studying IT-Security. In germany we need to do an internship in our 5th semester to gain some practical experience and i really want to do that in the us. I have an GPA of 2.7 and no real work experience, just some little volunteer work i did. The only good thing is that i have visited relatively many courses.

To graduate i need to do an 6 months internship in any IT-Related job. To improve my chancec i would take care of a visa sponsorship myself once i have a job.

Do you guys think any us company will apply me for an 6 months internship with an gpa of 2.7 being from abroad? And if so, do you have any tips for my resume? A contact person at my university told me to point out that i would take care of the visa sponsorship in my resume, it that advisable?

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which looked like it might have been a temporary state of affairs, now. 


""Hi,"" the businesslady in front of him said, interrupting the silence first. ""I need to talk with you about a couple of things in private."" … *ooooookay?* What did she want? He pondered the question in his head. Was it something about the treadmill incident? He thought that was resolved! 


""There have been some troubles on the political side of things,"" she confirmed. ""You're being relocated to a different ship, belonging to an ally of the wexiks' main government. They're called the Embuos Collective."" She slapped the folder down onto the table. 


""This is your briefing, but we only have what the wexiks have provided us, so in part you'll be setting policy for interacting with them."" Oh. Great.


""So, you understand, I'm not exactly a diplomat, right?"" he questioned. 


""...have you ever heard the saying, 'don't look a gift horse in the mouth?' You're looking a gift horse in the mouth,"" she answered. ""Either you swap ships, at least for a month or two as we smooth out diplomatic relations, or we find a loophole to send you back to Earth, combat-training success be-damned."" Ryan's shoulders slumped. Well, at least he'd still be in space, he supposed. ""So, what do we know about the, uh, 'Embuos'?"" he asked.


""The majority of the Embuos Collective's populace are four-armed snake people that eat plants and whose species name is also Embuos,"" she answered. ""They pack bond almost as powerfully as wexiks and are notably stronger, even than us."" Ryan picked up his folder and skimmed through the briefing. The main briefing on the new aliens was, unexpectedly, brief. They had some basic laws, and none stood out as particularly odd. And while *all* of the laws were, in fact, *not brief*, they were ordered by significance and relevance, and, skimming through the top, he was pretty sure he wasn't going to piss off an alien government in a day. Going on to culture… well, they really liked cuddles, so that may end up being a problem. But, luckily, there weren't any major fears that humans would just, activate. Looking at it, bringing a small dog or cat was a *bad* idea, but he had neither, so he should be good. Their planet's gravity was low, so the weights would have to stay on. They had close-knit social circles of around five to fifteen or so.


""Come on. You can finish the briefing on the way over,"" interrupted the businesswoman. Ryan blinked a few times in confusion.


""Wh-... you mean like right now?"" he inquired.


""Yes. The ship we'll be getting on is human. We're not going to send you to a new alien species without undergoing intense training,"" she explained. ""You might want to read that folder as we walk."""

I couldn’t find much info pertaining to internships, from what I’ve read for a career you don’t want something that takes 30m or less, but not sure if that’s true for internships or not.

tqci2i,0,2022-03-28,Finishing school asap? Would love some advice.,WookieChemist,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tqci2i/finishing_school_asap_would_love_some_advice/,"So I go to a great university and I have just 5 more courses left before I graduate with a CS BS (Linear Algebra + Statistics + 3 CS of my choice). I currently have a paid internship at a startup I could continue if I want, and a really good internship lined up this summer at a relatively big tech company.

The plan was to take 4 courses for next fall and 4 during the following Spring, adding 3 extra ones because why not, there are some interesting ones &amp; I don't want to get lazy. But I could also just do 3/3 or 3/2 with an easier work load, and I could pickup side projects or a part time job.

But my mom is suggesting I take ALL 5 during the fall and graduate an entire semester early. After giving it some though, I think I possibly could manage that, if I choose really easy CS courses, and forego a couple interesting ones (Operating Systems, Security, Cryptography, Machine Learning, Databases - I do want to learn these at some point). I also know that sometimes the courses teach the subject in a BS way where we get TONS of busywork, in which case I would rather just learn the subject on my own online.

So now I am thinking about many different options, I could do my original plan of 4/4 , or 3/3 + a part time job, or all 5 next semester &amp; get a real job by 2023 (which sounds kinda exciting). There are a few things holding me back from doing all 5 at once: being extremely stressed all the time (which might be good) but with no time to meet new people or friends, missing out on a couple really good (or potentially BS) courses. Regarding the friends &amp; side projects, I don't think my workload has much of an impact on that, being very busy or very free, I don't know if I would just go outside and talk to people all the time either way. But it could be the case where I meet some people and through those people, I meet the perfect group of lifelong friends (what are the chances of that?). I also turn 21 next Spring...I might prefer to be in college when I can start going to bars? Or maybe it makes no difference going to bars in school. I could go with my coworkers? Do you even make friends with coworkers so easily?

TLDR: Would you guys choose to stretch your courses over 2 semesters and do an easier workload &amp; ""enjoy"" college for twice as long, or would you cram it all into 1 semester &amp; forego other cool (or shitty) courses &amp; forego ""meeting people"" (would you even meet people though?) Do any of you guys regret not making the most of college? Would stretching out courses over 2 semesters actually give you more ability to socialize? Is making friends hard in the industry?"

I(24F) am looking for some feedback. I am currently working a full time job as an addictions counselor. My schedule is 10-8 M/W and 9-5 T/Th/Fr. I am also working towards my masters in social work online. 

Work is stressing me out and I can feel myself getting burned out between work and school. The great thing about this job is that it is giving me great counseling/training/experience. HOWEVER, I start my internship for school on May 1 and that is going to require at least 16 hours a week. I’m unsure about how I’m going to do that and work full time unless I find somewhere to do my internship at on the weekends.

Here’s my dilemma 

My dad owns an insurance business and says that I can come work for him while I’m in school. He said that he will work with my school schedule and make sure that it is low stress so I can focus on school. It would definitely be a risk considering insurance is “you eat what you kill” type of business, but I live at home still and I dont have many bills. 

Would it be stupid to leave my job that is giving me good counseling experience/training in turn for a low stress job thatll allow me to focus on school?"

You’re not too old or desperate for pursuing a cs career or going back to school. I didn’t even know I wanted to pursue this until a couple years ago when I realized I just can’t become a lifelong server hating my life. 

I dropped out of high school, had a child at 19 with someone who’s turned out to be an addict, and it took me 9 years to complete my AA that I started as a junior in high school. I have felt like a failure so many times, but I’ve never let that be the final story I tell myself.

Get out there and learn from anyone you can, especially those that give advice for a living - advisors, career counselors, etc. 

Apply for internships. Work on your resume with someone in the field. And don’t stress about having a ton of projects under your belt - I literally don’t have time to have a “side hustle.” Use school projects and learn how to talk your way through them.

I’ll probably feel like an impostor again soon when the next challenge arises, but every step I make towards my goals I’m learning to stop and relish in it and add it to my memory that I’m doing just fine. 

It’s going to be ok! Go for it!"

Many of y’all said yes so I decided to attend. It was my first career fair and I remember somebody said to go expecting nothing and that’s what I did. I picked 3 companies out of 50+ thinking this will be my practice and since I am a junior I still have another career fair next year. The first company rejected my major (MechE), I applied to the second company, last company I never applied. A few days later after I submitted my application, they wanted to meet me for an interview. And just now I received a call from their HR department stating that they have extended the offer and they would notify me shortly but she wanted to tell me the news beforehand. I just want to say that it is possible, just go, be yourself and risk it. If they say no, like the first company did to me, then oh well, and keep moving forward. 

FYI: I don’t know anybody personally to help me get this internship. I just made a really good connection with the people at the career fair by making them laugh lol. 

Some info: 
Major: Mechanical Engineering
GPA: 2.6 
Year: Junior
Projects: 2 class projects and my own small personal construction projects."
tqgz0v,1,2022-03-28,Need some help with my resume and getting hired.,dummyaccount102902,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tqgz0v/need_some_help_with_my_resume_and_getting_hired/,"This is gonna be a really long post.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had jobs before, but none required any skill, so I just dumped in as much information as possible. None of there were tech-related. I probably shouldn't do the same if I'm applying for cs related internships, so I need some clarifications. I'm honestly so desperate now - I would jump on the chance for an unpaid internship.

&amp;#x200B;

For background, I finished high school in July 2016. I joined a computer school thing where I learned a bit of c++, but I didn't finish it because I had to move to Canada. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I got to Canada, my parents suggested I retake grade 12 because I won't be starting university till September, and I was around the age the grade 12 folks are, and I wasn't eligible to work. I finished that in June 2017, so my second high school education.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 1:** Which high school should be on my resume? Both? Is it worth it to include the computer school, even if I didn't finish?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

I started University (CS Major) in 2017, but I couldn't take classes regularly, and even when I could, I couldn't take more than 3 classes. I also wasn't serious about it, so I had to retake some classes.

&amp;#x200B;

I transferred to another school in 2021, and well, let's just say I'm more serious now, and the things that prevented me from taking classes regularly are sorted out. I'm doing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 2:** On my resume, do  I include the university I started in 2017? I feel like the question of why I'm taking forever in university would come up. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also considered only including the school I transferred to in 2021. If I do that, the question of what I was doing between 2017 and 2021 will most likely come up. I had jobs during that period, but they were all general labour stuff, and I didn't do anything related to programming except in the 2 intro to programming courses I took. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

If you haven't figured this out by now: I don't have any good experience to put on my resume, but I also really want some professional experience this summer. Without the general labour jobs I had, my resume barely fits a page. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only languages I'm confident in are Java and Python, but even that is just up to basic things like OOP, data structures (stacks, hashtables, etc.). I should be able to pick up other languages easily if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep seeing posts of people who got a job 5 months after learning to code. To be honest, It's really depressing for me to read posts like that, considering I haven't had a job related to programming, and I wrote my first line of code almost 6 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Question 3:** What can I do to increase my chances of getting hired? What can I add to my resume if I haven't done anything?

I've started working on some projects for my Github, but it's just generic things that everyone else has done. 

Honestly, if you made it this far, even if you don't reply, thank you!"

I am now working as software engineer at a diffirent company. I only started working 3 months ago.

I got referral to Meta (facebook) because of someone from my masters degree.

Yet I don't know if I should take it.

Because, there is a risk that after the intership (3 months) I won't get any offer.

There is also a red flag, that, they offer free housing near their campus, or X amount of money if I want my own housing of choosing, which indicates this job is on-site and not remote.

The pay is 25% more than my current job, BUT, there is job security risk, I might not be accepted at other companies, because of short gap between switching jobs.

What do you know of interns who got full time offer from Meta? I want to increase my chances and also hear your stories."

* Graduated with Computer Engineering degree in Dec 2017  
* First job was ""Application Developer"" but was very slow-paced and mostly did automation using software and some very minimal amount of PL/SQL and Perl (I was also bait-and-switched into this role). Duration 1yr 9mo and left for second job  
* Second job was ""Software Developer"" and mostly did scripting using Powershell and Python and some UX design tasks. Covid/shutdown hits and eventually I resigned for personal health issues and moved back to my rural hometown. Duration 1yr 1mo  
* Recovery time for health issues, 11mo  
* Current job is in IT in my rural hometown and do a variety of things -- networking, sysadmin, and scripting with PowerShell. I ended up in this position because I needed finances sooner than later (I did attempt applying for dev jobs, but was deemed as inexperienced in interviews). Duration 7mo so far  

After thinking things through, I noticed I had no direction in my career until I found this sub. I have decided that I want to pursue Frontend Development. My frontend dev experience so far was my part-time web dev job as a student back in college and a summer internship I did in 2017. With that being said: 

  
\- Should I build a frontend project to help me land a job? Or should I just brush up on LC? Or both?

\- How can I best explain my recovery period and current position without sounding like I ""messed up"" my career path? 

\- Should I incorporate my frontend experience from college and my internship from 5ish years ago on my resume/LinkedIn and if so, how?

\- What is my best course of action and do you have any other advice you have in mind that might help me out?  


Thank you all in advance!"

I accepted an offer for Supply Chain Intern at PepsiCo about two weeks ago but I just got an offer for a Business Intelligence role at Enbridge. I know it's not good to turn back on a company after you accepted the offer, especially at a big company like PepsiCo, but I figured since the Business Intelligence role is more inlined with my program and career goals it will be better fitting. 

A few things to take into consideration:

The PepsiCo role is located in a smaller city, but I have some old friends and family there I can live with so hospitality and commuting are not an issue. In the Supply Chain Intern role I will be working under Quality Control and supposedly leading a team when working at the Pepsi plant.

While the Enbridge role is located in a bigger city which is where I live. Also, the business intelligence role focuses on using data analytics and BI tools that I am interested in learning more about. However, the Enbridge role is through a contracting company so I will be an employee of them rather than Enbridge itself.

In terms of career options, I exist the possibility of doing something focused on engineering, but I am hoping to integrate either my computer science or math background into future careers. Such as quantitative finance, software development, or even more advanced data science careers.

Both of these positions are summer internships and I am not sure what to do."

However, for university, I chose Engineering for practical reasons (better faculty, scholarships, etc.) I did some internships, including one semester at one of the Big Three automakers. Eventually I got Master's degree in Engineering but I didn't really feel the passion the same way I did with computers.

After graduated in late 2020 (during the second wave of COVID and holiday seasons), engineering jobs just weren't there (small industrial city in Canada). I applied for a bunch and got no results.

Clock is ticking and rent is due, I gotta keep food on the table. I reluctantly applied for a call centre job at a streaming company. The pay was minimum, job was mechanical and boring, but it's IT related, I said to myself.

Almost one year into the job, I started to apply for more relevant IT jobs. After hundreds of applications, I receive very few response (maybe it's normal? Still, very discouraging). Eventually I was offered a Technical Support role for a robotics company. Pay was definitely better than minimum wage, but still entry-level. The company is based in China and has no office branch in North America. It seems a little shady at first but at least they sell actual products. Consider it a level 2 role troubleshooting Android-based robots.

A few months into this job I can feel the ceiling already: local tech support are commanded by headquarter sales; minimum training; ambiguous career advancement path; lots of traveling and minimum reimbursement. Job is easy but at the same time, not fulfilling. 

I started to apply again. I fixed up my resume, got LFCS and AZ-104 certifications, put up my personal website and documented my homelab setup into a nice [diagram](https://blog.ewonchang.com/homelab). Boom boom boom, this time around more job interviews coming my way.

One of the interviews was with the IT department head of a software company. He asked 10 technical questions ranging from ""what is a cron job"" to ""describe your scripting skills"". I handled most pretty well, because I'm not a bluff, but a real Linux user and sysadmin enthusiast for 5+ years. I know my shit, I think he knows I know my shit. I got the offer shortly after the interview. 

At this point, two years after I graduated, I can finally say I'm a **Linux System Administrator**. I feel right at home. Thanks for all inspiring posts in this subreddit. This is my thank-you letter. For those of you still knocking the career door, I want to say: keep dreaming your dream, don't give up; if you are determined enough, you will get there eventually."

And I have finally started to worry about my future a little bit. I'm doing a bachelor's in computer science in a country I don't have citizenship of. I'd really like to get a job after graduating and hence I looked at some software developer jobs in my area and read their requirements. And I was really disappointed by what I saw.

Most of the junior dev jobs also require at least 2 years of experience. The entry-level jobs are there but won't sponsor for visa (a minimum salary requirement must be met for a company to sponsor the visa for someone). I also don't know Dutch which is preferred for people working , all I know is plain old english. Of course, everyone here (the Netherlands) knows English but knowing Dutch is quite preferred. I have also not been an excellent student, barely passing classes , etc. Employers could very easily find someone who knows Dutch, don't have to sponsor the visa for and a student with better grades. This is also why I can't even find internships cause there's always someone better than me.

So as you can see , I'm really really behind everyone. I'm really panicking at this point but I do have 1 year left before I enter the job market. What would be your advice for me in this 1 year that can completely turn everything around and hopefully I can get a job after a year?"

I spent my first five years teaching in a private school where certification wasn’t required, so when I moved to public school three years ago, I went back to graduate school for my M.Ed. So technically I’m in my internship semester. Graded observations, EdTPA, the whole shebang.

Anyway. I teach high school math. My principal has never taught secondary anything. I just had an observation with my grad school supervisor and for the second time in a row was rated exemplary across the board. She said she has no concerns, was really happy with the way I interacted with the kids. We had a surprise tornado drill today and she was thrilled with the way I settled them back in and got them refocused. All kinds of specific examples.

An hour after she left, I got called down to the front office and had an improvement plan thrown in front of me for classroom management. This was based on a 15 minute observation that the principal did six weeks ago. This principal has never taught in a secondary classroom. Her complaints are that she doesn’t like my seating arrangement, my tables aren’t lined up neatly, and my desk is messy. Literally nothing about how students were behaving. And I allegedly am not teaching bell to bell, which is interesting since she came in the middle of class and stayed 15 minutes. I had to personally ask her for feedback on that observation because she wasn’t going to give it to me, and then she didn’t follow up for six weeks until she had the assistant principal spring this on me today. All of these things apparently lead to an environment that is not conducive to learning and need to be fixed by Wednesday of this week.

A few years ago as a baby teacher I would have been devastated and my confidence would have been destroyed but I’m honestly just pissed off right now. My university supervisor says she thinks it’s really sketchy, and I do too. I really have a feeling that someone’s nephew needs a job or something and that this paperwork is just a formality. After May I’ll be dual certified in secondary Math and Physics. I have multiple references. I don’t think I’m going to have a hard time finding a job. But seriously, fuck this. Just come out and say it instead of trying to make it look legit."

Every one that I applied to so far has rejected me, including one that was going to offer an $8,000 stipend. I'm trying to succeed in college, and everyone else around me already has an internship for the summer. Give it to me straight, how much are my chances of getting a FAANG job when I graduate ruined now? I'm going to keep applying to internships, but I don't even know what my chances are going to be if I can barely even get emails back right now. For additional info, i got a 3.48 GPA last semester, and at this rate, I'm going to end up getting lower than that this semester since my classes are giving me a lot of trouble."

I should end up with around an A- (not sure if they check) and I’m pretty passionate about CS and would love to help teach others. I also answer a decent amount of questions on Piazza. We’re supposed to make a short video explaining any CS concept we want and I plan to make a decent video on that. I’m not sure if they look into/ask how much CS experience you have, but I also have an internship this summer if that helps.

Also, am I less likely to get an IA position if it’ll be the semester after I took 280?

2. How much of a time commitment is it?

3. Does every IA have to teach a lab section, or are there other positions they have that don’t include teaching a lab section (like just tutoring or something?

4. Do they get paid, and if so, how much? (Per hour or per semester)

5. Is it for just a semester or the whole year? If it’s just for a semester, can I reapply the next semester?

6. This probably looks pretty good on a resume as well, right?"
tqo1uz,18,2022-03-28,How do you compartmentalize your schoolwork?,brightbeautiful7,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/tqo1uz/how_do_you_compartmentalize_your_schoolwork/,"I’m currently working full time and in school getting my Master’s part-time. I love my job and it honestly doesn’t stress me out at all. I feel lucky that even though I feel busy and challenged at work, I’m still able to stick to 40 hours a week, take and enjoy PTO when I want it, and leave work at work at the end of the day. 

School is a whole different story though and it’s really taking a toll on my mental health. It’s like there’s this constant little voice in the back of my head running through all the things I need to get done at any given moment. While I find my program itself to be rather easy and I am excelling academically, I just constantly have a laundry list of “busy work” that I can’t easily motivate myself to do after a full work day/week. I’ve tried to be intentional about setting aside time just to relax and unplug from work and school, but I end up just sitting there half watching tv or reading my book while the rest of my brain panics about all the school things I could be doing instead. I think my least favorite thing about being back in school after taking a break to just work for a few years is the way you’re never really “off the clock” like you are with work. 

I have a year left, which will include an internship and a capstone project (which will only add to my already overly burdened work load). I already feel IMMENSELY burned out and like I can’t enjoy anything I do for fun. I’m irritable when I’m out with friends/family and I can’t relax. 

Honestly if I weren’t so close to finishing and if I wouldn’t owe my company $30,000+ in tuition for not finishing, I’m at the point I’d probably just drop out. But I really can’t do that now. Any strategies or tips to help with unplugging from school or how to keep going when you feel like you can’t take it anymore?"

In the past this community has been helpful in providing me information about programs. Hope you guys can shed some light between the two universities mentioned.

I have added a short description and comparison between the two programs. My final goal is to be working in a AI related position. 

UC Berkeley 
1 year professional program. Students take 4 technical courses, a capstone project and go through a boot camp that teaches them about business management techniques and communication.

Pros:
- #1 public university and one of the best in the world.
- Located opposite San Francisco. So the job market is nearby
- great weather
- great alumni network

Cons:
- hella expensive
- US immigration is not always kind to international students
- AI concentration not available. But you can just choose AI related courses so not a deal breaker.

University of Toronto 
18month program. 12 months consists of 4 technical courses and 4 entrepreneur and communication courses. The rest of the 6 months are devoted to an AI related internship.

Pros:
- Canadian immigration is kinder to international students
- UofT is one of the best universities in Canada
- not 100% sure about the job market. But I have heard Toronto is rising in AI related jobs. 
- internship is guaranteed 
- AI concentration is available (not a big deal)

Cons:
- weather
- fairly high cost of living 
- would be departing from US

Would love your opinions on either universities! Thanks you!"

I applied for an internship in this position because it came up in a search result for a computer science internship and didn't think I would actually get an interview for it and now I have a lengthier and final interview coming up and have no idea what to expect. If it was for SWE role I would know to prepare for DSA but I am clueless right now especially because even though the job description said anyone in CS, Info.

I’ve been thinking about possibly going to CC then transferring to UCLA or Berkeley for Comp Sci but I’m scared that I’ll miss out not only on the social experience but on networking and internships.

I had recently gotten my predictions 41/45 and thought I’d get inside top30-40’. Well unfortunately to my luck I’ve only got into 2/6 and would now have to take my chances: 

Michigan State University: (Major in Econ and probable minor in pol science) 

- Tution costs come down to $42k ($9k from the university and $6.5k from Fafsa) 

- Genuinely like the courses as they seem similar to the ones back at NYU (yes I applied for ED2 and got rejected) 

University of Minnesota Twin Cities: (Major in Econ and probable a minor in pol science) 

- Tution costs come down to $40k ($7.5k from Fafsa)

- the economic courses look stagnant and not that coherent to what I would like to do

To be honest my selection comes down to which one has the better reputation - the one though which I can get good internships, jobs.

University of Michigan 
Northwestern 
Boston University

econ international student 

4.0 GPA. math220(A+), econ102(A+), rhet105(A), and some gend ed (LAS100 A+, LAS101 A+, SLAV117 A). This year: econ103, cs105, ansc250, aas100, and anth246. (high chance with 4.0 too)

Major activities/ clubs:

&amp;#x200B;

1. work 17 hours per week as a dining worker
2. Act green(a club related to business) with a sustainable recycling project.
3. CESA (a club aims to help Chinese students), focuses on the introduction of Gies to the upcoming 2026er, also holding meetings per week
4. Catsnap volunteer

\+decent essay: about my internship in China construction bank. (I started to write it in March and go to writers workshops two times every week.)

I’m so so so worried about getting into Gies because I don’t know what I can do if I got rejected(going to have a panic attack lol). Also because I’m an international student, which means the pool is going to be shrinking. There are 400 applicants every year and they want around 200, half of them are US citizens, and half of them are international students(only around 40 Chinese can get in). Another thing that concerns me is that I don’t have any leadership or business-related RSOs. (it really kills me) :(."

Anyway, I need to convince myself and him that UMD is a great candidate by itself, so please give some reasons I should attend. 

Some fields I'm interested in: Physics, Robotics, Astronomy, Robotic Learning(ML and robotics). 

Undergrad research is also a priority for me, and being able to work with great professors would be super cool. I plan to pursue an MS/PhD. Getting internships easily would also be really cool.

Geometry and ALG II Teacher: 8/10

She really respects my work ethic, as I struggled a lot throughout Algebra 2 (10th grade was online, and I am terrible at math, and have some focus issues.)

English 1302 Professor: 7.5-8/10

I \*occasionally\* turn in work late for this class, but she does recognize that I am a strong writer (at least relative to my school), and apparently enjoys reading my work, even if it takes slightly longer to get to her because I suck with deadlines sometimes.

Art History 1302 Professor: 6-7/10

I do not like this subject, I find it extremely boring. However, my art history professor does like us, and he has heavily insisted that I apply to Harvard based on the few things he knows of me. I do not think I am capable of that, but I promised to humor him on his request.

AVID Teacher (AVID1-3 and 4): 9/10

My AVID teacher knows me the best as she's seen most of my struggles throughout adolescence, and can speak the most strongly to my character. I've known her since I was 14 and she's made her classroom a safe place for all of us.

Chem Teacher: 7-8/10

My chemistry teacher, even though I had her class online, was the reason I came to appreciate the subject. It was an early morning course with a lot working against me (laziness and insomnia), but I tried my best and ended the class with a 95. Came to really enjoy chemistry as a result of my effort and slowly divulged more into it. Before the course ended, I expressed my enjoyment of chemistry to my teacher and desire to take college chemistry, but she insisted I lighten my load (I am glad I took her advice.)

*I do not have many preferences regarding college size, location, or climate. Just would like a few spitballs for ideas of places for me to apply OOS, if possible. My top far reach choices are Cornell, Michigan, Yale (SUPER FAR REACH) and U-Florida. Preferably somewhere that offers pre-calculus, but fine if that is not an option.*"

I am looking for a remote position so that I do not have to change jobs every time that I move. I am finding that for early career mech-es this is not really an easy thing to achieve, and am considering changing career paths (maybe something in tech/computer science?). I realize that such a transition is difficult, but hope that coming from a technical background will give me a good starting point to build experience before entering the new field. I am wondering if anyone has any general advice/personal experience/examples of others who have made such a transitions. I am interested to know if there are particular remote jobs that are achievable by people with my background, or remote jobs in adjacent fields that I could feasibly achieve after 6-8 months of online courses/certificates.

Roughly 2 months later, I get an error message when trying to boot. Yesterday things still worked no problem. But not so today.  
After spending a couple of minutes trying to find the cause, it turns out the power cable had the wires exposed. The isolation and manufacturing was worse than the ""cheapo"" cables that were shipped with my PSU that I now have put in. But my HDDs still don't appear.

Luckily i have an NVME SSD. So that thing works.

Wish me luck trying to save my data...

And that was the last time I bought from Cablemod.

If you have cables from them, please check the connection between the cable and the connectors. Mine looked like an underpaid intern was forced to do them."

2) What scholarships are available for incoming grad students from international countries ( like India for eg.) ? On What criteria are they given?

3) How is MS SE different from MS CS in terms of job opportunities? Which one is preferable if the goal of the student is to get a full stack dev job?

4) Do low rankings affect job opportunities for ASU/SJSU students? Since unis like UF, NCSU, Stony, TAMu are ranked higher, do they get any additional benefit? Or is it a level playing field in terms of job opportunities?

_

Through a series of events, a human named Ryan found himself at the center of attention of political secrecy and alien mistrust. As a video of him on a treadmill revealed humanity's hidden past as persistence hunters, the galaxy wondered; what else were these pink bipeds hiding? A wexit hacker, Riiker, intended to find out… with the help of a particularly vast resource; the human Internet. 

_

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard a *new* alien ship. Which he had *finally* finished his training for. A number of setbacks, and some intense cultural drilling after his screw-up on the last alien ship, had made a one-week process almost twice that. But, finally, he was done. 

What he had learned; They were intensely social creatures that, as a species, suffered from agoraphobia. The only reason they weren't considered to be more social than wexiks was because of that phobia, built by an evolutionary need to both stay together *and* stay hidden from Kaiju-sized predators on their low-in-gravity, high-in-gigantism homeworld. Sidenote, do *not* show them any Godzilla movies. While in space, they were just above average-sized, and next to a human, they were positively massive, they were on the smaller end of creatures on their home planet. Kind of like a gardener snake next to a T-Rex was the best evolutionary size comparison for humans. 

Except not quite, because the ""T-Rexes"" were upwards of twenty stories tall. Ryan had to say, he'd be pretty terrified, too, if teenage Godzilla wanted to eat him, so he couldn't particularly blame the poor snake people. They were cuddle-machines in order to keep warm during sub-zero nights. Their favorite foods were large, juicy fruits, their arms were monstrously strong, they could *gallop* on their four arms, and they would *not* like dogs, which looked like small pack-hunting animals that used to prey upon them, and are the evolutionary reason their bicep equivalents are built like hydraulic presses. Their government was socialist, doing their best to reap the benefits of capitalism while also being intensely loyal to their fellow Embuos. Not so coincidentally, they also really loved sharing. 

Of course, there were plenty of other things, but he was just going over the important parts in his head right now. Ryan was being flown to the Embuos ship he had been assigned to, and he had the feeling he was going to want the little extra review.

Riiker was missing something. He *had* to be. It was almost as if most humans weren't even aware they could go to space. There were videos of them playing with domesticated animals, and even *undomesticated* animals, and videos of their infamous wargames where they brutally ripped each other apart with their infamous ballistic weapons and even *melee weapons* of all things, and there were even videos of them genuinely risking life and limb to save someone they hardly knew, but every time, it seemed like they just shrugged off the fact that they were a spacefaring people. There wasn't even any mentions of a *name* of their homeworld, and the only other colony they referenced was Mars. *What was he missing about humans???* Riiker thought for a minute. Then he thought some more. Then he typed in the ""Google"" searchbar… ""History of Earth"". The wexik had a feeling. And if he was right, he had a very important anonymous call to make.

Ryan was *pumped!* It had been too damn long since he got to actually be a mechanic! Or, really, since he got to *learn* about being a mechanic. His expertise didn't really count for much on an alien ship. But he was gonna get to hang out with aliens again! He was in the middle of grinning like a madman when he felt a tap on his shoulder. Ryan turned to see the businesswoman, whose name had yet to be known to him, offering him a radio. Tentatively, he grabbed it. 

""What the hell is this for?"" he asked. 

""To keep in contact,"" she clarified, while clarifying nothing. She had a tendency to do that during her diplomacy lessons. ""Report everything you learn back to us. Maybe help humanity advance a few hundred years, and teach us a few things about our friends."" He pondered her words for a moment.

""... you mean commit Espionage?"" Ryan accused.

""No more than what you were already doing on the wexik ship,"" she shot back. ""Keep in touch, Ryan."" She shut the airlock door as he docked with his new travel companions. Well. 

""Shit."""

I scored a 3.7 GPA (out of 4) during my bachelor's degree in Economics [non-target] and 3.85 (out of 4) in my master's degree in Economics [non-target], and managed to get some awards and scholarships for my academic performance during my bachelor's. Also won a few state level competitions. After graduating bachelor's, I was on a gap year due to some personal reasons and decided to apply for internships, all of them rejected me. So, I thought I must be very underqualified and started looking for internships during my first year in master's and even then got rejected. I tried again last year - again rejected. 

Now I am applying for jobs and even getting rejected there. Now during this time (master's) I realised I had to do something about the lack of internships in my resume, which is why I had absolutely no option but to request people I know for an internship - most didn't help out but one of them did and I got 1 internship. But that was not enough experience so I had to resort to 4 reverse financed internships (I am paying the company to get internship experience). 

And now I am seeing people from target schools who are in their bachelor's degree get into jobs that I apply for. I see people who are younger than me work and get placed. My roommate chilling because they already have a job at hand and my friends working in great jobs and earning money. I feel ashamed of my self and I am starting to hate myself. 


I really need advice on how to approach the situation. I am willing to work any job right now and I don't want to burden my parents [bless them for being so supportive about the whole thing]. It hurts very bad seeing your parents support you at this age. My family of 4 lives on paycheck to paycheck and my father is the only earning member. 

I am going to also answer the CFA this year to boost my chances of getting a job. Until then I am willing to work anywhere and in any role that will hire me. 

I am about to graduate and be 24 and unemployed. I want to know what can I do to improve my resume and land jobs? From small companies to big companies like JP Morgan Chase, all have been rejecting me. Any help would be appreciated :')"
tr4krb,0,2022-03-29,I am being bullied and harassed by my housemates since September. Is there anything I can do with the university or legally to help ?,ConsistentWater5658,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/tr4krb/i_am_being_bullied_and_harassed_by_my_housemates/,"

(21F) So I fell out with 3 of my housemates in September. We just have different morals/values. They then started to stand outside my door at all hours of the day and talk about me in a negative way, make gagging noises, just mean and nasty things. They then broke 20 of my glasses “by accident “, started entering my room leaving rubbish in there, went to the bin fished rice out of the bin and left it outside my door. Then they got in contact with my not so nice ex-boyfriend and he sent them diary entries of mine and they pass them around the entire house and posted them on social media. I reported him to the Uni for this and the University put in a no contact order, at Christmas, between us which is difficult when we live in the same house. But since then and since this took a toll on my mental health, my anxiety got bad surrounding them. I stopped going into communal areas and kitchen. Bc I’d have a panic attack or something like that. I basically gave him a wide birth because I don’t wanna get involved in anything with them I just want to be left alone and live my life.

However they have decided not to leave me alone. One of them has written a Districk about me. They stalk me through the ring doorbell camera which they won’t give me access to and send photos of me to my weird ex-boyfriend. One of them has been taking parking tickets off my car (she took 16 parking tickets off my car) I only know about this because she bragged to her friend who intern told me about it because it resulted in my car getting towed and me having to pay over £1000 in getting my car back and paying off the tickets. They also contacted the letting agency fabricating evidence and trying to get me kicked out of the house. Saying I’ve been pissing out of my bedroom window. They said that I took a shit in the dishwasher. I did not take it in the dishwasher I haven’t been in the kitchen in months at this point. They also shit in my cocktail shaker and left that downstairs but I haven’t use that cocktail shakers since October I haven’t seen it since and at all. They are now fabricating evidence of me harassing them photo shopping messages and texts and sending them to the police as evidence saying I am pissing out my window as well and taking shits in the dishwasher. They are using the police to intimidate me saying I’ve done something when I haven’t this just makes me so anxious and really sad bc I’m just trying to survive in this house. I went to brush my teeth in the bathroom and my toothbrush started frothing, my face has been breaking out and I went and smelt my face wash and it smells of disinfectant. I think they are tampering with my stuff. I don’t know why they are stalking me and harassing me they are kind of obsessed with me all they do is talk about me and it’s making me feel ostracised isolated so hated. So I reported them to the Uni again
So Is there anything I can say to the university or a lawyer that will help me or give them a serious warning or punishment ?"

Both my junior and senior years were taken up by me also working in an IT internship which was what I ended up doing after graduation, but because I wasn’t studying computer science and didn’t have anything except on the job experience in IT, I ended up leaving because everyone there hated me because I just wasn’t as experienced as them. I wound up doing odd jobs for a couple years in the mean time before property management, and I’ve now been in PM for 4 years. 

At this point though I’m feeling burnt out and wanting to go somewhere else. There’s not much out there for upward mobility and pay is basically capped at $20 an hour everywhere. I’ve been applying to 2 jobs a day for the past month and I’m starting to feel burnt out from even job hunting. Most of the places that do give me interviews offer a cut in pay and no insurance which is worse than what I’ve got now so I’m better off in my current job. 

I had an interview with an Accounts Payable job yesterday and came out of that interview feeling like a moron. Even though I have some experience working in AP / AR from property management and studied accounting in college, because I never worked in some accounting firm prior to this when I was in college, I was basically stared at like I was a complete waste of time. I don’t even know where to go anymore, where my interests lie in terms of finding a new job and career path, and I just feel lost. I’ve looked into getting some IT certificates but I’d also need an IT job as well, but I don’t even know if IT is what I want to try going back to or if I’m just grasping at straws because it’s something I did before. I can’t put any past IT experience since in the IT industry, working there 4 years ago is basically the same as having zero current relevant experience, so I don’t even know if I can get an IT job nowadays even if I’m working towards getting a certification, but just because I have that it won’t guarantee a job for me, and I don’t want to drop $500 on a certificate that won’t do anything for me. 

I almost feel like property management is a stain on my resume and nowhere will take me besides other property management companies, and I can’t afford to take a pay cut going into an entry level job that I don’t even know if I’d stay in. Any advice?"

I think I like coding even more.,UnnecessaryAbrvtions,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tr67tb/i_am_starting_to_second_guess_my_career_choice/,"As the title says, I am starting to second guess my career choice. I took 2 semesters of Java in college and I loved it! There is nothing quite like the feeling of finally running some successful code. Hours upon hours of troubleshooting and BAM it finally runs! I honestly loved it. I get jealous of programmers that get to code cool stuff all the time. Not to mention their paychecks/ light workload. I had a passion for it; I always made sure my code was neat and organized, that the code was well commented and easily readable. My professor even used my code as an example to the class a few times. I always liked helping my fellow classmates troubleshoot their own code.. it was so rewarding. One time, my professor reached out to me about an internship. I declined because I had another one lined up, a fraud analyst in the cybersecurity dept of an insurance company, which I do now.  I am on the tail end of my college career, one more summer class and I'm done with my BA. My job will convert from part time to full time.


I have geared my career to cybersecurity. I chose IT instead of CS. I got the trifecta (A+ Net+ Sec+), I joined cybersecurity clubs in college, I made a little home lab to practice attacks, and I have 2 internships under my belt, both of which were cybersecurity related and one of which has led me to my job today. I do some light coding with XML in Splunk from time to time but thats about it. I feel my coding skills are slipping away. As if it were a spoken language that I no longer speak. It makes me sad man. In a weird way, I miss that awesome feeling creating and building stuff from scratch.


Do you all think its too late to change careers? Is it even worth it? Is there some sort of career that can mesh the 2 together? Am I overreacting here? Maybe I should be thankful to have a job in the market that is today. What do you think?"

Here is the 116th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

Alongside this, I'm also considering whether additional education combined with my CS degree would broaden my ability to work with my interests.

As far as my interests go:

\-I really enjoy the outdoors, the mountains and oceans being my favorite environments (not the best for someone who spends their days in from of a computer)

\-I love animals of all shapes and sizes

\-I like extreme sports such as racing, mountain biking, and ski racing (I'm kinda crazy for skiing)

\-I love history and I really enjoy stories about adventurers of old

\-I enjoy working with data and analyzing things

\-I like to be creative and explore.

I guess my question to anyone here is: Do any of you know of job fields or careers that would allow me to use my CS degree in coordination with some of these interests? I know that CS tends to be very generalized in its use, but I'm having trouble coming up with careers that fit both worlds. Thanks for the advice!"
trcl5u,410,2022-03-29,My helpful advice for future professional game devs,123_bou,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/trcl5u/my_helpful_advice_for_future_professional_game/,"I wanted to give some advice for future professional game dev. If you are here, I consider that you are serious about getting a career in gaming and you are not a hobbyist.

A little bit about me : professional game dev for 7 years, I have worked with multiple companies from big AAA to indies. I have more than 4 games shipped under my belt. I started as a software engineer and now I'm transitionning slowly but surely towards a producer role. Now, let's go into some useful advice.  

**Degrees**

If possible, always seek for a degree that will leave you with a broader range of option. I would not recommand to pick a game dev degree or some quick programming course. Instead pick a CS degree. If you are an artist, pick a degree that will let go either in films or games. Always seek broad. 

Note that IF you do not want a degree it's fine. A lot of folks in the industry are self-taught. Programmers, modelers, animators. Some even comes from wild background (philosopher, architect, biologist). Diversity in background is looked after especially when we need to tackle new market right now.

**You first job****^(TM)**

When looking for junior candidates, recruiters are looking for 3 things. Your work, your passion and drive and finally who you are/do you fit in. Most candidates have the last two, so let's talk about the first one. It's important that you hone your skill and show it off. The best way would be to do game jams, create games in your spare time. If you are specialized in your field, it's even better. You just know how to do this awesome Star Wars VFX you saw? Make it shine through your portofolio.

This is exceptionnaly well look at for AAA. People there do a few things, but do it well. Show that you can do that better than anyone else and the job is yours. For indies, you need to be broad, but let me tell you: getting into an indie company is harder because they have less ressources and will look for very specific or well-known to them candidate. 

There is a hack to get a first job. Networking. Make some friends in the industry (game jams are the best place) and let them know when you are ready to start well in advance. Work with them and show them you are good at what you do. They will do the work of promoting you for free to get the job. 

If you can, get an internship. Do the work, do it well and get your first job!

**Engines**

You like Unreal and Unity don't you? I mean they are cool engines, work relatively well and are well known. But the bad news is : there is a lot of chances you won't touch the cool kids in the industry. The big companies are not using them. The small indies are, sometimes, but often they run their own stuff. It's better to understand how they (Unreal, Unity) work than how to work with them. But for the love of everything above, don't put an engine name if you don't know anything about it other than ""I booted the engine once"". 

Engine are relevant up to a certain point. But that point is very quickly passed. 

**Salaries and expectations**

You need to understand well and very quickly where you at. I have heard multiple times that salary are lower in gaming. That's true to an extent. If you do work well, set the example and lead forward, you will be sure to be well compensated. For personnal experience, I had a better salary than all of my friends in different field in programming. Set yourself to a point and keep at it.

If you are underpaid, assume it, ship a game and switch job. Trust me, you can make money in gaming. It's also important to note that game companies often pay in bonus. Like FAT bonus, based on the game performance. 

You should, ALWAYS, understand the game you are working on and FEEL if it's a hit or not to make your move. You can see it in your colleagues' eyes. You can sense it in the floor and in conversation. A team knows when a game will be a hit. And a hit, means recognition, money and to some extent fame for the studio. And if you are working on a hit title, keep at it. Hug it like death. In the same vein, failures, bad game and cancellation happens. You should run away from them. With time, you will know when a game might succeed or fail. Experience will be your friend.

**Overtime**

Ahahaha. Yes you will have overtime. But no, don't fully deny it or accept it. Overtime, across the industry is well known. But it also happens in other industries. Understand when it's okay to have overtime and how you should take that time back. However, do not overdo it whatever happens. 

You should, at all times, understand the position of the company and the game you are working on. Indies are not AAA. Sometimes, failures is not an option. Even in AAA, firing people happens. You should understand how you are positionned in the company and how overtime, doing it or refusing it will affect you and your job. As much as you can, work smarter. Re-use, block proposition, position yourself well to have the minimum amount or reasonable amount. 

In my 7 years, I have faced overtime a few times (always close to shipping) in few dosage. Far from enough to be fed up or burned out. I saw some people overdo it and burn out because they didn't position, speak or align themselve correctly. 

**Shipping a game is hard**

If you have never shipped a game: it's hard. It is REALLY hard. From small games to big games. No exception. It's stressful. It's taxing. Imagine a game jam last-day feeling, on a 4 month period. That stress is building, you have to deliver quality, people are waiting after you, some might go into overtime if you are late. There is tension in the air. It's not really explicable until you do it/you live it. Conversation are quick and effective. Meetings are though. 

Learn yourself and learn to deal with it. After shipping a few games, the feeling will turn around from panick to control. You should build your confidence and let NO ONE tell you are not good enough/fast enough.  

**Professional have standards**

This is my advice. I believe that true pros have standards. I have some myself and I never go below my standard in the product I ship. Standards put you apart. It allows you to thrive where other slug. As a software engineer at heart, some standards that I have are : always ship quality code, refuse compromise, set clear goals and always find a viable solution. Tell to the people you are working with, by example first, what your standard are. Then, if someone tries to break them, remind them of it. 

This is useful for a few reasons. The main one being: by putting standard in front of you, it makes you someone we can trust. And by trusting you, we will trust your work and ability to deliver. A plumber that doesn't want to cut corner is objectively better than a shady one right? There you go. 

It can also protect you from some unwanted overtime... but hey, it's up to you. 

**Gaming is fun but it's a business first. It is a job. NEVER forget that.** Have fun though.

Hope it's useful. Maybe there are other folks that can answer your questions in the comments (or maybe it will be me?) if you have some. 

**TL;DR:** there is no TL;DR. Read it."

trfvre,5,2022-03-29,Amazon Propel Interview - Just Finished,Forrox,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/trfvre/amazon_propel_interview_just_finished/,"Had my interview today (03/29/2022). I got a question about ""Can you talk about a time where you had a deadline and you needed to compromise"" (interviewer said I did well on this one), ""Can you talk about a time where you had to take on a task or work that was not your responsibility."" I think I had good answers for both of these questions as both of em related to my past internship. Where I know I went wrong is I had to solve the ""Clone Graph"" question which is a leetcode medium. I struggled but the whole time I was giving my thoughts, not a single line of code was written where I didn't tell my interviewer my rationale. At the end he said I was really close but we'd ran out of time. He told me to give the time complexity of what I'd written so far and just thinking back, I know I got that shit hella wrong. I'm keeping my fingers crossed because it would be lovely to get this opportunity even though this place is the worst place to go looking for hopium. I've heard that while Amazon cares a lot about coding, they care even more about leadership principles and I made sure I demonstrated leadership, creativity and flexibility in my answers. I'll update y'all on how it goes!

trj2ok,43,2022-03-29,Anyone else been stuck between GIS and software engineer/developer,strongr_togethr,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/trj2ok/anyone_else_been_stuck_between_gis_and_software/,I will be graduating with a degree in GIS this year but I already have a 2 year degree in computer science and have done a lot of coding. I hope to get a job as a GIS analyst or software engineer or maybe like gis developer or something along those lines. At one point I thought I wanted to steer away from coding and just do GIS work with a little coding maybe involved. But now I kinda want to improve my coding skills even more so that I could maybe get a software engineering job. I love how coding keeps my mind busy. I just got a GIS internship with a company so I guess I’ll see how I like it. But I also like making maps and writing code for scripting tools and analyzing data. Anyone else in this position too? Where they have GIS and some coding skills? It seems that software engineers make more money but I just want to make sure I’m doing something I enjoy regardless of the money. Any feedback would be appreciated because idk I guess while I’m doing this GIS internship I could code more and improve my software engineering skills and then come fall semester just start applying for jobs in both sectors? I’m just stuck between two fields I guess.

Every offer I've received right now (MS, Riot Games, Bethesda, fintech, etc) has evaluated my 6 YOE + 1 year professional internship + 1 year as a lead + projects experience to be at least a Senior Software Engineer.

I get the big G down levels, and that this offer is pretty good compared to what [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) shows for an L3, but taking that title feels wrong. Also, being on-site in Mountain View, California required 5 days a week kind of sucks and the work doesn't sound that interesting (G Assistant). All in all, Google's TC is about $20K/yr better than my best offer but in stock only. The salary is the lowest of my offers."
trjfbz,1,2022-03-29,1st Year CS student feeling very underqualified for internship,BlakeR-,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/trjfbz/1st_year_cs_student_feeling_very_underqualified/," 

I'm a 1st year in college studying computer science, I have decent programming skills and have some knowledge about Data structures and algorithms + some OOP principles, haven't had any experience with actually developing a piece of software.

Recently I was looking for some summer jobs and I saw a posting for a Software Developer Internship. I applied on a whim, they sent me some easy style leetcode questions, passed them no problem, had a phone interview with them, again no problem, and then they invited me to a technical interview. It was at this point I realise I'm way out of my depth, and I am wondering why they even passed me to this stage in the first place.

They sent me an email telling me what to expect for the interview, and said to brush up on various topics such as Cloud Computing (AWS), various architecture patterns , data modelling, some more advanced programming topics like concurrency and others. I have zero clue about any of that outside of knowing roughly what they are, and the interview is happening soon.

I've spent the past few days ignoring college trying to research these topics but it seems very overwhelming and I don't feel I've made very much progress. Again, I have no idea why they even accepted me in the first place, I didn't lie on my resume, just said I have some basic programming skills and am looking for a summer job. The thought of sitting in a call for an hour getting drilled about questions I don't even know where to start on seems pretty stressful and I'm considering just emailing them and telling them I have other plans but thanks for the offer.

Am I overthinking things and it wont be too advanced, or do you think there was a disconnect with the recruitment process and I got passed on when I shouldn't have? I get that I have nothing to lose even if I go for it, but again it's been eating away at my actual college studies and I've been kind of stressed about it, so I think mentally I'd like to just leave it and come back when I feel a bit more experienced."
trs014,3,2022-03-29,Question - For anyone with experience with Berkeley EECS,GatorBoyUSA,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/trs014/question_for_anyone_with_experience_with_berkeley/,"Hello Everyone,

I hope you are doing well! I am a current high school admitted to Berkeley for EECS. At the high school that I came from in Washington, AP courses in the STEM area
were very limited. I only was able to take AP Computer Science and AP Physics I in the STEM area, and then decided to pursue dual enrollment at my local community college to gain access to more Calculus and
higher level physics courses. I currently have a 4.0 and am understanding the content very well, but I know that
Berkeley EECS is on completely different levels in terms of difficulty (CS 70 and upper-division classes) and that
I will around some of the smartest people in the world. Although I am decently confident in my study skills (although I do procrastinate at times), I wanted to ask
you guys if EECS is something that may be doable for me to succeed with decently high grades (for internship opportunities and grad school) and graduate
within 4 years. I really want to go to Berkeley, but I have really been thinking about this and any advice provided
(regarding the program, study advice, or things to be aware of) would greatly be appreciated!"

tru0c2,6,2022-03-29,Advice on special consideration,yozitzme,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/tru0c2/advice_on_special_consideration/,"so i finally returned to sch for lessons after the prev sem (i was on intern last sem) but this sem has been the worst for me by far. i got covid in between, and after that it was really hard for me to catch up on all my assignments as they started to pile up. I’m overloading this sem (30 MCs) which also adds to the craziness. i’m pretty sure i’m going to flunk the sem, and it’s really disappointing for me because my grades have always been pretty good.

initially i was going to apply LOA this sem to rethink if i really wanna continue bc my internship really scarred my view of the industry i’m due to work in and honestly i also feel very detached and anxious everytime i think about school. i don’t feel the same joy when i’m working on my assignments as i used to in the past and idk what to do. i missed out on the deadlines for several assignments and i miss out on some classes because covid totally destroyed my immunity.

i’m thinking of applying for SC but it requires medical certification and i recovered from covid via home recovery instead of going to the doctor cos i wasnt ‘high risk’, so i don’t think any doctor would be willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. i really dont know what to do, deciding to just suck it up and take this sem was a mistake and now it’s almost over but i’ve given up on myself entirely."

I am a freshman computer science major and I want to ask if someone here can help my situation. So I really hope I get to do a paid internship (i really hope) at least in the summer, but I wanted to see if i could do it during my spring/fall semesters to make enough move out of my house. Ill just say its would help me tremendously to move out of my parents house for personal reasons. If I could keep a paid internship as a way to become financially stable and independent before I graduate, it would be a life saver. So, my question being... is it possible?"

I’m a junior in Computer engineering, I’ve taken only 2 intro to CIS courses so I do suck. I’m the first to admit I’m really severely bad at coding and understand it very little. After applying for a summer internship I had to interview 7 times for this position with every team member at this job. The one technical interviewer told me to switch to business because “I’m not seeing enough here to call you a computer science student”. The only edge i really had over the other applicants (all from big name schools) was that I’ve been with the company for years. It’s a huge global company where I started as a cashier and now do management for the same store on weekends. 

I don’t understand how it’s possible I got an offer after such feedback.

I’m so scared to accept the offer and be trash when I get there. 

Any guidance?

My stats:
88 credits 3.40gpa
President and VP of a few school clubs
Prior internship in IT
Work 20 hours on weekends at this company store on top of taking 15 credit hours"
trvkjn,1,2022-03-29,[CA] Background Check Question,Important_Letter_840,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/trvkjn/ca_background_check_question/,"\[CA\] I am a college student who landed a nice internship with a national laboratory who is run by the Department of Defense (DOD). I am worried about my background check.

I am in California. Over 7 years ago, when I was not 21, I got pulled over for speeding after having some alcohol. I got pulled out of the car and did the breathalyzer and blew a 0.01. Because I wasn't 21 I got my license taken away, had my friends come pick me up and then I had to go through some legal stuff. I saw a lawyer and he went to court for me and got the charge reduced to a ""Disturbing the Peace"" charge.

This background check wants me to mark if I have ""Ever been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor"". Do I select yes? Was this a misdemeanor? How does this effect the possibility of me getting the job?

By the way, I sort of turned my life around after the age of 21 and am now getting my engineering degree from a UC in California after a few years of hard work at a community college.

Looking for some answers or some similar experiences from anyone out there.

Thanks!"

trwor8,1,2022-03-29,How do I get a decent remote job as a mechanical engineer? I'm open to changing fields!,binjo1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/trwor8/how_do_i_get_a_decent_remote_job_as_a_mechanical/," Hi  All. To quickly summarize myself and my current position: I am a 25  year old living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I recently received a BS  in mechanical engineering and am now working for a medical device  company. I have a good amount of internship experience (calibrating and  deploying monitoring sensors, mechatronics projects, some basic computer  vision projects, CAD). I am proficient in MATLAB, C++, Java, Python.  Generally, I pick up new skills quickly and am happy and eager to learn.

At  the end of the year I would like to move out of my city into another  large city, and foresee that I will continue to move around throughout  the rest of my twenties. I am looking for a remote position so that I do  not have to change jobs every time that I move. I am finding that for  early career mech-es this is not really an easy thing to achieve, and am  considering changing career paths (maybe something in tech/computer  science?). I realize that such a transition is difficult, but hope that  coming from a technical background will give me a good starting point to  build experience before entering the new field. I am wondering if  anyone has any general advice/personal experience/examples of others who  have made such a transitions. I am interested to know if there are  particular remote jobs that are achievable by people with my background,  or remote jobs in adjacent fields that I could feasibly achieve after  6-8 months of online courses/certificates.

Thank you very much for your help and advice!"

My father has got a sudden health problem which will require treatment (and a shit ton of money) over the course of 9-10 months. He has quit his job and was the main source of income. My family is not exactly rich to manage his treatment( We tried our options ). There is also the aspect that emotional support since my mostly mom will have to look after him.

My plan was to take loans (along with savings) for my grad school and do it on my own. I have talked to my friends and family members and they are saying I need to support my family until his treatment is complete.

I am trying if there is any way that I can go for my grad school and solve this family problem. Or apply in Spring if situation permits.

The thing is I do not have any siblings and my parents won't be able to sustain( financially speaking ) for too long.

There is so much on my plate right now I have no idea what to do. 😫

If it do comes down to doing job, software engineering seems to be the option(pay is good)

Most of my internships are research based. So I have not really prepared (leetcode, interview prep) for these job opportunities. I will be graduating soon and hiring window for my class is already over.

Since grad school was my goal and I got my admits, I did not apply to on campus job opportunities from **Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Facebook**.😣

* Will the admission/visa committees will raise an issue if I have a gap year?
* What are other things which I could do to improve my profile for next cycle? take another GRE attempt to improve my score?
* Do more side research?
* I have heard grad schools do not care about work ex(like USC).
* Does age matter for grad schools?
* What can I expect in the next cycle?
* Do companies hire after graduating?
* How do I deal with the feeling of ""left behind""?😭

**These few week have been one the worst weeks in my life.**

Tl;dr: *Got admits for my top choices but I may have to give up on Gradschool for this cycle due to sudden family health issue requiring lot of money and support for 8-10 months. Don't know what to do or how to deal with all this*."

I have a job interview at a huge tech giant coming up and I think I’m a great fit! I went to college at a great school but, and trust me I know it’s stupid, left before submitting my internship paperwork for credits which would have made me officially graduate. 

Fast forward 3 years later, never got hounded for it and it’s never been brought up. I contacted the school a long time ago and they said just send it in and file an appeal and it will undergo a process but my lazy (and dumb) ass just never did because no one has ever gotten on my case about it. I would have done it if I planned to gun for this job but they reached out to me and got the hiring process started. Now I’m nervous because this is my first potential big employer and I’m assuming they’re going to look under every rock.

Should I just say I didn’t complete or say I completed the university and roll the dice?"
trz43p,1,2022-03-30,"I accidentally divulged too much personal information when called for an interview, should I be concerned and how do I remedy it?",WenchQuench,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/trz43p/i_accidentally_divulged_too_much_personal/,"I was called today to schedule an interview for next week for a paid internship that would literally launch me into my career. It’s an absolute dream! The thing is, she was calling to schedule for next week and I’m having surgery next week, so I said I was only available Monday since I was having a medical procedure done and would be out for the next two weeks. I can’t believe I was so blasé with personal information like that, I was just so excited and nervous that it came out. The surgery wouldn’t affect my ability to be in the program and I would be back to normal by the start date. In fact it’s a two week max expected healing period and there’s a good chance I’ll be back to normal in just a week! 

I’m worried that saying that will impact my chances in getting chosen for the program since it’s in a hands on, physically demanding field. I’m not sure if it’s anything I need to really worry about but I’m very anxious now that I’ve tanked my chances with this internship. I’m thinking I might just say I’m having my wisdom teeth taken out if I need to address it, that’s not what’s happening but it’s far less invasive than the truth and I’ve had my wisdom teeth out before which did take two weeks to heal. So is this something I should be concerned about and if so, what do I do to address it?"

ts4rvh,0,2022-03-30,What the coming recession might mean for you,PaisFigo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ts4rvh/what_the_coming_recession_might_mean_for_you/,"More and more the people that know things are talking about a coming recession.  I think many people, especially those are who are actively and passively looking for work should prepare for some significant changes.

When a recession happens companies tend to exert more pressure that gets pushed down onto bosses who are told to make their teams more profitable or less costly.

Everyday there are countless posts about WFH and switching careers and what people think are toxic bosses.  If you haven't worked for a company during a recession, especially the beginning of one, things can get weird 

We see posts here about companies starting to bring employees back into offices.  If we enter a recession I suspect this will happen even more.  Bosses who are getting pressure from their bosses will want to exert control.  And if/when people buck, it's easy to let those workers go (unless they are true top performers).  

Departments that don't provide revenue (most of them) will be forced to not hire new people or make cuts.  I'm going to piss off a lot of marketing people but no matter what reports you make showing you actually make revenue, your sales leaders when it comes down to it will get credit.  So if you're a junior person on a marketing team, head on a swivel.  Might want to start looking for recession proof industries.

Marketing always always always gets cut, their budget gets cut, then the conversation turns to, if we are not doing as much, why do we need X.  Hey if it ramps up you can hire an intern to help or ""hire X back"" which everyone knows is a lie.

I hope whatever recession is coming doesn't really come, or is really short but companies always react.  

Listen to your shareholder calls, read the Qs and Ks, if you're at a private company listen for clues, if you're at a startup ask about burn rate, funding, etc 

In 2008 I worked at one of the major job boards, when everyone in the world is talking about saving their businesses and laying people off, stuff gets real fast.  Companies who spent 100-200k a year on recruitment advertising would say, we are laying people off, we don't need to spend that or anything with you.  

Many of my clients went out of business.   The first 12-18 months were crazy till everyone calmed down.  But companies would say, we don't want any applicant who is out of work.  There was a feeling and it was bullshit, that companies only laid off bad people.  I can't tell you how many meetings I had with people who should know better who said, we get 1000 applicants for this job, 950 of them aren't working, how can we quickly filter to the people with jobs.

So I guess I'm saying, be careful out there.  What you think is ""toxic"" in 2022 when you're 24 is probably very different than what people over 35 think is toxic who lived through the last great recession.

And looking at housing prices, it seems very similar in some ways"

I am also a female in a STEM field, so I am slightly worried. I don't even know where to look, other then applying to the big companies (those will usually prioritize returning interns). I started using linkedin, but I am still not very good at scanning the market. I know I need to put myself out there and send my CVs to as many companies as possible, but I need a good way to tell if a certain position would be a good fit for my skills and the direction in which I want my future to take. I have little guidance from my parents and university.

What are some ways of telling how a company treats the employees before an interview? How can I better scan the market for positions that would align with the subjects I am interested and the skills that I have? Can I look for internships in different countries as well, if I know there is a better STEM industry in a different country then where I live? If yes, how can I look for those positions in different countries, considering that Linkedin tends to advertise positions in your location?

The internship would end the same week I graduate. It is a series B startup that is in their growth phase and this is the first time they’re doing interns and are looking for expansion of employees, and I did really well in the interview and apparently was a top candidate for them (no leetcode or anything it was pretty chill just asking about application design and personal fit questions and general problem solving). 

While I wouldn’t consider myself a bad developer for someone finishing up a CS degree I definitely am not anything amazing (I mean who really knows with all that imposter syndrome), but I have really good soft skills from past jobs in sales and stuff which really helps once I can actually get an interview and past the resume screen.

While I do think there is a good chance I can get converted to full time at the end of the internship, I won’t know until the end so that’s a lot to bank on, I could either have a great job at the end or be unemployed if I don’t play my cards right… 

With that all being said, assuming I don’t get a return offer, how much does having a software engineer internship help for getting that first entry level job? 

Is the internship going to be really helpful for getting past resume screens or just mildly so or not at all? 

TLDR: how helpful is an internship for getting past resume screens and being able to get more interviews than without one?"

Any advice?,Realistic_Dingo7363,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/tsa0oo/where_do_i_24m_live_next_year_any_advice/,"I (24m) graduated last may from college. I wanted to move out after moving home from college in May but I couldnt afford it. The reason I wanted to move out is because I hate being at home. My parents are divorced and both households are toxic for me and cause me a great deal of stress. Since living home I have felt so much stress and anxiety and have felt suffocated, and have been foggy. 

Background:
My mom and dad live about 10min apart. My moms house is tiny and I feel suffocated. She has anxiety and constantly nags and gives me no space. My dad is controlling and manipulative and I used to go over there on the weekends but stopped going after we had a fight because I said I didnt want to go somewhere with him after work. He pays for my college and my car so im grateful for that but we have a rocky relationship since he went to jail for a weekend two years ago. He has belittled me and my older brother before and I remember having fights with him because he calls us lazy. I told him “we werent lazy when we bailed you out of jail”. My brother appeases my dad and is soft in my opinion. Regardless my dad works hard and has provided so much support financially and has taken us on expensive vacations. My mom is loving and does my laundry so I appreciate that but overall Im miserable at home.

I got accepted to a prestigious business graduate program about 20minutes from my house in the city. This starts in September. I was very happy and absolutely love the school, but dont like how close it is to home. My brother is a doctor and got his residency in the same city as my school which starts in june.

Ive been looking for summer internships but havent got one yet. My plan was to move out in may and just live by myself near the school. I found an apartment right near my school with shared random graduate students for $1200 a month. The lease would be from june 2022 through august2023. I was happy because I can finally move out and id be set for summer internship if I get one and school. The problem is my brother is looking for an apartment too. I talked to my dad and he said to wait until I get a summer internship for sure to move out. He also wants me to live with my brother. My brother keeps asking me to live with him but I dont want to deal with him or my family and want to be on my own. 

The lease is due tomorrow and im afraid I wont find this nice an apartment again. I dont have a summer internship but I have enough money saved up that it would be okay. Im nervous about hurting my brothers feelings and the backlash from my family for not living with my brother. His school is in a different part of town so we would live far from my school. Lastly, im pretty sure my dad would pay for our apartment together. But i dont want to live with him and not sure if I sign the lease today.

Tldr: Should I sign the lease thats due today for june2022-august2023 even though I dont have an internship for summer. I hate living at home and am starting school in sept. My brother wants to live with me and i dont. My family might get mad at me for wanting to be alone. Im scared and lost."

*Enlado could feel his heart thumping in the background as he guided the massive metal chassis that was his body towards the enemy. He was a fallen soldier reincarnated as a demi-god of the battlefield. His titanic frame pounded the earth, alerting the enemy of his approach, but it did not matter. Artillery shells struck the enemy’s airfield destroying the biomechanical constructs that the enemy fielded as air support. The troops with their myriad alien forms began to swarm from within the rest of the encampment as their point defense emplacements more accurately zeroed in on the artillery shells that sought to fall upon them.*

*Enlado ‘felt’ the heat of energy weapons upon his metal skin, but it was too late as he reached the threshold he’d calculated and leaped. He landed on the other side of the enemy’s defensive emplacements and, with a sweep of his hand, let out a massive cutting beam that destroyed them all in one fell swoop. He felt a thump beneath him as an explosive let out and left him reeling for balance. Small arms fire and anti-vehicle weaponry began to thump out as he let out a cry of rage and regained his balance. He continued his swathe of destruction, leaving the enemy base in ruins. He stumbled out of the wreckage, barely operational after the damage he had sustained in the fight. Enemy artillery fell upon what had been their own base, and Enlado once again greeted death, this time with open arms.*

## Hephaestus

Bridget had thought she would be late but by some miracle had made it on time. With fewer train breakdowns occurring every day, it seemed that it was just faster to get places. She couldn’t even imagine what things would be like if the transport system was able to get some actual upgrades instead of just being patched up. That being said, the panic from the feeling of being late had yet to subside as her mind raced. Her leg jiggled in an attempt to spend the nervous energy bouncing around inside of her stomach.

The door to the next room opened, and a tired, somewhat bedraggled looking man in a lab coat stepped out. He went up to the secretary, “I have an interview to conduct today right? If they’re here already I want to get it done so I can get some sleep before that madman sets me to another project.” His voice was a low growl, as if he had either been up far too long or just woken up.

The secretary, unperturbed by the grumpy scientist, didn’t even look away from her terminal before pointing towards Bridget, who had seized up. This was not exactly what she had been expecting. The man turned to her and squinted, eyeing her up and down. “Hmm you look a bit young. He’s not too kind towards women either, but if we keep you out of the way it’ll probably be fine. C’mon lets get this over with.” The man walked through the door, and Bridget scurried afterward, following him partway down a hallway into a small bare room furnished with only a table, two chairs, and a viewscreen.

The man looked at the viewscreen as it popped to life, her files that she’d submitted for the application appearing as he browsed them. “Hmph, looks like your just now completing technical training, so no actual experience. Could be good, means no bad habits at least. Good marks all around, some positive notes from instructors too. Not too shabby, now if only we could do something about the fact that you seem more like a scared rabbit than a person,” he said pointedly as he whipped around to stare at Bridget, who stood frozen at the door, unsure of how to react to this strange and brusque individual. “Look, we aren’t going to get far if you don’t take a seat,” he said as he occupied one of the chairs himself.

Bridget took one of the seats quickly and tried to steady herself a bit, “I’m Bridget by the way,” she said. The man in front of her still hadn’t introduced himself yet, and she hoped he would take the hint.

“Ah, yes, names. Those can be important,” the man said in a tone that seemed to indicate he thought no such thing. “I’m Doctor Michael McKay, not that anyone around here cares that I’m a Doctor in my own right. Compared to Doctor Voinovich we all might as well just be interns running errands. Enough about me however, tell me of yourself, why should I hire on someone who looks like they might die of fright just from looking at me?”

Bridget forced herself not to flinch, the man’s voice was forceful, and he was not at all the consummate professional that Bridget had thought might be interviewing her. “Well as you already noted, I did well in my training so I am at the very least somewhat intelligent. I might seem a bit frightened to you, but I assure you I’m just somewhat in shock, because I wasn’t expecting such a...belligerent inteviewer. I’m sure I’ll get used to it. That being said the real reason why you should hire me is that I’m addicted to my work. Technically speaking I don’t have my certificate yet, but I’ve completed the final round of coursework already. And I’ve typically completed every round of coursework weeks to a month in advance of the end of the courses.”

Doctor McKay frowned, not breaking eye contact with her as the viewscreen tabbed over to her instructor’s comments. They flashed by the screen one after another, several referencing the blindingly fast pace at which she devoured courseloads. “A useful trait, especially in this lab. Good enough, your hired. Go talk to the secretary at the front, I’ve already sent her a message that your hired, she’ll get you sorted with all the paperwork and when your first day will be.” He stood up and moved to exit the room.

“Wait, that’s it? You haven’t even told me what it is you’re doing here.” Bridget asked, shocked that the interview was over so quickly.

Doctor McKay turned his head back towards her. “Part of what you’re about to sign is secuirty clearance paperwork. All work done at these labs is of utmost secrecy so I couldn’t tell you if I wanted to. You’ll find out what you need to know as you need to know it, if you can’t stomach that, then don’t sign the paperwork.” And without another word, he left Bridget alone in the room.

Bridget collected herself quickly and made her way back to the waiting room, where the secretary smiled at her, “Here you go dear. Welcome aboard.” Bridget took the tablet from the secretary’s outstretched hand and signed the documents without a word. She would read over the contract later, she knew it was foolish to not read through it first, but she Had to work here. Her instincts were screaming at her that whatever was happening here, it was the opportunity of a lifetime.

## Kipouen

After some time, Joseph finally had the opportunity to meet the team that he would be accompanying into the bunker. They were a motley lot, but all proven fighters. The plan was laid out for them and was fairly simple. Orbital sensor readings provided by The Avalon Fleet had done a good job of mapping out the bunker. It was shielded but didn’t account for advances made by scientists aboard The Avalon. The images were muddy but readable and had been turned into a rough map of the bunker and sent to the rebels.

They weren’t sure of the exact location of the Grand Arbiter but should be able to ascertain it after gaining access to the bunker’s security systems. The Avalon Fleet had given them some tools that should be able to do that for them automatically. They just had to plug them in and let them work. Once they had her location, they’d begin heading for her position.

The end of the ‘briefing’ was taken up with a rundown from Joseph on the capabilities of their new equipment. He wasn’t exactly an expert on everything, but he was all they had at that moment. After what amounted to a quick rundown, they geared up and headed out. They didn’t have the luxury of time as the longer they waited, the more likely it was that The Grand Arbiter would find out that they knew where she was. It might not matter either way, but any slight advantage was just that.

The entrance was meant to look like an office of some variety. The signage hadn’t weathered the fighting very well, but Joseph recognized the type of layout from visiting law firms and lenders in the past. It was a decent cover but had been rendered moot by the war. There was an elevator shaft at the back of the building that was meant to take them down. Some sort of code was required to get the elevator working, but bypassing that wasn’t much of an issue. One of the rebels pulled off the panel and plugged in his tablet. Joseph didn’t know what he did, but he easily bypassed the elevator security, and they were able to descend.

The hacker smiled as they descended, “I worked in information security as a penetration tester. My entire job revolved around trying to crack into systems much more complex than this elevator. That being said the tools I’m carrying around in this little tablet are basically toys compared to what The Avalon Fleet gave us from the sounds of it. I wouldn’t be able to crack military-grade encryptions with this little thing,” he tapped his tablet for emphasis. “The Avalon Fleet though said that this can do it no sweat though.” He shook his head incredulously as he held a comically tiny nondescript metal stick with an adapter plug at the end.

Some of the rest of the group started taunting him over the subject, but Joseph tuned it out. The Avalon Fleet definitely had some impressive hardware. The fact that even with everything they had that they were still locked in combat with the aliens after all these years. He couldn’t even imagine what that foe must be like. He wasn’t sure he ever wanted to find out.

After some few minutes, the elevator settled to a stop and dinged open. The group had been at the ready, prepared for an immediate firefight. They immediately ran out and found cover, only to be greeted by silence. Shiroykos took it in stride and ordered them to move up. They slowly began to cover ground, following the provided map keeping an eye out for terminals or maintenance panels.

Soon, without encountering any resistance on the way, they found their mark. A small maintenance panel, it was locked but was easily cut open. The little stick that The Avalon Fleet provided was put into the appropriate port, and after a few moments, data began to stream to them and fill out their map. The bunker had far fewer people than they had assumed. It seemed that all of the staff was robotic, and the only people down here were a handful of generals and The Grand Arbiter herself.

Then security footage came online showing what looked like a conference room. All the generals were slumped at their seats, clearly dead. Crumpled on the ground in the front of the room lay The Grand Arbiter, Elizabeth Yamato Cirillo, a hole blown through her own head. On the screen behind her, blood had spattered, but beneath that splatter, words could be read. ‘Connection interrupted, please try again.’ Joseph’s jaw just went slack, this was not at all what he had expected. He looked to Shiroykos, who merely nodded, giving him permission as Joseph took off at a sprint.

The HUD from his helmet had already mapped out the fastest route to the conference room, and he quickly made it there. The door slid open and he entered slowly. The scene was just as he’d seen from the camera feed. He looked at the screen, more information was forthcoming that couldn’t be read from the camera. She’d tried to set off nukes buried all across the continent. And when the signal had been intercepted, Joseph could only surmise she knew there was no going back and that defeat was inevitable. In that moment, she must have decided it would be less painful to take her own life rather than be captured and be subject to the whims of her enemy. Going out on your own terms, he could understand that, but he felt bitter that in her final moments, she had succeeded in taking one more thing from him.

Joseph collapsed into the open seat that had clearly been meant for her and removed his helmet. Tears of rage and relief streamed down his face as he was overwhelmed by the conflicting emotions rising up in him. After everything, this was how it ended? It was so anticlimactic as to be absurd, but who was he to complain? After all, the end result was the same, even if he didn’t get to pull the trigger. He still felt disappointment at not being able to do the deed himself, but he would shake it off in time.

In the meantime, he put his helmet back on after wiping away the tears that had come forth. He took a deep breath and triggered his comms. “Former Grand Arbiter Elizabeth Yamato Cirillo is dead along with her Generals. She killed herself after failing to detonate nuclear devices buried across the continent.”

Shiroykos responded over the line, “Thank you for the confirmation Joseph, sending the data topside now. We’re going to finish sweeping the bunker, please maintain your position for now.”

Joseph acknowledged the reply and remained in the chair. A single thought echoed in his mind as he sat. What now?

tsddi9,19,2022-03-30,How common are “diversity hires”,2077_trinity,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tsddi9/how_common_are_diversity_hires/,"Sorry, I don’t know if that the correct term. But I’m interviewing for internships and when I get offered a technical assessment/interview I get excited because it means the company likes my application at least enough to give me a chance. However, given I’m transitioning, my mom simply likes to blow these opportunities off like the company is just trying to reach a diversity quota. From my resume and LinkedIn though, you can’t tell I’m transitioning at all, I’ve made it all as if I was a cis woman. 

I know companies want to establish diversity and that these quotas are real but does it invalidate my skills and hard work as a coder? Am I only being offered opportunities to possibly fill these quotas and not because I’m genuinely a good candidate?

**I don’t want this to turn into whether diversity hires are good or bad, I simply want to know how much of an effect being a woman/minority actually has on your chances of being hired."

I have been given the choice to either work in the main Yorktown office, or the much smaller NYC office. Which one do you think I should do? Living in NYC sounds really fun, but would I miss out on opportunities working at such a small office (as opposed to the connections and opportunities I would have at the Yorktown Research Center)?"

As someone nearly done with college admissions, I am looking to craft a path for myself in college. I am a competitive programmer (albeit not a super-genius one) and I am also interested in AI (computer vision in particular), robotics, space-stuff (astronomy), maybe fintech. Lately I have been reading on how counterproductive competitive programming and hackathons are apparently, so those would be side-hobbies at best (Google Code Jam, etc.). So I would like some input on how to prioritize competitive programming, other competitions like hackathons or Kaggle, internships/co-ops, participating in research at college. Like, what should I dedicate my time to more? What is the best way to find my niche in computer science while getting the attention of employers for internships, co-ops, and jobs?"

tsgg7v,0,2022-03-30,Does anyone have experience or advice that can help me switch from an early mechanical engineering career to one in programming/tech?,binjo1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tsgg7v/does_anyone_have_experience_or_advice_that_can/," 

Hi  All. To quickly summarize myself and my current position: I am a 25  year old living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I recently received a BS  in mechanical engineering and am now working for a medical device  company. I have a good amount of internship experience (calibrating and  deploying monitoring sensors, mechatronics projects, some basic   computer  vision projects, CAD). I am proficient in MATLAB, C++, Java,   Python, and am currently taking a machine learning/neural network  course. Generally, I pick up new skills quickly and am happy and eager  to learn.

I anticipate moving  around the US relatively frequently over the next few years and am  looking for a fully remote position so that I do  not have to  change  jobs every time that I move. I have found that for  early career   mech-es this is not really an easy thing to achieve, and am  considering   changing career paths to computer science/programming/tech. I  realize  that such a transition is difficult, but hope that  coming from a   technical background will give me a good starting point to  build   experience before entering the new field. I am wondering if  anyone has   any advice/personal experience/examples of others who  have made  such a  transition. I am interested to know if there are any particular remote  jobs that I could feasibly prep for through online courses/certificates  over the next 6-8 months. Any recommendations of such  courses/certificates are also greatly appreciated!

Thank you very much for your help and advice!"
tshbsz,4,2022-03-30,Stuck in google EMEA team match,prawtuts,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/tshbsz/stuck_in_google_emea_team_match/,"I cleared my google team match interviews for a summer internship a month back and I have been in the candidate pool since. I heard back from a couple of hosts but things did not work out due to location eligibility.

I am only eligible to work in London and Munich.

As it has been around five weeks, I am starting to get worried about finding a match. So if anyone here works for Google London or Munich and is hosting interns, I would love to have a conversation about a potential match.

I have experience in backend development in Java and Python, and I have work on some intersesting project so far. I am open to my choices for a potential project for an internship."

tsll5f,5,2022-03-30,Some advice for a future graduate applicant failing to get internships/fellowships/etc...,danknight2011,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/tsll5f/some_advice_for_a_future_graduate_applicant/,"Hello everyone. Im not sure where to put this post but Ive been thinking about this for some time and I think I'd like to hear from strangers going through the same process :). I should mention I want to get into quantum computing for grad school.

So I'm a computer science/physics/computer engineering major with a 3.47 GPA, and I've got plenty of leadership experience as webmaster/vice president/president for an organization that is building a schoolhouse for a community in another country (EWB-USA). I'll explain my research background after explaining my situation.

I've been applying to REUs, internships, coop, fellowships, and basically every type of opportunity in the quantum field, but as of today I think I've been completely rejected. I even added a 5th year of schooling thinking that I might get an opportunity this time around, but that was not the case. 

I am worried my application won't be competitive for any university at the MS or PhD level for the fall of 2023. Although quantum is super niche, with ~300-500 applicants, these groups are accepting anywhere from 10-30 students (which I havent been a part of).

I will have two publications total &amp; a coauthor-ship for a solutions manual by the time fall 2023 applications roll around, but as of now its really just a work in progress. Otherwise, I've worked on plenty of machine learning projects &amp; I've even completed an undergraduate thesis on a quantum algorithm-hybrid neural network from scratch. But again, it's currently unpublished. I also have only done talks at my current university and havent been accepted yet to speak elsewhere.

My question for the community is ""what should I work on improving for now?"" Is it reasonable to still try &amp; aim for a fall 2023 enrollment? I also planned on taking the GRE/physics GRE for the summer.

I just feel crazy because I thought my background was solid, but each one of the groups I applied for unanimously said no to my application, and so Im a little discouraged &amp; would love to hear your guys' thoughts.

Thank you for your time &amp; thank you for reading this post. 

Sincerely,
A lost undergrad

Edit: TLDR: I thought I had a solid background, but Ive been getting rejected by every quantum-based opportunity. Im now doubting my competitiveness for graduate quantum programs. Would appreciate any advice on next steps."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Biology/Honors Chemistry - 9/10,  I had her for two years in a row and she liked me; recommended me for several biomed programs in sophomore year that ended up not happening thanks to COVID

AP Lit - 7/10, She likes me but I had only been her student for about 3 months when I asked (did not have a good personal connection with my AP Lang teacher thanks to COVID). Also she's kind of quirky so its very likely she wrote something equally quirky in the letter.

Scoutmaster - 6/10, She probably echoed a lot of the leadership stuff I discussed in my leadership PIQ for the UCs (below).

AP Biology - 5/10, I had her for distance learning and I tried to participate as much as possible, but we didn't have as good of a personal connection.

**Essays**

Common App/UC PIQ #5 (significant personal challenge) - Discussed my experience recovering from back surgery over the summer and first semester of senior year, how it caused me to re-evaluate my priorities and change my study style to match my physical limitations. Spent about 5 hours drafting, rewriting, and lengthening the original PIQ response into the Common App essay, and I think the writing on both was pretty good.

UC PIQ #1 (leadership) - Talked about my experiences in Scouting and learning about different leadership styles, how I led through teaching others and struggled to learn delegation during my Eagle Scout project, but eventually was able to improve my leadership skills through the process. Spent about 4 hours drafting and rewriting, and I believe my writing was strong.

UC PIQ #2 (creativity) - Basically wrote about how I like experimenting through cooking and how that connects to my future goal of being a scientist. Spent about 3 hours writing. The writing was good, but this was probably my weakest PIQ because I didn't have any ECs or tangible accomplishments to back it up (I just like cooking lol)

UC PIQ #6 (academic passion) - Discussed my passion for the biological sciences and my childhood wonder at the processes of life, and how my experiences through AP Bio and a molecular biology summer program deepened my appreciation for life's mysteries. Spent about 3 hours writing, and I think my answer was strong.

I also wrote many, MANY supplementals (shout out to UIUC and UNC), and overall I would rate them as mediocre.

**Advice**

I know a lot of people were disappointed by the UC decisions this year, and I am extremely blessed to have been accepted into both UC Davis and UCSB (got a tough decision to make lol, if anyone has any advice pls drop it in the comments). I was told both were a reach for me, and to have gotten in is a dream I had given up on many months ago.

***I can't speak on applying to T20s*** given my unfortunate results from UNC, Berkeley and UCLA, but if I have any advice for those applying to ""mid-tier"" (because lets be honest, many of the schools A2Cers call mid-tier are anything but) schools in the top 50 or 100, its this:

1. Quality over quantity of ECs. Even if you have a leadership role in \*all\* of them, having a few very impactful, personal experiences in unique ECs that you are actually passionate about makes for better essays and overall a better high school experience.
2. Love your acceptances. After I started getting into schools, I watched a lot of dorm tours and vlogs and found unique things about them that I knew I would like if I ended up going there. This also helped me be excited about each acceptance, even if it was to a safety.
3. In the same vein, don't fall too in love until you get accepted. I am very guilty of this: I was head over heels in love with UC Davis, and at the same time trying to come to terms with the very real possibility that I might not get in. Luckily, I did get in, but this made the whole admissions process very stressful for me and I know it would have been emotionally devastating to get rejected. Its totally fine to have a dream school, but I recommend not getting too attached until you get that confetti on your portal.
4. APPLY TO HONORS COLLEGES IF POSSIBLE. Especially if you want to continue your education after undergrad, this is a great way to get increased access to research opportunities and internships to strengthen your resume. Honors colleges are a great option if you end up going to your safety. The application is usually free and the worst they can do is reject you.
5. Remember that r/ApplyingToCollege and r/chanceme are not representative of the average student. These subreddits present an unrealistic view of the kinds of schools most people are applying/going to, even those with stellar stats and ECs. The truth is, most people don't even apply to Harvard or Yale or Stanford. So even if it seems like everyone's shooting for an Ivy, it's important to be realistic about your preferences, mental health and financial needs.
6. Learn to live with the unknown. At some point, you did everything that you could and there is nothing more you can do except wait. This was very hard for me to accept and is easier said than done, but eventually you have to accept that whatever happens is out of your hands once you hit submit.
7. Don't make rash decisions. Currently struggling with this as I try to decide between Davis (my dream school) and Santa Barbara (higher ranked school, thought I wouldn't even get in). Do your due diligence before you commit, even if you're pretty sure of where you wanna go.
8. Join discord servers for your schools once you get in! Met some really great people through the UC Davis admitted students discord :)

Congratulations to everyone, and good luck to the class of 2023! And, fellow Aggies or Gauchos (we'll see how it turns out), hope to see you on campus next year :)

Edit: Committed to Davis. Go Aggies!"

As humanity prepared to launch their first FTL fleet - a major occurrence for the young species - a wexik hacker began to put together pieces that could put humanity between a rock and a hard place on the political scene as Earth's homeworld status was revealed. Meanwhile, all eyes were on Ryan in many a government building, and somewhere in France, a ragtag group of malicious humans hatched a plan, with eyes on *them* as well...

_

Ryan was chosen to be a sort of intern mechanic aboard an alien ship. Which, while awesome, was soured a bit by the fact that, apparently, he was going to be pulling spy duty as well. The airlock door opened, and in front of him stood an Embuos. He suddenly felt infinitely less confident as the snake towered three feet over him, with over twenty feet of tail still resting on the ground. Its four arms were each as thick as his thigh around their *wrists*, and its slit eyes stared into his soul. In absolute contrast to the visage before him, the translator spoke up.

""Hiya! Pleasure to meetcha. I'm Gexie, and I'll be, uh, 'showin' ya the ropes,' as you humans say it,"" he said in a *deep* southern accent and offered a handshake. Ryan honestly didn't know how to respond. To either the fact that the translator *had* a southern accent, or that it saw fit to give this particular alien such an accent. Carefully, as if he were handling a bomb, he shook the lizard's *beefy* top right hand. It was very firm, but not as powerful as he would have thought. His arm wasn't *immediately* torn off, at least. Ryan still shook his wrist a bit in pain when Gexie let go and looked away. The big lizard arms did *not* lie, that was for sure. He slithered along, and Ryan followed next to him.

_

Rawlins took the last sip of straight black coffee in his cup. It wasn't nearly enough. The wexiks had started a motion to put protection around the Sol system, and he had to do everything in his power to get it shot down. The people of Earth and Mars would view the action as hostile, and the worlds' governments would have to take the same view on such a movement into human territory. Now… how does one tell the friendliest species in the galaxy that any effort they make to protect one of their allies will be seen as hostile action? He *supposed* with lots of caffeine, which he was sorely *lacking* at the moment. Well, first order of the day. Discuss it with the starter of the movement. Tarrki. He walked to the furry creature's office before knocking on the door. 

""Come in,"" he shouted in the wexik's yipping language. Rawlins opened the door. 

""Oh, hello, Rawlins. I didn't expect to see you here today,"" Tarrki said, darting his head forward in curiosity. Rawlins smacked the folder down on his desk. The wexik just stared at him in confusion.

""... Tarrki. You need to call this off,"" he half-pleaded, half-demanded. The small wolf-creature's confusion only deepened, bringing with it a quiet irritation.

""What? Why?"" he questioned. ""We aren't asking for anything in turn! We just wish to see our allies safe!""

""Humanity won't see it that way. The people will see it as an act of war. Or an act in preparation of one,"" Rawlins tried to explain.

""... Are you teasing me, here, Rawlins?"" he interrogated, barely holding a professional face as anger grew underneath his gaze.

""I'm afraid not,"" Rawlins answered, dipping his head. ""I know that you have no ill intentions, and so does everyone else in this station, but humanity doesn't trust the wider galaxy yet.""

""You're serious? You're saying no to this?!"" he questioned, raising his voice. ""There are *no* defenses around the Sol system, and we offer you *thousands* from our fleet, *for free,* and you're saying *no*?! What's going to happen if some... upstart Empire decides they want some packbonding slaves?! Or some Theocracy declares you an affront to their God?!"" The furball was furiously shouting at this point. ""Earth will be defenseless! Your *homeworld* will be-..."" Tarrki cut himself off, realizing his critical mistake too late. Rawlins sat there in shock. They-… they knew? He blinked as the shock slowly wore off. He sat in silence with Tarrki for what felt like an eternity… *How did they know? How long did they know? Was it that one hacker?* He thought they successfully locked him back out!... But the main question… what would this mean? For everyone?

""... I, uh… I need to make a call…"" he spoke, barely above a whisper. 

""... Alright,"" Tarrki whined. Hearing his friend's dejected tone, Rawlins wanted nothing more than to comfort him, but he had a job to do, right now. ""I'll... talk to you later."" Rawlins got up and walked back to his office. 

_

It was getting late, and Ryan saw the sleeping quarters. A pile of twelve Embuos, four humans and a strange, tiny bug creature laid in the center of a giant mat in the middle of the floor. Today had been a long day of Gexie showing him around the place to get acquainted. He knew the general layout of where everything important was, like the cafeteria and reactor room, and who the crewmembers all were. Gexie was the lead mechanic, and likely the person he'd be learning the most about space tech from. Speaking of, Gexie spoke up in his deep rural tone. 

""C'mon n' climb in, Ryan. Swear we don't bite,"" he offered, patting a spot in the middle of the cuddle pile. He hesitantly climbed in to the pile. Everything felt… very *close*. Uncomfortably so. As Gexie put his monstrous arms around him, Ryan already felt difficulty trying to breathe.

""Okay, nope, sorry,"" he apologized as he stood straight up. ""Can't do it. Too confined,"" Ryan excused. ""I feel like I can't breathe.""

""What is the issue?"" asked another Embuos, Reilu, who was given a Victorian accent by the translator.

""Uhm, sorry,"" Ryan apologized again. ""I probably should have clarified this when I came on board. I have pretty bad claustrophobia. If I'm in too small of a space, I start hyperventilating, and I get really bad anxiety."" He took a second, trying to think up a compromise. ""I'll just sleep a little bit away. Humans usually sleep alone, or at most with their significant other, so it's not a big deal,"" he offered. The Embuos looked at each other with a faint hint of sorrow, but bobbed their heads in a nod equivalent. Thank God. Well, with that settled, Ryan set himself a pillow on the massive mattress and closed his eyes. 

_

Today was the day. The greatest machines that Humanity had ever invented were being launched in mass, each extending humanity's efforts in space forward by a decade… and it was Bowler's job, as an agent of the planet-wide CIA equivalent (Earth Extraterrestrial Intelligence), to watch one of the marvels of engineering being launched today get stolen by some crackheads. Life was just *great*. He watched the cameras cut to a loop. Just as they had, unfortunately, planned. "

I’m finishing up my sophomore year at a ~T10 CS uni and have yet to land an internship for the coming summer. I know it’s technically not too late but it’s looking bad. I submitted over 200 applications, did my Leetcode, and even had a few final rounds/big tech interviews that didn’t go my way. 

I know I’m still early in my college career but I really felt like I had to have something for the summer - and to perpetuate the problem I’m doing worse and worse in my classes. I have around a 3.5 rn but I’m looking at a 3 for this semester. I really want to work somewhere like google or Spotify but the competition is insane and I can’t see why a company would ever hire me. 

Does anyone have any advice for finding last second internships or advice for getting on track for a FAANG? Also considering doing an internship during the coming semesters as I have enough credit to graduate a semester early.

tsn7pg,2,2022-03-30,How to find a customer for a bunch of very promising greenhorns?,mkflg,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tsn7pg/how_to_find_a_customer_for_a_bunch_of_very/,"First of all, I would like to note that I've read the rules and the FAQ section before posting this and I'm myself not really sure if it's the best place for this type of question but I still see the gist of my post as being a very useful  example of problems in programming industry and something that many programmers would consider useful to know if they want to be more well-rounded professionals. So, now the story...

I have several very promising interns that I've mentored for a couple of months and now that the company has suspended its hiring process due to all of the current situation in Eastern Europe they're left in a very risky state of possibly not getting hired at all not only by the company but in the whole region at all. 

I, myself, have some experience in pretty much every part of a typical web project life cycle except actually getting a customer who will provide an actual paid project.

I want to get my chance with this post of getting some directions from the community on the possible ways to, well, finding a job for a fresh team.

If you have any advice or resource recommendations where I could find further wisdom on the problem of finding, leading and finishing a project from a real customer from a business view, please, give me a few pointers.

Aside from that, I would also really appreciate any advice or resources on mentoring and skill development of an inexperienced team.

Thank you."
tsne3x,14,2022-03-30,Deciding between two internships...,StillBlueberry6,dataanalysis,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataanalysis/comments/tsne3x/deciding_between_two_internships/,"I'm a college student and I've recently received two summer internship offers. One from a reputable bank as an operations analyst and one from a healthcare related company as a data analyst. 

The bank one is in-person and requires me to relocate for the summer but the other one is remote. I'd like to stay close to my friends for the summer if possible but if the bank is providing something I'm not seeing then one summer won't be bad. 

From doing the interviews, I can't tell exactly what I'd be doing for the bank but I'm sure excel would be my daily. For the healthcare company, I'd be using sql, probably python, and maybe I'd even learn some aws.

They both pay about the same 

I'm having trouble deciding, but I'm leaning towards the healthcare company because I feel like getting experience with sql and python would be very beneficial for the future plus I can be close to friends for the summer. 

Any advice would be appreciated! If anyone want more background just ask.

Lastly, I just wanted to mention that I'm very fortunate to have received two offers and I'm not trying to brag or say this is a terrible choice to make. Just trying to make the right choice.

Edit: thanks for your thoughts so far!"

I'm also planning on taking 2 classes this upcoming summer quarter. I've read in previous threads to avoid taking classes in the summer especially while working. How difficult are the first two classes, and how feasible is taking the 2 classes during the summer term and working full-time?

(i.e. working in a lab and taking gen chem and bio) With that in mind, when should I start looking and applying for internships?

I was planning to leave anyway but clearly my timetable has been moved up. While job searching I spammed out my resume and received more attention than I expected and have been fortunate enough to land a couple full-time offers as well as an internship. To my surprise I also managed to land interviews with a couple FAANG companies.

My problem is that I don't see myself at these full-time positions long-term, I think with a bit more time spent leetcode grinding I could ace the FAANG interviews or I could be more selective with my applications and find a more enjoyable job. So my short-term goal is to buy time to study and continue applying.

My current options are as follows:

1. Full-time position inside my current company (would need to relocate a long distance)
2. Full-time position outside my current company (remote)
3. 3-4 month internship outside my current company (probably remote)

So I'm looking for general advice and opinions on how I should proceed. I clearly don't want to relocate across the country, especially for the salary they've offered but ideally I think it would look the best on my resume to stay within the company before I jump ship. The job outside of my company is tempting since it's remote but I don't think it would be perceived well if I left my company and worked there for 4 months before leaving. In the short-term I the internship sounds appealing but I don't know how that would look on my resume either. I'm also working on my PhD part-time so I'm sure I can explain it away at the interview stage but that would require me to get to that stage first.

Thoughts, suggestions, and advice are all welcome!"

tsv1fg,7,2022-03-31,Help to find motivation.,d4calt,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/tsv1fg/help_to_find_motivation/,"Greetings! I am sorry if this isn't the kind of post meant for this sub or if it's repeated, I can't seem to find what I'm looking for.

&amp;#x200B;

I am having a hard time trying to focus on a game project and putting time and dedication into it. I am not able to get this idea out of my mind that I'd be wasting my time if I got into game development instead of doing something else tech-related (which, as you could guess, leaves me stuck in a cycle of inaction). Hope you believe me when I say I don't mean to offend any of you by that.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently in the second year of a CS major and the environment isn't very encouraging. I feel constantly bombarded with the pressure of internships for big tech companies I don't really care about, people who built computers when they were 12 and feel the need to show off and then a clear preference for certain career choices. It feels as though I should be making websites 24/7, or making AI, or doing competitive programming to get an interview at some big tech. Become a developer at Facebook or go away.

&amp;#x200B;

Got to admit I got into CS for the very reason of making games. I have always loved the way you can make a player interact with the environment, the kind of worlds you can create, the stories you can tell, and the impact you can make on the people who play your game. I love every single aspect of it. From designing mechanics, programming, making art, writing stories, working with musicians and other artists. I even love it when there is something that isn't working and I get to spend hours figuring out a solution or looking through forums for answers. I've done a couple of Game Jams and I've loved it!

&amp;#x200B;

But my passion is murdered when I feel like it's widely downplayed by peers, teachers, and even family. It's like, for them, game development is nothing but a hobby or something you shouldn't really be expecting to get a career on. I constantly listen to others say ""It's just making games for children"" or everything is a ""dumb little game"". Therefore, I find it hard to focus and devote as much time and effort as I'd like when I keep hearing about how useless it is, or how small, irrelevant, and even ridiculous it is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any word of advice or personal experiences would be gifts for me. It gets rough to get through a CS Major when you lack the passion or it dies slowly. I don't feel very passionate about doing anything else.

I have a placement year included in my degree and I want to do multiple summer internships in the UK before going to Minnesota, USA to do a placement year. I have been to the states before in 2018 and I have indirect family living there( mother’s sister). Is it possible for me to secure a placement? What are the immigration requirements? Do you guys it’s worth it? Honestly it’s either a placement in my home country: the Netherlands, America or london. Also Dutch passport with English residency for the immigration details.

**Interviews**

**Northwestern**: (3/10) First college interview ever. Also the worst college interview ever. Dude kept on asking me finance questions once I told him about my work in finance literacy. He asked question where you can have an opinion. He asked me if I liked stocks or mutual/index funds better. I said Index funds because as a teen its better to invest your money in a safe medium and I even reasoned my answer(I could go on but it would be boring). HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL ME MY OPINION WAS WRONG. and then he told me why stocks were better. I understand both are good but it depends on the person, hence opinion. Anyway, I think he thought I was gonna be a finance major. I didn't like it.

**Tufts**: (8-9/10) This interview was very good. He asked nice questions. Lasted 50 minutes. Told me about his college years and what he like about the town and college. Also talked about international relations because that was my 2nd major choice and he happened to major in international relations.

**Locatie:  Rotterdam**

**Aantal uur:** 32 - 36 uur

**pionierswerk verrichtenVacaturenummer:   2326** 

**Wij zijn op zoek naar een professionele ICT service delivery manager voor 32 tot 36 uur per week.** Bij het Centrum Jeugd en Gezin (CJG) Rijnmond werken zo’n 700 professionals op 49 locaties en in opdracht van 14 gemeenten aan eigenlijk maar één doel: het gezond, veilig en kansrijk opgroeien van de ruim 250.000 kinderen in onze regio. Is er iets mooiers om je voor in te zetten? Je kent ons misschien van onze consultatiebureaus waar we ons letterlijk over baby’s en peuters buigen en een vertrouwenspersoon zijn voor hun ouders, met al hun vragen. Maar ook daarna volgen we de ontwikkeling van de kinderen en staan we voor hen en hun ouders klaar langs het soms slingerende pad naar volwassenheid. Ja, alles kan goed gaan tijdens het opvoeden en opgroeien, maar niet iedereen heeft dat geluk.

**Jij gaat pionierswerk verrichten**

De professionalisering van de afdeling ICT leidt tot deze nieuwe functie. Als ICT service delivery manager ben je meteen onmisbaar. Voor je 15 collega’s op deze hechte afdeling én voor de rest van de organisatie. Met jouw ervaring in contract- en servicelevelmanagement (SLA, DAP), je kritische blik en helicopterview stimuleer je de verdere ontwikkeling van onze ICT-dienstverlening. Door jouw inbreng ondersteunen we de organisatie steeds beter. Van ons ouderportaal tot Kidos, ons registratiesysteem voor professionals: alle systemen functioneren op en top zodat onze collega’s uitstekende jeugdgezondsheidszorg kunnen bieden aan ouders, kinderen en jongeren in de regio Rotterdam-Rijnmond.

**Wat ga je doen?**

**Jij tilt ons leveranciersmanagement naar een hoger niveau**

Je primaire focus ligt bij het professionaliseren van ons leveranciersmanagement. Met onze leveranciers kijk je naar de lange termijn en bouw je strategische partnerschappen op. Je stelt de producten- en dienstencatalogus (PDC) op en bewaakt de volledigheid daarvan. En je zorgt ervoor dat alle afspraken met leveranciers goed in beeld zijn en zowel intern als extern nagekomen worden.

Dit combineer je met het managen van interne projecten en processen. Je bewaakt de kwaliteit van onze ICT-dienstverlening en stuurt actief aan op het gebruik van standaardoplossingen en uitvraagscripts. Je zorgt ervoor dat het interne servicemanagement steeds beter wordt zodat de andere afdelingen en CJG-locaties fantastisch en waardevol werk kunnen doen. Je bent een sparringpartner voor het hoofd ICT en de informatiemanager. En als het hoofd ICT afwezig is, neem jij haar rol waar.

**Jouw toegevoegde waarde**

**Jij werkt van binnen naar buiten en andersom**

Je draagt met gemak 2 verschillende petten tegelijk: die van vraag en aanbod. In gesprek met leveranciers vertegenwoordig je onze organisatie. En in het projectmanagement vertegenwoordig onze organisatie en bevraag je de externe leverancier. Je weet wat voor de leverancier van belang is en je kunt daar kraakhelder over communiceren met het team. Je bent een onmisbare schakel die stuurt op behoefte en kwaliteit. Zo draag je bij aan onze missie: 'Op tijd voor ieder kind'. Iedere afspraak die je maakt en alles dat we vervolgens opleveren draagt daaraan bij. Zodat ieder systeem en iedere app op tijd beschikbaar is - en ook beschikbaar blijft.

**Jouw profiel**

* **Je hebt een hbo of wo werk- en denkniveau. Je hebt bijvoorbeeld de hbo-opleiding Bedrijfskundige informatica of een vergelijkbare opleiding afgerond.**
* Je hebt minimaal 5 jaar relevante werkervaring in een soortgelijke functie.

* Je kunt goed omgaan met een veelheid aan informatie en afspraken. Daarin breng je graag structuur aan.
* Je hebt een kritische blik die je goed kunt toepassen in gesprekken. Je bent een sterke luisteraar die gericht kan doorvragen.
* Je bent een sociaal persoon, gericht op verbinding.
* Je bent in staat om efficiënt en effectief binnen een team samen te werken.
* Je hebt affiniteit met de (jeugdgezondheids)zorg.
* Je draagt bij aan de verdere ontwikkeling van CJG Rijnmond en je werkveld.
* Je bent in het bezit van een geldige Verklaring Omtrent het Gedrag (VOG).

**Ons aanbod**

* Een impactvolle rol in een ICT-omgeving met veel spannende projecten op komst, zoals een redesign van ons netwerk en een nieuwe WAN-infrastructuur.
* Fijne collega’s in een gemotiveerd en gezellig team.
* Je krijgt veel vrijheid en ruimte voor eigen initiatief in een uitdagende werkomgeving en een breed werkveld.
* Volop ontwikkelingskansen en scholingen: vakinhoudelijk en persoonlijk.
* Behalve midden in de samenleving werk je ook midden in Rotterdam, op de Westblaak. Maar ook thuis. We maken afspraken over de afwisseling tussen thuis- en op locatie werken en jouw werkdagen en -tijden.   
* Onze cao kent onder andere een vaste eindejaarsuitkering en uitstekende parttime werkmogelijkheden. Deze functie is gewaardeerd en ingeschaald in schaal G conform de cao CJG Rijnmond.
* Gezien de huidige arbeidsmarkt bieden wij voor deze functie ook een arbeidsmarktoelage aan in schaal H.
* **Het carriereperspectief is dat de Service Delivery Manager op termijn het nieuwe Hoofd ICT zal gaan worden.**
* Vanzelfsprekend voorzien we je van alle technische hulpmiddelen, inclusief smartphone en notebook.

From what I have researched about the position, I know what to expect in terms of it being much less hands-on technical and more documentation-focused, but is it better than going the “traditional” route of something like a SOC Analyst in terms of “entry level” cybersecurity positions?

The internship has a pretty strong chance of going into a staff IT Audit position at the end as long as I perform well and I already feel a great connection with the team and I feel like I have a solid understanding of what I’m getting into, but I just want to make sure that I’m going down a career path in GRC that isn’t a dead end. To be honest, I never considered going into GRC or even bothered to look at these jobs until I was offered one and kind of assumed I would start as a SOC Analyst, so I feel a little blind in this specific path if cybersecurity - but if it’s still a rewarding path with opportunity for growth, then Im more than happy to continue down this track."

I wanted to hear everyone’s opinion on the value of CTF tournaments; and at-home CTF experience like THM, HTB, Vulnhub, etc. 

Im a junior studying cybersecurity and from last November until late February, I probably applied for roughly ~30 internships. I either never got a call back, or received a rejection letter. It wasn’t until I attended a fairly big CTF competition in February when I got a call back. The competition was sponsored by about a dozen big name companies, and they held a job fair a day before the competition. After the comp, I received a call for an interview for a cyber engineering internship position. Fast forward two weeks, and I successfully landed the internship for a cyber engineer. I have no formal work experience in tech (Not even a help desk role), but I’ve done a fair amount of CTF challenges and spent quite a bit of time on THM and HTB. Whenever I graduate next year, do y’all think having a cyber engineering internship coupled with sec+, CEH, and CySA+, I’d stand a pretty decent chance landing a full time job in the cybersecurity industry? 

Do CTF tournaments/at home experience really stand out to employers that much?"

tt209d,1,2022-03-31,New Engineer Impatience or Time to Leave?,r2peetubes,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/tt209d/new_engineer_impatience_or_time_to_leave/,"Backstory - Let me start by saying that I was an older student looking for a career change. I started an internship during college. During that internship, I was asked if I'd like to stay on part-time during school. Closer to graduation, I was given the invite back to full-time after graduation. I took it as I felt I knew the team and company and could hit the ground running in my new role as an ""official"" engineer.

I came back and was given new projects/tasks as it has been even when I was a student and part-time. I completed them to the best of my abilities and asked questions when I needed to. Then there was a sharp switch in how my managers were interacting with me. I was pulled off a project and was given, what I can only call ""busy work"". I talked with my manager about my progression and the new work I was receiving and was told that ""I was doing well and it just takes time"". I kind of questioned her response until I received my performance/salary review and I ""exceeded expectations"". Part of the the review stated to continue manual calculations and analysis to better understand analysis software and gain better engineering judgement which I had no problems with.

This put me at ease until I got my next task, which more or less brings the story to the present. I was told to start an analysis model. It's been the largest structure I've dealt with so far and in a program that I've had little experience in - which I let be known from the outset. Since getting this task, I've had little interaction with my managers - even when I ask or email questions, I either get no response or very short answers. Come to find out that I've been doing this in parallel with a more senior engineer who has basically done the analysis on the building already. So now its not even me analyzing anything as much as its just me updating my model to reflect his model.

I'm trying to be patient since I know I can't expect change or more responsibility overnight but I would think that the time I have put into my roles and the recognition I WAS getting at first counts for something. I was told to do more manual calculations but I haven't been given the opportunity to do so. When I ask, I'm told more or less to be patient but I haven't been given any other assignment. Not only am I starting to feel guilty for charging this time to the client but its becoming demoralizing to the point where I waffle on even attempting to ask questions or communicate with my team since recently, I haven't gotten anything from them.

I wanted to provide enough detail but keep the post short, so I apologize for the length.

Like the title says, am I being impatient or do I read the writing on the wall?"

My aim is to go into the industry after graduation. 

In addition, I have some specific queries:
1. While I was initially enamored by the ML Engineer job title, from what I've seen here on Reddit, it just seems to be a glorified software engineering role where some basic knowledge of ML should suffice. If that's true, the idea of studying something extensively for 1.5 years but never utilising that knowledge doesn't quite sit right with me. On the other hand MSCS at UT is more flexible, but then again not sure that means I'll learn something useful from an industrial perspective...
2. People say that the CMU ""brand"" matters, but I've also heard recruiters don't care about which program you're doing there. This seems slightly contradictory given some programs are way more selective than others. Surely, an average person doing MSCS at UT Austin should have a higher ""brand"" attached to them (given it's their only on-campus program + is highly selective), than an average person in the SCS at CMU?
3. Would you say UT has a location advantage with presumably a lot of local hiring happening from there? Or is it minimal/offset by the CMU brand?
4. Should I be looking at the course-load factor, as in what gives me more time to apply for summer internships and jobs?

PS: The difference in cost is obviously a big factor, but if the difference in post-graduate outcomes is stark, I'm okay with making the investment.

Sorry for my ramblings. TIA."

My question is how difficult would it be to get an entry-level job in data science with no internship/experience a year from now if I don't do this internship vs getting a job with the internship on my resume?

Background - 
I have joined a company as a DE. Prior to this i was working as an intern straight out of college.

I have picked up the tech stack in the new company fairly well. Thanks to this community 🙂

Problem.

The problem is that i have zero knowledge of the new domain.At the interview, i asked them if i would be given some kinda training as i come from another domain.They were cool about it and said i will be given the required KT.

Fast Forward few weeks...
The functional KT is finished. However, it only comprised of very very high level info. I have with me couple of pyspark scripts which basically consists of some complex transformation required for the final data model.


The transformation is not the issue. The issue is understanding business logic behind them. It seems all alien to me.
I am finding very hard to understand the business logic behind the query and understand the data altogether.

What i am doing. 
Doing adhoc analysis of source table data and trying to make out sense and see if everything fits together and identify relationship between the tables.
But this is taking lot of my time and minimal result.


What should be my plan of action here?
Any help or guidance will be appreciated.

Getting the GIS science degree would add 2 quarters as most of its requirements are already fulfilled by the GRM BS and GIS cert classes.  3 programming classes, remote sensing, airphoto interpretation, and land use planning.  I already wanted land use, but would graduate before its available again if I just got the cert.

Is the education in programming and the gis degree worth it over a 6 course cert?

It would also give me another summer of GIS internship.

I have gotten straight A's in GIS classes, and am doing research for a GIS professor.  I am looking to get straight to work after school so the internship is big on my to do list, as is seeing the research project through to completion.

Is a double major even the edge I think it is in job seeking?"

However, with only 1 1/2 months until both internships start, I’m stuck and genuinely have no idea which one to do. Just looking for advice or other’s thoughts and opinions. Here’s what I think of both opportunities.

COMPANY 1
- Out of state but concerned about being so far from family and friends
- Most likely more interesting work?
- Mix of in-person and remote work so would get a good balance of office environment work and remote work
- Better for my personal growth to get out of my comfort zone 


COMPANY 2
- In state so would get to be around family and friends
- All remote work, which I also did last summer and didn’t enjoy that much
- Very convenient and not much of a hassle (don’t have to move, fly to another state, etc)
- I would feel more bad if I backed out of this company since the HR team accommodated me a lot (found a specific team I could work in that wasn’t posted in the job application and I got to meet some of this team)

Both are relatively equal pays. Any insights or perspective would be thoroughly appreciated 😂"

He's massively impressive.

I'd like to find a way to have him connect with his peers.  We're in a small school so he doesn't have many (any?) peers who share his level of interest.

Is there a camp I could help him apply for?  Ideally one that he could get a scholarship for by showing his projects?

I've also considered signing him for a college class or apply for an internship designed for high schoolers.  But I don't also don't want to accidently stifle his enthusiasm for programming.  Those types of experiences can have some harshness and intensity to them that might be a lot for such a young person.  On ther hand, most experiences for his age group... he's well beyond them and might bore him.

What should I do to help encourage his development?  He has online peers already.  And his work on Odin Project has surely taught him a lot about independent learning, which he thrives on."

I‘m a student and I‘m working part time (around 12h per week). After I finished my internship at my previous company, the people there offered me a job for 27chf/h (no paid holidays). Even then I didn‘t know if it was a good deal, so I interviewed at other companies for software development jobs hoping to see what the market offers.

I shot myself in the foot because when the recruiter asked me what my salary expectations are, I was shocked and didn‘t know what to say. Then I have a range that my old employer gave me (25-30CHF/h). Now I don‘t know if I undersold myself.

I‘ve gone to online salary calculators and I couldn‘t find a definitive answer. Most of them are suggesting that I‘m on the lower side of the spectrum.

I wanted to hear everyone's opinion on the value of CTF tournaments; and at-home CTF experience like THM, HTB, Vulnhub, etc.

Im a junior studying cybersecurity and from last November until late February, I probably applied for roughly ~30 internships. I either never got a call back, or received a rejection letter. It wasn't until I attended a fairly big CTF competition in February when I got a call back. The competition was sponsored by about a dozen big name companies, and they held a job fair a day before the competition. After the comp, I received a call for an interview for a cyber engineering internship position. Fast forward two weeks, and I successfully landed the internship for a cyber engineer. I have no formal work experience in tech (Not even a help desk role), but I've done a fair amount of CTF challenges and spent quite a bit of time on THM and HTB. Whenever I graduate next year, do y'all think having a cyber engineering internship coupled with Sec+, CEH, and CySA+, l'd stand a pretty decent chance landing a full time job in the cybersecurity industry?


Do CTF tournaments/at home experience really stand out to employers that much?"

1. How hard is it to get into CS, informatics, or applied math at UW?
2. Which college (UW or UCSC) will give me more opportunities (internships, clubs, jobs)?

Obviously, Covid ruined a lot of my plans, making me drop my master's application and search for a job instead as I wanted to save money as well as shifting my final semester internship in the US from 7th semester to 8th.

Couldn't give up on US intern opportunity because of it was once in a lifetime opportunity in my area of interest (ML and robotics research) despite my middle east student visa being at risk as my student term was coming to an end. Unfortunately, I had to stay a few more months in the US (after my middle east visa had expired) but once I came back to India, the placement coordinator said he couldn't help much be he'll try, yet he didn't after constant pestering.

Now, I am unable to get decent developer/analyst jobs in India which will help me save money and enhance my career as I have to apply laterally and most of the companies hire from universities only and neither can I get jobs in middle east because I am no longer a legal resident of the same and the opportunities are way lesser.

I am so frustrated at myself for not applying for Master's and taking a loan instead of this. I already have a gap from oct 2021 till now (recruiters have been asking me about it and then ghosting me). Don't know what to do at this point. Can't be reliant on my parents. They're retiring soon too"

I was excited about this job and honestly still excited about the potential of work that could come my way. 

One of our other new hires that started with me also quit, and I was also expecting to get more work and I got one new responsibility but it's something that I barely have to do. 

For the most part since I've started I haven't received much work other than busy work and even that isn't enough to keep me busy. 

I ask for work about once every other week. Especially since my manager complains about how much there is to do, which is obvious from the amount of hours he works. So I try to ask so I can lighten his load, since we are the only 2 engineers that work in this department plus 2 interns. 

I've noticed that the interns seem to be constantly busy. All my work I finish within 4 days and that's me stretching it out a bit so I have something to do through out the week. I don't have due dates for my work and usually it's no rush jobs. Yet the interns do get that type of work. 

I've spoken to my manager and told him I could handle more work. I feel like my talents are being wasted here. I'm stuck here until the end of the year due to a contract I signed promising that I'd stay here if they gave me a relocation package. 

I have no idea what else to do other than research and keep some of my skills sharp by learning/practicing on my free time. This job is feeling more and more like torture cause I'm stuck in a desk only working about 5% of the time I'm here. My time feels wasted, I'm not being stimulated here, location wise I'm so isolated and I don't know anyone, I feel like I have mo purpose here except filling a seat.

I decided to start a business making apps on the side to fill my time at home. 

I don't want to just quit, I really would like to learn but it feels like I'm not given the opportunity. How are the interns busier than I am after being here less than half the time I've been here? If I wasn't sure I was doing a good job, I would think I'd be getting let go or something, that or I'm a diversity hire  /s 

I'm just running out of steam, so if someone could give me some advice that would be really helpful for my sanity"

- Over 4 years at the company (1+ as an intern, 3 full time)
- I spend 90% of my time writing SQL and building Power BI reports
- Also do some web development using PHP and JQuery
- Tiny bit of Linux stuff as well, since I manage the server instance my web apps run on
- I also write PHP scripts and run them via cron jobs to manipulate/move data from one database to another

I currently make about 82k base + 7% annual bonus.

I applied to a data engineer position within the company. My supervisor is aware of this, and they don't want me to leave their team. So they offered me a data engineer position within my current team to keep me from leaving. I've accepted the position and will now be getting paid $92,750 base + 7% target annual bonus to perform the same tasks as listed above. The job title is changing, but the work remains.

Maybe I'm wrong, but based on what I've been seeing on this sub, some other subs and levels.fyi, I think I'm being underpaid. Considering my work experience and the fact I'm graduating next month with my master's degree in computer and information science, I think I should be getting paid more than what they're offering me.

I'm going to leave the company soon regardless, because I want a more technical position with more programming involved. I don't want to write SQL and build Power BI reports all day. But I'd like to know how much more I can expect to make once I do get a data engineering role (or similar--end goal is MLE) elsewhere.

ttayu0,4,2022-03-31,What to do when denied learning experience at practicum site?,esptutor,therapists,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapists/comments/ttayu0/what_to_do_when_denied_learning_experience_at/,"Hi everyone! I am a second-year MFT student who started my first practicum site in February. I had a really difficult time finding a MFT supervisor/site with relational hours in my area and ended up taking an intern position at an agency that primarily serves SMI individuals. It’s not the population I really wanted to work in, but when I did my initial interview there, the clinical director told me I could help grow their newly launched children’s and family services (my desired population). 

Since I’ve started, there have been a number of red flags. The first is that the agency strongly prefers the use of DBT. I understand the value of learning/using DBT, but it’s not my first choice. Further, I feel limited in my ability to practice other modalities that more closely fit with my budding therapeutic identity. Others include limited communication (I didn’t get my first client until this month and spent my time in waiting with nothing to do), last minute cancellations of trainings, no follow up on promised trainings, excessive turnover, and being left in charge of getting my own informed consents for supervision/recording signed instead of having it done at intake which is really difficult with this population especially over telehealth. I chalked all of that up to working in an agency. However, recent events have made me question if I should continue on at this site. 

Up until this point, I have only gotten adult individuals. When supervisor spoke with my clinical director about adding children and families to my caseload, she rejected the idea, the reason being that there are too many adult clients on the waitlist. I understand the reasoning but also it feels like I was baited and switched and that I’m not getting the variety of clients or relational hours I need. I communicated my concerns to my supervisor, but I also feel bad putting her in the middle. I want to advocate for myself, but I am sort of uncomfortable going to the clinical director directly. Further, I don’t know if or when I should have my university intervene. Lastly, I’m worried that if I leave, I won’t be able to find another placement and be in practicum purgatory again. Any and all advice is appreciated."

I just finished a coding interview and I did terribly. For whatever reason, I pretty much had a panic attack when the first question started. It was so simple but I didn't finish it in time. Of the 3 questions, I only got one test case to pass on the final question. Everything else failed. I know I could have done all of them perfectly if I wasn't panicking.

Its so late in the year. I'm a junior, so this is my last summer to get a decent internship and I feel like I wasted my opportunities. Some companies still have applications open but I doubt they are actually still looking for people.

I needed to be making decent money this summer to pay my rent and tuition next year. I needed the experience and potential of a job offer after my senior year. And I messed it all up. During winter break I made a list of 30 companies to apply to. But with projects and things getting in the way I only applied this month. Way too late, most of them were already closed.

Do I have any hope? Has anyone ever gotten an interview in april? Any advice at all that would help a hopeless CS major?"

There is so much stuff you can do with CS that I seem to like everything (theory, data science, development, among so many others) that I don't know what to do (except 2110 and related stuff). Any recommendations on how to explore the different fields efficiently?

Additionally, I don't know if I should take CS2200 because I may end up doing Intel and Theory and it is not a requisite for those threads."

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Lang - 8.5/\`10: taught me virtually, I did very well in her class (like I might've been the best student, I was scoring close to 100% on final essays and timed writes), she liked me a lot and helped me start a speech and debate club

AP Bio - 9/10: taught me ap bio in 10th grade and biotech in 11th, here's how I knew she really liked me: AP bio has 60 or so kids (across 2 periods) and each year she selects about 5 to present the class in the informational meeting for prospective students for the next year, these students are generally her favorite or the most high achieving and I was one of those students

Referee from AYSO - 9.5/10: this guy knew me since I was 9 and brought me up through the program (he works as an executive at a biotech firm so he knows how to write), he went over all of his bulletpoints he was planning to write about, and all of them were solid

Manager from Internship - 8/10: he wrote my letter kinda late but he knew me very well and I performed nicely in the internship, my managers offered to write me referrals for future internships but he went over what he was going to write about and they all showcased me well

Counselor - 8.5/10: she knew me since freshman year and loved me, treated me like a nephew

**Interviews**

A family friend does interviews (not somewhere I applied) so he helped me prep, I was ready for almost any question, did several mock interviews.

Dartmouth - went excellent, totally vibed 9/10

Northwestern - also went great, he actually facetimed me on his phone, I met his kid, and I texted him after my result, honestly just a good contact for the future 9.5/10

Rice - mostly was a Q and A about Rice, she didn't ask me that much, 8/10

Cornell - similar to Rice, 8/10

Penn - my Interviewer tried to ask me hard questions (I was prepped for some and not for others), eventually salvaged it and hit home some strong points at the end but almost lost it, 8.5/10

**Essays**

9/10 personal statement:I started over summer, personal statement was about my sister/family and understanding her struggles growing up in a traditional family and our different interactions with culture

I had a private counselor who gets a lot of good results every season so my essays for every supplemental were like 9-9.5/10 - I had a lot of iterations and met with my counselor multiple times a week to go over stuff

**Additional Information:**

Post EA Notes The goal was to go 1/4 with UVA, Umich, Gtech, and UIUC. Going 2/4 (no rejections so it's really like 2/2) is an absolute dream. I got super lucky with this. Still a little sad over CMU since it was my dream school but hey UVA and UIUC aren't bad at all. UNC was fine to take an L on since they take so many in state kids so that's life. Wrote LOCI for mich and GT but not Northeastern since I got into purdue at the time and I wouldn't have gone to Northeastern over Purdue. Lesson here is EA helps a ton so apply EA everywhere you can.

Post RD Notes: Damn. As much as I want to feel hurt by my rejections, and as much as they do sting, I still have 2 great options. What really sucks is not being able to go to college in southern california (lot of family there) but I'm thankful for it all. Without my counselor's help/guidance who knows what could've happened. Yeah, it was a hard year, I'm applying CS from a tough demographic, but I got into schools that will take me to my career goals, and there's not much more I can ask. It's between UVA and UIUC (I wish RD added a serious contender but it just didn't), but either way they're excellent, and if anything it's motivation to do more in college.

Note about my counselor (written post EA, pre RD): she hard carried. She helped me find and create some of my better ECs, and really helped with my essays. Without her I wouldn't have gotten into uva or uiuc. I had a lot of help."

**Demographics**

* Gender: Male
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (specifically Chinese)
* Residence: NY
* Income Bracket: less than 30k (as low-income as you can get)
* Type of School: Public School (It's a title-1 school, so the worse of the worse in terms of high schools)
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): First-Gen, Low-Income, First-Gen Asian American, and my older sister is attending Columbia Grad School, so sort of legacy for Columbia.

**Intended Major(s)**: Computer Science or Mathematics. I applied to schools with joint math and computer science programs; if they didn't have that I just put computer science.

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 96.73 (My school doesn't do weighted GPAs)
* Rank (or percentile): I am ranked 6th out of about 180 students (in my year alone).
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: I took 5 AP courses throughout my four years of high school (they only had six, so I consider it an accomplishment to take 5)

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

NONE! My school doesn't do anything like that, but the ones that listed were that I was consistently on my school's honor roll and that I was a finalist for a scholarship/college program called Posse.

**Letters of Recommendation**

**AP USH (9th and 11th-grade Teacher): (9/10)** What made this one really good was that I go to a small school, so she knew me for all four years of high school. So, she has watched me grow throughout my four years and helped me along the way in many different ways.

**Geometry Teacher (10th grade): (7/10)** Only had him one year, but I helped tutor some of his students in 9th grade and now 12th, which is fun. I really like the guy, whenever we talk we always have the same mindset: money and math. Which is fun. Honestly, he was the only math teacher I didn't get to know better, but he was the one who made me want to become a mathematician.

**Counselor (9/10):** She was a sub-teacher in my school, during my 9th-grade year, then in 10th and 11th grade she became my guidance counselor and has already written me several letters for various programs and internships. This part of my application may be stronger than most people's guidance recommendation letters because she has physically seen me grow up over the four years of high school.

**Interviews**

**MIT (9/10):** We talked for an hour plus. His kids were distracting him, but it was fine. He told me that he would try his best to get me into the school, so that was nice. Also, after I wrote him a thank you email, he seemed to genuinely like me.

**Princeton (7/10):** The interview went well. We talked about the stock market and various aspects of Princeton that I didn't know about. Also, we kind of bonded over the fact that we both liked puzzles. However, it felt really rushed. He said he had another interview at 4:30, so at exactly 4:29, he said: ""I have to run, so bye now!"".

**Essays:**

**Common App Essay (9/10):** Wrote about how I was considered the stupid brother and bullied in middle school, but a teacher inspired me to do better, so now I am doing better and found my passions in math and science. People have read this essay many times and everyone has commented how they loved my essay and how it has inspired them.

**Supplemental Essays (7.5/10):** On average, all my supplemental essays were really good because all my teachers, friends, and family members proofread them before I sent them, and many of them really liked them. Of course, some were better than others, but in general, they were all at least a 6 or 7. Additionally, both the MIT and UC applications helped me with the supplemental essays because they helped me find and discover certain themes that I wanted to highlight.

**Afterthoughts**

I should've applied to more schools and created a more balanced school list. I have regrets but it's an experience that I will never forget and that taught me a lot of things about myself and life in general.

Edit: I was kinda angry yesterday but I've calmed down now and taken a step back. Many people are telling me that I should've applied to more accessible schools and I understand this, as I said in one comment: my goal was not to study in the US, it was to study at a top institution in the US, thus rejection was more than expected. I had also made this post with the intention of renting and calming myself, but most importantly to give Moroccans/North Africans an idea of the results they could be expecting as I struggled a lot to find people from my own country to talk with and plan this stuff with. I will apply as a gap year next year in prepa while taking into consideration the lessons I have learned this year."
ttd7kq,4,2022-03-31,College cost cutting suggestions,RetiringTigerMom,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ttd7kq/college_cost_cutting_suggestions/,"So now you are looking at your college options and they are all so…. Expensive. The obvious ways to cut costs are applying for scholarships/financial aid, something you should be doing right now. But if your favorite college option is a bit more than you want to pay, we brainstormed a few creative ways you might be able to reduce the cost of your degree. They will work better at some schools (public universities, generally) than others (Ivies and other expensive privates who want to see you do most of your learning on their campus to deserve the diploma).

1)      Graduate early. If you have a bunch of AP/IB credits and maybe did some dual enrollment in high school, see how that can be used to reduce your requirements at your top choice colleges. If you can cut a full year off at one school but not the others, that should be a big consideration. Often you can do a one-year related master’s degree at your same college if you later find you can afford it and want to stay the full 4 years with your friends. This should put you ahead in the job-hunting game.

2)      Take some classes somewhere cheaper. Check the rules for your college, but many will let you take summer classes at a community college or another school and use those to fill GE and elective requirements. Cheap classes for 2-3 summers can cut off a semester or more. You may also be able to study abroad at a cheaper school in a less expensive country and transfer that coursework in to fulfill requirements. It is important check all the rules for senior residency and make sure classes will count by talking to your college counselors, but this strategy has strong potential savings.

3)      Take a high course load. This isn’t a plan for everyone, but if you are a strong student it might be smart to take 18 units per term instead of the 12-15 normally considered full time. If you do that consistently you can graduate a term or two faster.

4)      Get a job. And not just any job. If part of your aid package includes work study, that’s a great plan. But if not… you could also try to get a job on campus that comes with lower tuition - some full-time campus positions will allow employees or their families to take classes at a discount or free.  Or work for an employer that provides tuition assistance. UPS and Fedex, Target, AT&amp;T, even McDonalds and Walmart offer to pitch in for college, even for part-timers. Starbucks has a terrific tie-up with Arizona State for a free online degree. Seriously weigh the tradeoffs between a job and taking more classes, though, and think about how either option will affect your grades if you are interested in grad school. And a career-related internship might beat working for an Amazon warehouse as you approach your senior year.

5)      Cheaper housing. Living expenses are often the biggest part of college costs, especially if you find yourself in a dorm with a high-price food plan, which can easily run $20K a year. If you can live with your parents or other relatives for even part of the time you may be able to save yourself so much pain later. It’s a little easier to live at home as a 19-year-old sophomore than a 23-year-old broke fresh college grad trying to save on rent and repay $80K in loans just from college housing.  If you do live in the dorms, becoming an RA or taking an administrative job can bring the perks of free room and board, definitely one of the best ways to reduce college costs. Those spots are hard to get but worth trying for. You may also be able to do a term with all online classes and live somewhere inexpensive (like at home), and then find a cheaper sublease off campus in spring when many students want to leave because they have graduated or want to study abroad.

6)      In-state tuition. This can really help if you are going to a public school. In some places this is a pretty easy process and only takes a year. If you are trying to pull it off for, say, a UC school, it would be a big challenge and probably require your parents to relocate to your new state. Depending on what your family situation is, this is something you might explore, with a lot of attention to the details and how long it would take. If you have a solid plan to switch residency but tuition in the meantime is super high, might be a good idea to take a semester or two off and work, especially if you can find a good local internship that will boost your skills.

7)      Look into military programs, the national guard, and Americorps. If you are service minded these can be good place for funding.

8)      Scholarships for continuing students. They aren’t all given out to freshmen. As you start into your program, keep an eye out for special scholarships offered by local and national organizations, as well as your school or department. I’ve seen quite a few go unused because they were set up with a lot of preferred requirements (scholarship should preferably go to a sophomore accounting major from X high school) so nobody bothered to apply. There are quite a few generous government and private scholarships for study abroad programs – check the embassy websites of countries you are interested in. And some colleges reward students who started out as average and didn’t get merit aid as a freshman but do very well. As you explore the schools you have been accepted to, ask about the potential for future awards. I know someone who only paid tuition for the first year because her excellent grades won her scholarships. After that she only paid her living expenses and studied abroad every summer with even the airline tickets covered.

If, after crunching the numbers and trying your best to figure out costs savings, you still just can’t bring yourself to pay what’s being asked, really think about whether the school you have in mind is the right start for you. Consider starting at a community college and transferring, worst case to a cheap state school. For the vast majority of jobs (basically anything except Wall Street and top tier consulting) really any decent T300 college will probably do just as well as a T30. If you are smart and hard-working, you’ll be successful no matter where you start your college journey.  I never considered community college for my kids, but after we saw the cost at my daughter’s favorite options and ran them through this entire list to try to figure out how to make them more affordable, she ended up deciding to do a year of CC. Since everything has mostly been online anyway and the dorms weren’t really a good option with covid, we are so, so happy with that decision. Instead of paying over $300K for NYU she got a UC degree for under $30K. And she is already accepted to her dream grad program with money left to pay for it.

Think about this decision as a time for bargain shopping and trying to get items you’ll really like on sale. And remember, no returns or exchanges allowed, so you’d better be really sure if you choose something expensive."

Thoughts on COMP 346 in the summer with an internship? Class is at night. If someone can confirm, I've heard there is no actual lab to conduct and that lab session are there to help you for assignments? Also are tutorials mandatory, because those are earlier in the day and I would have to miss them definitely? Regarding the teacher giving the class, I noticed Nagi Basha would give it from the TA job postings. I already looked at rmp but I wanted to also ask here, about your experiences with this prof.

Thank you!"
