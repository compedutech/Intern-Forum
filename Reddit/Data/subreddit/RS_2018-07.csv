8v65or,5,2018-06-30,Internship opportunities for rising juniors!,ElChac,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8v65or/internship_opportunities_for_rising_juniors/,"Just wanted to let y'all know about an organization called Genesys Works that gives high schoolers the chance to get a proper internship if you live in one of the following areas:  
* Houston  
* Twin Cities  
* Bay Area  
* Chicago  
* National Capital Region  

Their program is split into two parts; the training which lasts 8 weeks, and the actual internship which lasts a year. To be accepted, you need to fill out an [application](http://www.genesysworks.org/for-students/student-application/) 
 during your junior year and pass an interview which will come at a later date.  

The training takes place during the summer and will consist of 4-hour sessions, 5 days a week. You'll be taught professional skills (how to interview, how to give presentations, etc.) and technical skills (how to troubleshoot computers, how to use spreadsheets, etc.) which are useful in just about any career you could choose.   

Once that's over with, they'll partner you with a company and you'll begin your internship almost immediately. The internship itself **is paid** ($10/hr), and you'll be working ~20 hrs/week. In addition to the internship, they will also provide you with college application help which I found to be really great.  

Anyways, if you want to check it out you can go to their [website](http://www.genesysworks.org/) and look around, and I can also try to answer any questions. Thanks for reading this far, and good luck with life and stuff :)  


Disclaimer: I'm just someone who went through and enjoyed the program, and I'm not trying to sell y'all anything :)"

I am a senior computer science and math student from a low tier state university. I am considering grad school, but only if I can finish at a prestigious school (I can't justify it otherwise). Earlier there was a post about the absence of funding in masters programs, so I would need to get into a funded PhD program to continue school.

**About me:** I have a 3.9+ GPA.

I am a double major in math and computer science.

I have 2 research internships at large labs. One in particle accelerator physics and one in high performance computing. I have ~2 years as research aide at my university (where I have done nothing notable).

I have 1 banking internship.

I have 1 IEEE publication (in high performance computing).

Approx. 330 GRE (170 Q, 160 V) (Haven't taken yet only practices)

I have 1 amazing LoR (director of national lab/professor), and can obtain 2 other above average ones

I have no current research interest in particular (which is my biggest issue)

I don't really have side projects (because I play too many videogames)

I don't have side activities (hackathons, TA...?)"

I completed my data structures and algos courses in highschool so I skipped all the intro stuff and jumped right into the core classes.

I'm behind on my degree a bit, it'll probably take me just under 5 years to graduate due to some personal shit.

I applied to a consultant company called Slalom for an internship and did really well in the interviews but didn't get the job. I believe it's because I faltered on the SQL questions that I wasn't expecting. I'm still in contact with their recruiter and I'm going to apply again next year. Overall, they said they really liked me but they wanted someone more technically competent. I believe the tech was SQL as I did great on their other tech questions. I'm currently working on an iOS app I hope to publish in a month or so. I'm planning on doing a talk on Elliptic Curve Cryptography this summer at a fairly popular dev meetup I know some folks at. I started doing Linkedin stuff recently.

So far, I'm doing okay in school. I've been crushing my CS classes that deal with writing lots of software. I was top 1&amp;#37; in my past 4 classes. Beyond that I've only done okay. GPA is 3.1 to 3.2. I've just been really fucking depressed with college since my freshman year. I have a decent number of side projects completed in the past and I've won a prize at a hackathon. 

What else can I do to buff my chances at getting internships? 

What are the best ways to find internships online? I want to cast a massive net.

How big of a deal is it to graduate in CS without doing any internships? I've worked part time for a professor's small company but that's it so far.

I know this is a big dump. I'm riddled with anxiety about the future and about my worth and I have no idea where else I could post this kind of thing. Any feedback is appreciated."

I also learned how to use some ML libraries like scikit-learn to build some basic ML models.

However, when I learned how to build ML models, everything was limited to Python. What it means is, I was just able to see the results on Python console and that was it.

As I became used to some frontend web development, I became curious how ML libraries are used when building apps.

In my understanding, those Python code goes to backend and we use server-side libraries like flask or django to return the result of the ML/AI function through API. In the frontend side, we make an API call and fetch the computed result (mostly in a JSON format??) from the backend. Is my understanding correct?

I am really interested in incorporating ML/AI functionalities when developing an application, but I don't have a clear sense of how everything works.

If you are familiar with these kinds of works, please teach me some.

Thanks in advance!"

I yearn for a future of having a CS career, while living in France. I plan on graduating university with a B.S in CS from Texas State, meanwhile becoming proficient in French. Is this combination particularity good or bad for any reason?

I've taken many object-oriented classes like java, c++, python. In regards to picking a field of CS to find a niche in, I am currently gravitating towards iOS development with Swift. App's are used internationally and it seems like a prosperous side of CS to dive into.

Texas State doesn't offer resources to comprehensively learn Swift. I make personal project apps for personal enjoyment, I've released some on the App Store for portfolio purposes. I am pursuing possibilities for iOS development internships.

I will need a comprehensive knowledge of Swift, the iOS SDK, Test Coverage, ability to work with back-end developers to integrate API clients. What else should I be thinking about? is studying both CS and French a naive choice? any advice is appreciated, thanks."

In Australia all students have to do this as part of their degree so hopefully that makes it a little bit easier than say the US where not everyone seems to have to do one. 

However my main question is this: how do I get it across that I suck at taking tests? If you look at my transcript I've got just above a credit average (and a maths fail - I believe due to the uni switch) which is alright but definitely not great. However when it comes to doing projects/assignment and not just memorising an entire semester's worth of content I have performed quite well and have a better understand of the work than some of my peers imo, this just doesn't really show on a transcript where roughly 70&amp;#37; of my final marks come from final exams.

So yeah that's me, I'm looking for any and all criticisms/advice you guys might have. Also whilst I'm here I may as well ask: does any computer/digital design happen in Australia besides FinTech?

Anyway, I plan on telling the company I am interning with I want to remain with the company before the technical “end” of the internship. I would love to work there full time. Whether or not that will happen is a different story, as I have not really been given any indication that the feeling is mutual, and that I will not be kept on due to whatever reason. There are also no openings I see that I could move into within my field. 

Here is the situation. I am not sure how to go about the process with the company that called me. I’m sure they would want to interview, but I work full time at my company. I still want to try to transition into my current company, so I don’t wanna request days off or anything to interview.

I'm still quite Junior in terms of my engineering capabilities, I can't architect whole systems by myself, have average problem solving abilities, occasionally still get stuck and need guidance towards a solution from a senior engineer.

I'm currently doing cloud migration engineering work for my current company (fortune 100, you've heard of them). They're a good company but I know I'm not working with the most recent tech and I'm not getting the best experience I could be. The city I'm in is big but it isn't a tech hub.

I've been lightly searching for another job while working for this company. I was talking to a recruiter from a company in San Francisco and she said that in order to be the best engineer I could be I needed to spend some time in the bay.

So here's my five year plan: spend the rest of this year trying to find a great company to work for that's in a tech hub city (Seattle, New York, or Bay Area). Spend 2 years at that company working as hard as I can and getting as much experience as I can. Spend 2 years doing digital nomad thing working fulltime remote while living in other countries.

And here are my questions:

I want to work for a startup and get the best experience I can with recent tech, do I need to be specifically in the bay area to do this?

What is the best type of work to get into if I'm trying to eventually work remote? (like developing applications, data stuff?)

Thoughts on Golang? I spent a year doing Golang so do you think I should leverage that to get better positions since Golang devs are more scarce?

Anyone else do the digital nomad thing? How'd it work out?

8vcf6i,2,2018-07-01,Where do I go next,ShaneTheSpaceMan,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/8vcf6i/where_do_i_go_next/,"Hey everyone, my name is Shane you may have seen me here a few times.  I want to create video games, it's something that I love and want to do for a long time. Your obvious question is which aspect of the game do I want to be involved in? Programming? Animation? Design? Art?

 I personally enjoy the stories in games, the adventures, the character development, the interaction between characters and the environment, the inevitable plot twists and turns. That's what I enjoy much more than everything else, and find myself being the most comfortable. I'm decent at drawing and designing environments but it's not my strongest area. I'm decent enough that if I were to draw a train, a TV, a chair or a jacket you would be able to recognize it as that. By no means am I great at it, but I can get my point across with the drawing. Everything else I lack in, pretty badly. 

Some necessary information
1.) I have no job experience in game development.
2.) I would love to create my own videogame to get that experience but I lack some necessary skills (programming and animation, for example, is a complete foreign subject to me) but financially I cant support paying for all the people necessary to do their respective portion. 
3.) I live in southern California and I can drive to several studios within the day. Blizzard is in Irvine, Treyarch is in Santa Monica, Sledgehammer is in San Francisco. 
4.) I'm 18 working a shitty little job to pay the bills, Im sure this would help explain 1 and 2.
5.) I have no official portfolio of my story developing with things I've designed for it yet.

So my plan is to design this portfolio and to get an internship or an actual job by winter. I would say summer and fall but my class schedules are already booked and by then I can complete my portfolio. I plan on reaching out to the studios to see if I can get in contact with one of the story creators, or developers. 

For people in my position or past my position what advice do you have for me? Is there any good podcasts or books that would help me in the position I want to be in? Should I teach myself different computer languages and more skills like animation or should I just master my craft in story making and art? If you guys have any references or anyone that you can send me to please feel free and let me know! 

Thanks developers!

8vdkwt,2,2018-07-01,Relationships are hard,throwthisawaysoon321,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/8vdkwt/relationships_are_hard/,"Hello reddit. Let me start off by saying this is my first relationship. I'm shy, selfish, and a hardcore introvert. Any who, I've been in a long distance relationship with this girl for some a year and a half. She is loyal, sweet, and cute. At first I was hard core in love and only thought about her. Then after 2 months she moved in with me for the summer while I was on my internship. I'm not much of a people person and enjoy my time alone (it is the only way I can fully relax and recharge). However the summer was fine. I do think I became less sweet to her and such because I was taking her for granted or whatever. But I was working full time and taking calc. So I didn't have much of any free time. She was taking college algebra and had to drop it because she wasn't passing. I understood that it could be hard and that she might not have not understood it. But that was all she did. She didn't have a job, didn't clean the apartment and got to do anything she wanted all day. In the end I ended up paying her $20.00 a day to clean it so she could have some money. I did feel bad because she was bored all (it would have been a dream for me to stay home and do anything I wanted.). And I think she lost weight because she felt like she was eating my food. I told her she could have anything she wanted at the store. I just didn't want to have to eat out all the time. She would get some stuff at the store, but not a lot. I thought it was fine. We still did eat out every weekend 2-5 times ( which blew my mind that people did that.) Anyway it was fine.

Then college classes started back up and we both went to our colleges ( 2 hours apart). It was fine. I honestly barely talked to her during the day but every night we talked on the phone for 1-2 hours. Like there has never been a night that we haven't talked at least 30 minutes. I don't enjoy it much but she does. So that was fine. During winter break we both have a month off. I spent 5 days at my parents house and a week with her. A friend wanted me to come see him and I had talked to him in a few months so I did want to see him for two days. I asked her if I could see him and she got upset and said that I didn't like spending long amounts of time with her (which I guess is true. I didn't like spending over a week with her or anyone and nothing else to do). In the end she let me go but cried a lot and I felt super guilty. Then I spent time with him. At around 10:30pm she asked if I wanted to say goodnight and said yes. I tried to make it quick because I was at his house. So we talked for like 10 minutes. Then I went back and hung out with him. Then later she texted to see if I was still awake and said yes. She said she wanted the goodnight before I went to bed. I said okay I tell her before I go to bed. So around 1:30am we decided to go to bed I called her and she was upset that I waited so long. I felt so guilty that night I couldn't sleep. I ended up typing this not about how much of a baby she was for getting upset ( the note was just for me to vent.) Then later she found that note on my ipad that I let her have. It was very hateful and made her cry. She told her family about it and I felt embarrassed and so bad. I was having a hard time in classes and I just hurt my girlfriend bad. So that day I talked on the phone with her for probably 4 hours. Then I went to sleep and she tried to call me while I was asleep. My goes on do not disturb mode when I sleep so I didn't get it. So then she was very upset the next day by this time I didn't care anymore. I felt bad about the note, but not about not answering my phone. Before I meant her I was made sleep a priority and would go to bed around 9:30 and wake up at 6. I loved going to bed early and would only stay up occasily once a month or if I saw an old friend. However after I meant her I would go to bed around 1am - 2am talking to her. (in the beginning we talked for 4 hours minium a night). I told her that all the time, I would call her around 8pm and was hopping to get of the phone around 9ish but it would usually be 11. I don't have much to say tbh. She always wants to know about my day, but nothing really happens but she always has a problem or something great happened.

Fast forward to this summer I'm doing the same internship but she had to stay at her college town to work. I was kind of relieve at this. But this summer I'm taking Calc II and working full time. I work from 8-5 and have class 6pm-8pm and it's a 30 minute drive. So I'm really exhausted. I did it to myself with failing Calc II and having to retake it though. So we don't have much time to talk, I always have homework and such. I talk to her on my drive back and sometimes to class ( so 30minutes to an hour). She then wants to talk before I got to bed. So at 10:30pm I call her after my homework and I try to get her off the phone by 11pm which usually works. Then once she came on a week day to wait for me to get off work and was cleaning my house and found condoms (which were ours but she forgot). So then she went though my internet history. I clicked on a picture of a naked girl on the internet and you know what i did lol. But she found that and kept texting me at work and got so mad. Again she told her family that I jacked off and that really embarrassed me. She again forgave me after a while though.

I really just needed to vent and get this off my chest. Other things. I'm an atheist she's a christian. I don't want kids she does. I think I'm healthy I work out every weekday and I'm training for an ironman race. I'm pretty frugal and like improving myself. I'm pretty independent and like to do my own thing. Once I biked 125 miles one day and slept in the woods and biked back. I loved that. I had so much freedom. Now I could never do that. She would worry and want to talk the whole time. I do miss that. But when I was single. I always dreamed of having a girlfriend. I thought I would never get one I liked though. I would hook up with girls who I thought were attractive on tinder and that was nice. I miss that sometimes. Having no strings attached. Her and I met on tinder by the way ( we didn't have sex for a while though which i didn't mind) . I'm not very good at talking to girls so tinder makes it nicer. One more thing is I don't know what I want. I want to be single and just travel and do my own thing the rest of my life. Other times I want a relationship. I really just want a girlfriend I could talk to once a week or just spend every other weekend together.

So that's my story right now. If you made it this far thank you for reading all of this. Sorry for all the typos. I just needed someone to hear me.

TL;DR

I think I'm meant to be single. I'm too selfish to care 100&amp;#37; about my girlfriend."

8vf0bl,2,2018-07-01,Three supervisors in past month say I have attitude/was arguing/disrespectful. This ain't the first time I've been through this. How to express self clearly?,Throwaways0986547896,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8vf0bl/three_supervisors_in_past_month_say_i_have/,"I'm 35 yo woman, working on a career change, have two internships, and am quite tired of folks taking what I say/do as meaning complete the opposite. It happens about once a week.

This is a long post. Tldr at bottom.

After such incidents, I mentally beat myself up, get physical symptoms like nausea/shaking.

**Relevant:**

* I was raised in a cult until 25. 

* I'm oblivious, take things literally, and scour movies/TV/books/people's actions for social rules. I'm not completely terrible--got solid friends and can hold a job. Have psychologist, they doubt I'm autistic. Say it's all from cult.

* I try to find things in common with social gaffs so I can come up with rules to avoid them. I mentally repeat these rules to stop fucking up.

* Unless I concentrate while speaking, I am soft spoken and do not finish the ending of every word. People often ask me to repeat myself.

Following are three latest situations where I misread the situation/was misunderstood/was stupid.

Is there anything in common I can just...stop doing to stop fucking up?

**First incident.**

Internship one, thrift clothing store. It was a sale day with lots of clothes to put out. 

Supervisor: ""Go put those clothes away.""

Me: Did not immediately do this. Had UTI/painful bladder, visited restroom, got water, as fast as possible. (Took ~3min.) Then was called to assist customer. Finally started putting away clothes, got black greasy stuff all over my hand because reasons, and headed to wash my hands... 

Supervisor stopped me. At this point she hasn't seen me for ten min. ""You're in wrong part of store! I told you to put away clothes.""

Me: ""I'm going to wash hands, and caffeine will help me get going!"" 

Coffee is in same room as hand washing sink... I thought self-deprecating humor would make her smile. Nope.

""I can't handle your attitude, do you want me to send you home?!""

Apologized. She had me go put away clothes, no washing hands. 

**Question:** Why obvious thing am I missing in this interaction? How can I do better?

**Second incident:** 

At internship two, a museum. 

Director was telling me what period/region/time this pair of moccasins I own would be correct in. I said I have a matching not-period correct bag. He paused. 

""What did you say? I wonder why you're arguing with me about [period correct-ness of moccasins]?"" he wondered.

I was confused. There was no raised voices, no contradicting, no arguing. 

**Question:** How does one tell if calm conversation is ""arguing"" or, well, calm conversation?

**Third situation:** 

A second supervisor at museum internship. He teases everyone. My job was to lock up back of museum. He shouted out a second chore as I was heading out--something everyone headed out there is reminded to do, something I was visualizing doing to make damn sure I didn't forget.

""Go ahead and tell me something else I'm already going to do"", I quipped. I genuinely thought I was teasing back.

When I returned, he informed me he is my supervisor and I am to do the things he says to do.

There was zero intention to be disrespectful, and zero awareness I could come across that way.

**Question:** How does one tease back without being disrespectful?

**Tldr** Three supervisors have told me I have attitude, or was arguing, or was disrespectful in past month. I'm a fucking 35 woman from a cult who is oblivious/literal/awkward. Had zero intention of being disrespectful, what in the hell is the matter with me? And what can I do to stop it?"
8vfil0,1,2018-07-01,"My life is a fixer upper, thoughts appreciated",triplebamcam,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/8vfil0/my_life_is_a_fixer_upper_thoughts_appreciated/,"Hello,

First, if you're reading, thanks. So I'm an engineering student finishing two degrees, one in electrical and one in computer. I work as an intern for an engineering company, and I have a girlfriend of 4 years and 8 months. I plan on getting engaged within the next month. That's why I think I'm life reflecting. 

Basically, I'm looking for advice on money, motivation, health, and anything else you think may help. 

Right now my life sucks, and I think I'm partially to blame. I go to work every day (albeit about 30-45 min late) and I'm supposed to work 8-5. I'm a couple thousand dollars in debt from the school year, but my will to work and make money is in the toilet. My job isn't particularly bad, actually the money at $18 an hour isn't bad, but when I leave by 3:30 or 4 every day I basically don't have enough money at the end of the month to make any financial progress. So there's one issue. 

Another is that I have goals that I constantly don't complete. I'd like to make YouTube videos, and I'd also like to make some video games, but when I come home from work my drive is so low that I normally sleep for 3-4 hours and/or watch Netflix. I also play with my cat, but that's not a bad thing. 

My diet also sucks, but I've always had such a high metabolism that I've always stayed at 150, but I eat fast food on the daily for lunch and dinner, because I stare at my debt and worry about buying groceries because I'm broke and I don't have the will power to even do laundry consistently, so how could I make food? I also live with 6 other interns for the summer, so I engauge with them sometimes but it's also hard to use the kitchen with our work hours all being different. 

None of my friends or work colleges think I'm unhappy, on the contrary my work performance is pretty high because I guess I value having a good resume. My girlfriend knows I'm down a lot but she is also dealing with her own junk, so she trys to help but when she's not around I'm still a mess. She's great by the way. 

So any advice would be great, positive or negative, I can take it. Feel free to ask me more questions for clarification. Thanks. 

TL;DR I'm super lethargic and want to have a better work ethic, diet, budget control of diet, and accomplish my goals because I'm super stuck in a rut. "

All together there is 12 employees currently. I want to find a new position. I took this one about three years ago as my first out of college. I'm also trying to either move to a new city or state with this new job. 



I'm not sure exactly what position I'm looking for. My plan is to just apply for everything I find interesting, and mostly qualify for. 



My current position is with a company that installs aftermarket accessories on cars. My job is kind of odd, because the days are rarely the same. Especially these days. I'm not sure exactly what to highlight about my job on my resume. 




**Some of what I do:**
  

* Pickup/drop off cars (to dealerships for the wholesale part of business; can include very high end cars like $250k up cars, not everyone at the shop is allowed to pick these cars up so I think its a nice testament of how much I am trusted.)



* Pickup/ drop off customers (retail)



* Answer the phone (also do yelp inquiries and ones from out website via email) for both wholesale and retail sides of business



* Schedule all shop work (for about 5 installers)



* Handle quickbooks: invoicing, statements, entering checks in to close out invoice, entering CC payments, notifying past due accounts, etc.



* Keep office and shop supplies stocked (basically a lot of trips to Target and Home Depot, and buying stuff off Amazon)



* Keep the Wordpress site up to date, maintain the plugins, etc. 



* Social media: facebook/instagram ads, posting on Facebook/instagram, writing a blog for our website

Would the tech companies not care, would they care a little bit, or would they care a lot and find it really impressive (like on the same level as doing ICPC competitions)? For a general oversight I have a couple of internships under my belt and considering getting involved in ML research as well.

About fourteen years ago, I moved to study mathematics at a reputable university. I finished the degree, then a Master's with honours, and started with a PhD. After some time, however, I got severe depression and was forced to quit.  

Treatments and therapies turned out to be ineffectual for me, and soon my finances were drained. I started tutoring to earn a basic living, but sadly, for the longest time, this was barely enough to cover rent. Most of my adult life was spent on poverty and depression; however, I got valued as a tutor, and over time established the habits to sleep consistently, to get up each day, to exercise regularly, to fix nutritional deficiencies, etc.

Partly due to those habits, my state stabilised and I got somewhat more regular students to tutor and a steadier, even if minimal, income.

I'm 34 now.

**Issues**

I always had a small and loose social circle, which eroded until it was gone.

I'm too old for internships, and too inexperienced for proper jobs. I improved a few soft skills (such as listening to diverse people; adapting quickly to different skills, subjects and needs; focusing on priorities, planning accordingly; empathising while guiding), but I have no work experience. Regarding more concrete skills, for example, I am knowledgeable about technology and can code in a few languages, but never did so professionally.

**Question**

How do I find a job that allows me to build a life and where my talents are valued?"

c) résumé or detailed background information (target / non-target institution, GPA, SAT, leadership, etc.)


The more detail you can provide, the better the feedback you will receive.


**Common topics**

 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

 * [Read wiki on cover letters.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/mccoverletters)

c) I have not heard back after the interview, what should I do?  

 * Wait or contact the recruiter directly.  Students may also wish to contact their career center.  Waiting times can range from same day to several days at target schools, to several weeks or more with non-target schools and experienced hires.  Asking in this thread will not help.

Acy (Bachelor of Accountancy) and I am not that sure how to continue my future career.

During my internship (6 months) in a Data Managment Department in the Financial sector and due to my instrests of the possibilities of Data within the Financial Industry and the economy I applied for a Data Science Master and got accepted.

Currently I am doing a lot of VBA on the job (which is interresting at the moment and is giving me some insights, but not the kind of work I want to do in the future) and at home I have been studying Python, SQL &amp; a little bit of R for a while , in order to have an ""easier"" start at my Masters.

As I m lacking the Mathimatical and statistical background in my opinion and  doubt that I am going to obtain **all** the relevant knowledge whitin the 3 semesters of my MSc ( at least relevant to me, I think with this MSc I am prepared for the first job, but my personal thirst of knowledge would not be satisfied in those specific fields), I am thinking about starting another BSc in Statistics at the same time. I already constructed a timetable, and I probably would need five semesters for my MSc and six to seven for my BSc  with a 50 to 60 h week, depending on the time I need to study (semester abroad included, without it I could be a little bit faster). During the summer breaks I could do some Internships ( like 3 internships for 2 months each)  in order to gain some working experience (I guess with my financial background, it should not be to hard to find a job at a bank or insurance company for the summer, in my area)

Thats my plan up to now, but I am also a little worried, as the most people in my country work 20 to 40 hours during the Master and I would have just gained a year of working experience overall, after obtaining my masters degree with 27 to 28 ( in contrast to 2-2.5)But in my opinion, I will work presumably for a long time in the futue till retirement, so I rather extend my knowledge in fields I m intrested in, as long as it is possible. As soon as I am on the job, it is probably way harder to learn these basics. (This does not mean I do not want to learn on the job, but I think the basics have to done by then)

I am in the fortunate postion that money is not a concern, as I am living in country where education is almost for free and I would obtain a scholarship for up to five semesters.

So there are the following oppertunities:

* MSc in Data Science &amp; 20-40 hour work (I probably could get a job at my current employer with  good payment and several social benefits, but not the field of my intrest and Master studies. Moving to a more interessting department would be possible in a year and a half \[thats the way it would work at this company\])
* MSc in Data Science &amp; 20-40 hour work in my field \[Data &amp; Financial Industry\] &amp; home studies of the missing knowledge (depending on the job)
* MSc in Data Science &amp; BSc Statistics &amp; some personal sideprojects &amp; up to three internships in the summer (my personal preference up to now \^\^)

I would love to hear your opinion about my situation &amp; what you would do in my position."

My friends brother just graduated from here, with a Masters in econ and got offered 50k starting + a company car, idk how much of a difference that is. This led me to rethink my choices at the beginning of the summer when I found that out, so I started looking at accounting and ISDS. I think with both, I could get a bachelors, then either the CPA or A+ and security+, and both of these would give me a pretty safe job out of college if I have a solid resume with it. So I started looking for ISDS internships. I got a job on campus working with a database they made, but it is basically just doing entries all day, not learning very much. I kept looking and my school has an IT help desk for Jacob's engineering. I just got offered a job there that I will start on the 23rd.

I know how to use them and more than the rest of my family but I've never build one or looked at the parts for one, things like that.

TLDR: In econ, it doesn't provide the career I thought it would, want to change to ISDS. I will be a junior in the US next month. I don't know very much about components of a pc or anything more than the basics really. Just what I know from using one daily. Is 2 years enough time for me to learn everything I need to and to get enough work experience? I start a job at my university at a help desk on the 23rd.

He's a nice and understanding person, so it's not like he is a shitty boss.
He only has quite high standards, and it's been 3 months now, so of course I have made some errors or didn't expect I have to pay that much detail to some stuff.

He just told me that this can't continue like this and that we need to talk.

Do you have any advice, to me , how to get better or how to handle this?

This is an internship , I still have 3 months left."

Many of my peers had internships at larger companies and were invited back for jobs after graduation. I've had a few initial interviews but have never gotten to further stages.

I'm a CS major and I'm looking for a part-time job while I'm finishing my degree. I hear getting into IT, esp. entry level shouldn't be that difficult if I pass the certs and also brag on my CV about working on my CS BS. I have a very superficial knowledge of IT so I would appreciate being corrected. 

What I plan to do is to take my cert. exams whenever I have free time, and study whenever I have free time. I seem to enjoy how IT intertwines with my CS major subjects and it helps me get into the cutting edge with more breadth to my field instead of just plain programming things. I also like helping people and I have good social skills so I don't think it will be that difficult for me to adjust. 

The other reason why I want to take an IT job is that I don't want to do a minimum wage work that isn't related to my field. Programming jobs in my area are very competitive and demand years of previous experience. You can say that for some IT jobs, but in my perspective I don't find it as competitive. Also I like solving problems and fixing things, esp. computers because they are what I'm interested in.

**TL;DR:** I have the option of either attempting to get an internship for IT or CS, or get a part-time for IT (less difficult for CS) and build industry experience and get paid for it. I'm trying to decide which is better and is worth the effort to look forward to while I'm working on my CS BS.

Thanks guys"

My official title is a technical intern but I'm actually doing real projects. I'm going to school for cyber security and plan on continuing that track. I got into this company out of pure luck and chance through a cyber security competition so I thought that is what they would have me doing. I was so lucky to even get into the internship program because I wasn't in the running originally because of the county I lived in. The internship didn't describe what I'd be doing only that it was ""technical in nature"". At first, I got this internship thinking ""Wow! I'm gonna get paid $15/hr and I'm also learning how the real world works"" But it quickly turned sour. I was put onto a team of people that are all socially awkward coding junkies. I'm no stranger to coding but they are leagues above where I am. I really don't like them, they're hard to talk to and so different in personality to me that I don't get along with them. So that's the first issue...the second issue is that I have no idea what I'm doing. They have put work in front of me that is extremely coding heavy with tools I've never even heard of but everyone around me is familiar with. I can figure it out but I have such a struggle doing so. To add onto that I feel like I can't ask anyone around me since they don't know how to put it into layman's terms and explain it like I know everything already. It's been causing such a big issue in my life, I'm stressed out, I'm doubting my future and career path, I'm really in a hole that isn't looking good, and I've grown to dread going to my job. I've started to hate waking up in the morning to go to a job I don't like and a job that I don't know why I'm even there in the first place I can fully say at this point that I hate this job and it's making me feel stuck in life...but this internship is guaranteed to turn into a job later, guaranteed to give me a security clearance, and guaranteed to pay really well throughout all of my 4 years at college and even pay for my masters if I choose to do that (which would be nice). What I'm really asking is does it seem worth it to be extremely stressed out the next 4 years so that I can have a really well paying job during my time in college and a security clearance within a year and free education when I get to my masters? I've been contemplating this so much and could easily find another internship with another company but it seems like the upsides to this job are really unique but I can't tell if it's worth my sanity...Any advice at all helps, thank you all!"

I will apply to full time programs this fall (Round One for Fall 2019 entry). I've been doing a lot of research and reading this subreddit but I haven't been able to actually pinpoint the strength of my candidacy. Any feedback would be appreciated! I would especially appreciate feedback on four topics:

1. Priority areas to target to increase my application strength (essays? gmat?)
2. Value of grad degree and focus on energy efficient buildings (How much will this help?)
3. Realistic expectations for my chance at elite programs  (which programs should I trim?)
4. Management of recommendations (can't use current manager)
5. Communication of work experience (include volunteer work?)

**Background**

*Work Experience*

During my graduate program:

* Teaching (Part Time usually / Full Time in Summers, Paid, 2 years): Teacher and program analyst at a NPO after-school program (elementary/middle school). My manager here was also my professor for advanced statistics and program evaluation..
   * This is a strong recommendation but my work for them was completed 2013-2015... is that too long ago?
* Internship 1 (Part Time, Unpaid, 12 weeks): Analysis of energy use for commercial building stock in the greater metropolitan area of a large city
* Internship 2 (Full Time, Paid, 4 weeks): Analysis of energy use for manufactured homes in an affordable housing NPO development and cost of upgrading homes
* Internship 3 (Part Time, Unpaid, 12 weeks): Feasibility analysis of real estate development options and demographic studies for a small municipality

After my graduate program (took awhile to find a full-time position):

* Part Time (Paid, 0.5 Years): Energy Consultant for a super small consultancy on the supply chain of LNG in south east Asia
* Part Time (Unpaid, 1 Year): Affordable housing advocacy non-profit
* Full Time (Paid, 2.5 Years): Environmental Resources Policy and Planning Consultant at a smaller international consultation firm

Extracurricular

* Leadership committee of a neighborhood community planning team (liaison to the City)
   * Facilitated technical meetings for street redevelopment plans
   * Managed and acquired performers for neighborhood festival
* Vice President of Toastmasters Club
* Blood donor and blood drive volunteer
* LEED Certified

Undergrad School/Major

* Quality State School (Think: UCLA, UTAustin, UWashington)
* Political Science

Undergrad School/Major

* Top-Tier Program (Top 5)
* Public Policy and Urban Planning

Race/Nationality

* White

Sex

* Male

**Stats**

GMAT

* First attempt: 700 (44Q / 41V / 6 IR / 6 AWA)
* Second attempt: Scheduled
* Trying to figure out if I should retake the GMAT after attempt number two. I'll see how I do after the second attempt, but to be honest I don't see much room for gigantic gains in a few weeks. It's tricky because my undergrad gpa is bad, which matters a lot for rankings, but my grad gpa is great, which matters little for rankings. My graduate school work included high level statistics and somewhat advanced financial work (city budgets, program evaluations, real estate pro forma, etc). So through my essays I should be able to confirm that I can perform at a rigorous mba program. Thoughts?

Undergrad GPA

* 3.12
   * (Improved in-major dramatically over last 3 quarters)

Graduate GPA

* 3.92

**MBA Info**

Goal of MBA

* I want to pivot from the environmental resources consulting role I'm in now to an analyst role in green/sustainable real estate. I am passionate and educated about human rights, energy efficiency, affordable housing, and demographic analyses. Much of my graduate degree was built on green buildings and energy efficiency. I want to build business skills on top of that foundation so that I can provide core development and investment management services to environmentally friendly real estate firms ([http://www.related.com/our-company](http://www.related.com/our-company), [http://urbanvisions.com/](http://urbanvisions.com/)) I want to build hyper-green affordable housing.
* All things equal I'd  strongly prefer to be on the west coast, but obviously NYC has a lot of what I'm looking for so if need be I'll go there.

Target Schools

* Stanford, UPenn, MIT, Berkeley, Columbia, UCLA, NYU, UNC, UWashington

So far I have created a website to show my resume and portfolio and I have created a small android app. I am basically wondering if I should start working on Cracking the coding interview or if I should continue to learn and possibly work on projects.

My goal is to eventually intern at a big name company, and my first coop term will be in the winter, so I’ll be interviewing in September.  

On the one hand, I feel like if my goal is to work at a big name company I should start getting familiar with the interview questions ASAP.

On the other hand, I have not taken DS&amp;A so this would involve a lot of self teaching. That being said, I do know of most of the algorithms and data structures from the book and I am confident I could learn the others. 

I also feel like I could use this time to work on a project to build my portfolio, since my resume is pretty blank at the moment. I was thinking of making an app with react. 

I also feel like it’s very unlikely I get into a big name company for my first coop term anyway, and with my current pretty blank resume, so maybe I should just focus on building my resume for the next one.

Any insight would be very helpful, I just want to make sure I am spending my time doing the right thing."

My issue is I’ve signed up for Honors Spanish 3 because I have been told that 3 years of foreign language is very important for top schools. I really did not enjoy Spanish last year but I knew it was an easy class so I just decided to take it. I’ve just now started to question this decision as I feel foreign language is really not that important since I’m going to be applying as a STEM major (biomedical engineering or mathematics most likely). Because of this, I’m now considering a few options:  

* Take AP Computer Science A instead of Spanish. My school doesn’t offer this course but they will pay for me to take it online. Computer Science and programming is something I’ve always wanted to try out. I think it’d be great for me to take this class so I can go ahead and figure out if it’s something I’d like to do as a part of my career or not.
* Do a work-based learning internship at a local prosthetics service through my school. This is directly related to my intended major and is something I think would be really interesting.  
* Take AP CS A and try to get experience at a different prosthetics service. I’ve already contacted a company near where I live and they seem interested in me working with them. I’m just not sure if it’s a formal internship or some more casual shadowing.  

Taken all of these options into consideration, which one do you think is best? For a little more context, I’m trying to get into schools such as GA Tech, Duke, Vanderbilt, possibly Yale, etc. Thanks for your help!

8vn8vk,7,2018-07-02,Unusual situation..need advice,renboque,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/8vn8vk/unusual_situationneed_advice/,"Whats up fellas.

Little about me before I ask you guys for some advice:

I just graduated from a semi non-target with a Business degree with concentrations in Business Analytics and Mathematical and Computational Finance.

After my freshman year of college, I interned with a PE fund where I mainly did market research and wrote reports for the partners of the fund. AKA no real, tangible experience, really, but definitely eye opening.

A couple of summers later, I decided to try out what it would be like working in IT (I was genuinely interested in an IT career path), and interned with a fortune 200 energy company as a business intelligence intern supporting the energy traders on some curve visualization data.

This company offered me a job in an IT leadership rotational program and gave me three days to accept last August. I obviously accepted with intentions of silently looking elsewhere and playing the field.

I ended up not looking into any jobs too furiously (randomly applying here and there), taking some interviews, but ultimately not really trying to get any other offers. I got complacent with my offer, and just partied my senior year away to enjoy my last year in college.

Well I just started that job in the IT program, and I am honestly really questioning my decision to forego the finance route. I didn't realize how slow the work is in IT (perhaps it is faster elsewhere, but in my role currently its slow). On top of that, most of my coworkers here are older and are generally very bland people which makes it very hard to connect with any of my coworkers. And on top of all of that, the location is in my hometown, and I really want to get the fuck out of this area.

So, the point of this post is to ask for advice on what I should do.

I plan on sticking it out for a few months in the job at the very least, and if I still really hate it, I am going to jump ship and try and transition back into Finance.

My only concern is that I am afraid that it might be too late even with a Business degree and a concentration in Finance to transition back 3-6+ months from now.

Do you think it is a viable option to be able to hop into an entry level position in Finance (potentially IB, equity research, etc) 6 months from now? Or will I be overlooked by kids graduating next summer?

Perhaps some of the skills I pick up in IT are sell-able in an interview? (I am working with data, primarily process mining with log file data and helping to develop a machine learning model to predict customer call intent before an agent gets on the phone with a client)

Lemme know what you guys think. Appreciate any input.

**tl;dr:**

**Recent semi target school finance graduate working in IT out of college. Just started the job, but I now realize I probably should have gone down a finance route, and am worried about being overlooked for entry level finance positions 6+ months from now.**"

So I'm a young college grad here, and I'm currently interning at a company as a software engineer. The company is building a ASP.NET web application, and I've been tasked with implementing a back-end platform where I pull data from different parts of the application, and it creates customization graphs for their business folks to look at.

In my interview I told them that I had never worked with others at a large software development firm before, and I wanted to learn, and gain some experience. My ""learning"" has basically been me sitting in a cubicle by myself searching through microsoft documentation. It's really confusing since I've never worked on a C# application before. I also can't really ask for help because I was told that I shouldn't talk to senior developers for more than twenty minutes day, because if they're not developing software, the company loses some sort of tax deduction. I was given a onenote file on how the application works, but no one every really gave me an overview of the entire application, which is important if I'm supposed to link data sources from across the application.

I'm just wondering if this is normal for an internship. I just feel so lost and confused.

Today I just came across [this LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericliuche/) and have become so demotivated. All I want is to work at one of these companies yet they have no trouble getting all of them. Seeing how successful and easy CS comes to these people just make it seem like I have no way to compete and make it to a top company.

How do you guys deal with lack of motivation when you compare yourself to your extremely successful peers and it seems like you have no chance to catch up?"

First off, thanks for taking a look at my issue, any information leading me in the right direction is helpful! I'm not asking for someone to do this for me, just any help I can get would be beneficial because I'm starting to feel defeated from searching Google up and down.   


A little about my experience: I know some basic HTML, I edit/update imagery and copy for email blasts for clients at my job but usually based off of a template, not from ground up. I just learned the basics of GIT so I could share an Xcode project with a friend on GitHub.   


Lately, I've been learning Python because I have a task at work that is very time consuming and I just know there has to be to automate it... 

\[The Issue Setup:\]

I have an HTML email that I created/edited .   
The company sends me an excel file that has all of the different agents that work for a generic insurance company.

They want separate HTML files, the raw code, personalized for each agent. (Name, Phone Number, Address)

What we have been doing in the past (which I know is a terrible terrible way but these companies are just switching from physical postcards) is having an intern go in and manually type in each agents information to the correct spots in each individual HTML, save it with the agents last name, and then compress all 187 agents personalized html files into a zip folder and email it over to them as the final deliverable. 

Is there a way to...

1. Call on the data from the excel sheet while in the html code editor (Sublime Text) to fill in the specific fields for one agent at a time.

2. Save the file as a .html

3. Loop for each agent one by one so a folder is being filled with 187 separate html files personalized to each individual agent that was listed in the excel file.

4. Repeat until all agents have a separate personalized HTML email without feeling like a terrible person making an intern manually input the information to 187 separate files.

My Question(s)/ Plea for help:

1. Is there a way to do this? There has to be, right?

2. Is it way more work to create a script to do this and/or even possible for a newbie at Python?

3. Should I even be using Python for this? I've read/ seen mention of other methods using PHP (Which I don't know as of right now) and a few other languages to accomplish this. Would it be possible to learn a new language within a week or two to do this? Is this an advanced thing or do-able by a beginner?

4. Can anyone help point me in the right direction on how to do this!? I promise to pay it forward as I learn new languages and help back!

Thanks all!"

For a freshman, I think I have a decent background in computer science and math (i.e. classes on Data Structures, Discrete, Linear Algebra, etc). However, most of my coding has been assignments for school, and none of them are impressive. The only side projects I have are a Hangman game that guesses the most optimal letter/word based on the number of letters in the word and the information it has gathered, and a program where the user selects a text files and the file's individual words are flashed in front of the user one-by-one. The latter has a bit of functionality like the ability to pause, change the WPM, skip forwards, etc and was meant to be a way to help people read faster.

I know neither of these things are much, but my question is whether or not I should upload them to GitHub and include a link on my resume? Just wondering if those of you who have more experience in this area could give me some advice.

A little background to get some understanding. I am interning in the quality engineering department. I really have very little coding experience, so hoping someone here might have some ideas. I was recently accepted into aero, but my internship is just a general engineering internship. 

The company manager has asked me to create a way to prioritize all parts coming into the inspection room. He wants a way to have the inspectors work only on the parts needed as a priority, then move to priority b, then  c, and so forth.  This priority scale changes weekly and sometimes even daily depending on what final product needs to be shipped to inventory after inspecting. For example, a work order has come in for a raptor. The manufacturing department will go to supply for all parts needed to create a raptor. Supply comes to quality to restock after a full inspection is attained. The question is how to best create a way to continually prioritize the parts coming in to quality inspection as needed by supply and manufacturing? Right now the inspectors get an excel sheet and they have to go thru this sheet for each part as they come in to see where it belongs. The parts come into inspection randomly, with very little rhyme or reason. One day they get 100 different parts that will go to any number of final projects orders. So, they are asking me to come up with a way for the inspectors to know which of the 100 plus parts are more important and needed quicker instead of just doing them one by one. 

Any ideas or current programs out there that may give an insight to a way I can help the company achieve their goal. Their final goal would be as the part comes in, the inspector barcodes or types the part into a computer, which gives the priority level. Then the inspectors can work only on certain priority items first before moving to secondary items. "

I'm a rising sophomore and I've been looking everywhere for software engineering internships. I started looking really late though so I didn't find many opportunities. Just today, I got offered an interview for a front end developer position. This concerns me though as my goal is not to work as a web dev in future years but rather as a dev with languages like Java/Python/C/etc. Something more backend I guess, not really sure how to put it, but more of a software engineer than just a web developer. I actually don't want to do any web dev positions.

**What worries me?**

I'm worried that when I apply to companies, they'll notice that my resume only shows front end work experience and will thus refer me to a web dev position, thinking I'm better off there because I don't have any work experience in say Java/Python/C/etc. All my experience there is in school and my side projects are all web dev related so I'm really conflicted about whether I should take this front end position interview offer or not."

We work in PA,DruggedByHR,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8vpxjx/tonight_i_found_out_i_was_drugged_by_a_coworker_4/,"Edit: Thank you everyone for your helpful replies. I got some sleep and calmed down a little and have definitely listened to your comments. I’d like to clarify that when I said I wouldn’t let anyone tell me I was overreacting, I meant at an emotional level. It’s a big deal to me personally that this happened and I am not going to let anyone tell me how to feel.  I apologize if I came off as antagonistic or closed minded towards how I should outwardly react to this.  I really did want this subreddit’s advice which is why I posted here.

This morning she replied to my text with
&gt; If by drug, you mean give you a gummy vitamin, than yea 
I really don’t think that’s the truth given that so much of the story lines up with the opposite. Why would she randomly lie last night to my girlfriend that she drugged me.  Regardless, none of this is relevant.

Moving forward I’m going to take this subreddit’s advice. I’m planning on having a private, in person, conversation with her to ask that our relationship stay strictly professional.  That’ll be it. If for some reason she decides to retaliate for me ending our friendship, I’ll be speaking to a lawyer.

TL;DR: Coworker who is HR laced my drink with a marijuana edible about 4 months ago in Nashville, TN.  Tonight, she drunkenly told my girlfriend that this happened in Philadelphia, PA.  

Two years ago, I started as an intern at a small company based out of Montreal and befriended a coworker who started as a full time employee shortly after I started my internship.  I'll call her Emily.  Our office is in Philadelphia, PA where we both work.  Over my spring break, my girlfriend and I traveled to Nashville, TN along with Emily and her husband who we invited.  Like many people in Philadelphia, Emily and her husband are casual marijuana users and I have no problem with that.  However, I am personally very against my consumption of marijuana for personal and legal reasons.  I have made this very clear to Emily, her husband, and many of my friends and coworkers.  Our first night in Nashville (March 3, 2018) we did what most tourists do and went out and got drunk on Broadway.  While out at a bar, Emily mentioned that **some random guy in a back alley  gave her a marijuana edible gummy**.  Again, I had no problem with this, that's her own problem.  After finishing up at the bars, we took an uber back to our airbnb.  During that trip, Emily again stated that a stranger offered her a marijuana edible gummy.  

When we got back to the airbnb, the four of us decided to have one more beer before bed.  We had poured our beers into solo cups.  Emily encouraged me to chug my beer when I felt something gummy pass down.  I immediately freaked out thinking that she had put some or all of the gummy in my cup.  She assured me that was not the case and it must have been something else.  Being drunk and already tired, I went to bed within 20 minutes of consuming the beer.  From my understanding of edible marijuana, it likely did not take effect until after I had fallen asleep and likely wore off before I woke up in the morning.  

Moving on from that night, we spent three more days in Nashville before returning to Philadelphia.  Our friendship continued, I graduated from college, and about a month ago started as a full time employee at our company.  One of the conditions of my new position is a 3 month probationary period that I previously was not worried about.  I did not have to take a drug test as my company does not perform them.

Tonight, Emily invited my girlfriend and I to their local corner bar across town to celebrate her husband's birthday.  When we got there, it was obvious Emily had been drinking for a while.  I immediately started talking to Emily's husband while my girlfriend talked to Emily. We had another good night out together and I returned home with my girlfriend in an uber.  When we got home, my girlfriend told me that Emily admitted to drugging me in Nashville.  This statement was unprompted.  My girlfriend said that Emily joked with her shortly after our arrival, with me out of earshot, that she had gotten me ""high on weed"" in Nashville.  Before my girlfriend could respond to what was said, someone else entered their conversation.  As soon as my girlfriend told me this when we got back home, I immediately knew exactly when the event occurred.  I am livid right now.  I have calmed down a little, and understand that this may have been a mistake, but I texted Emily, ""Did you seriously drug me in Nashville?""  She did not answer.

Some of the reasons I am so livid are that I am a volunteer firefighter in New Jersey and at that time also in Pennsylvania.  On top of that, my girlfriend is about to start a government job that requires a military clearance.  Regardless of any remote legality at a state or local level, if I had been involved in an accident while operating a fire apparatus, I know at minimum I would have been kicked off the fire department after failing the mandatory drug test and likely held liable in a lawsuit.  Any ideas of getting hired by a career fire department would have been immediately taken off the table.  I think its  pretty obvious that my girlfriend should just avoid everything related to federally illegal drugs if she intends to work for the federal government.  Another scary thought is that I had contemplated applying to jobs outside the company I interned for.  If I had gotten hired and then failed a drug test I could have ended up blackballing myself from a company or industry.  I don't really doubt the story she told that night about it being given to her by a stranger.   She drugged me with something received from a stranger that could have been something much worse than he had advertised.  At the end of all of this, I just don't want to consume marijuana.  I am ""knocking it before I try it,"" but that's my right.  I don't care how legal it is, it's just not something I am remotely interested in.  

Overall, I don't know if I've ever been this angry at someone before.  I don't want to have to see her every day.  I don't want to have to work in my small office knowing I was drugged by a once close friend sitting 20 feet away.  I don't care if she goes to jail, I don't want money from her, I just don't ever want to see her again.  I'm fortunate in that she is going on vacation starting tomorrow until next week so I at least have some time to cool down before I inevitably have to go back to work with her for a hopefully short duration.

Questions:

1. Should I consult with a lawyer?  What kind of lawyer should I seek out.
2. Should I tell this story to the police?  Should I tell Philadelphia Police Department or Metro Nashville Police Department?
3. Do I, or could I with further evidence, have grounds for obtaining a restraining order?
4. Should I tell this story to the head of HR in Canada? I'm really concerned that they will not care about this at all given that marijuana will soon be federally legal there and the lack of drug testing in our company.
5. My absolute top priority out of all of this is to not mess up my career.  I overall really enjoy working for this company and don't want them to fire me just to protect their only HR rep who they very much like.  How can I protect myself from this if that happens?
6. I'm not going to let anyone tell me that I'm overreacting.  However, if the only way out of this without me getting screwed over is to just pretend it never happened, then I may have to consider that option.
7. I obviously need to start looking for a new job however inconvenient that may be. The job title on my contract hasn't technically changed in over a year so I'm not concerned about my resume too much.  Is there any documentation I could obtain to ensure that a hair sample test excuses any trace amounts of marijuana?"
8vpzst,4,2018-07-03,75$ a month,HomininofSeattle,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/8vpzst/75_a_month/,"Is how much I’m paying to stay in a trailer of a worker at the place I’m interning at until another place is adequate.

The family left for the fourth and me and another intern are taking care of the animals. First off, I became quickly aware of my other interns mysterious lack of care or thought about how these animals are being treated even though she has worked with animals all her life? But basically, first warning sign was listening to the beagle whose the son of the older dog get his second bite to an infected leg that’s already being treated with antibiotics and has to be separated at night but apparently the family (the son, dad and mom) stay corralled in an enclosure that has two pigs enclosed in a 10x10 or so as well. The pigs have direct sunlight with little shade opportunities throughout the day. The dogs get one smalll cup of food in morning and one at night apparently. The water bowls inside and outside definitely don’t get cleaned enough. The younger dog who has the injury I noticed was unusually thirsty last night so I gave him three small bowls of water and same with the other dogs so I don’t think they like the water they usually drink. The younger one is also insanely dependent and follows me around nonstop. I just noticed the cat didn’t have any food for her for probably the last day and a half. I’m blowing up in stress, they also have like 7 chickens and 3 ducks. I just wanted to rant, no these animals aren’t in serious neglect. I just have a personal hate towards this type of animal care. I also hate that I have to deal with this shit on my days off before my next 4 10 hour days in the heat and that my other intern who is signicantly older than me and should be more mature is taking this very laxed route to dealing with these animals.

Melrose gave me an approving nod from behind his own mask and began the process of putting the man back together again, perfect suture stitches in an even row.


“Well done everybody, excellent work. Especially you, Louis.” His warm, heterochromic eyes extended their warmth to me. I thanked him and tried my best not to appear too gleeful before my fellow interns. We all knew full well I was Melrose’s favourite of the batch. When the others went out partying to celebrate successful hands-on session I’d elect instead to stay in my room and carefully re-read the manuals and handbooks, re-assess my written pieces and monotonously draft and re-draft. I’d earned my skill.


I carefully scrubbed my hands, making sure to get under the nails and into the webs of my fingers. Beside me Melrose did the same on his hands, which I noticed were oddly deeper tanned than his face, like he’’d spent a few hours in a tanning booth that catered just to forearms.


“Really good stuff today guys, now go home and get some rest before tomorrow, you’ve earned more sleep than you’re getting,” he paused and gave a grin, “but this is the profession you chose ladies and gents.”


As we stripped out of our surgical scrubs Maddie, or ‘Mad’ as I’d retitled her, bumped into my ribs with a jovial shoulder barge. “Well look at you, Mr. Favourite,” she dropped her register to mimic Melrose’s voice, “Well done everyone, especially you Louis.”


I grinned back at her. “No need to be jealous.” I goaded, returning the light shove she’d given me.


“Of you? No way, who needs skills when you look this damn good?” She giggled and framed her face with her hands, winking one of her grass green eyes. “Wanna grab MaccieD’s?”


“Sure.”


The grimy little establishment stunk of grease and stale fries, but at least it was empty at this time of night, save for the harshly overweight man ahead of us that couldn’t decide for the life of him if he wanted the McRib and a Big Mac or two Big Mac’s and a box of chicken nuggets. After seeing the kind of damage the cholesterol does to you, you’d imagine we’d stop getting fast food, but I still smoked about half a pack a day so it was the least of my worries. I dug through my jean pockets for my wallet. 


“Ah, fuck knuckles.” Mad head snapped round and she snorted a laugh, caught off guard. “I left my wallet in the changing room.”


“Oh, shall we go back and get it?”


“Nah, you get what you’re getting. I’ll be back in a mo.”


As the heavy door slowly swung to a close behind me I heard her chide in a sing-song voice, “Don’t miss me tooooo much.”


As the automatic sliding doors trundled open the receptionist lifted his head to give me a nod and let me carry on by. I slipped quietly through the hallways that still bustled with people, even at this time, death and disease waits for no man. I  reached the water-spotted double doors to the surgical ward I’d been working in that day.


As I passed the shuttered windows of the OR I’d vacated not an hour before I was taken aback to see the lights on inside, which was odd because all the others, even the hallway lights, were out. From inside I could hear voices. I supposed they must have been cleaners, sorting the place out after the messy operation earlier.


I reached the door, which had been left slightly ajar, allowing a thin crack of light to cast out onto the ugly blue floor. Before I reached it I stopped to listen to the voices that came from inside, a deeply odd discussion indeed.


“No no no, it’s my turn! You went last time remember? Maybe we need to get you a new brain. You had the hair!” This voice was raised and firm, and I heard several thumps as he emphasised his words.


The other one spoke, “And I’m telling you that you’re wrong, that was before the liver.” This voice was sterner, more aggressive in its assertion. I didn’t recognise either. “Do you think you can fool me, Werner?”


Werner… I recognised that name. That’s right, Werner was the Doctor that had been shipped over to our hospital just a few weeks before. I specifically remembered him because when I was introduced I had to work hard not to stare at his eyebrows, which were a different shade of brown to his hair. Why was he in the OR arguing over body parts?


“Both of you,” a new voice this time, “Would you shut up. Faied, you can have the next one.” I heard a sound, presumably of Faied huffing. I recognised this new voice however, I’d heard it many a time, it was the tired gravel of the Hospital’s director, John Finnigan.


I edged a little closer now,  just enough to peer through the thin sliver of light and into the room. The theatre was still in the state we’d left it, bloodstains and all. Werner and Faied were standing over the table, Faied in surgical scrubs but Werner only in his clean white coat. Neither had their gloves on. Finnigan sat in a dark corner upon one of the shitty plastic chairs the hospital stocked.


I had to stifle a fearful gasp as I glimpsed the man on the operating table, slapping my hand to my mouth and quickly receding from the light in case they saw me. Strapped down was the man we’d been operating on earlier. What really disturbed me however was that he was neither anesthetized nor relaxed, instead sobbing through a thick gag tight around his mouth.


I heard them continue their discussion but  barely heard their words as I tried to slow my panicked breaths. What the fuck was going on? After I got ahold of myself once more I slid back over to peer inside.


“He’s just had the heart operation, yes? Of course I’d get the one with the useless heart, I’ve been waiting all week,” Werner whined, “Fine, I suppose I’ll take the legs, he looks like a runner.” Faied huffed once more.


“Oh, give me something easy why don’t you.” And with that he slipped on his mask, Werner backed away from the table where the man lay, still struggling and whimpering, unable to break free. I watched, paralyzed, as Faied grabbed a shining bone saw from the instrument tray. The man on the table, seeing this, only began to try and struggle harder, kicking wildly at his restraints and crying as loud as he could through the gag. In response, Faied leant over and stared him in the eyes with a savage grin, twisting the saw in the bright light so it sparkled.


“Hey now, this won’t hurt a bit.” Without another word Faied grabbed the man’s legs and pressed the blade to it, dragging it back and forth with his full weight behind, causing an eruption of blood as it jaggedly sliced apart the flesh. The victim of the macabre operation only screamed louder and higher.


“Hey, careful Faied, that’s mine!”


I barely managed to stay standing as I fell back against the wall, hands clasped to my mouth. My head span as the man’s muffled screams continued, and behind it the devastating rip and tear of flesh, the cracking and scraping of bone.


The sound paused. “Whew, this guy’s got a hell of a leg Werner, good choice!”


Suddenly my phone buzzed in my pocket and my heart stopped, as did the voices.


“Hey, did you hear that?”


“Did you leave the fucking door open again, Faied?”


“Hey, I’m just trying to-”


“Shut up, both of you, who’s out there?”


Without having time to think about it I started to move around the corner of the room, still doing my best not to make a sound. I heard someone punch the door open and call out, “Hey, is there someone out here?”


“Come on, we just want to have a discussion, don’t be nervous.” Faied chuckled.


I rounded the corner away from them, footsteps coming rapidly my way. From another direction I heard Faied’s goading voice drift through the halls, “I don’t like to play hide and seeeek.”


I backed up to the door of another operating theatre, trying my best to open it without making a sound. I closed the door behind me and crept to the table, tears streaming down my cheeks, stifling sobs. I managed to slip out of sight just as the lights flicked on. The vapour bulbs buzzed and I heard Werner’s heavy breathing, but he didn’t say a thing. He stood there for several agonising seconds, before I heard his heavy footsteps click against the sanitized linoleum floor, flicking the lights off behind him. As soon as the door closed I took out my phone, seeing one missed call from Mad. I held the button for five long seconds and tapped it off. After that I just sat there for what must have been hours, not daring to move.


At around four in the morning I finally mustered the courage to get up and leave, listening for their voices, hearing nothing through the echoing hallways.


“After that, I came straight here, Mad. That’s what happened, I swear to God, Faied, he, he fucking…” I let my head fall into my hands and cried loudly like every cell in my body had wanted to all night.


“Dude. This isn’t funny.” We were sat around Mad’s coffee table, a hot brew in front of us each.


“Mad, I swear it’s the truth. You think I’m this good of an actor? I’ve been up all night. I didn’t even get my fucking wallet.”


“This is the worst excuse to ditch me I’ve ever heard.”


“It’s not an excuse! Please Mad!” I looked her dead in the eyes, begging her to believe me. She paused and stared at me, before swallowing and averting her eyes.


“And why would I possibly believe this? Do you have proof?” It was my turn to drop my eyes now, scouring the ringed glass where my cup rested.


“No. But, but I’m going to get some. Tonight I’m going to try again, this time I’ll have my phone, I’m going to record it.”


“Bullshit. If that’s true why would you ever go back?” She scoffed.


“You just said it, I need proof. How about- how about you come with me? If you don’t believe me? Then we can pretend we’re lost, they won’t attack us if there’s two so-”


“Louis, I’m not an idiot. I don’t believe you.” She sighed, and I once more held her quivering gaze.


“Oh, fine. We’ll go, we’ll see nothing, and then you’ll look like a fool because I never believed you.” I flung myself over the table and hugged her. She sighed, and lightly hugged me back. “I swear, if you’re having a breakdown you better not drag me down with you.”


Despite my complete lack of sleep I just about managed to make it through the day, Melrose’s two different coloured eyes nodding and smiling at me. Mad tried to avoid me throughout the day, instead focusing on her work. I kept wondering if she did believe me or not, why would she agree to come if not? Whether or not she did, I was infinitely glad to not be doing this alone. I kept my phone fully charged and emptied the memory out to ensure I had enough space to capture everything these crazy fuckers did.


The day rolled by in a blur, partially because I couldn’t focus from lack of sleep, partly because I was distracted by my plan.


“Do you think Melrose is in on it?” It was the end of the day, and she finally spoke to me again. The way she said it made it sound like the focus was on whether I thought he was in on it, not whether he actually was. Clearly she still didn’t believe me.


“I don’t know… no, no way, not Melrose. Those other guys, they’re, they’re creeps but Melrose? No.”


“So… you wanna talk to him about it?” She was hoping she could get me to talk to someone who’d help me with my delusions.


“No. We bring in as fewer people as possible. Just me and you, until we’ve got proof.” I insisted nodding my head.


“Fine, but when we don’t get proof, if this isn’t a joke, we talk to Melrose and get you help okay?”


I nodded but said nothing. I was going to get my proof.


The day ended and the ward I’d seen them in the day before closed down once more. We decided to wait it out in the canteen. Mad ordered a coffee and a flapjack but I passed on food. I couldn’t eat, not now, when we were about to expose this whole monstrous affair.


“So what do you think they were doing with the body bits Louis?”


“I don’t know, eating them maybe? Maybe they’re cannibals or something. Or maybe it’s like some kind of torture cult, or-”


“Louis, do you have any idea how crazy you are? Please, let’s just go get some help, we’re in a hospital for God’s sake, let’s go down to psychiatric and-”


“Dammit Mad!” I was getting irked now, I hadn’t slept and I was sick of being treated like a crazy person. I wasn’t insane, I knew it, I saw what I saw. I lowered my tone, “I saw them, Faied and Werner, and…” I gestured with a tilt of my head towards the table across the room, where director Finnigan sat, eating a muffin. I hadn’t been able to take my eyes off him since we sat down, only able to see him as a silhouette through a cloud of blood.


“Right.”


We stayed sat for another fifteen minutes before FInnigan stood, grabbing a handkerchief from his pocket and wiping the crumbs from his coat with it. We followed, lagging far behind as he headed into the closed wing.


“See, fucking see?” I kept my voice low but whispered fiercely at her.


“That doesn’t prove anything, they might be opening an operating room again or something, lots of people need operations, remember?”


“Death waits for no man…” I mumbled. We waited another twenty minutes before I finally had enough courage to usher her inside and quietly sneak up to the lit OR at the very back. To my joy and amazement, they had once more left the door ajar. After yesterday’s events that seemed odd. Would they really forget again? Still I pressed on until I could peer once more through the thin strip of light.


There was no one on the operating table this time, Werner and Faied perched upon it conversing instead. I could see Finnigan at the back in his chair.


“How’s the leg treating you Werner? I did well huh?” Faied asked.


“I’ll admit it, you’re an excellent surgeon. I see why he chose you.”


“The grandmaster never chooses wrong, Werner, he never does.”


“When you’ve been alive as long as he, you pick up a few things I suppose. What do you think of the new prodigy then?” Werner turned his head towards Faied and tilted in intrigue.


I looked at Mad, whose face was now drained of color, she shook like a leaf in a hurricane. I gulped and turned my head back to the OR, just as I heard a click behind us.


I froze.


“So what have we got hear then?” I knew the voice, all too well. I could never mistake the voice of my mentor. I swivelled to see Melrose standing behind us, a pistol in his hand pointed squarely at Mad’s head. Mad whimpered, opened her mouth in preparation to scream.


“Make a noise and I blow that pretty little face away Miss Jeaneau.” Mad dropped her head and sobbed.


“I’m sorry, Mad, I’m sorry.” I whispered.


“Both of you, up, don’t pull any shit.” We did as commanded, rising to our feet and backing into the room, not taking our eyes off the gun. “You,” he gestured with the weapon towards Mad, “get on the table.”


Mad shook her head and quietly moaned. Faied and Werner grabbed her arms and started wrestling her down into the restraints.


“Stop struggling, or this one fucking gets it.”


He turned the gun to me, pressing it to my forehead, my sweat moistening the barrel. She stared for a second, looking to me desperately for some kind of plan, but I had none. She gave in, letting the pair tie her into place. Tears were welling in her gorgeous green eyes and streaming down her perfect white skin.


“Why are you doing this?” She trembled out, just before the gag came over her mouth. Melrose’s blue and green eyes came to life, a grin stretching across his lips.


“Well, I suppose you deserve an explanation.” He stood up straight and took a deep in breath, like he was about to regale us with the greatest of tales, the same way he did before every lecture.


“You see, people, our bodies, they’re machines. We fuel them, they complete their functions, they’re complex, but they are indeed just machines. And like all machines, when they get old, they break down, that’s why we have hospitals you see. That’s why we have jobs. The parts, they need to be replaced. But see we always have the same problem, we replace the parts only once the parts begin to break down. What we need to do, what we do, is we replace the parts before they break down. We combine the best parts of different machines to extend the lifespan.”


With that, he pulled open his coat and unbuttoned his shirt to display his chest, a chest that was swathed in scars. Every inch had another slice that had been stitched back together, some sections with different shades of skin connected, as if they were… as if they were from two different people all together. Mad began to scream from behind gag, and they began to laugh.


And then, I began to laugh too. Melrose lowered the gun and placed it onto a surgical tray by the door.


“Now, let’s see what the prodigy can do, eh?”


I nodded and stepped forward taking up a scalpel from the tray.


“You want her eyes, sir?” I asked Melrose, as he nodded in approval.


“Oh yes, they’re lovely, finally I’ll have a pair that match, eh?” We each laughed once more, and I leant over Mad, looking her in the eyes.


“See, there’s a reason I’m the favourite.”"

I am starting my second to last year in Computer Science and I am wondering if I really want to get a career in AI how about should I do that?

I would say I am knowledgeable with Java, and this summer in my spare time outside of my internship I am learning Python and even using it at work to automate social media tasks (I am basically running the social media accounts and website for a local non profit organization). I also have a machine learning course online that I will start once I have a better grasp on Python.

How can I use my current knowledge to delve into the world of AI and what sort of thing do employers look for in candidates in this field? I guess my big plan would be to make a personal project demonstrating my programming skills and knowledge of AI and hopefully that will spruce up my CV.

Those of you who work in these fields, what sort of things did you work on in University?"

Originally I didn't have any drive to go to college, but because of pressure from my parents decided to go. I ended up with a degree in Videogame design but don't have very good job prospects. Since graduating I took an internship in digital marketing which completely sucked the life out of me and left me feeling depressed. I highly value integrity and honesty and I think marketing and sales is the exact opposite. It also didn't work well with my anxiety because marketing was too ambiguous and there weren't ways to measure what I was contributing. I'm trying to find a path forwards even if it means going back to school.

Ideally I'm looking for a career that allows a good work-life balance so that I can continue to work on myself socially. I tend to be a very independent and introverted person and have a history of pretty bad anxiety. I feel like a lot of people can go straight from college and dedicate everything to their careers and family... because they have someone to come home to or the confidence and experience to know how to make that life for themselves. I haven't given up hope that I will one day start a family, but I also know that there are certain careers that may disadvantage me especially if they take me to a more rural location.

Growing up my hobbies were Video Games, Camping and Hiking, Automotive Restoration with my dad, Solving Puzzles and Writing Stories

My favorite subjects were History, Computers and Technical Courses (like cooking, shop, and CAD)

Career options I've been considering are transitioning into UX/UI Design or Software Development. I learned some programming in college and have been working on my own apps in order to build a portfolio. I've also considered the Military, but believe my personality could lead to problems with that environment. I'm considering the trades as well, but am worried that those jobs may leave me without time outside of work and I don't know where to start since I don't have experience with any (outside of auto mechanic - but I've heard the field is absolutely terrible when it comes to work hours and pay).

If you have any insights about a specific path, or maybe just general life advice on how I can make the best out of life and my situation, I would be grateful.

I was top three in my graduating class, 4.0 GPA, full aid-based scholarship to college, determined to be a professor or diplomat. This was awesome because my father had left my family when I was 15 and I needed to help my family out. Everyone was so proud.
First year of college was rough. I did decently in my classes (3.65 GPA, Dean’s List), but the rest was really challenging. I struggled to find good friends, as a lot of friends I initially made betrayed me and hid the fact they disliked me. I was single the whole year, which was frustrating. I struggled with beginning to hate myself because I saw everything going wrong as my fault, that I deserved to be lonely and have people leave me. It was really hard.
I found better friends towards the end, although I’m constantly wondering what they really think of me because I’ve been hurt so many times.
I didn’t do everything I could have to accomplish my dreams. I didn’t network, didn’t get a good summer internship (just interning at a local court), didn’t eat myself up for success.

8vxn3w,9,2018-07-03,Finishing school soon: Stay at student job or help desk?,snitchesgetswitches,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8vxn3w/finishing_school_soon_stay_at_student_job_or_help/,"Hi, long time lurker on a throwaway here.

I'm in my late 20's.  I'm currently finishing up community college in IT and networking, and did well enough in school and made some connections there to secure a work term at the school as a full-time paid intern with their networking team.  The job is kinda interesting -- a variety of whatever the senior techs need help with, ranging from asset management to programming Android TVs to learning how to set up netmon software with their topology.  I'm partway through the term, and with it being a mostly networking environment, it's also left me wondering if I don't need more exposure to software and scripting as well.

Pay is good-ish, better than a lot of student gigs but not quite full-time salary for my area (so, like any other internship).  The job is fairly low-stress.

My dilemma:

I have the option to extend my work term with them (still as a student). At the same time, my supervisor recommended me to a friend of his, telling me they need an entry-level guy. It's for a help desk position at a law firm, supposedly paying much better than what I'm getting now (though, that could mean anything).

Out of respect for him, I've done some preliminary interviews and they like me, and my current employer is more than on board with me leaving if I took it, since it's full-time versus a student position. I have a good relationship with them, and, honestly, the management is so chill I don't think it matters too much to them which way I go.

Still, I read conflicting things about help desk both here and elsewhere online. I feel like a lot of people get their start there and I'm not above paying my dues. I'm not even all that bad with people so it's not the work itself that bothers me.  But it does also sound like people recommend spending the least amount of time doing it as possible before moving on to other things (I could probably take the CCNA soon, judging from what I've seen of the test versus what I learned at school).

What I love about working my current environment (public sector, higher ed) is that since the pace is so relaxed, whenever I had something new to learn, I had plenty of time and space to search and learn up on all the background details (which, I think, fits my learning style). It's even made me wonder if working in public sector might be a viable career choice for me, even if the majority opinion seems to be against it.

I guess I'm nervous about possibly not having that leeway once expectations are higher -- especially if it's an environment like a law firm, and the stress might lead to a downward spiral of lack of confidence and anxiety about going to work (I've been there before). I also don't see a lot of room for advancement in the IT vertical at the firm, so staying there long-term is probably out anyway. Or, if nothing else, I could always find a help desk somewhere either less high-pressure than a law firm, or somewhere with more room to move around.

So! My options:

1. Stay at my student job, build up some more confidence but delay graduation and getting a permanent position?
2. Take the help desk job for the experience, grind it out and look to move up afterward?
3. Finish school as soon as possible, work in another environment altogether? Possibly, skip help desk?

Your thoughts are much appreciated!"

I hope you’re having a great night. Honestly: this is a long story so I’ll throw a TLDR at the end.

I’m looking for help at diagnosing and getting past my anger and lack of confidence.

This all started about 2 years ago, during my senior year of college. I’d done two internships for a Fortune 500 company and received great reviews. I was eagerly awaiting a job offer from them. When I hadn’t heard back for a while I contacted them only to find out that they had not recommended me for employment on grounds of being too “easy going”.  This shattered me. The job was going to be in the same city as my girlfriend and family and I’d worked for this company and built relationships for two years. Many of the folks I’d have worked for I would consider close friends. It hurt.

I proceeded to take another job but it didn’t feel right. I remember moving south and during the drive to said place I’d be living I felt nothing but guilt and sadness to be compromising so heavily. Of course, the distance didn’t work and my girlfriend of 3 years and I split. Due to stress and genuinely hating the work environment of that job I ended up leaving after about a year with the intention of going to graduate school.

After leaving the job, I moved home, and since then I’ve lived there. Beforehand I just felt like a piece of crap all of the time and like nobody liked me or thought I could do anything right, but now, the anger has started. I can hardly look at myself in the mirror without wanting to punch the face in it. I’ve pushed away my friends and family with my anger. I don’t know how to explain it, I was always an easy going guy and now, just two weeks ago, I was at dinner in public and snapped. Something on the menu changed and I threw my perfectly functional phone on the floor, shattered it, and stomped it to the ground before walking out without it.

Tonight I got a ticket in my car going 27 in a 25 and after the cop gave me the ticket I politely accepted it, left my car where it sat in a neighborhood, and just walked 5 miles home because I felt if I touched the car again I’d just get another ticket because I’m too much of an idiot to drive properly.

I’m honestly afraid at this point. I have no composure. I start graduate school in roughly a month at a dream school, Harvard, but I can hardly even go into public without having a panic attack.

Do I forgo my admission to the best school in my field to get my mental health back? Do I move out of this house ASAP? Do I need to seek professional health.

I’m honestly afraid I’ll harm my future beyond repair if I don’t get myself in line soon.

TLDR: having serious self confidence issues since being denied from a job that meant a lot to me and having serious anger issues since living at home. Looking for help"
8vzcbh,0,2018-07-04,Graduate soon. How to grow as a software engineer in Atlanta. I need advice,EE_dreamer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8vzcbh/graduate_soon_how_to_grow_as_a_software_engineer/,"I will graduate from Georgia Tech next year. I have been interning for 4 companies:

1. A well-known e-commerce company in Atlanta
2. A high paying startup in SF
3. A big-N company
4. A big-4 company

I've learned and growth so much after doing internship for the 3 companies in the Bay Area. But I feel like I want to live in Atlanta after graduation since I have too many ties there (family, friends, communities). There aren’t many really cool, but reasonable safe and successful startups in the ATL area. There might be 2 or 3. But not that many. The rest are mostly corporate or not really outstanding and exciting to join.

Working remotely is an option. But I think I need to be more senior to do that. Or doing my best to those 2 companies that I have on my ATL target list. But there are only 2, the chance is odd compared to the number of companies in the Bay Area.

I can still live comfortably by joining the not-so-exciting companies in ATL since they pay pretty well (80k-90k). But I'm concerned that I won't grow in the way I would imagine working in the Bay Area.

Do you have any advice?"

Programming absolutely intrigued me I love everything it can do it amazes me.. I struggled throughout college and earning my degree but completed it. Recently got a job and I am absolutely miserable. I feel like the dumbest person here and im working mostly with backend here. I previously had an internship in front end which I enjoyed way more so i’m considering going that route but I feel like a failure for not being able to stick to backend which is what my degree mostly focused on but I sit infront of my computer feeling hopeless. Its bringing back past depression and I dont want to quit my new job mostly because I am afraid of the judgement from family and friends that will come with it. Basically this is a rant and not sure if anyone has ever felt like this but besides front end does anyone have any other career suggestions I could pursue with a computer science degree?

I received two job offers this week and cant decide . I currently live w/ my parents in a city a few hours from NY.

The first offer is an entry-level, associate job at a global CPG company in NYC and the second is an assistant marketing manager role at a regional healthcare company(10,000 employees) in my current city.

I had my heart set on the CPG job, until I saw the salary was less than 45K (I realize I'm just starting out but thought it would be higher given the company, and cost of living in NY). The team is very friendly, has interesting projects and it seems like a great learning opportunity that could pay off in the long run / boost my career prospects.

My second offer was completely unexpected and came a day after the first one. I know I would enjoy it and the salary is 15K more than the CPG job. However, I am nervous that that I will miss out on valuable experience for a short term salary boost, but it would give me more financial security, a lower cost of living, and provide more digital experience, which I wanted.

Essentially, I am very anxious about making the wrong decision. Both are great opportunities however, I'm struggling to put one ahead of the other and compare salary with long term potential. The idea of relocating and the high cost of living in NYC would be very difficult given the salary and I want to avoid debt, but also want the best opportunity for my future. I am unsure if the risk is worth the reward, or if there is even substantial long-term benefits. I appreciate any guidance or advice. Thanks!!"
8w0k77,2,2018-07-04,21-year old Japanese returnee student struggling to fit in and find work. What should I do?,foxontherails,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8w0k77/21year_old_japanese_returnee_student_struggling/,"Note that the following is my background and is important to understanding what kind of situation I’m in right now. I'm set to graduate March 2019 from a Japanese university, with a Bachelor's Degree in English and American Literature, specializing in linguistics. I also happen to be a Japanese returnee student/*kikokushijo*, having spent 12 years of my life abroad, starting from the age of 3. I lived in four different countries, being educated in multiple international schools and two public schools in the United States.

I returned to Japan at the age of 15 and attended a high school that specializes in returnee students. In fact, this is the first time I attended a Japanese school, and I struggled to adapt because my Japanese isn’t exactly stellar and I wasn't raised in my home country. Even today, I speak English better than Japanese by a great margin. I then fucked up my university entrance exams. I tried to enroll in Computer Science departments but I didn’t prepare well and ended up having to enter my fallback, which is the one I’m set to graduate from next year. I spent the next four years feeling like an impostor because I kept getting good grades thanks to my near-native fluency in English.

Now for the meat of the story (my current situation.) The Japanese employment system usually picks workers straight from university, starting at the beginning of April of each year. Some do also employ people who already graduated, but university seniors are prioritized. Another thing to note is that Japanese companies tend to hire based on school name recognition rather than what recruits studied in university – if they ever study anything, that is. Instead, Japanese companies train their recruits over a few years, increasing their pay based on seniority and further encouraging loyalty. Overtime in the 30-40 hour-per-month range is considered normal and there are edge cases where people literally work themselves to death. The fact that little to no action is being taken, along with the work culture in general, which emphasizes one’s loyalty to company to the point of sacrifice, deeply disturbs me. The way I see it, Japan’s throttling itself because of its old-fashioned values, and I’d rather not have anything to do with it.

So what am I doing in this situation? Right now, I’m job hunting, although I started relatively late with little prepared – I haven’t even done a single internship. I’m looking for a work environment that uses English primarily, both because I dislike Japanese work culture, I don’t have confidence in my Japanese, and countless times I found that I just won’t fit in. My kouhai – and some of my senpai – in my university clubs hate the living guts out of me and mock me and I sincerely can’t fathom why. It’s made my social anxiety around Japanese people worse. Also, I don’t think my university career center is helping me much, because they’re mainly geared towards employing for Japanese, not foreign, companies. Once when I told them that I wanted to work in an environment where I could speak English, my assigned career counselor told me that it’s foolish to search for work like that and instead told me to look for a company’s values. This really pissed me the fuck off.

I’d like to work abroad in an English-speaking country if I can’t work in English in Japan but foreign employers only pick experienced professionals rather than graduates. I’ve been considering either going into IT, English media (newspapers or writing, for example), or translation. I only have basic experience in programming but I’m willing to learn. I’m considering a few options. One: Go to an internship abroad. Two: try to go to graduate school, maybe abroad. Meanwhile, I’m still looking for a foreign (gaishikei) company with an English work environment or at least some English usage. What should I do?

Sorry if this is difficult to read, but I decided that I need to get this off my chest and look for help. Many around me have already found their jobs and are settling down and I can’t help but feel a slight terror both because I don’t have the security they have and because I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I found the right place to talk about this – maybe there’s some forum for people like me out there? – but I’m certain it’s a start.

TL;DR:

* Japanese returnee student struggling to fit into Japan
* Degree in linguistics expected March 2019
* At odds with the Japanese work culture
* Wants to work in an English-speaking work environment, but doesn't know where to look
* Prefers IT, English media, or translation as work"
8w0npy,40,2018-07-04,Female super noob to (still very female) junior dev,Jukabrown,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8w0npy/female_super_noob_to_still_very_female_junior_dev/,"Not here to write my autobiography, but a very simplistic and straightforward timeline to be used as a reference for the self-taught or unconventional programmer: 

•(Feb. 2015) Spent 1 full year learning HTML, CSS and Ruby in my pastime. 

•(Feb. 2016) Studied questions for App Academy’s application test. Failed.

•(Mar. 2016)Applied to out of state dev school. Was accepted based on pretty much nothing but guaranteed money upfront, but got scholarship that paid for half ($10,000). 

•(Apr. 2016) Moved and completed 3 month, Mon-Fri. dev school, thanks to the sponsorship of my parents. Felt incredibly unprepared upon ‘graduating.’

*ADVICE: Don’t attend dev school until you have some kind of idea about the flow of how applications work. Don’t go unless you have the energy to dedicate  to working after hours on subjects you didn’t quite grasp in class. This will literally render your money and time worthless if you don’t stay caught up. The nature of boot camps is to cram as much down your throat as possible. Come ready or wait until you are.  

•(June 2016, $18/hr) Moved back home and found ‘tech’ (managing Wordpress site) job 45min away for good money, but knew it would never grow to be the income I was promised graduating dev school. 


*ADVICE: Do not accept jobs that does not use recently taught code skills or do not force you to learn new ones, unless you have to of course. Those skills will go stale FAST without practice. If a social media maintenance job is required to get by, do not underestimate the power of play coding on the side,  every day. The more you practice, the more you encourage muscle memory. Also, don’t take any jobs that don’t build your resume as a programmer from this point on. 

•(October 2016, $20/hr) Moved away to intern at friend’s company. Was a short, overpaid job that gained me some experience. Was not able to afford to keep me on after government funded internship ended.


——-Long dry spell, couldn’t find work in small town Gainesville, competing with college grads ———-

•(January 2017,  $10,000, state funded thanks to CareerSource Florida)Attended 3 month local dev school for MEAN stack, to both diversify skills and understand other approach to coding (honestly the most common). 

•(July 2017, $14/hr) Started job as web tech, literally doing nothing but coming up with shit to keep myself occupied, at UF. Would occasionally be assigned JS tasks, but best professional development came from free Lynda membership for staff. Used this to level up  in a number of languages, frameworks, tools, etc. Built out code projects for resume. Point is to get paid for learning tech by whatever means.

•(April 2018, $15/hr) After applying for 2 years to every even slightly techy job available at this top, local software company, I was finally asked to come in and interview for a web dev internship, likely because of the RELATIONSHIP I HAD BUILT WITH THE HR REP.  She had answered my inquiries for two years now - surely she saw my ambition. Can’t drive home enough how important perseverance is with companies; they view resumes all day long, so try to keep your name known. 

•(July 2018, $15/hr) Completed 3 month internship  at said software company learning React, Redux, Typescript and tons of other odd things I barely had any experience with before starting, but had mentioned an appreciation for and interest in during said interview. 

•(July 2018, $50k/year) Was finally offered a junior dev position at software company.

I'm a rising junior this summer, and am looking to get an internship for Spring next year. I'm currently doing an internship, and am learning a lot! Since it's a variety of different stuff, I'm not sure how to mention all of it on my resume, and also during the short intro one gives when a recruiter asks what experience one has. How do I frame it differently when talking to a tech person vs a business person?

Here's a list of everything I worked on:

1) a simple database CRUD API in the framework my company uses, to familiarize myself with the concepts of routing. Also learnt basic AJAX and jQuery.

2) Lots of APIs on our actual product. At one point, I was the only dev on my team. A lot of backend work with the database.

3) Built a video streaming service. Talked to solution engineers from various companies (whose product we used) to put together a viable solution for our use case. Used, and thus have knowledge of what a CDN is.

4) Worked on devops-ey stuff like setting up nginx, deploying our product to it, maintaining that code and understanding how nginx works. 

5) Also worked on requirements gathering and made a spreadsheet detailing it all.

6) Implemented a load balancer on a test server.

I'm confused because it's a mix of things I learnt and things I did, and I'm not sure how to fit it all in the short amount of time one speaks to a recruiter for at a career fair."

In summary, i befriended a person she betrayed me and the aftermath of that is my life flipping out on me, i don't want to come out as a whinny person but they say that words cut deeper then knives. when i was young i did get physically abused but now its the verbal which effect sticks longer than a bruise.

# The Problem:

I really don't know what to do, i have two more years till graduation, im afraid the more im being at home that the abusive words would get to me and i won't be able to function probably, im getting blamed for every problem that happens in the house every bad thing that occur is in one way or another is my fault.

# Further explanation

an ex-friend of mine sent an offensive voice note to my mother, who is a strict person to no end, and she flipped on me treating my like a trash verbally abusive to no end. I have talked to her told her my side of the story but she choose to believe a voice note not even along with any evidence. Im at a dilemma because the fact that my mother who never trusted anyone choose to believe a person like my ex-friend knowing that her daughter is an open book everything in my life says that im the opposite of what that voice note stated. Since the death of my father i have been  dependable on my mother financial support and in this country its hard to get a part time to help me get dependent on my self. Hence i have been shutting my mouth and getting that abuse without answering her just because i want to finish my study, but lately i have been noticing how her words are starting to affect me. i have noticed it in my internship interview how the interviewer was telling me to actually express my own thoughts on a matter but i was actually afraid to do so, even though in my previous interview it didnt happen before. *im starting to lose my own person, im believing every word she is saying about me. i know im not so bad as a human but the more im getting her verbal abuse on the daily the more im starting to believe im worthless, failure, ugly and do not deserve what i have..... All because i met a person &gt;&gt; became friends&gt;&gt; got betrayed by them*

# Background info:

So since young my family kept me and my siblings pretty sheltered, basically at 15 years old my peers started to understand a bit how the society works, common rules like not everyone is good, not everyone is bad. my point is they got to start learning how to tell the difference.

i got to meet two friends and we stayed friends after, i mean why would i. That was until i moved across the world and found myself on my own no friends no relatives nothing. i made some good friends along the way, but that was until one person slipped and become more than just a best friend.

# When it all begun...

so this person become my roommate eventually and our bond got stronger she had issues with her life that made me wanna help as much as i could've, and i did. After a while she begun to be distant from me, i tried to work on our friendship but i got tired after the many times she clearly stated she didn't give a shit, i mean the girl did try to commit a suicide so i didn't wanna give up on her just because she tries to push people away with hurtful words. Eventually, me myself started to feel like i was falling for depression and started to steer away from her fearing my condition would be negative for her.... for a while stuff went good but because a minor issue concerned a small amount of money she went ahead and sent ***A VOICE NOTE***  to my mother who is very strict about me being a whore and drug addict and an alcoholic, which was everything she was doing ( to be honest i didnt once call her a whore but i didnt care if she moved from one guy to another in less than a week) and that led to my problem."

I don't have internships anywhere, didn't go to a top school or even have a CS degree. But while I was in college, I started reading web tutorials on my spare time and got a work study campus job where I did some tech support for faculty and also updated some departmental websites. Then I took a full-time web dev job at a small local startup and was laid off 2 years later.

I'm at a crossroads and want to turn around my career. It seems like it's idea to start your career early at a large company where there are many people to learn from without leaving the company and plus good benefits. But I don't have any friends in the CS or IT world, and I certainly don't know anyone that can vet for me at these companies.

Which is why I ask, are there any large companies that have talent seekers looking for people with interesting projects or potential? That didn't have the advantages of going to the right schools or internships? That way fewer people get left out. What sorts of projects would be great, for say, Google? Apple? Or Intel? My biggest hurdle is my resume. I've applied to large places and they're not getting any bites. And for web developer roles. Without internships, no friends or coworkers to vet me how am I supposed to get in?"

When I looked my program up, I only hear good stuff from it.

They also accept based on our dossier, no entrance exam, they just look how well we did the past few years and make their decision based on that.

So yeah, I thought it was super selective, and once I got in i went from : « FUCKING YES MY DUDE » into « well if I got in it wasn’t very selective »

I've been in Uni since 2014 non stop. I'll be done by Fall 2019. My gpa is a 2.6 or 2.7. My major is Business Admin with CIS (Computer Information Systems) as an emphasis. I've never been good at school, even with studying, medication (Welbutrin/Vyvanse), meditation, and therapy. 

To make up for that I placed emphasis on working jobs at universities that are related to IT or somewhat related. I have a board member position for one of our Cyber Security clubs. I use LinkedIn actively and attend CIS or Cyber Security events when they are available.

Only thing hurting me is: Low GPA and No Internships.

Regardless of if your major is related or not, was it hard to find a job out of college? 

I'm the only one in my family who will have a degree if that helps. These past 7 years I have had massive stress about not being good enough after graduation despite keeping myself busy...

8w4jfw,2,2018-07-04,I feel underpaid - How should I approach this?,Vitesze,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8w4jfw/i_feel_underpaid_how_should_i_approach_this/,"My situation: I'm a 25yo European who obtained his MSc in Environmental Sciences last year and moved to a big city in Canada for employment. I initially started off as an intern, but after three months I became a salaried employee. The company acts as a consultant in the waste industry, and only  has about 30 employees. Since I'm on a work permit  (obtaining Permanent Residency in a few months), I legally can't switch jobs.

My job: I'm working as a Product Developer, and my main activity involves designing an Arduino-based electronic device. By  mounting it on a container it will report on truck pickups, fill-rate of waste inside the container and taking images. The purpose of it is to optimize the service efficiency of containers and detecting the disposal of illegal waste (e.g. hazardous waste). For example, if your container is picked up twice/week but is always 80&amp;#37; empty, you can reduce the pickup rate to once/week instead (saving a lot of money). Our company has a non-existing technology department - so I'm literally doing everything myself. The reason they're invested in this all is because the current choice of similar devices on the market are either too costly, or (often) don't work well. Within the company, there's no one that comes even remotely close to being able to replace me - they probably would also struggle finding a replacement from outside as there's few businesses like us, and the work does require some specific waste industry-knowledge. It's hard to say what the economic value of this device is to them, but in 2017 they paid about 450K for similar-devices. We currently have 10 working prototypes, and hoping to have them produced at a large-scale in 2-3 months from now.

My dilemma: they initially low-balled the negotiations with a 40K offer, which I declined. They upped it to 45K, but weren't thrilled on going any higher than this. I earn the minimum vacation time (10 days) and there's no bonus, commission, etc. I know that at least a fair portion of my similarly-aged colleagues earn between 45-50K right now, and that this difference  is experience-based (I accidentally saw files I was not supposed to see). These colleagues work either as Customer Service or Junior Accountants. Senior colleagues earn significantly more. It is an extremely high COL-city though (average rent for a 1BR in the area is $1700), and I spend about 40&amp;#37; of my income on rent alone. Whenever I talk with my supervisor (who is also the company director) he always talks about how great this project I'm doing is, all the plans he has for it, etc. But I can't help but feel that being (among) the lowest earner in the entire company, I'm getting underpaid significantly. At the same time, this company gave me an opportunity as a paid intern when they didn't had to, paid for work permits fees for me, etc. so I do appreciate that.

Just this morning, I had a conversation with my supervisor and the Financial Manager, and they would like me to consider assembling my own mini-team for the project - either by training a few other employees, or by getting an apprentice/intern to help out. Again though, I can't help but feel that while the value of my work is clearly there and recognized by everyone, 45K for a very high COL-area just seems low. The company is doing extremely well financially, and in the last two year has gone up from 5 to 30 employees.

How do I approach this with my supervisor, without shooting myself in the foot? Losing this job would be absolutely disastrous to me as I moved here to live together with my (then) LDR-gf - I would most likely be forced to return back to Europe again since I can't switch to another job. My employer knows this of course. This is my first ""real"" job, and I'm unsure on what I should be doing."

8w5s55,5,2018-07-04,Should I ask for a raise?,therealprez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8w5s55/should_i_ask_for_a_raise/,"Howdy folks,

So I've landed by first job January of last year in a small startup. I started working doing front-end work, mainly with React + Redux, which I became very proficient at as of today. Note that at the beginning of this job, I knew very little about the JS ecosystem, how REST APIs worked, unit testing, using VCS (Git in my case). After all, this was my first job, and I was only 17!  I was recruited by a relatively close member of my family, who is one of the three founders. Now I know how that sounds, and I've made every effort possible to battle the idea that I'm only here because I'm ""the boss' cousin"".

My salary was (and still is) 14$/h CAD, which I was fine with in the first year or so. But this summer, I was hired as an intern (I couldn't be hired the previous summer as my school only allows internships on second and third year) and I have been thinking about asking a raise. Ideally, I would like to be at 18$/h, but I don't want to overshoot and make relations with my bosses awkward, as we are a relatively small team and we all like each other. What I hate is that I've never had the occasion to share salaries with my coworkers, except one time where one said that his previous job was 22$/h, and that the offer that my company made was higher than that. Note that he has not yet graduated, and I'm fairly certain he's also doing front-end work. My reasons for asking a raise are that I've improved a lot during my work there, mainly that I am much more proficient in front-end work than I was before. That and also that I started doing work in the backend (yay!), which adds new responsabilities. Not to sound braggadocious, but I've been praised by my bosses as a quick learner and as a very talented programmer. But I don't want to let that get to my head, so this is why I am here. Is 18$/h too big of an increase?

I'm really eager to ask for a raise, as one of my friends, who is very talented, has received an offer of 17$/h at his company, so it got me thinking about getting a raise. As I don't want to be overly specific about my location, I'll just narrow it down to the province of Quebec, Canada.

Cheers,

Prez"

Do students ever get them after their first year (completing 61A and B, Calculus, EE16A)?

Or are they more so for upper level students (juniors and seniors). 

Lastly, are cs students employable after their first year? at a low level, can students who finish their first year in cs or data science find jobs?"

I'm currently a junior attending University of California - Santa Barbara. For as long as I can remember, my grandparents have had a vacation house here, located a couple miles away from the beach up in some hills, mostly covered by trees. It still has a decent overlooking view of the ocean, but it backs up to some woods. Anyways, I lived in the dorms freshman year and then spent sophomore year in an apartment with some buddies. 

For this upcoming year, I wanted a little more responsibility because of a major internship I have lined up in the fall. Plus, I wanted to show my parents I could handle my own. After asking my grandparents if they had anyone living in the condo. My grandpa said, ""No, its been empty for awhile and we never have the time to make it out there anymore."" After hearing that, I inquired if I could move in and pay a cheap but fair rent living by myself. At first, he hesitated then agreed saying, ""That should be fine, but you have to be careful in that area. I've heard a small Satanic group has broken into a few other homes in that area and conducted some... rituals."" I remember laughing and jokingly responding, ""This isn't the sixties Grandpa, Charles Manson has been locked up for awhile and those groups don't exist anymore."" 

Last week, I finally moved in. The big brown cabin-style house was exactly as I remembered, but definitely had some wear and tear inflicted. On move-in day, I found that a window on the back door had been broken but the door was still locked. After getting the rest of my stuff in, I sorted out my boxes by room and planned on running to the hardware store after seeing if the condo needed any additional work done. After making a small list of house essentials as well, I was sitting in my bedroom when I heard a bang outside, it startled me and almost knocked the crucifix off the wall. 

Thinking nothing of it, I continued onto the store, gathered my necessities, and quickly returned. Later that night, I was trying to fall asleep and it proved difficult due to first night jitters (an eerie sensation when you're spending your first night alone in a new place and your imagination gets the best of you). Drifting in and out of sleep, my eyes opened after hearing what I assumed to be the back door closing. When I swung out of bed, I saw that the crucifix had been moved to the center of the room, I tossed it up to being delirious and headed downstairs to find an empty living room. After seeing nothing was missing, it appeared no one was here either. The only thing that was out of place was the back door being now somehow unlocked. Thinking I'm tough, I opened the door and yelled, ""Great joke guys, you got me."" I was under the impression it was probably some teenagers trying find some trouble. 

After getting everything under order, I headed back upstairs to my bedroom and saw it was around 3:15 am on my bed-stand clock. My mouth dropped as soon as I entered the room, the crucifix I THOUGHT I imagined being moved to middle of the room was now upside down, and appeared to be screwed or dead-bolted in. Being too tired to deal with it but still not wanting to look at an upside cross while trying to sleep, I covered it with my Marilyn Monroe poster (which is a painting of her face with a real emphasis on the big, red lips and luscious blonde hair). Unable to fall asleep, I laid with my eyes open and they appeared to be fixated on the Marilyn poster for the longest time. 

This is where it starts to get weird. Everyone I've told has said this was a dream and not to worry. I swear I was awake but when I was lying there, I was staring at the lips thinking, ""how scary would it be if they moved."" Within 3 minutes of thinking that, the whiteness of her teeth disappeared as her lips began to move and the face became somewhat animated. The eyes slightly adjusted and were looking directly into mine. The apple-red lips were moving but no words came out, only what sounded like the hissing of a snake. It did this for a few minutes before I jumped out of bed to find the painting had not changed at all. Freaked out, I jumped in my car and took off to stay at a friends for the rest of the night.

The following morning, I told him I was at a party close by and just needed to crash. He accepted my story and I decided to head back to the house. The backdoor was still locked and everything seemed to be in place. When I entered my room, the Marilyn Monroe poster had been torn off the wall and ripped to shreds and a red,messy pentagram was drawn around the still upside down crucifix. At this point, I know someone (possibly more) have been in my house. In disbelief, I go into my bathroom to think and written with lipstick across the mirror was, ""Prepare to see Lucifer.""

A few days pass and nothing happens so I'm starting to think I was just apart of some fucked up joke. Then last night, I get home from work to find the back door window broken again. It was too late to do anything about it and after a long day, I just wanted to rest so I hop in the shower. When I get out, there was more lipstick on the mirror but no words this time, just the beginning of a line. I follow the line along the walls and I see an arrowhead at the end of it pointing right out my bedroom window. When I approach the glass and look down, there are six purge-looking masked individuals all looking directly at me, all pointing with the same hand at me (possibly behind me?). Immediately, I locked my room and called the cops. When they finally arrived, obviously the group had dispersed and were long gone. 

After all this trouble, is it still worth living here?? "

I couldn't find anything about my situation in the wiki.

In April I signed a six month sublease on an apartment starting July 1st for an internship I have in the area. In June I got word that the start date for my internship was pushed back a month, so I asked my landlord if it was ok to move in on July 7th instead. He said ok. On the 3rd he sent me a text saying that the room will not be available until the 26th because the current tenant delayed his move out. He offered me a bed in the living room and a room ~20 miles away from my internship, both of which I refused.

I know that this is a clear breach of the lease and that I'm entitled to some sort of compensation. I wish I could just leave it at that but finding temporary housing that isn't astronomically expensive on such short notice is proving to be very difficult. Some of my relatives have graciously offered their house, but they live ~10 miles from my job so I will have to Uber there and back every day.

What are my legal rights in this situation? If I were to stay somewhere like Extended Stay America (which costs like $150/night as opposed to my $850/month apartment), how much of it would my landlord have to pay for? In addition if I were to stay with my family, could I make my landlord pay for the Uber rides to and from work?

Thanks in advance."

8w7zww,20,2018-07-05,TIFU by losing my job for basically breaking a fan,matheus886,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8w7zww/tifu_by_losing_my_job_for_basically_breaking_a_fan/,"Obligatory Disclaimer: This didn't actually happen today, but it was at the beginning of this year, maybe around February.

So I was actually in an internship, not exactly what I call a job (or working as a trainee, not sure of what I could call it since English isn't my native language) and it was at my local University, specifically at the Asian Languages and Studies department we have here, and my job was to basically organize books of our library by categories like title and year of publication or author each of them in different files. Not exactly important for the story actually.

Story begins here: I worked with one more coworker, same office, different desks, but she one day decides to turn on the fan as it was getting really hot and asks me if I don't mind a fan on facing my back (the only energy socket that wasn't busy was located beneath the other desk behind me) and I say I don't but this response might be the very beginning of my fuck up. She turns the fan on, gets back to her desk (by my left side), but later she goes outside the office to refill her bottle or something.

At the moment I responded her I didn't mind the fan on I actually didn't know that it was starting to make all the papers by my desk fly and also a little key chain that was hanging from the lock of a locker by my right side kept tapping in the locker door and it made a really annoying sound. Me, not being as bothered by the heat as she was, decided to turn off the spinning set of the fan, and turn the fan facing at her direction slightly more than mine, INSTEAD that in a moment of sheer stupidity my brain farts and I turn the fan right WHILE IT IS STILL ON.

So I start to panic and freak out as the fan, which was bought by my supervisor, has its propellers stopped by the grid it was in, with the propellers stuck through the grid and the fan completely stopped, even though I can still feel the vibration of its little engine still on. I immediately pull the energy plug out of the socket and pray I can put the propellers back on the former position and have the fan working no problem. Which I manage to before my coworker gets back to her desk, even though the grid was broken by the propellers but it was black colored and it was almost unnoticeable that something cut through it.

Fast forward to late March/early April and it's cleaning day; the cleaning ladies come by and ask if we can get out of our offices for them to clean them, I worked in a hallway full of other offices and small libraries. Me, my coworker and my supervisor, as well as other university teachers and staff leave the office hall, some go grab a cup of coffee downstairs or have lunch. I talk to my supervisor in the meantime and about 45 minutes later when we come back I face my absolute nightmare: I see the fan I managed to get working normally in the past month completely fucked.

Overwhelmed by the guilt I decide to be honest and tell straightforwardly my supervisor I was one of the responsibles for breaking the fan, but the cleaning ladies definetely did something to it while we were outside the office. There was SMOKE coming out of it, and worst of all, I only noticed it was in that state after 15 minutes of tapping on my keyboard organizing the bookshelves and whatnot. A teacher had to come out of his room across the hallway to warn me, a dumb motherfucker, a fan was basically on fire and I had to turn it off and open the windows (not on fire, but with the propellers through the grid like they were before I fixed it and a few of its cables completely burnt. My coworker left earlier that day).

Few weeks after that my supervisor and his boss (the coordinator of my uni course and the department) call me for a ""talk"" and they decide to fire me for ""lack of iniative during work"" and also a few more stuff about a scholarship to Japan I denied due to not being able to gather a few necessary documents few months back. I'm pretty sure though the fan business played a part in getting me out of there, and I absolutely regret that day.

TL;DR: Broke a fan by turning it so it can face other way while it was still on, propellers got stuck on the fan, it eventually completely broke in a short time. Was fired probably because of it."

I need a lot of advice on my future because I'm stressing out on how to move forward from my situation. Please try your best to understand my situation and offer the most appropriate advice for me. I would be very grateful for any advice I get. I will break this down into sections and add images to help you a little bit more. Thank you!

**Background Info/ History**

I'm 20 years old and I lived in England for pretty much all my life before moving to Texas in August 2016. I completed high school there and had it evaluated in Texas to confirm that I have achieved the US equivalent of a High School Diploma. I have not attended any high school in the US; I am currently attending a community college. Because of family priorities, I have only been able to attend this community college part-time and have will have completed 28 credit hours by the end of the summer semester (in almost 2 years since joining), and my current GPA is 3.52. (I've got A's in all my classes apart from one). I've had a hard time managing driving my family around/ helping financially with a job/ doing classes, which seriously affected one of the classes I took, but now I've quit my job and I'm focusing solely on education. I'm planning on transferring to a 4-year university in Fall 2019. 

**Interests/ Talents/ Hobbies**

I'm not passionate about ANYTHING. I have no particular interests that will push me towards a particular major. I have my likes and dislikes and that's it. I don't have any hobbies or any talents. I'm just a boring dude. I listen to hip-hop, play video games, and do class work. That's it. There's nothing to me that will make me follow a particular path apart from certain likes and dislikes. I would prefer a job that includes sitting at a desk in front of a computer and get paid well. 

**Accounting vs. Computer Science**

Transferring to a 4--year university is my current goal. I initially wanted to major in Accounting, not because I'm passionate about it or anything. One day my sister suggested Accounting and I researched it and thought it was interesting. Then I came across Computer Science. I do enjoy being on my computer and technology so I thought maybe I should major in Computer Science, even though I've not got any experience in coding or anything. Like I mentioned above, I'm not talented or passionate in anything. I'd say my strengths are academic. I can do the classwork and do well, so there isn't a major that appeals to me more, but I'm currently pursuing CS.

My questions are:

**(1) Which of the majors will give me more/ better opportunities in the job market (in Texas)?** I don't want to be struggling to find a job after graduation. Am I more likely to find jobs in Accounting or Computer Science?

**(2) Based on what I've described about myself so far, is there a major that suits me more than the other?** I'm academically good so I'm sure I can do either but what do you suggest is a more suitable option for me? Can you ask me some questions or give some pros/cons of both which I could form a better decision on?

**(3) Is experience in these fields necessary before applying to a university?** I have no experience in either of these fields so I would be going into a major that I have some interest in and that's it. I know there are students who have coded since they were young and students who have successful business ventures, but I have nothing. Is it necessary to have experience in these fields? How difficult would it be for me to get into college with this disadvantage? 

(**4) If experience is highly recommended, what should I do to gain it?** Are there any particular courses I should take or any books that you recommend for me to buy? Are there any coding languages that I should try to learn before applying? Are there any ways of gaining accounting/ business experience or knowledge?

**Internships/ Scholarships**

I have some doubts and questions about what I do once I have selected my major.

**(5) How do I increase my chances of getting a scholarship?** What sort of scholarships should I be on the look out for? Are there any particular websites I should use to apply for a scholarship? (Keep in mind the UK education system is different to the US one, so please answer me like I'm an idiot. I legit don't know how the American higher education system works :/ )

**(6) What are the advantages of internships?** When should I apply for an internship? How do I boost my chances of being accepted into one?

These are my major concerns for now. As mentioned above, the UK education system is different to the US one, so please answer my questions like I'm an idiot because I really don't know how a lot of American things work lol. I may edit this post if I have questions in the future. I know it's kind of a long read, but I'd be so grateful if you took time to read and gave me some advice. Thank you so much for reading this and any advice you give! :) "
8w8obt,8,2018-07-05,My First Real Job!!,Curious_Cherio,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/8w8obt/my_first_real_job/,"Hey Redditors!
 
So I just got my first job after graduation, and I'm super excited but also very confused on how to spend the income that I'll have now.

Background: Dad left me at young age, so mom and I lived on very low income (~30k/year). He took everything. She did her best and she paid my university education as well. We never ate out, we never indulged, and always did our best to save $$. Flash forward through my teens and adolescence, I had 4 internships where I made about 60k total. I basically spent most of my money on bills and fun. I could've saved more but I wanted to have fun for once in my life so I did. I spent money on mom, and creating memories which I missed years before.

What I have now: 
1. 21k in bank. 1k in chequing and 20k in TFSA
2. Toyota Corolla worth 8k (depreciating)
3. A house that is 80k/210k paid (mom's gift)
4. Property in a different country worth 300k
5. Business ownership worth 20k
6. New job: 
     a. 60k/year with overtime (could be more)
     b. Sign on bonus of 14k
     c. Relocation Amount: 10k
     d. 40k in stocks to vest over 4 years
7. 4k in a different country

I know it's not like a huge amount of money. I would've had more given different circumstances. 

Future expenses: 
1. Returning to University part time to complete second Bachelor in Psychology and Computer Science. So far I have 1.5 years completed. I have 2.5 years left. If I work hard I can get it done in 3-4 years. Approximately 4k/year

2. I'm moving to a different province, so I'll have to find ways to decrease my expenses and increase my profits. 1k/month

3. Want my mom to decrease her work load so I'll be giving her 2k/month for rent in the house and fun money.

4. I have 140k KMS on a 2005 Toyota Corolla. Should I buy a new car? If so when? 

5. I want to buy things but I want to make smart decisions that will help me in the future. I have a friend who is open to buy a franchisee in a partnership. My friend is a 40 year old accountant who has his head on straight. I have business experience as we've owned a restraunt ( not anymore) and manufacturing plant back home (still own).

I wanted to ask Redditors who are masters at managing their finances so I can make decisions to increase my income. I want to start a business, and my mom will be working full time to run it. She is amazing at running a business, so I can fully focus on earning money and investing it where it counts. 

I'm very motivated to learn and understand money. Help me in any way that you can!! 

P.S. I'm very excited that my life is finally turning a new leaf and hopefully I can snowball these outcomes into something much bigger.

Tldr; My first job. Don't know what to do with money. Help.

8wa5k2,197,2018-07-05,"Life as a Waterloo student in an alternative universe, Part 1",NegativeBinomialM136,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/8wa5k2/life_as_a_waterloo_student_in_an_alternative/,"I wake up on the living room couch in a tiny bachelor's studio unit that houses 6 in a sketchy Kitchener neighborhood. I'm paying $1,750 per month for approximately 50 square feet of space and have to share the living room with Daniel, one of my roommates, who opens his eyes, annoyed. I had a decent sleep because it was my turn to sleep on the couch last night, but that means Daniel had to sleep on the carpet and judging from his facial expressions I can tell he's clearly in a lot of back pain. He curses, lets out a loud fart, and then proceeds to urinate in the washroom with the door open. 

I log into WaterlooWorks on my phone and see that my co-op advisor has sent me a message: 

""Oi,

This is CECA, get your stupid ass here ASAP, you have an interview with The Government of Ontario in an hour, better not be late or I will triple your co-op fee, I know your daddy's rich, don't you cry.

Get Fucked,

Janis""

Helvete! I can't believe I almost forgot about my only interview so far this term! I have to be on CECA's good side, I think to myself. I'm already retaking PD 6 for the third time (because I only got 95% and 97% in my first two attempts and I'm aiming for at least a 98%) and I don't want to jeopardize my chance of graduating with the greatest honour of having the word ""Co-operative"" on my degree. 

I take a few quick bites and quickly pack my backpack. Daniel comes out of the washroom, yawns loudly, and gulps his protein shake. ""You have any interviews today?"" I ask him. 

""Yeah boi, Blackberry."" He replies in a lazy voice.

""Blackberry?!"" I look at him incredulously. All Cali companies died because of the 2008 financial crisis, and Blackberry emerged as world's most venerable leader in disruptive innovations. Their proprietary mobile operating system is far superior than Android and iOS in every way. Who thought open source was a good idea LOL? The Blackberry buildings on Phillips Street are now known as ""The Most Innovative Postal Code in the World"". On top of that, Blackberry also pays its interns ridiculously well, and offers catered meals from the plaza. Davis Centre and E5 were annexed by Blackberry to be used as corporate housing for Waterloo interns. In essence, ""Blackberry or Bust"" is every CS student's motto. 

Daniel is interviewing with Blackberry?! What a hypebeast! I shake my head in jealousy and head out to catch my LRT. Perkele, I'm gonna be late for the train! As I run towards the station, I feel an imminent panic attack and find myself whispering uncontrollably under my breath:

""thank prof smith, thank prof smith...""

Professor Larry Smith never went on his sabbatical and his lectures continued to attract hundreds of students to the point that a WatCard check had become a necessity. But the students liked his lecture so much that they started bribing the TAs to let them in. A truly benevolent leader and obviously well-liked by students and faculty alike, Professor Smith eventually replaced Feridun Hamdullahpur as the President and Vice Chancellor of Waterloo by an unanimous vote in the Senate. He has become some sort of school idol on our online school community known as OMGUW. Students have been professing their unbridled love and admiration for Professor Smith on OMGUW for quite some time now. In fact, the last non-Smith confession on OMGUW was from last October, and it was downvoted to oblivion.

**Fortunately**, my prayers to Professor Smith have not been in vain, and a slight, unexpected delay to the LRT means that I am able to get on the train as it is about to leave. The driver is kind enough to halt the train to let me on. I give her a nod gratefully and say to her ""thank prof smith"".

Suddenly, everyone on the train puts away their phone and starts staring at me intensely. The driver has also become visibly upset.

8wa83j,10,2018-07-05,Anyone else feeling lonely over summer?,Ractrick,UniUK,https://www.reddit.com/r/UniUK/comments/8wa83j/anyone_else_feeling_lonely_over_summer/,"So I've finished 3rd year. Im doing a 5 year degree, and honestly being home over summer has just been so boring. I do work but the hours are limited by necessity (I work with kids so its only really from 4-8pm until schools break up, and thats only 3 /4 times a week at most). 

I had 2 groups of friends at school/6th form, the ""nerds"" I did my subjects (Maths, and Science) with and the ""lads"" I played football with and went drinking with. I've fallen away from the ""lads"" group as tbh I've matured as a person and actually find a lot of the shit I used to do/say with them pretty distateful. As its the end of my 3rd year, most of my friends from the ""nerd"" group are all starting jobs/internships as theyve graduated and so they're not really free to hang out with that often. 

Most of my Uni friends live far away, those who don't have graduated and are doing long internships (12+ hours a day at investment bank sort of things) so have no real time to go out either.

So yeah, I'm lucky if I can manage to do 1 thing a week with any of my friends. 

Idk where this post is going, but its starting to get me down. I guess its real life getting in the way of stuff and nothing to do with me, but its pretty depressing to go from having a decently big group of friends at uni where I could do stuff every day if I wanted to to being lucky to do something once a week.  Anyone else feel like this?"

I'm about to start my Junior year in my CS degree. I am currently doing R&amp;D this summer, for a private cyber security company. In my time here so far, I was able to take and pass the CySA+ exam. This is my only formal cyber security experience, other than hobby projects and research. I am mainly interested in exploits, malware, and reverse engineering. I had thought about going for OSCP as my next cert.

Are there any jobs I could get with this certification and one internship for experience? Are there any certifications I should look to obtain with CySA+ that might allow me better opportunities out of college?

Thank you,

In the application they said they required a minimum of 3.0 GPA, and I put my actual GPA which is &lt;2.5. They interviewed me anyway, and I passed the interview and got the offer flawlessly. However, I heard that some companies revoke offers (I even heard they do for this company, in some of the other sub companies they own) if they find out that you GPA is less than 3.0 (the CEO of the company even said they require this minimum on their website). What are my chances of getting my offer revoked? The internship will run a background check soon and I don't know whether or not they saw the GPA on my application, or if I have to submit my transcript. I go to a top CS school and they might have interviewed me because of that and ignored my GPA, but I'm not sure.

8wbo9o,9,2018-07-05,"USA Citizen accepted to MSc program in Hamburg, Germany",SovngardeHero,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/8wbo9o/usa_citizen_accepted_to_msc_program_in_hamburg/,"Hello all! As the title says, I was recently accepted to study in a Master's in Science program for chemical engineering at TUHH in Hamburg. I am very excited for the opportunity to experience Germany, to further my education, and to really immerse myself in the culture and language. I may be a little different than most other master students though in that I have held a full time engineering job here in the US for the last 3 years before attempting to study abroad. 

As a result, I have several attachments here at home and the logistics of moving to Germany in a couple of months is fairly overwhelming! Many of these are personal issues that I will face on my own, however some of my logistical questions are relevant, I believe, to some members of this sub. Specifically the general questions of what I, a citizen of the USA, need to do both prior and during my stay in Germany. 

The acceptance letter from TUHH gave me the general guidelines, but it is also vague enough so as to apply to all international students. From what I have gathered, I do not really need to do anything specific prior to traveling to Germany. Instead:

1. I can travel to Germany on a tourist visa (US passport) about 2-3 weeks before school begins. 
2. Once there I will register myself with the local immigration office. 
3. I then need to obtain one of the publicly available health insurances. 
4. I can now go to a local Deutsche Bank branch and open a student account. Once open I need to transfer and convert at least 8800 euros into this account. 
5. I will likely have set up the appointment beforehand, but next I will go back to the immigration office and apply for my temporary residence permit. 
6. Hope that I obtain the permit before my 90 days are up (I've heard and read it's usually pretty quick, even during September/October time frame). 

Does all this sound correct? As long as I give myself enough time beforehand, I can try to get this all done in the few weeks prior to beginning the semester. I also recently found out I didn't get into one of the student residence halls, so I will likely be spending those first couple of weeks also searching for a place to live. 

So my questions to all of you: am I crazy? Completely misinformed? Do I need to give myself more time? Are there actually things that I need to do in the US prior to traveling to Germany to study? Advice from US citizens who have already gone through all this is especially appreciated! Thank you all for you time. 

EDIT: Okay so I had #2 wrong and had it mixed up with registering my address within 2 weeks of securing it.

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for your wealth of information! From what I'm gathering from the replies below and some discussion with a friend who did an internship in Germany (also a US citizen, no ties to Germany), I really don't have any direct administrative stuff required to be completed prior to traveling to Germany. While I have seen information related to blocked student accounts and applying for residence permits while still in the US, it seems that none of this is necessary for me. 

Instead, once arriving in Germany I can just open a regular German student bank account (no blocked account necessary) and wire transfer/convert my US currency into this account. The residence permit application officer only needs to see that I have a German bank account with the proper amount of funds in the form of a bank statement. Whether it's a special blocked account or just a normal student one shouldn't matter, I believe.

Also, the 8800 euros was just a figure that I've seen thrown around on the internet and I've never actually managed to find a HARD value to shoot for. I've even seen resources say it's funds for the entire duration of study (in my case 2 years or 24 months) at ~780 euros a month. My main concern is that I can at least get a year long residence permit and just reapply for another year with new proof of funds when it is required."

I read on reddit that in their other subcompanies people had their offers revoked for not having a 3.0 at least. Since I got the offer, should I be okay? I do have another offer for another company and I'm not sure whether or not to accept it just in case. How should I ask the recruiter if their GPA requirement is strict? They have yet to send me the offer details, and they said it will come within a week or two.

Two months into my internship, I'm beginning to discover that my interest in full-stack web development is diminishing. I want to try SDE roles (C++, Java, Python) and see how they are compared to full stack, then pick one to go into for full time and stay for a longer period. The problem with going into full time immediately is that full time jobs expect employees to stay for a longer period of time (min. 1 year?) and it looks bad to job hop too early. 

I was wondering, will it be hard to find a SDE full time job with this full-stack internship experience, or should I find a SDE internship next summer and postpone my graduation date? "

Looking to major in some form of engineering, maybe environmental engineering for schools that offer it - maybe crop sciences for schools that offer it (such as UIUC) - but otherwise just some form of engineering (currently undecided which).

School: small elite private-school in Manhattan

Background: Indian (first-gen immigrant, parents attended college in India. Legal, permanent resident.)

GPA: 3.6 

Rank: unsure, school doesn’t do ranks.

ACT: 35

APs: 5 on APUSH and AP Calc AB; will take AP Stats and AP Bio (or AP Physics) next year. (School barely offers any APs, maybe 11 total, max any person could ever hope to do would be 6)

Subject tests: took Math II (third attempt; previous best is 740) and US History in June, expecting strong results for when I get them next week. Planning on taking the Bio test as well.

Activities:

Hydroponics:
- I build hydroponic personal food computers (no real purpose, just personal tinkering)
- Three week internship at hydroponic lab/farm this month
- personally working/collaborating with MIT to integrate hydroponics/agricultural tech into environmental sciences at my school
- starting a vocational program for 18+-year-old kids on the spectrum that involves harvesting, packaging, and distributing hydroponically-grown crops to soup kitchens (my brother is on the spectrum)

Writing/Art:
- published poet
- currently co-founding a collective of artists
- editor and writer for school newspaper for three years
- editor and writer for school literary magazine for three years

And, an explanation as to why I think I’m screwed:

Essentially, I’ve been on a downward trend grade-wise. Nearly straight As (and decent courseload, no APs) freshman year. Straight Bs (and a Withdraw Pass in one class, no APs again) in sophomore year. 3 Bs and two Cs (with two APs - both of which I got 5s on though) junior year. Best case scenario, I’ll manage straight As first quarter next year with two APs, and finish with an overall weighted GPA of ~3.6. 

As for the explanation why, all I can really say is personal/mental health issues. If I could give it a name I suppose it would be anxiety that’s been stopping me from completing and handing in work resulting in the drop in grades. There’s no official diagnosis and I’ve never spoken to a guidance counselor though - haven’t seen therapists, haven’t been on medication - so I don’t know if I could provide any proof. Most advice I’ve seen for students in similar positions has been “just explain it in the additional info section of the common app”, but I’ve also heard that schools typically don’t want kids with mental health issues and will often reject them on that basis. 

Anyway, I’m mostly freaking out because I expected to bounce back from sophomore year - get straight As junior year, and finish with a stellar GPA. Instead, things just... got worse. Praying I can bounce back for senior year. I was looking at schools like MIT, CMU, Harvey Mudd, USC, UCLA, UC-Berkeley, UMich, URoch, RIT, and UIUC, but I worry that most, if not all of those are now no longer a possibility with my downward trend, shitty junior year, and two Cs. If that is the case, some suggestions for new match and safety schools would be greatly appreciated.

and if you read all this, thanks a ton."

A little backstory about myself, I am a recent graduate at a non-target school. I majored in finance and have a couple internships under my belt. I applied and got accepted into a Masters in Finance program this upcoming Fall. The program starts from Sept - Sept, which bars me from any internships available through the summer next year. I wanted to pursue a career as a financial analyst particularly as a corporate FP&amp;A, but after doing a lot of research I am torn on what kind of path in finance is the most appealing to me and my future.

 I thought about the IB route, but it just sounds so demanding and unpleasant. I am now seriously considering the Big 4 route because of the advantages its brand gives to employers. I know I don't want to apply for audit or assurance, and that I would have to apply under either Risk Advisory or Transaction services (something not tax related). After doing that a couple years my plan was to move over to another company in finance in a higher paying position. What are your thoughts on how I should proceed with the upcoming school year? Should I try my luck at the Big4 during recruiting season or do I wait until after my Masters program ends to hopefully find a job in F500? Thanks"

8wclla,58,2018-07-05,[META] Results of the 2018 Subreddit Demographics Survey!,Himekat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8wclla/meta_results_of_the_2018_subreddit_demographics/,"## Introduction and Context

The last demographics survey we ran was in January 2017. We ended up with 1100 responses and a bunch of good data, which you can find detailed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5rvlig/meta_results_of_the_2016_subreddit_demographics/). A year and a half later, it seemed about time to run another survey. We've almost doubled our subreddit size (from about 87k subscribers to 165k subscribers), we've added several more mods, and even managed to spin off r/CSMajors into a viable subreddit.

**We received over 2000 responses to this year's survey**, so I want to thank everyone for participating and for being patient with my constant nagging and reminders. Once again, I don't think there will be any truly surprising information in these results, but I will detail the highlights below. If you think words are boring and just want to see contextless graphs, click [here](https://imgur.com/a/NvU3oXs)!

## General Demographics Statistics

Where do you all live? Well, true to general reddit trends, [75&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/tBUPXKg) live in the United States. The next largest groups come from Canada (8.7&amp;#37;) and Western Europe (8.1&amp;#37;).

CSCQ members are [85.2&amp;#37; male](https://imgur.com/nMiJNbE), 14.4&amp;#37; female, 0.3&amp;#37;; other gender, and [77.6&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/E7kd9ob) are between the ages of 18-28. These are basically exactly in line with the previous survey.

Although [almost half you hold a Bachelor's degree](https://imgur.com/TTG50Qb) as your highest level of education (48.1&amp;#37;), there is also significant representation from people whose highest levels of education are Masters degrees, Associates degrees, and high school diplomas. 27.4&amp;#37; of people are either working toward their first degree, or working toward a second degree.

By far, the majority of people on the subreddit are still in school or fairly new to the industry. [65.5&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/VXDr1Pa) are either still in school or have less than 2 years experience in the industry.

Most of you have at least [some kind of job](https://imgur.com/fskQkHY), with only 5.1&amp;#37; of people reporting being unemployed at this time, and 19.1&amp;#37; of you being students with no current professional work.

## Work / Job Statistics

Here is a [word cloud of submitted job titles](https://imgur.com/X7DUPaG), with ""intern"", ""software engineer II"", ""developer"", ""web developer"", and ""data scientist"" being some of the most common professional titles currently held by CSCQ members.

[61.6&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/nzxQ2uz) report your current role at work is in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, with much smaller slices for every other role. Much like last year, [Javascript, Python, and Java dominate the languages list](https://imgur.com/4FvRw9l), and [43.3&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/Itfp1DG) say you get to code at least 50&amp;#37; of the day. When asked about additional tools and technologies you use at work, [here](https://imgur.com/dfJM7ca) is the word cloud of your responses with ""git"", ""aws"", ""slack"", ""redux"", ""flask"", ""jira"", "".net"", and ""node"" making really strong showings. [All OSs](https://imgur.com/5yWU4ki) and [all stacks](https://imgur.com/sEKaOku) make a strong showing, and [most of you](https://imgur.com/O0NoUtz) (75.3&amp;#37;) use `git` for version control.

When asked what resources you all use to solve problems, [Google and StackOverflow are the most used](https://imgur.com/X4zUcHD), followed by official documentation, internal forums/docs, and internal meetings or talks.

[Company size](https://imgur.com/reZjn7N) and [team size](https://imgur.com/Mf629Th) are all over the place.

Only [5&amp;#37; of you are fully remote workers](https://imgur.com/ytWFrKg) (down from last year's 6&amp;#37;), but 63.2&amp;#37; of you say you can work from home at least occasionally or part of the time (up from last year's 58.7&amp;#37;).

## Home / Personal Projects Statistics

[26.2&amp;#37; of you do **no coding** outside of work](https://imgur.com/hxpVK3V), and an additional 50.1&amp;#37; do less than 5 hours of it per week. That should give hope to all the people who ask if outside work is absolutely necessary to getting or keeping a job.

For the people who do projects outside of work, [Python, Javascript, and Java](https://imgur.com/Px9tbCD) still win out over other languages, and [more than half of you](https://imgur.com/woiGWVh) (54.3&amp;#37;) use Windows as your home OS. When asked what technologies/tools/frameworks you use on personal projects, [here](https://imgur.com/bL9ghth) is the word cloud of the responses received, with ""git"", ""unity"", ""django"", ""flask"", ""vim"", ""spring"", ""node"", and ""pandas"" making the largest showings.

## Job Hunting Statistics

You all have [very varied means](https://imgur.com/kEWatOk) of finding new opportunities, and [most of you](https://imgur.com/vOPQdaf) (86.5&amp;#37;) are at least looking for a higher salary when switching jobs (as well as better work-life balance, technologies you love, companies whose products and missions you care about, and a shorter/better commute). This is all in line with the last survey.

Although many of you are still students or interns, of those of you who are in full-time jobs, [28.3&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/3xMRtpF) have stayed at your longest job for under 2 years, and 24.8&amp;#37; of you have stayed between 2-5 years. The statistics here are probably largely skewed due to the overall young age of the subreddit users and the fact that many people here are students or interns.

[84.7&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/NM9KGlU) keep your resume up-to-date or almost up-to-date, and [you all primarily use friends, family, and career offices to get resume feedback](https://imgur.com/53aGdlb).

[54.8&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/aexXDSk) have applied to a couple of dozen jobs or fewer over the course of your careers. [84.7&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/SPglCvI) have gone on only 1-20 on-site interviews, and [83.9&amp;#37; of you](https://imgur.com/1mXLcsY) have received only 1-20 job offers over the course of your career. Again, these numbers are probably a little skewed because of the relative youth of users on the subreddit.

## Conclusions

Overall, these survey results are not significantly different from the previous survey results. There are some general trends that emerged previously and they largely emerged again:

* A large portion of the subreddit are students or interns, while a sizable amount on top of that are people very early in their careers.
* Subreddit users are largely young, male, and from the United States.
* Subreddit users usually hold Bachelor's degrees, or Master's degrees, or are working toward them.
* Most users who are in professional roles are software developers working with Java, Javascript, Python, C++ or C#, but who work with a varied set of tools and technologies across many types of technology stacks.
* Most users do not do personal projects outside of work. For those who do, they largely work with the same technologies as above (Java, Javascript, Python, C++ or C#).
* Most users who are in professional roles get to work from home at least some of the time, although very few are fully-remote.
* Most users in this subreddit do like to keep their resumes up-to-date, and many have had their resumes reviewed by at least someone at some point in their life.
* Users have a lot of varied desires when moving to new jobs, but largely look for better salaries, better work-life balance, better tech stack, or a (perceived) better company.

## Final Note

I hope you guys enjoyed seeing the results of the survey. These results will be posted in the sidebar, and we will be posting another survey in 2019 (once again taking into consideration the feedback we received during this one). 

Thank you again for your participation!"

I'm kind of into computer graphics/animation, so I was expecting that I would go to one at some point, but since I happen to be in the same city at the same time as the 2018 conference, I might as well go to this one.

I've never really been to a professional convention, so I'm at a bit of a loss for how I could make the best use of my time if I go. I know that there's a big exhibition and a job fair, but I'm also only halfway through my undergrad degree. I haven't had the opportunity to take any CS electives yet, so I don't think I have a lot of things I could show off. I've done some small projects my own through online lectures, and I've read a bit of some textbooks and journal papers, but I'd definitely say I'm still learning the basics. Obviously, I'd love to get an internship with one of the companies that will be there, but it would probably still be worth it just to get acquainted with the industry, if that's all I could do this time.

I had a general strategy of just talking to as many people as I can while I'm there, whether they were professionals, other students, company representatives, etc., but I may have only one or two days for all of it, and I'd really like to get as much as I can from the experience. Computer graphics doesn't have a huge presence at my school, so I'm hoping I can bring some useful information back with me for some of the relevant clubs that I'm a part of, too.

Former Pre-Med here.  No longer interested in pursuing medicine given te many circumstances I'm facing atm. I've never liked biology or medicine and feel like my life will be miserable if I take that route. Long story short I was forced to get into the Pre-Med track by my parents and I don't want anything to do with healthcare.  Don't want to babble too much about why I'm no longer interested but that's for another post.  

I'll be moving to Dallas in the near future (hopefully August) and I was looking at the CS program there. I graduated with a general science degree from a school in the east coast with a minor in Math.  I was wondering if I can do CS masters degree,  and I know full well that I'd have to take some pre-reqs. I have no background in CS but I'm willing to take 2-3 semesters of undergrad CS coursework to get the foundation. I love computer science and have always wanted to understand what goes on behind the computer screen and underneath the processor. I have some base-level technical knowledge about computing but have no formal education and I'm absolutely not qualified to take a job in IT or Software yet.  I  I have taken Calc I-III differential equations and linear algebra at my home institution. Math has always been my biggest strength and I was among the top of my class in every math class since highschool.  (straight As in every math class since HS except a B in linear algebra which was due to a stupid big mistake) 


Should I consider doing a second bachelor in CS or the post-bacc  Accelerated Program of CS offered at utdallas?  


I'm hoping that a degree would equip me with knowledge needed to land a job in software development.  I do realize I would have to work hard in my spare time to learn the various programming languages &amp; frameworks on my own and apply for internships after I feel I have some applicable skills. "

That same day, a recruiter reached out to me with some interview details for a much better job. 

The interview I just  finished was for a Jr. Systems Admin position with a much bigger company. Contract for hire, but better pay out of the gate and much better pay if I get hired full-time. I contacted the recruiter afterwards and said everything went well, even if the interview did seem a bit quick (25-30 minutes).

The offer I accepted from my internship site states that I start Monday, but I might not know if I got the Jr. Sysadmin job or not until next Thursday. The only issue now is that the recruiter is aware of my current offer, and asked if I had accepted it already. I panicked and said no, leading me to now. 

Not my brightest move ever, I'm aware. Is there anything I should do in this situation? I'm obviously very new to the field and don't even have a bachelor's yet, so I'm not sure what to do to fix my flub. "
8wd3gp,0,2018-07-05,Gathering external reports and summarizing them in a DB,Eloyas,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8wd3gp/gathering_external_reports_and_summarizing_them/,"So I have an internship in a mining engineering company. My boss just gave me a new task:

Everyday, he receives a report from each mine they own saying if they accomplished their daily goals. He says he's sick of those reports cluttering his mail, so he want me to find a way to get those reports (a mix of pdf, excel sheets and word documents) into a database and see the trends in a nice graphic.


For now, he suggested making every report into an excel sheet, sending all the reports to a dedicated email adress, have a program open the new mail and identify the right template to use and finally have the template send the data to an access database.


As I have worked with VBA until now, I'm thinking it would be simpler to modify the Template used for each report into an excel sheet and having a button on the sheet that'll upload everything to the database directly. Problem is, I have no idea how to connect a database to the web securely (there's no global corporate network connecting all the mines). Also, I suppose I will need something better than Access to make this work.


So would anybody here have advice on how to begin a project like this? Recommended readings are also welcome."

Background about myself: I'm 27 living in the Detroit, MI, USA area. I have a tech background (IT and teaching) but I only have a BA degree. After completing one of those for-profit web development bootcamp things in early 2017 I got an internship with a small web development agency and then was hired on full time. I've done well at the company and have earned praise and recognition, we primarily do LAMP stack development with WordPress, ModX, and Magento 1 and 2. I've also had the opportunity to build out some cool totally custom web apps using Silex and Larval. I have done quite a bit of front end work using SASS and VueJS as well. 

Anyway I've probably taken it about as far as I can in terms of my role and what I am going to learn here.

So my question is, what should I be looking for to take my career to the next level and get another job? I've applied a few places mostly for PHP roles and have gotten a little bit of traction but it becomes difficult to drop everything and go interview for a job I may not even accept if offered.

I am wondering what other people have done to get to the next level at this phase of their career? I've never gone through a recruiter or recruiting service, is that worth looking at? Are there any skills that will make me more valuable right now? 

Also important to note salaries and opportunities are both fairly low in my area. I am willing to relocate though, with the most feasible destination being Chicago. "
8wdikk,7,2018-07-05,After a month of IT,sgntsh,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8wdikk/after_a_month_of_it/,"About 2 months ago, after a year of finding nothing related to my degree, I decided to make a career change and get into IT, network security specifically. So I started classes and found myself an internship and I just wanted to share some of my thoughts so far. I always find the impression new people have on something interesting and maybe someone else here does too.

1) Sometimes the answer to ""so what was wrong with it?"" is *shrug* ""I dunno."" I am a very curious person by nature so this kinda irks me. I always want to know exactly how everything works, but since I've started I've had to accept that sometimes you don't question why a fix worked.

2) I AM busy! I feel like there is a lot of standing around and waiting. Especially when you are working with older equipment. I'm actually typing this up while I wait on Win 7 to make a backup image on a computer I cant just leave alone and I'm sure the people around me think I'm just goofing off.

3) It's not magic, it's perseverance. I feel like people watch IT guys just *fix* things and it was all training and know how when in reality they just kinda beat their head against it till it worked. NOT to say that IT people don't know what they are doing! Obviously experience plays a huge part in it but I just thought it was kinda interesting how much trial and error there is.

4) Passwords don't protect us from malicious people, they protect us from stupid people. Ok that's a bit harsh but really people, IT gets paid to do this for a reason. Just call them. Stop ""helping."" This one is more from stories that my first hand experience.

Anyways that's just a few things that I have picked up since I started. Just felt like sharing and seeing if any one else has some nuggets to share."
8wds54,5,2018-07-05,Intern With Questions,--sprout--,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8wds54/intern_with_questions/,"(Throw-away because main could probably be linked to me)

Hey guys, I've been a longtime lurker of this sub and it has genuinely helped me in my attempt to get an internship. Well, I have one now and I'm in a really strange place.

I'm having a pretty stereotypical intern experience according to this sub: team doesn't tell me a whole lot, I try and sit in on meetings but don't understand half the things they're saying, and they've given me a project that is basically solely mine.

The weird part is that this project is INTEGRAL to their new product, and it was supposed to take me my entire summer internship to finish part of it, but instead I've finished the entire thing in a couple of weeks. I'm not saying the code is perfect in anyway, and I know it's going to need revisions, but it does what it was supposed to do and it is pretty well organized.

I've been trying to get my team to look at my PR's but they won't (I have SIX I've been waiting on for over a week and a half). I feel like they should really be helping me, not only because I'm an intern but also because this is essentially a third of the product they're supposed to be putting out in the next year. I asked my mentor what to do in the meantime and he gave me a small project that took me about an hour to complete. I've been sitting here for the past few days just kind of... Researching the small amount of our tech stack that I've heard about in meetings, and doing hackrank problems and such but I feel like I'm essentially taking my company's money and they're gaining nothing. Should I continue to do what I'm doing? Just self-teaching myself and asking my mentor daily for work. Or should I do something different?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Also, this should probably be an entirely seperate thread but it's sort of related:

I've been offered to interview at a BIG tech company for a full-time position (and I honestly think my current company may offer me a position after this internship). How important is it that I finish school, at least for now? I'm a year away from graduating and if I get either of these jobs I'd still like to go to school but it would certainly be a few years before I got a degree. Should I take a job if I'm offered one or should I say something like ""I will gladly accept this job after I have graduated""?

Thanks."

My ultimate goal is to get an intellectually demanding job in the US and work there for a few years to save money. 

A few questions: 
* Is it worth it to pay for your master in econ? I did some searches and found out mixed opinions so far. On one hand, master in econ is a waste of time and money since it is not as rigorous as a PhD and serves as cash-cow program for universities. On the other hand, Master Econ seems to be a pretty employable degree to get. 
* Is it worth it to pay for your MS CS?

(July 24th.)",HotNerdZen,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/8wh945/suicidal_thoughts_for_a_year_and_i_think_it_will/,"I'm a 20 year old female, and I am dedicated to being a well-performing student to avoid staying at home. I apply to scholarships, win some, recently gotten into a paid internship, and get decently-good grades. When I am at home, however, I feel like I'm in a cage. When I ask to hang out with friends, I get scolded as to how the world is dangerous and how I can't go alone or can't go alone for trivial/logical reasons. Hanging out with friends is rare, and I'm pretty much forgotten by most because of my lack of being able to go out. I adore my parents, and I know they just don't want me harmed. And I know I don't wish to break their rules because I live under their roof, but I think I did just about every single thing they disapprove of to feel alive. I drank, smoked, had sex, snuck out of home, went to places I shouldn't, and all of this without their knowledge just to feel alive at rare times I can do it. But I'm tired of living this double life and I'm tired of them comparing me to my sister who rebelled against them for reasons of her own. I just want to feel free while feeling as though they are proud of me. My parents' strict rules towards me because I'm a girl aren't my only issue, but also my sick head.  When I do hang out with friends or go to an event, I get depressed/anxious and ruin the day for others and/or myself. It's been happening ever since I hit 2015, once my depression finally went out of control after years and years of bottling it up. It's like when I do finally hang out with people, I can't enjoy myself. I lost so many interests as a result and feel like nothing but a shell. But when I'm caged, I feel miserable. Feeling alone is so painful.   
There's no win to it, no matter what path I take.  
I grew into an angry and bitter person from the lack of interacting with people in real life. My behavior gotten me into fights with strangers whenever they try to approach me (they mostly come to hit on me, disgusting older males that say disgusting comments). I suddenly hate people I adore at certain days, especially when they are having so much fun; and I hate myself even more from it. Like all I'm filled with is hate, anger, sadness, anxiety, jealous, loneliness, and this depression.   
 I've been diagnosed with clinical depression at the age of 16, despite showing signs for as early as elementary school. I recently been diagnosed with anxiety. I recently been going back to self harm after three years of being clean. I tried killing myself over 11 times, with one nearly ending my life for keeps. Suicide hotlines haven't helped, staying at a psychiatric hospital hasn't helped, my friends who do listen to my rambling say nothing or don't know what to say. I have a psychiatrist and recently stopped looking for psychologists/therapists since they are temporary and a fake friend getting paid to listen to me in the end. I'm taking four medications and when I request for changes, my psychiatrist disapproves of it. 

My birthday is coming up on July 24th; I'll be working on my internship at the time. But it's like... what's the point of continuing this facade of a life I have? I don't feel satisfied, no matter how many school accomplishments I get. They don't mean anything to me because all I'm doing them for is to escape my cage. I can't make any new friends even when trying to talk to others, I can't hang out with the ones I have (especially the males), I can't act according to my own wants and needs without being held back by my family, and I have to watch everyone around me, including my brothers, live happily and free. My only escape is social media, where people had complained that I'm on the internet too much, but I have no where else to go. I'm sick of being on the internet 24/7, but it's my only contact to people.  
I go to the gym, eating right, be active on my work life, but nothing feels fun or lively. It almost always never felt that way. What's the point of living when there's no life to live with?   
What's the point of living when all you are is a ""workaholic that has no friends?""   
What's the point of living when ""you're nothing but a selfish and lazy daughter?""   


21 has been an age I've been wishing for ever since I was in elementary. And now I wish it more than ever, so I can finally feel like I can make the one choice I want to do right now. I just want to fly away and never come back down. I never felt truly alive or as a true individual. Fighting with my parents about making my own decisions had only made them angry up to the point where they disowned me twice or compare me to my sister (I am technically their last chance of a daughter and they are clingy to me,) and I hate fighting and fighting. That's all my life is. Enduring and fighting, but never succeeding and winning something that makes my life happier.   
The urge to die is so strong right now as I type this, but I feel like marking my birthday as the perfect day to end it all. I'm so tired of fighting. I'm so tired of feeling like a worthless waste of molecules. I'm so tired of feeling like nothing is for the sake of myself, but for the sake to avoid conflict. These feelings probably won't be with me tomorrow, but they kept creeping every night.   
Over a year of fighting to stay alive, but it's so tiresome.   
Nothing's getting better, even when I try and try. 

I just want my life to feel like a life I can finally mold for myself and not a fight to having that right."

I (23 f (is this an important information?)) always thought of myself as a talkative, social, funny person because my whole family consists of people that are constantly making jokes and are good at talking and socialising. And even though I only had few friends in school I felt like I am good at meeting new people and having conversations with them.

Now I am in college and things somehow changed. I feel like a sphinx or something, there is still that girl in me that reeeeally wishes to have friends that like and appreciate her, I can barely cope with being alone and I feel incomplete with a partner (I know, stupid.) But on the other hand I am soo frightened when it comes to seeing people (especially the ones I already know), I am terrified of that silence that kicks in when noone know what to say, so I talk a lot but not because I want to say these things, I just want to say anything. I also have the feeling that I am terrible at keeping friendships going, it is so exhausting to keep in touch with them and sometimes I just cant get myself to be interested in anyone (kinda contradictory because at the same time I LOVE to help people). 

I started an internship 5 days ago and I think sooo much about what my colleagues think about me, the other trainees are super talkative nice girls and I can't stop myself of being angry at them because I can't get myself to be this super talkative, overly positive person. I guess I am kinda jealous and feel pressured because I dont want to be that one trainee nobody likes.

Does anyone had the same change in character? What did you do about it? Coz it sucks and I feel torn apart.


Sooo long story short. I always thought I am good with people but now it gets harder and harder. Cant deal with people but at the same time really want to have someone around. Gnahhh &gt;__&lt;"

To get to the point, I am a ""Computer and Communications Engineering"" undergrad, I have already finished my final project on May and all remaining courses. I just have 6 remaining credits for which I am currently doing an internship (after Internship ends I get those 6 credits).

So Everyday my Unpaid internship (IT Helpdesk position) place is a great multinational company but its far, it takes me about an hour going another coming back home, I of course stay for at least 8 hours for work (although I have done more up to 13 hours yesterday).

I of course come back exhausted and as  I do not eat anything during work, I fix a meal just after getting back and mostly just read a bit until I can barely keep my eyes open without effort, I then proceed to iron my clothes for the next day and hit the sack.

So I am thinking about trying to continue the research I did for my final project, maybe even publish something in that field (computer vision), I am also not sure if I want to get a masters degree and in the mean time during work I was told that I might be able to get the chance to configure so high grade equipment so I am studying on that.

How can I balance my time to be able to do all 3 of the above competently? what did you guys do? what would you suggest anyways?

Also: sorry for my english

We were highschool sweethearts. He transferred to our school when we were sophomores,  and we kinda clicked since he's American and I was one of the people in our class who can speak english (it's taught in our school,  but only a few dared to speak it because we're all afraid to be laughed at.) He told me he's thankful that I was speaking to him because our classmates wouldn't. Then,  after five months,  we started to date. 
There were things that we had to go through,  like my parents thinking that our relationship would hinder my studies, my being reserved (introvert)  and him being so friendly (extrovert)  and all those culture shocks. Eventually, we surpassed them. 
When we graduated in high school,  we got into our own paths. He went to an engineering school while I went to medical. We still went out, but we rarely had time for each other.  Luckily,  internet and phone were there. 

September, last year. I was interning in a hospital as a nurse while he's in another city that's five hours away if you travel by bus. While I was getting ready for my shift,  he called me and told me he missed me and wanted to see me. I reminded him that we're both busy,  so we couldn't really see each other,  and he said that he's going to see me after my shift,  which was 7pm-7am. It's good because we both were free after my shift and we could actually meet,  although I was worried because I knew he's had many things to do even in his free time. We kinda talked for a while until my shift started. 
When we met up, he held my hand and we had a date. He was smiling all the time,  and I was happy to see him. We complained about the things in our workplace,  but all was good. It was a good time. 
Until he broke down. Night came and while we were on his apartment,  he held my hand and told me he's thinking of killing himself.  He showed me strings of email asking for help (to josamaritans) about what he's feeling. He also told me how,  despite every loving person in his life,  he felt lonely and depressed all the time. I was so shocked. I'd known him for a long time and I'd never thought he's depressed. I remembered there were lots of crying and me telling him how much I love him,  how much he's worthy of happiness. He hugged me and told me how thankful he was that he finally had someone to tell about what he truly felt. I told him that he could tell me everything eveb before that night. 
  I remembered texting my parents that I couldn't come home because I had to do some things related to my internship (parents are still strict even until now) just to stay with him. We laid in bed to sleep,  and he was aslept after two hours or three. I couldn't sleep because I was worried that if I closed my eyes,  he'd be gone. I remembered touching his chest and feeling his pulse just to make sure. 
After that night,  he promised that he wouldnt do something dangerous and we went to see a psychiatrist I know. He had therapy sessions after that. 
March,  this year. I was studying in my room when my mother called. She said he shot himself. I was in denial because I didn't think it was real, but mother couldn't have joked about something like this. I calmed myself, but couldnt keep myself from crying and shaking. It's so painful. Up until now, it's still stabbing me. 
He didn't leave any notes,  and the months after his breakdown were good memories. In the headlines, it was said that he did what he did because of too much school works. I was so angry because they couldnt have been more wrong. 

It has been months, and all I could think of was him. I miss him so much and I love him so much. I try to focus to other things, but after everything,  I go back to thinking about him.  I couldnt tell anyone because they're already worried for me. Most are even uncomfortable of talking about it


I dont know what to feel anymore

Tldr: the guy I love killed himself, asking for advice on how to move on

A lot of my choices are reaches but I want to get a rough idea of where I stand.

  

Demographics: 

Hispanic, male, upper middle class

  

Intended Major:

Math, economics, or both. Maybe applied math or CS instead of math depending on the school and whether I change my mind. I’m looking to go into research.

  

Academics:

SAT: 1570 (800 Math, 770 R/W, 15 Essay)

GPA: 93.7 out of 99.0 (8th: 90.7, 9th: 93.4, 10th: 95.0, 11th: 96.0)

APs: Chem (5), Macro (5), Micro (5)

I go to a mid size (200 person) selective public school where ~45% of people end up at T20s. We don’t rank and are somewhat limited in the number of electives we can take, but I’ve taken the most rigorous possible course load. 

  

Extracurriculars:

Neuroscience Internship: Worked full-time over the summers and part-time during the school year, will have worked 1200+ hours by the time I apply. Have a fully independent project and was largely responsible for supervision of another HS student, including for a period of time where our mentor was away. I am a co-author on an already submitted paper and will likely have one or two first-author publications. I also plan on submitting to competitions in the fall.

Model UN: Sporadic attendance during 10th grade, consistent participation during 11th grade. Third most important leadership position for 12th grade, shared w/ two other people. Minor award at CMUNCE (fairly competitive multi-day conference run by Columbia).

Economics Club: Since beginning of 11th grade. Qualified for team by test. Member of runner-up team in the Ricardo division of the National Economics Challenge. Same team was also ~10th seed at HPEC (econ competition at Harvard).

Columbia Science Honors Program: Since beginning of 10th grade. Selective program (by test, 30% admit rate) at Columbia in which students take 2.5 hour classes on Saturdays. You take a different course each semester, and they are mostly taught by PhD students and postdoctoral fellows. 

Math Team: Sporadic participation at best, did qualify for AIME though (103.5 AMC 12) and was part of the Purple Comet team that was first in NY for our school size. 

JV Soccer: 9th grade lmao

  

Recs: 

Math (9th/11th): Should be very strong. Teacher liked me a lot and credits me with significantly changing the classroom dynamic for the better. 

USH (11th): Teacher likes me, has said that I am a good writer, and has told me that she appreciates my efforts to introduce alternative interpretations to class (I lean somewhat away from the politics of most of my peers). I was a very active participant in her class.

  

Lab Mentor (postdoctoral fellow, maybe to be cosigned by head of lab): Should be very strong. I have shown ability to work very independently, pick up concepts quickly, supervise/teach others, and make intellectual contributions to experiment design and analysis (i.e. I didn’t just do grunt work).

  

Schools:

Stanford (REA, legacy)

MIT

Princeton

Yale

Brown

NYU

Carnegie Mellon (CS and non-CS)

  

I know that my list is a little top-heavy, but I have good reason for choosing each of the schools there and have safeties beyond them. I don’t have many matches bc one of my safeties is international and is actually a match in quality. I will know by the time I apply domestically whether I was accepted there."

I get paid way better than any non-cs intern I know, but it's not like a Big-N pay. I get in the 20's per hour.

I was recommended for this IT position in a different company by my current boss. The interview went well! The application process is going smoothly right now too; however, there is this one field under Previous Employer that concerns me: Reason for leaving. It is a drop down bar that gives me four options:

Terminated, Promoted, Resigned, Laid off.

Underneath is a fill in the blank box labeled: Explanation.   


This requires a bit of explanation.  


At my previous job I had two write ups due to slow stocking morning truck shipments and being over some amount of money in my cash drawer. For three years until that point they only had me cashiering and training new employees around cashiering with the occasional mid stocking shift. That's around the time I received a call about this summer internship I had done one year before. I told them I'd be more than happy to return for another season. I put in my two weeks resignation with the retail company I worked for and just about one day before I was out of there, I woke up late and failed to activate my sick leave in the appropriate window of time.

Things to note:

1. I'm in Virginia (If that means anything.)
2. I previously left that retail position for the same internship I am in now and returned after the season ended. I have never been in danger of, or being fired from a position prior to this. 
3. I'm friends with a lot of the employees from my previous employer and I've heard some of the management considers what my call-out was to be a no call on show.
4. I'm 21 years old. I've only had about three jobs.
5. My current boss in my internship program has applauded my work ethic and referenced it to the person I had interviewed with for this new position. (Tier 1 IT Help desk)

My main predicament:

I want to be honest and say I was terminated, but I want to show that there was a technicality to my termination.

Perhaps making that kind of excuse would reflect poorly on my work ethic?

What should I write in the explanation box Reddit?

Thank you for your time,

Being an intermediary between two people who won’t talk has been an ongoing problem all my life and it’s something that’s profoundly fucked up my self esteem. I often feel burdened by people who I see as too fragile to deal with a situation. My dad has PTSD and my mom has some bizarre avoidant coping mechanisms; it’s a weird and codependent relationship. It’s difficult for me to form new relationships because I worry about people demanding me for more than I can give. Currently, I’m trying to find a therapist to deal with this and set some boundaries and develop healthier relationships.

Frequent visitor and lurker, but figured it was time to make a change and become a poster.  I need serious career help as I have recently graduated college, and I still, truly, do not feel like I am cut out to be a software developer.  I know posts like this pop up all the time, but I do believe my situation is unique and I am very grateful to anyone who takes the time to read this and hopefully give some career advice.  I am struggling deeply with depression over this and have no clue what to do.  

Ever since I was a young teenager, I knew I had wanted to be a software developer.  I started using tech and computers at a very young age (around age 5 or so) and quickly became obsessed.  I wanted to learn everything there was to learn about them.  In young elementary, I was given the IQ tests and was told I was ""talented"", and that my IQ was high.  I was placed in advanced math courses and was told I had a math brain.  Everyone encouraged me down the academic route.  I breezed by in elementary and middle school, getting high grades without studying.  By age 12 or so, I was getting into web development and hacking our router's settings at home, hacking the network at school, etc.  Then in highschool, I took every computer course there was to take, as well as advanced math and science courses (AP).   I had a reasonably high GPA and even finally developed some study habits.   I had strong extra curriculars, and ""pretty good"" SAT and ACT scores.  I got accepted into my university of choice, which is currently still top 25 for computer science programs. Everyone told me that this was an awesome and lucrative career path, and that I was set and ready to go to college.  I was said to be a winner, that I would succeed in life and make a very good living for myself.  Everyone was proud of me, I was one of the smartest boys in my family out of 7 male cousins (a terrible athlete, but that was my only weakness).   
In my mind, there was no other path for me.  I was going to be a techie, and a damn good one, or so I thought.

I am now a graduate from a legitimate and well regarded 4 year state university, but struggled the entire time through.  As a computer science major, I would spend 8-12 hours on assignments that my classmates would have done in 2-3 hours.  Sometimes I would code binge and spend as long as 24 hours straight or longer on a lab assignment, because it was the only way I would ever get them done.  I didn't party, I didn't drink, and barely smoked.  In fact, I didn't have much of a social life at all other than my girlfriend at the time.  All I knew was work and school.  I ended up having to go slow, 3 classes at a time, which everyone told me was was okay, that I would be okay.  Very slow.  I ended up graduating in 6 years with a 2.99 cumulative GPA overall, and just above 3 in major, not for lack of studying.  I studied harder than most anyone that I knew, at least in my major.  I had to retake 2 of my core classes, and barely passed in others.  But I made it.

I was even lucky enough to score 2 internships during college, neither was prestigious or special in any way, but it gave my resume a boost.  Neither required a technical interview.   So, so very lucky and blessed was I.  And I worked hard at those internships.  I stayed an hour or 2 late almost every night, didn't browse reddit or the internet at all, I focused and tried hard the entire time, skipping lunch and drinking coffee, etc.  The end result of both, my code and what I contributed wasn't amazing by any stretch, but hey, I did good enough to put them on my resume and for references.  At least they knew I wasn't a slacker who didn't try at all, like many of my peers said they did with their internships.

I thought I had done EVERYTHING right in my life so far.  I graduated, got a professional resume created, and began applying for jobs.  And today, I get plenty of calls back from recruiters, so my resume is not an issue.  My resume APPEARS competitive.

**\*\*The issue is straight simple.  I (still) suck at coding.\*\***

Everyone tells me this is a ""candidate market"", and that companies are struggling to find talented CS grads from real 4 years and not bootcamps, or for profits colleges.  Well, that sounds great for me, except the talented part.  Talented, unfortunately I am not.

Yesterday, I spent no less than 10 hours on coding a leetcode medium, AFTER looking at a solution.  You read that correctly, 10 hours.  That's how long it took me to get something that compiled correctly.  (The problem name was number of islands, for those curious.)  My end solution is well commented, perfectly indented and tabbed, all the variable names are perfect.  Anything and everything I could make better for it without my base intelligence, and just hard work, is perfect.  Pristine looking code.  However, my solution itself is crude and only ran in 160 milliseconds, a terrible efficiency.

Today, I struggled with coding a simple linked list reversal earlier today.  Again, due to my hard work I could instantly get all of the ""template"" code down easily, just from my memory and hard work studying other linked list coding problems.   
 I was instantly able to declaring the variables I knew it would need, the function and input, I knew it must iterate over the list in a loop and was even able to figure out the condition for the loop, and what function would return.  

`LinkedListReversal(Node node) {`

`Node current = node;`

`Node prev = null;`

`Node next = null;`

`while(current != null) {`

`//No idea yet, but I'll get it.  I got all the template stuff that will help me develop the logic, right?.`

`}`

`return newNode;`

`}`

Then came the actual core logic for the while loop.  For the life of me, I could NOT figure this out.  I glanced at a solution, and then even drew it out by hand 5 times on pieces of paper, tracing various inputs.  Then I put the solution away.  I still could NOT figure out the core logic of the code.  I was simply not smart enough to figure it out.  A simple linked list reversal.  4 lines of code.  I had to glance at the solution again, and write it out line by line.  

`LinkedListReversal(Node node) {`

`Node current = node;`

`Node prev = null;`

`Node next = null;`

`while(current != null) {`

`next =` [`current.next`](https://current.next)`;`

`current.next = prev;`

`prev =` [`curr`](https://current.next)`ent;`

`current = next;`

`}`

`return newNode;`

`}`

All I achieved doing was simply memorizing the answer by looking at a solution, and tryharding my best to understand it.  But to be perfectly honest, I still don't understand it, and even now I bet if I traced it again I would stumble with my understanding of it.   Even as I typed this out, I had to glance over at my solution because I couldn't remember it, and couldn't develop it on the fly.   I'm sure that's hard to imagine for the more talented, but it's true.  My brain simply will not accept learning why it works, even after tracing it multiple multiple times out, writing it out, etc.   And this is ranked as an easy problem on HackerRank.

I'd prefer to spare the nasty details of what has happened on the technical portion of every technical interview I have been to over the last 1-2 months as it is simply too depressing to type it out.  Needless to say I haven't found anything yet and usually fail miserably at them, even when they are multiple choice questions and not coding questions I often bomb.

**Tl;dr:** I spent 6 years to get my degree, struggled the entire time, and now struggle with technical interviews and finding software roles, easy and medium LeetCode problems.  Not just struggle, but spend 4-5 times as much time as my peers on the same problem.  I truly don't feel smart enough for this career path, and not sure what my options are.  Living at home is not an option, I just need a job that can pay at least $1000 a month, or I'm sunk to living in my uninsured car in 4 months from now.   I'm wondering if there are any other career options for me at this point, or I should continue beating my head against the wall in development, maybe possibly on the hopes of finding the miracle of an entry-level position that won't HackerRank test me with a medium or hard question.  Maybe I should switch to a different role in tech, but I have no experience in anything but development.  I'd like to know about my options there, is QA perhaps an option?  Bills are coming, I have 4 months to find a job from my current savings.  No clue what to do, feeling hopeless and depressed.  I essentially wasted 6 years of my life and thousands of dollars for nothing, I have no friends after losing contact from spending so much time in school studying, horridly out of shape from so much sedentary time, no money I have literally $2 a day for food, etc.  I thought college was the ticket to a better future, but it's just not the case for me.  Need honest and sincere career advice about what my best options would be.  Coding is all I know and all I have from the age of about 12 onward, and yet I still suck at it."

You guys are the best , no need to help us noobs get somewhere but it's done everyday here.  Makes me proud and extremely grateful  that I am pursuing, at the least,  a related field of study.  It will be a few years but I will pass the help on when I have some level of proficiency/experience.

Hello All , 

I know this is an extremely broad and probably misguided question.  It is a reflection of my lack of knowledge or insight into this field which is new to me.

I am computer science major and very interested in Cyber-Security.   So I got an internship with a Sysadmin , some certifications (CompTIA Net+ , hopefully Redhat SysAdmin level 1 by end of August) but many of my peers, who are also interested in cyber-security regard these efforts as a waste of time which I find extremely confusing.

I understand Cybersecurity , like ""Computer Science"" is an umbrella term which includes so many things but in my mind I thought one could not possibly separate this from network expertise.  It just seemed to me that one sort of lead to the other.

If any one gets a moments I would really appreciate any input or advise regarding this issue.  Is understanding Linux, doing low-level SysAdmin work and setting up virtual networks for research etc.  helpful towards contributions of Cybersecurity?  

What sorts of contributions can someone make without this understanding?  Would they not be limited without a better understanding of networks?

Apologies for the kind of basic and unfocused question.  I just want to make sure I'm using my time in a helpful way.  I know you don't have enough detail to make that determination but am just wondering if I am going about my education the wrong way.

Please let me know if I can add any information which would help and thanks for reading this.

Hopefully, I can get this subreddit's thoughts on my situation and whatnot.

So I am a 22 year old college graduate, with a BSIT (graduated this May 2018), no minors. During my college days, I had 2 summer internships, one which was essentially busy work and the other working as an internal Operations IT Helpdesk Team Member. I didn't really involve myself much in college (I honestly didn't like the dorm situation I had, and I was mostly homesick), thus I spent most of my time attending classes and basically holing up inside my dorm room with league of legends/drawing.

I can't say that I am super-interested with IT, like I don't actively involve myself within the industry. The reason I mostly took this degree was because when I was a simple freshman, my parents were adamant on my getting a degree related to engineering or computers cause they thought it would equate to a good-paying job. However, as my college years dragged on, I slowly began to get worried that I couldn't achieve anything within the IT industry. I didn't hate my degree, but I couldn't say that I was interested either. Sure I used my laptop a lot, but I mostly use it to draw or play games. The most technical thing I personally ever did with computers was removing viruses from my parent's laptops when they contract them. Worse is that some of my senior classes had some poor instructors who basically gave out A's and open book tests all the time, making it so that I didn't really get a good feel of the industry.

Fast-forward to my current situation now, I am about 2 months into my unemployment time. About a month ago, I started applying to several IT jobs such as Heldesk techs, System Admins, Network Engineers, all the while playing league or talking to friends. I have a job interview lined up on monday, which I am nervous about. However, I can't really envision my future.

Since I'm not interested in IT, I feel really inept within the IT crowd and I can't help but feel like I won't be able to meet expectations if I am hired. Like what if they ask some menial question that most IT people should know, but I don't and make myself look like a buffoon? Is my lack of knowledge why companies aren't calling for an interview? 

Am I doing alright for a 22 year old College graduate who isn't interested in the jobs that he is applying for? Is being unemployed for 2 months normal for College Grads?

**TL;DR:** Got a degree in an industry that I'm not interested in with urging from parents, trying to apply to jobs within the same industry with only about 3 months of IT experience, starting to feel inept comparing myself to other IT people. Am I doing ok?

Sorry if this post is long-winded or inappropriate for this sub.

I am in the most literal sense a greenhorn at both IT and job hunting."

I finished my first build last Sunday, and I wanna talk about my experience with it. Call it motivation for any of you yet to start/complete your build!

I recently watched a video of a haphazard intern completing a speed build in under half an hour. I should mention his opponent, who won, was blindfolded. So I figured if *I* took my time, I could complete my build in 3 hours. Y'know, to account for errors. Of course I'd come to laugh at how naive that was, but I felt prepared. I read blogs and articles every day after work for two weeks, researching and deciding on components. I watched tutorials, made pages of notes and step-by-step instructions. I visited Quora and of course, here. Then all the parts arrived...

...20 hours, one short sleep and a few meditation sessions later, I diagnosed that my second RAM stick was DOA, and the monitor needed a new cable. In 48 hours the replacement RAM would arrive, and I could test my theory. All it needed was a second stick.

And then it arrived. The feeling when I flipped the switch on and it finally POSTed was amazing. I don't ever think I'll buy a pc again after this.

Keep going, be patient, and just do it. It's a great sense of accomplishment, and I saved hella money too!"

The best way to get there is by public transportation, so I was wondering if there was any way for an incoming freshman to buy this ([http://transportation.ucsd.edu/alternatives/transit/summer-pass.html](http://transportation.ucsd.edu/alternatives/transit/summer-pass.html)) since its the best deal. I don't yet have a student id, but would the career services portal be able to help or should I contact admission or..?

tl;dr: incoming freshman confused who to ask to get a bus pass for the summer"
8wqoaf,2,2018-07-07,"Need to relocate for personal reasons, but want to stay on at current company. How can I ask to work remotely",entango159,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8wqoaf/need_to_relocate_for_personal_reasons_but_want_to/,"I have done some searching on here and haven't seen much great information/opinions on the topic, so I figured I would post again.

Due to some family matters, my wife and I need to relocate back to our home city and help take care of her parents. It also will put me closer to my family again which is a great bonus. Personally, this is a great decision for us as we don't have a ton of support structure out here and want to start a family within a few years.

However, I work at a pretty large tech firm and have for just over 8 years including internships (5 years full time) all with the same team. Over the past year or so I have had some major growth in my career taking on new and challenging things. In my start-of-2018 and mid-year reviews, my manager has stressed that I am a key contributor and a valuable part of his team, and the business as a whole. I have been able to start branching out and working on company level initiatives and my name is starting to be recognized in some pockets outside of my immediate business. I feel that I am in a great position where I have growth ahead if I could stay on in my current role.

The big issue is that *typically* my company does not do remote/ distance employment unless you are  specifically in the field for support or sales. I am in development and would prefer to remain doing so. Remote employees are not unheard of, but it seems as though it is a legacy thing from past policies. There is one colleague who works from a home office but has been with the company for 30+ years. The other anecdote of a similar situation as mine, was that an employee had to move for personal reasons, but was basically told after a year to resign...

Really, I have no real issues with looking for a new job, but it my current one is starting to be very lucrative as well. Having some stability through the move would be great, as my wife would be looking for a new job as well. 

As I type this out, I am seeing that I really should just talk to my manager and discuss the situation with him. I could see him as well as a few levels of management up that i know personally would be fine with this, but corporate would likely shoot it down. There really is no risk of them saying ""well you are planning on leaving, so we will take this as your resignation, pack your things"",  so I am not worried about that. I suppose the earlier I broach the subject the earlier I can start looking elsewhere if necessary. 

Sorry for the rant, I realize there isn't much of a question here, so I will pose a few directly:

1. If you had no repercussions of asking to work remotely/in a new city, Is 3 months too early? I have heard them having quick response rates on this sort of thing.
2. Would you recommend I search/apply in my new city before I hear back from my current company?
3. Is 3 months too long for looking for a job in a new city? i.e. apply today, can't start until November.

Thanks for any of your thoughts."

8wr9xv,2297,2018-07-07,What I would do differently if I was learning to program again,stokkid,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8wr9xv/what_i_would_do_differently_if_i_was_learning_to/,"Hi Reddit, I am a software engineer that taught myself. Recently I had a chance to interview and mentor some interns at my workplace and doing so made me think about what I did when I was in their shoes many years ago.

I would like to share what I would do if I went back in time and were learning to program again.

# Do not expect yourself to know it all

I noticed that learners of programming set a very high bar for themselves. While aspiring to the higher standard can be motivating, it often backfires because such mentality often punishes you for not knowing, or puts you in a self-denial in order to appear smarter than you really are in the eyes of others.

For instance, during the interview process, many candidates were constantly name dropping complicated terms or concepts that they did not really understand and had very little to do with the question asked. When asked to write a pseudocode using a for-lop, ""I have been watching C videos and wonder if I can use pointer reference for that"" does not really demonstrate your skills.

It is important to recognize that nobody expects you to know everything. Even experienced engineers often do not know shit, if you talked to them for a while, and they are okay with that. In my beginner years I was also conscious of what I did not know and I could clearly sense the same vibe from the interns. If I went back in time, I would start by being absolutely non-apologetic about things I did not know and just saying ""I don't know.""

# Do not go to bootcamps

Many of the intern candidates were graduating from so-called coding bootcamps often costing thousands of dollars, and that was absolutely crazy to me. First of all, knowledge is free and you do not need to pay hefty sums of money to so-called mentors to learn to program. You can go to GitHub, clone a repository that interests you, and study how it works and imitate other experienced programmer's style and it's all free.

At least that is how I learned, and it's effective because copying is the best way to learn. For example I copied famous guitarists for seven years straight before I could write a shitty original and coding is no different; I think many of us expect to get better ASAP by throwing money at the problem and such instant gratification does not pay off.

Secondly, most bootcamp attendees I interviewed all sounded exactly the same. When asked to describe a project they were proud of working on, 9 out of 10 the answers were something along the lines of ""this market place app we built in class using Rails"" or ""this book review app we built in class with React.""

The thing is, you do not need to pay thousands of dollars to build those shitty apps. You can build shitty apps yourself for free. I am speaking from personal experience because I learned by building shitty stuff that mostly made zero sense (you can still see some of them in my github [https://github.com/sungwoncho](https://github.com/sungwoncho)). At least doing so gives you some originality and saves you money.

# Write down what you learn

This is the biggest mistake I made that I would change if I can go back in time. A lot of people will tell you to ""get your hands dirty"" to improve. But in my opinion the more important thing is to remember what you learn. How many tutorials and articles have you consumed recently, and how many lines of code have you churned out? And from those endeavors, how much knowledge did you actually retain? Unless you keep a note or a journal, give it some months and you will forget the most, like I did time and again.

When you learn a concept (language feature, algorithm, data structure, ...), write it down in your own words. Regularly go back to your journal and refresh your memory. I am not a beginner anymore, but I still do it and even wrote an article about it ([https://dnote.io/blog/writing-everything-i-learn-coding-for-a-month/](https://dnote.io/blog/writing-everything-i-learn-coding-for-a-month/)).

The thing is it's a good habit to have because you will be learning forever if you choose to code professionally. And those that can learn more effectively can really set themselves apart from the flock.

# Build shitty stuff that works

Some interns that we ended up hiring stood out in that they actually shipped working software on their own. I know a plenty of experienced engineers with academic background that have never shipped a program that does something by themselves. Therefore when you go through such journey as beginner you can immediately set yourself ahead of most engineers. And by continually putting in hours, you will come to a better understanding of how software works.

The part I struggled when I was trying to ship as a beginner was the fact that my code was shit. I just could not come to terms with it especially when hosting my code publicly. If I could go back, I would tell myself that nobody really cares about your code because everyone's busy with their own stuff, and that I need not be self-conscious about how bad or good my code might be.

Remember that most master artists such as Picasso or Warhol were insanely prolific. A large portion of their works are not neither well-known or critically acclaimed. I'd like to think that, by producing more and more, they were able to develop their own style and programming is no different.

# Hope it helped

I decided to share this opinion at the risk of sounding self-aggrandizing or too pedagogical. After all, these are some things that I'd like to tell myself in the past.

There are more to be said, but I am hesitant to write more because the best advice beginners can get is the advice they did not get because they were too busy shipping. But there were some things to be said. Sadly these cannot help my past self, but I'd be happy if they helped someone here and now."
8wra7j,0,2018-07-07,3s on AP Exams as a CS Major. Should I say goodbye to my dreams?,throwaway8953207,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8wra7j/3s_on_ap_exams_as_a_cs_major_should_i_say_goodbye/,"Well, I'm another part of the ""low ap score"" crowd and the results this year have hit me hard. I had ambitions of potentially going to top CS schools like UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, CMU,  etc., but I'm devastated by the fact that I might just have to let those dreams go. I'm fairly confident in the rest of my college app; it's just AP scores weighing me down and I truly worry that they will be my downfall. I don't believe that they're a true representation of my abilities and they're an embarrassment for me. I would have a hard time finding something I'm more ashamed of.   

Here's the run-down:

* 10th: World History (5), French (5), Computer Science Principles (5), **Physics 1 (3)**
* 11th (projected): U.S. History (5), **Computer Science A (3), Physics 2 (3),** Calc AB (5)
* 12th (planned): U.S. Gov, Chem, English Lit, Calc BC, Human Geo

It's the ones in bold that I'm afraid of. I honestly believe that the rest of my app is relatively competitive for CS and gives me a decent shot at the schools I mentioned. As a brief overview, I have a 4.67 UC GPA/4.0 UW, 1530 SAT, for subject tests I have 800 Math II, 800 Physics, and 780 French. ECs include a CS internship at local community college (and a few math courses alongside that),  ISEF,  founding/leading a club for 3+ years to teach code, along with some local STEM competitions. In order to compensate for the APCS score, I intend on going for the Java Programmer I Certification from Oracle, which is roughly equivalent in breadth to the AP Exam. Also, I hope that the 800 on Physics somewhat makes up for the AP score.

I really do apologize if the post might have come off as a bit overbearing, but I have heard many times that ""colleges don't look at AP scores,"" which I frankly have trouble believing with regards to prestigious colleges. I would sincerely appreciate any realistic advice that might pertain to this kind of situation in the hopes of helping both myself and the many others who I'm sure have similar concerns."

8ws10s,0,2018-07-07,Am I overreacting or is my boss very disrespectful?,notnicewhaturdoing,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/8ws10s/am_i_overreacting_or_is_my_boss_very_disrespectful/,"This is more of a vent but I'm nearing the end of my 12-month internship (1 month and 10 days to go) and yesterday I've had an incident which really made me question myself and my manager. Long story short: we have an office stereo (a device called Sonos) on which we could all put songs as part of a queue. A couple of weeks ago some people complained that they've been hearing the same songs every day and that some of them were work inappropriate (had explicit lyrics). It's a casual office for the most part so only a few people raised complaints about the hip-hop music (I only put ""clean"" songs on).
 
Since there are 5 tables in our office, the manager changed the queue system after a vote with a 1 table per day system. As a small sidenote: The Wednesday table has 3 people on it, the Thursday one has 8 and the Friday one (mine) has 6. A lot of people also don't use the Sonos app to put music on.

Last week I've had some issues when someone at my table kept deleting my songs from the long playlist we had on, as well as skip one repeatedly because ""everyone's moaning about it"". It was hip-hop/trap music nobody complained about for months (the idea of this new system is, according to my manager, to give ""democracy"" and let everyone have their music for a day). 

Yesterday someone kept deleting one of my songs for about 5 times in total because it had the Spotify explicit tag, even if it had no explicit lyrics whatsoever (Spotify gives whole albums that tag sometimes). In addition to that, when I came in at 9, I found that the two people who came in at 8 put *fifty* songs on. I complained about it and my boss eventually said that we could all put five songs on, then we can shuffle the whole playlist.

I did that, however, pretty angry as I was, I sent her an e-mail (which other people said was completely reasonable and polite) asking her to allow me to put music on Wednesday instead, citing the number differences between tables, the fact that people removed my songs and the honest truth that I have different music taste than everyone else (it's usually a mash of '80s &amp; '90 pop and mall indie). She replied back to me saying that she's sorry because *she wants the people on Wednesday to have their share* and that she also has a unique music taste (imo maybe, but not as divisive) and to let her know if the skipping/deleting happens again. I replied back, just as respectfully, telling her that giving everyone an equal chance is a great idea, but that this would be better for them and me as well, considering that they won't have to hear my music and that the numbers will be more even, highlighting again the 6&gt;3 scenario.

I got no reply the whole day and she went on as if nothing had happened.

Needless to say, I was pretty angry the whole day. After the shuffle thing stopped, one guy (or him and someone else) put like 15 songs in a row and no one batted an eye. I put on 3 at the end and all of a sudden I see someone trying to put songs between them forcefully and repeatedly. It was obviously my manager since she went ""don't we have shuffle anymore?"" and I said that no, we didn't. Ten minutes later we switched to the football game since Uruguay was playing and my manager complained and gave my co-worker who put it on a funny look, saying that it was ""our day to put music"".

I have 5 holiday days left and this made me decide to book them all on Friday instead of Monday. Am I overreacting? Is my boss actually [expletive]? I really don't understand how someone can  be so petty about this. For a bit of backstory - she has a history of complaining whenever she doesn't like a song, calling it ""bad music"" and embarrassing whoever put it on or skipping it. She's also the kind of person who goes on about ""good music"" and ""praises"" those who listen to her definition of that. I avoid these kind of conversations, even if I can't stand what's on the radio most of the time, because as long as it makes them happy, I'm happy. 

TL;DR - boss tries to set up a ""democracy"" at work regarding the music queue and almost completely ignores my qualms about it and how it's making me unhappy during my last month at work."

8wtwk8,2,2018-07-07,Is private College worth going into debt for??,FalloutSeeker,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8wtwk8/is_private_college_worth_going_into_debt_for/,"Hello! So, I was accepted to a private University several months ago. I just wanted to know if it was worth the debt.

This year, I had to take $5,500 out of Federal loans, and $12,000 out of parent PLUS loans at an interest rate of 7%. This would be a yearly occurrence. Now, I am taking computer science as my major. I am definitely staying my first year, but I just wanted to know if I should maybe go to a more affordable public University next year? I do have secured jobs lined up that allow $12-$14 an hour at around 25-35 hours a week, plus a $16 an hour job on the weekends if my manager wants me to attend if I have the option. I just wanted to know if it is feasible to save up and budget, as well as look for scholarships and grants (my school service is helping me because they have a first generation student support services.) I just wanted to know if it would be logical to save up and apply like crazy for scholarships, or if I should step out next year to another school...

I am being offered a steady internship if I stay the second year in software engineering. This is what I'm also debating."

Without knowing their background I just got a feeling that these are competent people who know their work properly.

When I got to actually know them that feeling was confirmed as they were proven to be professionals. They always act in a professional manner, if they do not know something they clearly say so and might even suggest where you can get the info, they also answer any questions in their field properly without straying too far or just inserting their own experience egotistically.

These 3 were:

1-A university lecturer in  my university's Computer Science department. I found out later that he has many years of experience as a developer.

2-A lecturer in a vocational academy who taught a Microsoft certification course. He also has 10+ years of experience in computer engineering and IT and is a cybersecurity expert.

3-The head of IT in the company where I intern now. This guy did his bachelors, masters and PHD in 3 different fields and has 20+ years of experience.   

So can years of effort, experience and competence actually make a man/woman exude a feel of professionalism or is this just an illusion. How do you achieve such a thing."

I graduated from my MSc (computer science) from a top Canadian university in early 2017, and have been trying and failing to get a permanent job. I've applied for over 100 jobs, but I don’t even get interviews. I finally got a student co-op through a connection, so I’m doing a job usually taken by undergrads after their second year, and it’s going to end soon, and I’m going to go back to my small town and live in my parents’ house. Hopefully I’ll be able to get a job as a cashier or something to have some extra cash. It would be nice if I could freelance, but I’m not sure how I’ll get clients. The stats:

CS undergrad from a well-respected Canadian university, 3.8 GPA, no internships

MSc from same university, software project was published and is in use, but isn’t something that anyone is hiring for, or that I’d really want to do, or have any connections to do

No personal projects, blogs, websites, or portfolios.

Languages: I’m not much of a programmer, I’m good at python, but it’s been a long time since I’ve coded in C++ or c#.

One of my major problems is that I don’t really know what type of job I want to do, or am really qualified for. I’m good with neural networks, but I’m not otherwise strong on statistics enough to be a data scientist (also don’t have a PhD and years of experience). In the past I’ve avoided back end development because I’m hilariously terrible at using computers and getting environments set up and working.

I'm currently an rising university senior majoring in computer science and I gotta say that I still have no idea what I'm doing . I honestly just feel so lost. My freshman and sophomore year grades weren't very good at all and now that I've found myself dramatically improving since I feel like all that progress means nothing because of how much those previous grades are weighing me down. My current GPA is approximately 2.57 and I know that it's impossible to raise that up to a 3.0 at this point. I've been looking for internships and the like in my field but haven't found any such luck. I'm just panicked and just don't know what I'm gonna do with my future.

And I'm leaving to SCU (6 hours away) this fall but now I'm seriously rethinking it because of how hard my mom's been taking our family's incompleteness.  

To add on to that, SCU isn't something that I'd have trouble giving up, but honestly I'd feel the same about any college that isn't less than 1 hour away from my family.  So I guess I'm also scared to leave home.  Recently, I've been picturing myself going to community college for a year and then transferring to USC, which is way closer to my fam. and even closer to my grandma, which is a huge bonus since she might be a potential dorming option (obviously for way cheaper).  Since my mom constantly talks to and visits my grandma and my grandma always wants to see me and my brother, this potential future situation would be perfect.

Also, I want to be able to help my brother on his hw while at home, and it would be harder to do that as effectively through Skype.  My family also has a lot of silly traditions that I don't want to leave behind.  

But my concerns are: I don't get into USC - which is a pretty big downer but at least I'd transfer to a college closer to my family like UCI (which I would have guaranteed admission for because of the TAG program) - I start getting feelings of regret for not going to my far away college and starting ahead, since I have lots of AP's, which a college like USC wouldn't even look at.  Since USC is a rather transfer-friendly private, I'm not too worried about making friends.  

So all in all, it boils down to me wanting to stay close (perhaps too close) to my family, but at the same time not wanting to make a bad decision.  So at the moment I am as on the fence about this as anybody could be, and I feel like I'm at the fork in the road of my life.  I hope you guys can provide some insight to help me make a decision.

We'd never been with anyone else and we were so fucking perfect together. 
 
To make a very, very long and wonderful story short, I forced myself on her, sort of, a couple months ago and ruined it all. She had recently been very into being tied up, used, and forced, which was something I was always hesitant to try because I'm not at all a violent person. And by forced I just mean licking and continuing when she says no, not physically harmful. So she was into this at the time... And one night I got carried away and continued when she clearly didn't want to because fuck knows why. 
 
I cried along with her that night because I felt terrible. Shortly after, we took a month trip to Europe and it wasn't the right place to reconnect. Too much new, not enough catching up where we needed to. 
 
We got back home and I had to go out of state for 2 months for a summer internship. No problem, we'd done long distance tons of times, for 2 years at one point. She told me we were fine, we were talking as normal. 
 
I can't keep telling the rest of this same damn story... She left me through a fucking text message after eight and a half years of being happy together. As soon as she did, I begged her to just talk to me about what was wrong. Nothing. She's ignored me for an entire month. So I drove back home to see her a couple weeks ago, 12 hour drive, and she wouldn't hear anything I had to say. Just looked at me without a tear in her eyes, and told me she doesn't love me or care about what I have to say. After almost half of our lives together, that's my closure. Nothing. 
 
What the fuck is the point of going through this miserable existence if the person I care about more than anything can instantly flip a switch and not care if I'm alive anymore? 
 
So now I get to be alone up in another state, away from any friends or family, and suffer this hell. I'm just going to save what I make and send it to her so she can have some comfort while she finds a job and then stop this shitty pain. I love this girl and I believe she's just poorly handling stress or something, but she literally won't even reply to me. "

8wwjxd,23,2018-07-07,Suddenly don't think I want the career I've been leading towards for years. Passion/motivation issues.,iammaxhailme,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/8wwjxd/suddenly_dont_think_i_want_the_career_ive_been/,"tl;dr: only ever had a mild interest in anything that would be useful for a career, followed those mildly interesting subjects (chemistry, later refined to computational chemistry theory) to halfway through a PhD before realizing that I just don't have enough passion to be at that high of a level, almost certainly leaving the PhD before completing it, now I have no idea what I want to do with my life because the only things I enjoy more than a mild amount are my hobbies

Background: US native. 26, male. Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a rant. 

In high school, the classes I did best in, and also somewhat enjoyed, were math and science. So when I went to college, I double majored in chemistry and applied math. Because I sorta liked them, and did well in them without too much effort. I never really had to push myself too hard in these subjects in college. Sure I wasn't getting A's, but I was satisfied enough to get B's and B+'s without spending much time studying. I did undergrad research because you were supposed to. I got an internship because you were supposed to. The internship was at a government environmental chem lab. 

After graduating, I got trapped in the ""you need a job but have no experience, but entry level jobs won't hire people without experience"" loop. I looked for an entry level job for slightly over a year without being able to get any offers except shitty 6 month contracts (which now I realize I should have accepted and used to get a permanent position later). I didn't, though, so I did the only thing I could... go to get a PhD. 

I'm ending my 3rd year in the PhD. It's been going badly, my research has gone nowhere. The first year was great because its just classes. The second year was okay because I was just learning background. However after that, you get into the original research phase and I hit a brick wall in terms of motivation and ability to push myself to focus. I sort of liked the topic in my lab, but not a ton. And I've grown to realize that you really need to like your PhD subject a ton to force yourself to do it. I tried to find my niche and find a topic for my research, but it didn't go anywhere. None of the side projects for my prof's research led to anything. 

I probably would continued to complacently get nowhere despite an insane amount of anxiety over it, except my prof (who never really helped me with research much and didn't seem to care) told me to change to a different group. Partially this is because of my lack of progress but also he's leaving the university for a better one anyway (even though he put it all on me...). That was about 5 weeks ago. Since then I've been basically having a mental breakdown about what I'm going to do going forwards. I don't think I'm going to change to another PhD group, instead I'm going to leave with a master's in chemistry. That's not what bothers me. Instead, I just don't know what I want to do long-term.

My family is being supportive. There's nothing shabby about a master's. However they are all really ambitious people and they seem to keep trying to comfort me with things like ""don't worry, you'll find what you love to do, and then you'll be happy working at it!"". But I know what I love to do. I love to do a LITTLE work to make me feel useful, and then sit around for 6 hours playing video games or go hiking or cook or whatever. It's hard to realize that you have ""interests"" in what you thought you job would be, but no actual ambition. I like what I was studying, but after 4 years of college in it and 3 years of serious research, I realize that I don't love it enough to make myself work hard enough to be an actual scientist. I always thought I would end up being a research scientist, because, well, I don't know why. It's just what I was good at in school, and it seemed interesting enough that I didn't really consider anything else. But I have now realized that's not enough. 

While I didn't get any publications in grad school, and almost certainly won't due to my prof's situation, I did get some skills. I learned a lot of computer skills; bash, linux, python, C++, but all at a relatively surface level. I found myself retreating to those tasks for ""fun"" (not exactly fun, but they were, at least, satisfying to do) after hitting my head against the wall trying to read research papers for hours. I'm thinking of trying to make a career out of those things... but that would basically be abandoning all the chemistry I've spent like 8 years studying. Part of me thinks ""who cares? You didn't really love it anyway"". Another part of me thinks ""you do have a genuine interest in the topic, even if you didn't like doing original research"". I do know firsthand that the non-PhD chemistry job market is pretty terrible, though. 

Also, this should probably be at the top, but I had severe ADHD as a child &amp; adolescent, but sort of coped with it until about 2 years ago. The coping was mostly that nothing in high school or college or the 1st year of grad school was very hard, so I didn't really need to focus. But in research? And probably in a real job? You gotta have LASER FOCUS BRO!!!! or so all the tryhards in my PhD program say, who work 55-60 hour weeks every single week and are seemingly happy about it.

Anyway... well, I guess I Need some fucking zoloft or something. Or ritalin, even though it gave me awful side effects when I was 12."

I know that there are a lot of these types of posts, I've been sitting on this sub for a few months now, I want to apologize in advance for adding to that list. 

I graduated this year with a B.S. in Computer Science from a University of California. I finished with an above 3.0 GPA. I moved back home and live in the Los Angeles area now. 

I did not take any internships during my time as an undergrad so I have no experience outside of the projects in school. I also don't know anyone in the industry. I've been applying for Entry Level SWE positions recently with no calls back. I've taken a lot of the advice posted on this sub. I have a Linkedin and a GitHub. I re-did my resume. I've been doing coding challenges from Leetcode, Codewars, and Daily Coding Problem (some take more time than others, but they are all do-able). I code in my free time working on side projects because I am truly passionate about coding. I try to learn new technologies I am interested in.

I am set on this as my career path. I want to get a master's degree. I did not decide this soon enough to attend this fall, but I am planning on applying for the fall of next year.

I feel very lost at this stage in my career. I didn't think a job would come easy, however, I am starting to get discouraged at the lack of any response besides rejection. I understand that my resume looks like just about everyone else I graduated with and I want to make it stand out. I just don't know what I should do in the meantime before I attend Grad School. I don't want to make a wrong move because I feel like this is a very important stage in my career. I feel like the sooner I get experience the better off I will be, but at the same time I know I won't get a chance to dedicate myself to whatever project I like once I am employed.

Should I try to apply to startups because I am having no luck applying to larger companies? Should I try to get an internship even though I've graduated? Should I just stay focused on my coding projects on the side? 

I am really just looking for some guidance. I feel like my undergraduate career failed to prepare me for this and I do not know what path is the best option. Any advice is appreciated."

I'm a fresh ME grad with an offer at a consumer electronics startup I interned at. It's in the industry I want, in the city I want, and I know most of the people there. It would be fun and easy to get back into it. However, I am concerned not only with unpredictable life of a startup, but the resources for me to learn. There are only a couple of MEs to help mentor me. I feel like a startup is where you cash in on your skills, not where you go to develop them, especially for a new grad. I am comfortable learning technical knowledge on my own, but don't want to develop bad habits. If my only experience not as an intern is a failed startup, I'm afraid it will negatively affect my ability to be hired elsewhere.

Consumer electronics is a tough industry to break into, but I've had a few internships there so I may be able to get an offer at a company with more foundational knowledge, but no luck so far. Many people have told me to start somewhere bigger so I can learn a lot from others.

Should I be happy enough as a new grad that I even have an offer at all and accept it and get to learning? Does your first job out of school have a large impact on your ability to move industries?"
8wybes,1,2018-07-07,What path should I take?,SkillToKill34,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8wybes/what_path_should_i_take/,"So some backstory:  


I graduated from a top school in economics, but I never really knew what I wanted to do, and was definitely not proactive in searching for internships etc. Truthfully I actually planned on joining the military but that's another story.

Anyways, I graduated and didn't have a job so I moved in with my parents and eventually got a job like 30 minutes away. My title officially is Marketing Analyst, but because it is a relatively small/medium sized company, there isn't much analysis that needs doing, so I also inherited event/project management duties (which I'm not too fond of but I make the most of). I'm not paid very much (\~$37K), but I also had no professional work experience, so I'm not surprised. I do expect to get a decent raise after a year, as is the custom at this company. 

So what's the issue? Well I am really happy that I don't have to pay for rent and the most of my food, so I can contribute the majority of my income towards paying off loans and building up 401Ks/IRAs. I also have plenty of money for travelling I guess.

The problem is, I am dying of boredom and feel like I'm missing out on life in my youth. My parents live in a place I didn't grow up (so I have no friends nearby), it's very suburban, and there are really only old people around (Palm Beach County, FL). I also feel like what I'm doing at work, for the most part, doesn't prepare me to become a better analyst.

So just find another job after a year of experience and move right?

Well...

My job is very relaxed, I have little to no stress, I'm close to upper management (yay references), and I have a ton of free time. With this free time I've taken up learning skills such as VBA/SQL and am actively learning Python, and eventually R. All of these are important skills for a Data Analyst/Scienctist, which is the career path I want to pursue. I very much doubt I would have this time while living/working anywhere else. 

Also, there is a University right next to my job that is offering a 30-credit Certificate in Statistics, which my job will pay half of. I will also be able to attend classes during workhours (as long as it's reasonable like 1hr). Learning more Stats will qualify me for the even better Analyst positions with much more interesting work and higher salary. 

If I stay here for a total of 3 years, I could cut my loans by 75&amp;#37; and have much more quantitative ability, as well as have all the technical computer skills for being an analyst.

Should I hold out for a couple years? Or jump ship after a year of experience and go somewhere where there are more people my age?"

For some background: I graduated May 2017 with a degree in Chemical Engineering from a well-known school with a 3.7 GPA. My resume and past internships have been mainly in R&amp;D, and I currently work in the Healthcare IT field in a tech support-like role and have been working for almost a year now.

I've been having some thoughts about going back to get my Masters for many reasons, including the fact that I feel like I still have a lot to learn, and that I want to switch career fields. However, I'm torn between deciding what program I should get my Masters in. Ironically, I'm not looking to get a Masters in Chemical Engineering, as talking to many in the field have led me to believe that there is no real advantage (industry-wise) on getting a Masters vs. Bachelors when it comes to Chemical Engineering. Unfortunately my employer doesn't help pay for anything to do with a Masters, so everything will have to be out of pocket for me.

I'm also torn on getting a PhD as well...my main experience in internships have been in research and development, and I did a good amount of research in undergrad, but my main goal of getting a PhD would be to teach, since I loved being an instructional assistant while doing my undergrad.

With regards to my Masters, I'm interested in Supply Chain/Optimization and Data Science, but also Food Engineering/Food Science. To be honest though, there are a ton of things I'm interested in, but I've narrowed it down slightly to the broad fields of optimization (I like making things more efficient), data science (since coding and doing things that make sense out of a lot of data is pretty cool to me), and food science (my hobby is with cooking and food in general). 

Sorry for the long post, but for those who were torn between Masters/PhD and what to get a Masters in, how did you decide to go back to school, what subject to study, and which degree you want to pursue? I'm just overall torn between what I want to do in the future and what seems feasible for me now.

Thanks for the advice! :) "
8wzoav,4054,2018-07-08,There's a Disease Killing People in This Town,FoolishWhim,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8wzoav/theres_a_disease_killing_people_in_this_town/,"I noticed it about three months ago. 

Three of my professors had canceled their lectures for the week. Each email I received varied, but they all had the same underlying reason for cancelation. The professors had fallen ill and were in the hospital for treatment. 

Though I knew it was odd that all three of the professors had succumbed to some mystery sickness within the same week, I gave it little to no thought after the fact. I am a college student after all. This just meant I had more time to sleep and dick off. 

When the following week arrived and those professors were still in the hospital, I became more concerned. When word got around that more people had caught this mystery bug, my concern shifted to alarm. 

There were professors and students all over campus who were now hospitalized. No one knew what sickness had befallen them, just that they were gone. Apparently there were a few people who tried to go to the hospitals to visit and they were turned away. Rumors of quarantine were thrown around campus.

The students and faculty that remained tried to continue on with the semester, they wanted to keep things as normal as possible. 

Their efforts were valiant, but still in vain. 

In the coming weeks, as more people were quarantined, hysteria seemed to rise. Some of the students refused to leave their dorms, they were too afraid of the risk. Others left, heading back to their hometowns. Still, there were others who chose to treat the situation as an excuse to party. 

I will not lie to you, I was one of the latter. 

I’m originally from a smaller farming town, I knew very little of the people on campus, and it seemed to be a great way of keeping the current events out of mind. 

Each night I would go from party to party, drinking myself into a stupor. I would wake in the morning full of regret, but not regretting it enough to stop. 

I began to notice that more and more people were wearing surgical masks at these events. There was also an obscene amount of hand sanitizer being used. People were doing their best to keep the illness at bay. Despite the effort, less people were showing up as time passed. It became harder, even with all the alcohol in my system, to minimize how surreal and terrifying the situation had become. 

At the last party I attended, I spent some time questioning the stragglers that had shown up. I asked whether anyone had any contact with any of the people placed in quarantine, but no one had seen or heard from any of them. I questioned whether anyone had heard anything about the sickness, but they were still keeping a tight lip about it all. 

Eventually, a rather intoxicated individual who had been slumped in the corner, began to loudly address my line of questions.

“They can’t, release any information because they have no idea what it is. They’ve been researchin it since the first case showed up, and they can’t figure out what causes it or how it spreads.” He took a long swig from the murky brown bottle he held in his hand. “Both hospitals filled up already, so they started taking the sick out to that old abandoned building near the country.” 

He finished his drink and stood on shaky legs, stumbling over to the counter to rifle through what was left.

“More than half of this fucking town is either quarantined in the hospitals and that building, or laying dead in their houses. No use trying to visit anyone, anymore, you wouldn’t like what you found if you tried.” He held a half finished bottle of vodka up victoriously before stumbling back to the same corner he had left. He fell, face slamming into the wall, as he reached his spot. He seemed rather unaffected by it as he rolled into position and took a long hard swig from his new drink. Blood was trailing down his nose as he did. 

Everyone else had gone silent, a mass of forlorn faces surrounded me. I was drunk, and a feeling of aggression overcame me. I was pissed at the guy for trying to bring everyone down. I thought he was talking out of his ass. “If they aren’t telling anyone anything and they turn everyone away, how in the hell would you know anything about it?” 

“I was an intern for one of the hospitals, you little bag of shit.” He spat at me. “One of the few idiots willing to volunteer my time. I was sent to the quarantined building along with the other volunteers when the hospitals filled up.” He stared at the wall, lost in thought for a moment before scrunching his face up in anguish. “I thought I would be able to help those poor fuckers. I didn’t realize that we’d been sent there to babysit them until they died.” 

“Bull. Shit.” I was furious with him at this point. Every fiber of my being wanted to launch myself across the room and knock him out. The people who sat around me were crying softly to themselves now. “You are a drunken idiot. I don’t know if you get your rocks off trying to scare people, but you need to shut the fuck up.”

He chugged what was left of the vodka and leaned his head back into the corner, the hint of a smile played at his lips. “You should all be thankful you’ve been spared this long.” He was drifting in and out of consciousness as he spoke. “Whatever this disease is, it’s eating away at people. Leaves them rotten.” His eyes jerked open after he laid there a moment, “Plenty of ways to find out if i’m a liar. The military is guarding the building now. I got out before they showed up. No one leaves anymore. Not without…” The liquor finally won and he passed out, snoring loudly.

I left after he passed out. I was still fuming about what he had said. Looking back, I think I was more scared than anything, but in my own intoxicated state that fear was expressed as anger. Whatever it was, I had decided then to do a little investigation. 

I had a car that I rarely used parked in a lot near my dorm. My roommate, Jared, usually did the shopping for the two of us and my parents had bought me a meal ticket before semester started. I still kept my keys with me wherever I went, despite the lack of necessity. In my angry, drunken, state I made my way to my car. 

In the time it took for me to reach the lot, I couldn’t help but notice that the campus looked deserted. There were lights shining through some of the dorm windows, but the usual bustle of activity was gone. An eerie silence hung over the place. I think I saw, maybe, two or three people throughout the entire walk. 

Once I got into the car I debated where to go first. I had a grandmother who lived in town and a key to her house. She had given me one before the semester started so I could do laundry there, but I paid Jared to do it instead. I couldn’t be bothered to spend quality time with her at the time. I turned the key and took off in the direction of her house. 

The roads were completely deserted, which is something I should have been glad for at the time. Instead of being grateful, it left me with a feeling of isolation. I began to drive more erratically, trying to get to her house quicker. 

As I drove, I tried to convince myself that I would find her alive. I wanted to believe that she would be ok, at the most she might be sick. 

When I reached her driveway, my stomach dropped. All of the lights were out and her yard was completely overgrown. Her mailbox was overflowing and newspapers littered the porch. 

My legs were shaking as I exited my car, making my way up the porch steps. It felt like time slowed down as I swung the door open. The odor that rushed out to greet me was overpowering. My eyes began to water as I made my way through the house, turning on each light to survey the scene. 

The closer I got to her room, the stronger the smell became. The whole house was a wreck. Plates were left lying about with molding food still on them. Everything was coated in a thick layer of dust. There were tissues littering every surface, each one stained with a bloody mucus  looking substance. 

When I reached her bedroom door, I found her cat. The poor thing was laying there quietly. It was still alive, but just barely. Though I knew I would find her dead inside, I still needed to see her. I think it was because I wanted to see what was happening to the people of the town. It was stupid of me. 

I opened her door slowly, prolonging the inevitable. The smell of rot hit me first. I had never been so close to a dead body before, let alone a diseased dead body. I swallowed chunks of vomit as I covered the lower portion of my face. 

When I saw her lying there under the blankets I realized that she had to have been there for a while. Her eyes were closed, like she was sleeping. She looked bloated and it appeared as though there was some dark bruising running the length of the bottom of her arms and neck. There were small clusters of open wounds covering her body in patches. 

It looked like her pores had opened up in little honeycombed style clusters. Each hole looked to be the size of a quarter and they were seeping the same foul bloody mucus tinged substance I’d seen on the tissues. I couldn’t help but begin to itch when I looked at them. The sight of her discolored gums, slick with the ooze was what finally pushed me over the edge. I turned and beelined for the door, skidding to a halt when I remembered the cat. It didn’t fight me at all when I tucked it into my arms and took off.

When we got into the car I broke down. I hadn’t been very close to my grandmother as I grew older, but it was still upsetting to find her like that. It also made me think about what the man from the party had said, about half the town being quarantined or dead. I couldn’t stop myself from thinking about all the people who died the way that she had. I don’t know how long it took, but eventually I turned on the car and threw us in reverse. 

I thought I was going to be able to leave town. 

When I reached my exit point that hope was dashed quickly. I skidded to a halt when I saw a barricade that spanned as far as I could see in either direction. There were people patrolling in hazmat suits with some extremely intimidating firearms. 

I sat there, sobbing uncontrollably for a long time, pressing the cat into my chest. I must have passed out eventually because I was jolted awake to a sharp crack to my drivers side window. 

I raised my head in confusion and saw one of the hazmats was standing there, pointing a gun at my face. I raised my hands in surrender instinctively, too stunned to do anything else. 

“Turn the fucking car around and don’t come back,” he barked at me. 

I guess I didn’t come out of the stupor fast enough, because he raised the gun into the air and let off a loud warning shot. “I said turn the fucking car around!” 

I shook my head violently in agreement and threw the car in reverse for the second time that night. 

I never did go check out the abandoned building. After everything I had encountered that night, I knew that man hadn’t been lying to me. 

For a while, me and Jared stayed in our dorm room. He would go out to scavenge supplies while I hid there. He hadn’t had to experience what the disease was like first hand, and he’d always been willing to go the extra mile. 

He eventually got sick though, just like everyone else. He deteriorated within the week and I found him one morning, the same honeycomb style clusters covering his body. I didn’t have access to a shovel, so I just put him in the hallway and covered him with his blanket. Now it’s just me and the kitty, who I have unimaginatively dubbed “kitty”. 

I don’t know how many people are still alive here, I stopped being hopeful when Jared passed. At this point i’m just waiting for the inevitable. 

I know that people are going to ask where I am, but I refuse to tell you. Even if you could get past the barricade alive, I won’t condemn anyone else to die like this. 

I guess my main purpose for this is to warn you all. There isn’t any cell service, and they’ve somehow blocked social media sites. It was actually Jared who had pointed out to me that Reddit was still usable. I think they knew most people would just brush this off as some sick ass joke. 

I still have no idea how this spreads or what caused it, I don’t even know what to call it. I do know it isn’t spread through contact. I was here with Jared the whole time he was sick and I had direct contact with his body multiple times. When he got weaker, I was the one who tried to clean those wounds. Keep your eyes and ears open, pay attention to your friends and neighbors. If you notice too many people getting sick at once, get the hell out of there. If it can happen here, it can happen other places too. I have a hard time believing this will be an isolated incident. 

I don’t know what they plan on doing here once everyone is finally gone, maybe they’ll find some way to wipe us off the map. I honestly wish I never would have come to this shit hole. 

Anyway, I’m running low on supplies so I need to head out and scavenge what I can. Wish me luck. Maybe I can make it another week or two.

As the title says, I am a CS student \[going into junior year\] who is looking to transition into management/business job after graduation. 

Whilst I have been at university, I have been really lucky to get access to some really unique opportunities in management and software development. For example during the past school year, I was able to act as a Project Manager for one of the organizations that my school runs. In which I would be organizing events, organizing everyone's projects/deadlines, and arranging and preparing the students for speeches that they would give.

In addition to this experience, I was able to help some of the faculty set up a volunteer organization. Which I really enjoyed, as I was given a fair bit of freedom to organize the different teaching weeks, and contact professors to help run them.

What I found out about myself reflecting on these times, was that I really enjoyed that kind of work much more than the C# I am writing for my internship at the moment.

I want to stress that I believe that I landed a really nice internship, especially when I compare it to some of my other classmates in my year. The team I work with are really helpful, and they are actually giving me challenging work. I just find that I am not really getting any passion out of my job, and I feel that I couldn't see myself doing this for the rest of my career.  

What I also want to clarify is that I do actually like programming, but I see it now as more of a hobby.

I have been doing some googling, and I found this this quora thread\* but I was wondering if anyone here had some other advice, or had perhaps have been through this same dilemma yourself. 

Right now I am feeling pretty lost in my plan going forward, and would be really grateful for any advice that you guys can give.

So for some backstory, I am an American uni student in Computer Science &amp; Mathematics, about to begin my third of four years. This past Fall, I had the chance to spend a semester in a Study Abroad program at UCD, and I have to admit I fell a bit in love with Dublin. I know that it's probably a bit early to be looking for jobs for the Summer of 2019, but I'd love to return to Ireland for a few months for some kind of internship position as a software dev. 

I am currently the lead developer on a web team here at my uni, creating and maintaining web apps that help our housing department handle accommodation reservations, among other things. In that job I use PHP, HTML, and a bit of JS and CSS, although web development isn't necessarily what I'd like to be doing forever. I also have interests in cloud computing (I'm currently working on my AWS Solutions Architect certification) and mobile app development. I'm open to many things!

If anyone here has suggestions, tips/tricks for landing a job, or knows of any places where I should start to look for this kind of position - or if you're at a company that is looking for someone to hire for the next summer and want to talk more - please let me know!

I was a terrible student in college and had a shit gpa, no experience from internships, and I frankly don't know where to go from here.

The jobs I've applied for require experience, of which I have none outside of class projects.

My life is a little bit unusual and requires a little explanation. I am 22 and an Australian citizen. I have lived most of my life abroad and travelling due to my father's work, and so don't really have a fixed idea of home. My parents currently live in India, while I just finished college in upstate New York. I graduated with a degree in aerospace and mechanical engineering (but poor GPA of 2.85) and have struggled to find a full time job in the USA (most will not sponsor me because of my low GPA).

Currently I am working an internship at a steel plant in a small town in Michigan, and will be doing so until November. I got the job through my Dad, and can't work here full time. Most of my friends are still in the Northeast, and I would like to move back there (especially to a large city), but again the job search is tough. After November my options are:

1. Move to Australia to try and find a job (unsure how likely I am to succeed)
2. Move to Australia for grad school (either computer science or in education)
3. Stay in the US for jobs and graduate school

I have never lived in Australia, and culturally I identify more with the U.S. I am tired of stressing over this and would love to hear some input. Please post any questions you might have."

I'm a cs student from Germany and will finish my bachelor with a minor in mathematics in a few weeks. If my finals go well, I will graduate with a 4.0 GPA, but I know that isn't worth much in the business world. After that, I'll start getting a masters degree, which is much more common here than in the US. I'm mostly interested in datastructures, algorithms and parallelization and lean more toward the theoretical site of computer science.  
However, this also means I don't have that much practical experience. After my third semester I did an internship in java development at a business consultancy and I also participated in a university project that developed a graphical interface for a deep learning framework, which was published and is used by a few researchers. I don't know if this is of any relevance, but I participated in a foreign exchange in highschool and actually lived a year in the USA.  
My plan is to do use the summer break to brush up on leetcode and implement the multiple sequence alignment algorithm that I analyzed in my bachelor thesis as a private project. It uses techniques like dynamic programming and various graph algorithms. Starting in September I want to apply for summer internships for 2019 in the United States.   


Now to my actual question: which US companies accept international students and have a good  internship program? Do you think it's worth applying for someone with my profile? Of course I already have a couple of the better known companies on my list, both from the east and west coast, but I'm sure there a more, that I haven't thought of.

So a little background about me: I'm a 24 year old American and am considering going back to school. My undergraduate degree is in Spanish &amp; International Affairs with a concentration in Latin America. I've studied abroad in Chile and spent two years living in Colombia and teaching English after graduation. Now I'm a freelance writer but I want to go back to school and get back into my field. The issue is I'm having trouble deciding which program is the better choice.

My first choice is to attend school in Buenos Aires, where I would study for a Master's in either IR or Human Rights. The program is 15 months and significantly cheaper than the U.S. (like max $5,000 per year for tuition). I would be able to just work part-time while going to school and wouldn't have to take out any more loans. However, I'm a little nervous that my degree won't carry a lot of weight in the U.S. 

My second choice is a dual-degree program for a J.D. and a Master's in International Relations, which would provide a good base for a career in human rights law (something I've been leaning towards). However, the program is $40,000 and in Boston (which is quite expensive). I really don't want to take out loans, but I feel that this degree might be more valuable.

Does anyone have any experience with getting a Master's degree abroad (specifically in Latin America would be great)? Did you find that you had trouble getting work? Do you think that a degree abroad combined with relevant internships could be just as valuable as a degree from the U.S.? 

Basically any thoughts, opinions, stories, and experiences are welcome! Thanks in advance!"

My brother is now at an internship for 6 weeks and it's the first time my immediate family of 4 will be incomplete (i.e. not together) for the longest time, and my mom especially is taking it hard and so am I but with less visible crying. And I'm leaving to SCU (6 hours away) this fall but now I'm seriously rethinking it because of how hard my mom's been taking our family's incompleteness.

To add on to that, SCU isn't something that I'd have trouble giving up, but honestly I'd feel the same about any college that isn't less than 1 hour away from my family. So I guess I'm also scared to leave home. Recently, I've been picturing myself going to community college for a year and then transferring to USC, which is way closer to my fam. and even closer to my grandma, which is a huge bonus since she might be a potential dorming option (obviously for way cheaper). Since my mom constantly talks to and visits my grandma and my grandma always wants to see me and my brother, this potential future situation would be perfect.

Plus I love USC's integrated comp sci/engineering program (my major), and if my brother gets in a couple years later and chooses to go, we could dorm together, which would be the beyond perfect situation. Also, I want to be able to help my brother on his hw while at home, and it would be harder to do that as effectively through Skype. My family also has a lot of silly traditions that I don't want to leave behind.

But my concerns are: I don't get into USC - which is a pretty big downer but at least I'd transfer to a college closer to my family like UCI (which I would have guaranteed admission for because of the TAG program) - I start getting feelings of regret for not going to my far away college and starting ahead, since I have lots of AP's, which a college like USC wouldn't even look at. Since USC is a rather transfer-friendly private, I'm not too worried about making friends.

So all in all, it boils down to me wanting to stay close (perhaps too close) to my family, but at the same time not wanting to make a bad decision. So at the moment I am as on the fence about this as anybody could be, and I feel like I'm at the fork in the road of my life. I hope you guys can provide some insight to help me make a decision.

I have been reading this subreddit for a few years now, and I see a lot of posts telling people that they're qualified and just suffering from impostor syndrome. I told myself that I was probably fine and that I too was suffering from impostor syndrome, but I'm beginning to think that I'm actually just incompetent. 


I wasn't the brightest kid in high school, I was definitely in the bottom 50% as far as my classmates went. I spent essentially all of my free time studying or doing extra curriculars that would contribute to my college application in some way. I didn't go out that often, and when I did, it was to get help from friends on assignments and to explain concepts to me. I didn't play video games or watch TV, and I didn't really do anything that didn't contribute to my life academically. I went multiple hackathons with friends where I honestly contributed nothing, but my friends did all of the work and carried me through and my name was always published alongside theirs as part of the winning team. I feel like the only reason I have made it this far is because my friends always supported me to succeed.


As a result, I somehow lucked my way into a top program. My high school friend group split up, they're all attending other fantastic schools and can't carry me through life anymore. After getting here, I'm doing so poorly that I'm at risk of being kicked out. I currently have a 1.7 cumulative GPA, my CS major GPA is probably closer to 1.2. I'm struggling through every single class I take, and I had to retake some courses. I'm barely passing my math/cs courses, and I already dropped down to a reduced course load. I'm just not intelligent enough to take and pass the same number of courses as my peers. 


None of this is for lack of trying. My social life is almost nonexistent, because I hole myself up and study/work on assignments for 10+ hours per day. I feel like I have a good grasp of the content, but then I go into the midterms/finals and fail everything. On weekly assignments that take my peers 5-10 hours, I find myself taking 30+ hours and still not doing as well. I just don't pick things up as fast as everyone else around me.


I'm definitely not one of those situations where someone is terrible at school but an amazing 10X'er developer either. I have done 4 internships at this point, and during those, I would take a literal week to do something that anyone else on my team could have easily done in a few hours. My teams have always been supportive, and I've been told that I'm still in the early stages of my career, but I don't feel like I have improved at all while working. I'm still slow as ever, and my PR's are full of errors. I honestly don't think I'll ever reach the level of competency that they have. Hell, my current internship told me that I was ""I was doing fantastic and because this was my first internship I wasn't expected to do better"". This is my 4th internship.


On paper I look fantastic. I'm attending a top school, I have had 4 internships, 3 which have been fairly reputable (1 @ big4, 1 @ unicorn, 1 @ household name), and I have some pretty big name hackathon wins. The problem is, none of it is *real*. I got my first internship because I ""won"" a hackathon, I got my second internship because I had ""work experience"" and ""awards"". I was admitted to university based on grades, awards, and relevant industry experience that my friends carried me to. I got attention and an offer from a unicorn during my freshman year because I attend a top school, had huge name hackathon wins, and 2 previous software engineering internships. During my sophomore year, I got an offer from a big4 because I had previous ""experience"" at a unicorn. 


The problem is, it's all built upon a fake foundation and I have no substance. I didn't contribute at all the the hackathons that got me my first job. I was incapable of doing anything useful while I was at my first job, but that fact that I had one got me more jobs and admission to a top university. I'm failing at my university, but the fact that I have a pulse and exist within the university system got me an internship at a unicorn. I was honestly the worst intern the company had ever had, but just because I had the unicorn on my resume, I got an offer at a big4. 


I honestly feel so useless, and at this point, I don't think I can blame it on impostor syndrome. I don't know what to do anymore."

I'll be on track for an engineering degree, and I particularly want to shoot for mechanical, but I might consider software or compsci if they happen to work better with me.

The big thing is that I have an associate's in IT from a small community college, and I'm sure that cuts down on the little bit of time that I have to really prepare myself for an actual career, especially since I never found work in that field in the couple of years I've been out. I know I'll have to really get on it, but am I hurt too bad since I might have a little over two years of school before I'm done? The school I'll be going to is big and has plenty of opportunities available, but what can I focus on to help my chances of landing a career? I should be talking to an administrator about my classes and what I'm going for in a couple of weeks. Is this a good time to bring up internships or work-based learning?

Sorry if this is kinda common sense for some, but this is my first actual step into University, and it can be overwhelming after the tiny little community college I attended (that barely had any actual opportunities to do anything, but it was a great place to start)."
8x4mkz,2,2018-07-08,Looking for advice building a new office LAN,gargravarr2112,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8x4mkz/looking_for_advice_building_a_new_office_lan/,"Hi all, I've been around /r/talesfromtechsupport a lot with some generally humorous (I hope!) posts about my still-fairly-new job at a tech startup.

We've been part of a startup incubator for the past 2 years, but the time is fast approaching to spread our wings and move to a new office (and not too soon, either - we're really struggling for desks here!!). After much contract negotiation and such, it looks like the finish line for the new office is in sight, with the boss expecting to have the keys next week.

So, my role - I joined as a combination devops/sysadmin, but have become the de facto sysadmin. I'm a Linux power user (very comfortable behind the command line) and tinkerer, but though I have some experience with above-consumer-grade hardware (I built a virtualisation solution on an internship at university, but that was within an existing network with SANs and all manner of fancy stuff already there), I'm still kinda green with it.

Fortunately, the needs of this company are pretty simple - everything we do is cloud-based, so all we technically need is an internet connection. We're looking to get two fibre connections into the building (I'm told the fibre is already there from the previous tenant), but from there on, we've got to build the network ourselves. The previous company took all their switches and routers with them with they left, although they did leave me an excellent, clean server room with 3 racks and a massive UPS - I'm dreaming about us moving in so I can have a proper server room \^_^

So, we're currently about 70 people onsite, projected to grow to around 110 in 12 months. We mostly push code up and down to GitHub and stuff of that nature. There's 3 major camps - Linux laptops, Linux desktops and Mac laptops. I'd say we have about 1/3 of each. We're sharing a connection from the incubator; we have a 100Mb allowance which we're comfortable with. Our MD is happy for me to get two 1Gb connections, ideally from different vendors, since it's cheaper than suffering an outage with developers idle until it's fixed.

With this in mind, what sort of infrastructure should I be looking to build? I need to fill the empty spaces from the fibre into the building to the patch panels.

My initial research has led me to Ubiquiti products; I hear good things about them from friends who run it at home, and also in corporate settings. I had initially planned to buy just access points from them and run HP ProCurve switches for the core network, but I've since found that UBNT have a good range of network products, and I hear great things about the management console linking everything together, so I'm now planning to populate the LAN with them.

Shortly before I took this job, I developed a philosophy of 'Do It Right, Once'. I've seen rickety networks that nobody likes to touch, to the point where penny-pinching has led to horribly unstable setups (in the previous place I worked, the company co-lo'd their production hardware, but used cheap core switches with legendary firmware bugs - STP would bring down the whole network!). In this job, I'm being trusted by management to put my money where my mouth is; I want to build something that's stable and scales up nicely, and doesn't require ongoing maintenance. I want to avoid single points of failure where possible, and be able to at least run things in a 'degraded' state until full performance can be resumed.

With this in mind, I'm thinking I will need at least two large managed switches - 2x 48-port PoE EdgeSwitches in this case - plus a router - something from the EdgeRouter series, able to handle two WAN connections and ideally bond them, or at least tolerate failure of one connection. The company is most keen on wifi, so I need to be able to handle &gt;70 people with laptops. I know I'll need at least two UniFi AC Pro's. So this is now where I start asking for more specific advice:

- How many wifi APs should I be looking at to cover the office? Is there a rule of thumb, APs/m^2? I'm not sure on the floor area just yet but I can get numbers on Monday.
- I'm thinking I would patch half the desktops/APs into one switch, half into the other, then connect to the router, then I presume the vendor(s) will provide me with a fibre modem. Is this a good approach?
- Besides duplicating everything, is there a good way to minimise points of failure? We have wifi adapters for the desktops for emergencies, and ethernet adapters for the laptops, in case everything goes drastically wrong.
- What sort of SLA is acceptable for a corporate internet connection? We've so far been offered 4 hours by one vendor, and a second has offered us a mirrored connection that duplicates everything to a second exchange via a separate fibre and is supposed to fail over in 3 seconds. While nice, I think the 3 seconds is overkill, particularly as the second fibre would not be contributing until the first failed. Is there a middle ground? We'd prefer two vendors in case one suffers a network-wide outage, or their billing system becomes sentient and decides we haven't paid for the month and cuts us off (we're all software people, we know this happens!).

I think the Ubiquiti management software needs to run from a dedicated machine within the LAN; I'll have some rackmount servers running as VM tanks for internal services (DNS, LDAP etc.) so that won't be a problem.

For those who have experience with Ubiquiti products, is the following possible:

- Limit bandwidth to individual IPs so one client cannot swallow the whole connection (we've had this happen, the responsible party was suitably embarrassed :)
- Limit the company LAN to only known MAC addresses (which I already have in digital form) and somehow prevent anyone plugging rogue hardware into a spare ethernet port
- Place unknown devices on a completely isolated VLAN with no access to anything (but can be examined by an admin) - something I read about recently
- Use 802.11X/RADIUS auth (backed by my existing LDAP cluster) for wifi auth rather than pre-shared passwords
- Have an isolated wifi network just for internet access for personal devices

I'm thinking I would have 4 subnets - Servers, Desktops, Wifi and VPN (the VPN is mostly for me to use from home, but also for others who often use public wifi), so the company LAN would be a /16 I think? This is about as far as my current knowledge of networking goes, I would love it if someone could recommend me some good reading on how to do subnetting correctly.

Overall, I just want to Do This Right, Once :) I'm aware that most of my experience is from consumer-level equipment but I'm prepared for the learning curve of pro-level gear. I just hope I'm setting about this in the right way! Thanks!"

8x4uqz,2,2018-07-08,Looking for some advice and potentially empathy from someone who’s been through something similar?,StoryTimeStoryTime,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/8x4uqz/looking_for_some_advice_and_potentially_empathy/,"Posted a few days ago but trying again :)

Hello!

I hope you’re having a great night. Honestly: this is a long story so I’ll throw a TLDR at the end.

I’m looking for help at diagnosing and getting past my anger and lack of confidence.

This all started about 2 years ago, during my senior year of college. I’d done two internships for a Fortune 500 company and received great reviews. I was eagerly awaiting a job offer from them. When I hadn’t heard back for a while I contacted them only to find out that they had not recommended me for employment on grounds of being too “easy going”.  This shattered me. The job was going to be in the same city as my girlfriend and family and I’d worked for this company and built relationships for two years. Many of the folks I’d have worked for I would consider close friends. It hurt.

I proceeded to take another job but it didn’t feel right. I remember moving south and during the drive to said place I’d be living I felt nothing but guilt and sadness to be compromising so heavily. Of course, the distance didn’t work and my girlfriend of 3 years and I split. Due to stress and genuinely hating the work environment of that job I ended up leaving after about a year with the intention of going to graduate school.

After leaving the job, I moved home, and since then I’ve lived there. Beforehand I just felt like a piece of crap all of the time and like nobody liked me or thought I could do anything right, but now, the anger has started. I can hardly look at myself in the mirror without wanting to punch the face in it. I’ve pushed away my friends and family with my anger. I don’t know how to explain it, I was always an easy going guy and now, just two weeks ago, I was at dinner in public and snapped. Something on the menu changed and I threw my perfectly functional phone on the floor, shattered it, and stomped it to the ground before walking out without it.

Tonight I got a ticket in my car going 27 in a 25 and after the cop gave me the ticket I politely accepted it, left my car where it sat in a neighborhood, and just walked 5 miles home because I felt if I touched the car again I’d just get another ticket because I’m too much of an idiot to drive properly.

I’m honestly afraid at this point. I have no composure. I start graduate school in roughly a month at a dream school, Harvard, but I can hardly even go into public without having a panic attack.

Do I forgo my admission to the best school in my field to get my mental health back? Do I move out of this house ASAP? Do I need to seek professional health.

I’m honestly afraid I’ll harm my future beyond repair if I don’t get myself in line soon.

TLDR: having serious self confidence issues since being denied from a job that meant a lot to me and having serious anger issues since living at home. Looking for help"

8x9mat,3,2018-07-09,What advice would you give a slow learner in terms of succeeding in the software industry?,enzio901,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/8x9mat/what_advice_would_you_give_a_slow_learner_in/,"I'm a 23 old from a south asian country. Since my high school years I have suffered from low self esteem issues.
 
 These stem from the thought that I'm a slow learner and I take twice more time than my peers to learn something new. I'm sure most of it is imposter syndrome but there is some truth to it too.

Non programming wise I can never remember driving directions. I have to use GPS to go somewhere I have gone many times. I did try alot but I don't think I would ever be able to do that. Also I'm terrible with remembering names. Anything I learn I have to practice more than twice others learning it to learn it. Sometimes teachers would get frustrated and think that I'm not paying attention. (eg : Martial arts, learning to drive, learning stuff in school). Blessing about programming is that there is plenty of resources for me to self learn in my own phase.

Over the years I have come up with techniques to help me with this. For example I make very organised notebooks in OneNote on what ever I learn. Therefore, If I want to recall it later I can easily find it by searching.

For example I did an algorithms and data structures module my last semester. But if you ask me to write the pseudocode for selection sort or quick sort I will not remember it off the bat even-though I studied it for my exam a month ago. But if I search 'quick sort' in OneNote I would have it in a second. [search](https://imgur.com/DnhhVSf)
I have made very clear notes that would let me understand it in an instance. For example part of merge sort notes I made. [merge sort](https://imgur.com/a/WAxqlZA).

However, I have friends who recall pseudocode for those algorithms right off the bat. Same with programming languages. If someone told me to connect to a database, or write to file in java I would not remember how to do it. But I would be able to do it instantly by referring to my notes. I always keep OneNote open in another Desktop for reference. 

Currently I completed 2 years of my software engineering degree maintaining a good average and about to start my 12 month internship in a leading software development company in my country. Still at times I feel like I didn't deserve it or it was an accident. For example the guy who interviewed me didn't ask me to write any java/sql code but assessed me by telling me to solve some problems by writing pseudocode. He said that he doesn't care about what languages I know and is assessing my attitude and problem solving skills. But the other interviewers who did my friends interviews were fully technical asking to write SQL queries and Java code on paper. I'm sure I would have screwed it if that was the case.

I'm not sure what help I'm asking you guys.. I have been improving my life slowly over the years. I use things google calendar, notifications,  to do lists and note taking apps to my advantage.  But still I have that nagging feeling that I won't be able to be successful because of my problems. Like how employers expect you to do things without referring to notes each time. Like if someone hands over their laptop to me and tells me to do something I should be able to do it without saying ""wait let me check my notes first"".

Looking for some advice here, so here's some context:

- Currently a university student in UK studying an IT related degree (not so much full on technical, but has contained topics such as HTML&amp;CSS, Java, project management, IT management systems etc.)

- In a 12 month internship in a service desk role, as part of my degree (sandwich). About a month in. There isn't

I've got a meeting in a few days where I'll talk with my manager about what I want to achieve in my year here. I've got to go into the meeting with some ideas on what I can achieve, and I've been forwarded emails that have been sent to my coworkers from when the annual reviews took place (as I wasn't here at the time) so I've got an idea of what will be talked about in the meeting.

The content in emails talks about any mentioning relevant training that I could make use of, but I'm not sure if they'll be reluctant to pay for any sort of training which costs more than a few quid since I'm only here 12 months. It also mentions if there's any projects etc that I want to be part of (which I guess is hard to talk about in a reddit post).

I know I want to develop my excel skills as I want to be good at it.

This job can be very very quiet at times, and I can sometimes go through days where I only do a couple of things other than the daily tasks I do.

Does anyone have any ideas as to what to ask? I've looked at certs (e.g. A+), but unsure as to if that'll be particular important once I've graduated, as this will be the only job I have between now and graduating. I've still got access to my uni's library so I can take whatever book they have/read them online, but would rather get involved and do something rather than study for another year. 

I know it's a good opportunity and don't wanna waste my time here, as it can be boring just reading stuff from a screen and browsing reddit(!) when it's quiet. Could be a good way to get some training paid for too, as although I'm only here for 12 months, it's still early days.

Hi all! So I don’t know if this is the right place to post this, but I’m going to give it a shot. I’m a senior in college and  I’m currently an IT Intern at a fairly large hospital system in my state. I’ve been told by many people that if I complete the internship, I’m almost “guaranteed” a job. I’m the kind of person that will believe it when I see it, so I’ve been searching for jobs through the same health system, looking for ones I like. I found one, but I don’t know if it’ll make me seem like I want to get out of the internship quick because I don’t like it (because I do).

So my main question is: should I go ahead and apply for the position as a fall back plan, or what?"

Just some quick advice please?
I just graduated a month ago and for months I have been applying for full time jobs and internships.

So here is the thing. I have been offered an internship at this GREAT company.

Here are the pros :
A) It is a really good company.
B) The people are GREAT. I know I could learn quite alot! 


But here is the thing,
A) Its too far. I don’t have a car , and using public transport will take 2 hours ONE way. So 4 hours of commute. I have to walk, take the metro, change to a bus , back to the metro and walk. So I would leave at 6am reach only by 8pm at night. I cannot carpool with anyone as nobody lives as far as I do.

B) I would get roughly 500$ (this is in the middle east) a month.  Which would not even cover my transport.

So Im in a dilemma on whether to take this or not.

Below is my story, feel free to skip over that and read the bottom if you just want to see my questions.

My goal in college was to break into quant trading. In my sophomore year I had messed around with quantopian and other ""algorithmic trading"" platforms, and despite being a finance major I found it really interesting. I taught myself some programming and became pretty knowledgeable about simple trading strategies, products, and market microstructure.

I wasn't active in campus clubs/orgs and didn't have a stellar GPA (\~3.4) but due to my interest/passion I was able to land a S&amp;T junior internship at a top BB (GS/JPM/MS) rotating on their algo trading desks. I did really well on my first desk and was told I was on track to get an offer, while the other two desks I was on weren't hiring (this felt pretty unlucky). In the last two weeks of my internship the first desk told me that their team was no longer able to hire another trader (FICC, their division, was down \~45&amp;#37; YoY..) and would only be hiring a strat. They said that they would pool me together with the strat candidates (separate program) and consider me there. Well, unsurprisingly I lost out to two other interns with masters in computer science. I networked with some other desks and got a verbal offer from a pretty lame desk and decided to just move on at this point because I didn't want to hate my life just to be at a top BB. I also wasn't a huge fan of the high-ego culture of the firm, and the rest of my class was pretty lame to be honest.

This was around August. Actually, I felt like I was totally fine at this point. I assumed that since I was able to get a trading internship at a top firm, I'd be able to get a full time offer. Boy, was I wrong. I wasn't aware of how accelerated recruiting programs had become and by the time I started applying there were hardly any positions available. Regardless, I interviewed at places like Citadel and Flow Traders but wasn't able to get an offer. It was at this point that I started to feel that shooting for a quant position as a finance major was totally pointless and that I had shot myself in the foot for pursuing something that deviated so far from my actual studies, no matter how interested I was in it.

Anyways, I felt that IBD / HF / PE gigs were out of the question since I had no internship/modeling experience, so I began considering non-algo/quant roles and eventually interviewed at a foreign MM bank (BNP/NOMURA/SOCGEN) for their S&amp;T program. However, the person who interviewed me said he thought I was great but wanted to put me in front of more technical/quanty desks since he thought it would be a better fit. Shortly after the head of the D1 trading desk reached out to me and said his team was looking for a technical person-- I ended up doing a series of interviews with them and got the offer, and I start the job in a few weeks. I'm pretty happy about this position for a few reasons:

1. I'm a fresh grad on a trading desk and I am very grateful for that
2. Everyone I met was smart / nice and seniors were mostly poached from top banks
3. They want me to program / work on the more technical, arbitrage strategy side of the desk
4. D1 gets exposure to tons of different products, economic regions, and strategies
5. This specific bank is exlcuded from the Volcker rule, so prop trading/risk taking is alive and well

Really, my only concern about this position is the ""prestige"" of the firm. I know that's a stupid thing to care about, but I can't act like it doesn't matter in terms of exit opps. Also, the firm is going under a lot of restructuring at the moment, and its unclear what the future of the American operation is.

Since I'll never really be a great ""quant"", I've put that dream aside. Instead, I think I would love to be at an investment firm that focuses on investing in emerging markets. Pretty much any global macro HF would be perfect. What do I need to do over the next few years to get there? Here are some questions I had:

1. Should I try to switch to another trading desk that's more relevant to global macro, or will I get sufficient experience as a technical person on a D1 desk?
2. Should I try to lateral to a BB, or does the fact that my firm is lower on the prestige scale not matter when recruiting at global macro funds? If lateraling to a BB is a good move, how can I best prep for that and go about it?
3. What else can I do to make myself a top candidate for a global macro HF? E.g., is modeling experience a must?

Thanks. Undergrads, feel free to AMA if you have questions about algo-trading/S&amp;T/the recruiting cycle."

I found an internship in this summer. I read the description and I thought it suits me really well. I went to the company, did the interview, and I was accepted. It's a small company with like 4 to 6 workers, and I was quite excited to learn. The thing is that I was given an advanced project were I don't know how to even start doing it, and I explained to the manager that I never did this before and I never used these languages or these softwares, but he was like this is the point you need to learn. However, I was shocked that the company doesn't provide any training, so I need to figure things by myself searching through google. It is been a week and I spent like seven hours googling and implementing tutorials that I don't know if they can help in the project. When I ask him he explains like general theory stuff that are not helpful. I've always loved programming, but since I started this internship I feel so stupid, and I start to regret my decision choosing this major. I didn't sign any contract and I didn't register to this internship through school, so I know that I can just call him and tell him that I can't really do it anymore. I'm quite depressed and I feel super useless, but I'm scared that If I quit that am gonna regret my decision in future. Is this how internships are? What should I do? "

8xe2d0,186,2018-07-09,I worked for a Scam Startup,the_pasta_cutter,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/8xe2d0/i_worked_for_a_scam_startup/,"Before we begin, just some background information, I'm a Malaysian and the start up in question is based in Malaysia (although they do some operations in Singapore). Also I originally written this article in a local forum in Malaysia so apologies in advance if I'm using some terms which may not be familiar with the international community. I did quickly glanced through the article to clarify any local references.

So in February 2018  I took up the job as a Finance Manager in a start up which I shall call The Firm (or in short, TF). Prior to that I research about TF and they had a decent website and good coverage from some fintech sites, so I thought it's a legit company. Furthermore it has 1 year+ full operations and even participated in some Sandbox program with Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) which adds to the confidence of the company's legitimacy.

However once I joined things started to take a lousy turn. The red flags were desperately waving at me right from the first week but I was too naive and giving too much benefit of the doubt to the founder. The founder is an Estonian guy who had another business in Malaysia prior to TF which I admit made some money but the business isn't really on the ethical side. Either way he say the biggest role he would need me to do when joining the company is to prepare the budget and financial forecast to be shown to investors.

So the first thing I did was looking at the accounts, thinking that by having a grasp of the previous years financials I can use it to support my assumptions and calculations when doing the projection and budget for the investors. To my horror there were no accounting in place. The company has been opened since 2014 and only the 2015 year end account was audited. The 2016 and 2017 account was not audited and hence there were no filing of annual return to SSM (Malaysia Companies Commission). That would've triggered the first red flag.

Secondly throughout the rest of my employment I've been receiving calls from the company's vendor requesting for payment for the various service provided to the company. When I brought these notice to the chairman, he scoffs off these claims saying that everyone is out there trying to take money from him. He say all these people chasing payments are overcharging the company and so on. On my first week I'd actually believe his claim but the moment he delayed in paying the office cleaner her pay for 2 months citing her service is too expensive (after agreeing initially) I knew this chairman was simply not an honest person.

Speaking about the Chairman, he really really talks alot, and spend a lot of the conversation just beating around the bush and talking about his past achievement. More important he boast about all his network and how he has good relations with people of power from around the world. Funny thing that despite all his connections and his so called wealth he can't even get a bank account opened under the company's name. Previously he convinced a young staff to take up directorship of the company so he can open the bank account and subsequently refused to change the company director back to the chairman's name, citing admin issues. I knew this was bullshit but didn't give much thought until he asked me to take up the directorship of the company, citing that ""we need a bank account and the country and banking industry is afraid of foreigners like myself"". That's when I knew it's time to leave. Strange that for all the times he kept trashing my country Malaysia, he still insist on setting up his business in this 'unfriendly' country.

**Part 2 - Weird job scope and goals**

So back to preparing the budget and projection for the Chairman, he's starting to make request that doesn't make any business sense. Now normally for any budget forecast you're suppose to get as many supporting documents or historical data to support your figures and back any assumption you made with solid facts. When I prepared my first draft of the budget the chairman told me that first year projection is too low. I told him naturally it's low because it's a startup and it will require some time by marketing before our sales will pick up to a profitable level.

He then explain that I shouldn't make the budget too realistic. He claims he wants to get Euro 4-6million in funding in first year so I should prepare the budget based on 20 million and then subsequently revise it down to 10 million like that before settling for his targetted amount. He then commented on the visual aspect of my budget and I should consider preparing my budget in Keynote format to be more ""presentable"" rather than just throwing excel figures with my basis of calculation and assumption. He say that most investors are not interested in details but will throw their money based on ""what looks good"". I knew he wasn't interested in a serious proper budgeting but rather something with fancy graphs and infographics to make it look good.

I then approached the marketing department on their marketing plan so I can do my revenue projections properly and to my horror I was informed by marketing that the chairman is not interested with actual revenue figures. He's more interested with the app downloads, Facebook likes, LinkedIn, Instagram reach and likes. Basically he's focusing on giving the company a good online image when someone search for the company's name, a habit which I see in all his actions. The chairman says that investors is not interested in pass financial figures or will NOT actually conduct proper due diligence on our business plan or projections. They will just throw money to whatever that 'looks nice'. I brought my doubt about how our lack of audited financial statements will lead to many problem in convincing investors but he went to his usual name dropping about how he knows some powerful guy in Europe who has access to billions of euro in funds.

**Part 3 - Ever Changing Office Location**

When I attended my 2nd interview I realize TF office is quite hard to find. The website merely states the building of the office but not exactly which floor or which unit number it is. Moreover the only number available in the website is a Singapore number. Thankfully the HR lady did call me and explained to me the exact location of the office. It was those SOHO building near Jalan Ampang. When I joined TF they just moved into this building in Binjai 8. Previously in 2017 they were in Troika and before that in this KLCC Soho suites.

Since the company's inception in 2014 it has moved office 4 times, from Menara Citibank, to Soho Suites KLCC, Troika and now currently in Binjai 8 (even so the founder refuse to disclose the exact unit number of the office). Previously in 2017 they were also falsely using Menara Ilham as their company location despite not having an actual office there at all. After some scandal and some reporters queried the Menara Ilham management did TF change their address in the web after being threatened to legal action by Menara Ilham management. Furthermore a property agent told me that the Chairman has a bad record in his database for having history of late payments.

The Chairman is super insecure about revealing the office location to any outsider. Whenever any of the staff were to organize a meeting with a potential vendor or partner the chairman will strictly warn us not to disclose the office location. The company has 4 to 5 different business location depending on where you extract the information from. Heck the Chairman even used another different address when it comes to dealing with banks. The Chairman's business card features a different building from where we were actually working and as usual, didn't mention any unit number or even floor. Dodgy. This guy just simply doesn't want people to know where his exact location is.

Without being too detailed his residential address registered in the SSM differs greatly from his actual residence address as well. Needless to say the chairman isn't keen on letting people know where he lives.

**Part 4 - Chairman made a fool out of himself with the authorities**

When I joined TF back in Feb 2018 there was this Operations Manager whose sole purpose is to develop the business plan for TF to obtain a certain license from Bank Negara Malaysia. I still recall the Chairman instruct the operations manager not to put too much details in the business plan. The Operations manager disagreed and within 1 month he quit his position as operations manager because he cannot agree with the chairman's sense of direction.

After the operations manager left I took over his function and started to work on the business plan. At this time I receive the same ridiculous instruction from the chairman; Make it look beautiful, don't talk too much about the operations, rig the income projections. Just tell a nice story but whatever that happens just get the license first then figure out the compliance issue later. I was quite frustrated working on the business plan because I knew BNM (The Central Bank of Malaysia, which issues license for Money Service Businesses) will scrutinize our figures and drill us with questions in detail. There's no point hiding any details from them, however the chairman scoff off my concerns as usual and go back to him boasting his past achievements and connections. Heck at one point he even say he will get his Estonian ambasaddor to write to the deputy governor of BNM if he couldn't get the license.

Either way the PA managed to arrange a meeting with BNM and TF. Can you imagine the Chairman scolded the PA for not preparing him for the meeting. By preparing for meeting the Chairman asked ""What is the race, seniority and years of experience of the people we are meeting in BNM"". Useless preparation i would say. In BNM itself the people there drill him with questions and the chairman as usual just ""goreng"" (local term for bullshit some facts in hope that it sounds convincing) some fact and figures and boasted about his non existense experience. BNM either way is unimpressed and insist that he produce physical documents and proof to back him claim. In fact BNM ask him if he can produce a 99.99% confidence level on some e-KYC verification in which the chairman happily said yes (in theory a 99.99% confidence level is impossible and BNM was asking him a trick question).

The chairman realize things went sour in the negotiation and for a moment I thought he finally learnt his lesson and will take this BNM application seriously. I thought he will finally hire the right people, clear the company accounts for audit and prepare the business plan properly.

Then back in the office he called me to a meeting. He started scheming a new plan to open a new company, asked me to become the director so he can open a few bank accounts, and say I'm paranoid about BNM and I should trust him in handling this BNM license issue.

I tendered my resignation 2 days later.

**Bonus Episode -Weird Hiring Decisions**

Now every hiring decisions goes through the Chairman. Naturally when briefly asked about his hiring principal he mention he only want the best. At first this chairman has TWO Personal Assistants! (PA). Heck word from the HR person is initially he has 3 candidate whom he thinks suitable for PA role but decided he wants ALL 3. Thankfully one rejected the offer so he only have two PAs now. Personally observing the mundane task given to the PA it seems he doesn't even need a PA in the first place. Further more two months later he decided his two PA useless because in his word ""They're not doing anything and as a PA they should know my needs and act accordingly"".

Next was the way he conducted the interview. He keep on boasting about the need to get good stuff but is dumbfounded when candidates refuse to join because the company offer no EPF and SOCSO. He thinks these statutory contribution shouldn't matter so much and candidates are not looking at the big picture.

Finally he totally judge a person totally by the looks. Too many times he rejected candidate without viewing their detailed resume on the basis on their photo posted is not interesting. Telltale sign this guy isn't really thinking about getting capable candidates to meet the company goals. All he wants is people who look nice.

**Final Part - Late Salary, mass resignation**

I left within 1 week after tendering my resignation. The Chairman seems oblivious about why I would tender my resignation as he believes ""Things are moving"". I told him what is wrong with his whole way of doing things and he refuse to believe he's in any wrong. that cemented my decision to leave.

I still wonder back then whether this Estonian chairman is a scammer or simply a terrible terrible businessman. However when I read this two articles about scam startups, I knew, this guy is a scammer.

[https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295304](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/295304)[https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-scam...up-574ced8acdff](https://medium.com/startup-grind/i-got-scammed-by-a-silicon-valley-startup-574ced8acdff)

It's quite disturbing how I share a similar experience with Penny Kim and her experience with WrkRiot, from the over talkative and constant name dropping founder to the late payments.

I believe that TF is now at the verge of dying as the chairman will not be able to get any investors (after witnessing his ""business pitch"" in BNM I really doubt someone is gonna throw to him millions). Company now has 3 full time staff and 3 interns, down from 13 when I first joined. With property agent and intern providers blacklisting him I doubt he can ever run operations again. Not to mention TF hasn't been providing EPF,SOCSO,EIS (these are provident funds contribution and employee insurance which is compulsory to provide in Malaysia by the employers) or Tax for the employees it's only a matter of time before they die. Still it was a refreshing experience for me. I guess I don't have family commitment so I didn't come out bad from this.  Can't say for the other employees who quit their stable job to work for this scam start up.

Also it was brought to my attention that the status of this company was brought up by an Estonian media :

[https://radar.postimees.ee/4294645/radar-avastas-veel-pikantseid-seikasid-malaisia-reisist](https://radar.postimees.ee/4294645/radar-avastas-veel-pikantseid-seikasid-malaisia-reisist)

As of 21st July 2018, TF sandbox license to operate in Singapore has expired. The sandbox was actually the effort of the previous Managing Director but somehow the founder/chairman took the credit all to himself. Recently he attempted to hide bad glassdoor review by changing the company's profile to make it seems like it's a different company but with the same business name."

I'm a sophomore CS/Math undegrad doing a summer internship at a small consulting firm doing fullstack engineering, while taking summer classes. I am a month and few weeks into this internship and I'm currently feeling very overwhelmed and wondering what the best course of action is in my situation.


I am currently building a full stack web application, that automates multiple games previously done manually by the company, from scratch with ReactJS (a framework I never used before) and the place I work has no other technical staff so I am basically self-managing the project with another intern. I'm basically learning everything as I go regarding the framework and while rewarding, it's highly stressful and frustrating when I have no mentor and there are deadlines to meet. 

The biggest issue is that I feel as though my boss/manager doesn't understand what programming a fully-functional, deployed project entails as he expects the product to be finished in less than three months. They also expect us to teach them how to manage the app, along with the frameworks, languages, and other technical intricacies, once the product is complete which I find a little odd and frustrating.


I feel as though they have hired interns to do full-time software engineer's job and I'm afraid that I cannot perform up to their expectations and feel constant doubt of being able to finish the project on time. The other intern I work with is a Master's graduate so I feel like she's competent in her work so idk what her sentiment is. I should also mention that I have to leave earlier than expected anyway due to a Fall internship with NASA.


I realize that I don't really have an obligation to finish the project as I have no intention of working with them in the future, but I feel guilty of bailing when I signed up to do it in the first place and the people I work with are very kind as well. At the same time I can't focus on my summer class and feel constantly stressed due to my anxiety.
I understand that this is real-life and I'm going to encounter stressful work experiences in the future and I should feel lucky just to have an internship in the first place, but since this is my first real SE internship exp, I'm wondering if this is normal or if my complaints are valid to an extent.


Thanks for any advice/input!

8xis21,2,2018-07-09,[TX] Retaliation due to calling workman comp for failure to follow restrictions?,retaliation2018,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8xis21/tx_retaliation_due_to_calling_workman_comp_for/,"So ive been on light duty restrictions for an at-work fall since May 2nd of this year. I work for a city government department. 

My job has only followed this restriction maybe a handful of times. Basically it limited the amount of walking I was allowed to do per day.  

About a week ago I went back for my 8ishweek follow up, the doctor said it should've been healed by then. But it wasn't, still caused a lot of pain when I walked too much...usually after about 4-5 hours. I made sure he knew they were not following my restrictions (my SO was in the room as well as an intern so I do have other people to verify I brought it up).

He upped the amount of walking I could do, set a 2 week follow up and said if it's not better by then he will have to send me to another doctor not related to workman comp and it would be on my insurance and I would have to pay for it all. That follow up is this next Monday  (a week from today). They still are not following my restrictions. I get maybe 15min-30min not including my lunch of off my knee tk me which is barely a 1/4th of what I should be getting per Dr orders.

Today, I finally got the courage to call HR for the failure to follow restrictions (and they KNOW they aren't but they use the excuse of ""well were short handed you have to do it anyway""). They sent me to their workman comp person who recorded my statement and later called back that afternoon for my supervisors name. 

About an hour after that call, my supervisor and the director of my job come into where I am standing working - a position I have been doing 2x a week for the past 3 months - pulled me out and basically demoted me stating they were going to ""cross train me"" in a different position. A position that is 100% sitting and does nothing to help my knee as my Dr wants me moving as much as possible but still follow my restrictions. 

My coworkers all texted me later asking wtf happened, why were they so pissed off when they came and took me and why was I being cross trained so suddenly? They were very short, to the point and you could tell they were MAD. The only correlation is that I called the HR workmans comp the same day. There was no other reason to suddenly pull me from a very important task (that they say I do a wonderful job at and keep me doing the 2x a week necessary because I am quick at it).

It honestly feels like retaliation. When I try to bring up the sudden change of action they are curt and cold shouldered towards me. I feel very unwelcome in my position and job now and a coworker feels like it's retaliation what they did. 

Is it? Do I have any recourse or where can I start? I already called the workman comp lady to let her know what happened, I had to leave her a voicemail but will try calling again in the morning. 

More info - there is another woman on restrictions due to a heart condition. Not suppose to bend over more than 2hours a day. But they have yet to cross train her to a sitting position that is more accommodating.  They have more than enough paperwork to keep me busy for 2hours sitting and the rest doing my normal position. They have also already written me up due to mistakes that are caused by my restrictions (I can't get overtime on light duty, preventing me being able to go back and check my work like I use to to make sure everything was entered correctly). 

My doctor also wants me walking this 6 hours a day. He wants me walking both at work and at home, and actually got onto me at my last appointment due to me trying to take it easy at home. He wants me walking and trying to work up to the regular amount of walking I did before my injury. I use to walk about 10miles at work and then a few more at home. 

Tldr - called workman comp for job not following restrictions, they have demoted me and are treating me rudely since getting in trouble. I do not know if my demotion is permanent or temporary. Is there something I can do for the Retaliation? Is this really actually retaliation?"

(I don't mean to come off as a braggart by this, to the contrary I'm very humble, but I wanted to give context without being specific.) I also have a lot of practical knowledge (backend web, mobile, and more) that I excel at more than the theory I'm tested on in CS classes. I have taken 1 Data Science class, 1 Intro to AI, and 1 practical ML class in my university.

I'm really interested in Big Data and I'd like to work on stuff related to it and so after thinking about my math and coding skills, I'd like to try doing DE work since it seems like it doesn't require advanced degree and/or math knowledge like Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer on average.

There seem to be many resources to learn on Coursera, Udacity, Edx, Udemy, etc but some seem very theoretical, lack instructor support, and/or are too short. Of course, it's hard for me to properly evaluate the quality of the courses due to my lack of DE knowledge. The Big Data ecosystem is huge and realistically I won't be learning most of the relevant tools, processes, etc quickly, but I'd like to get started somewhere and I feel lost deciding between so many learning opportunities without guidance.

Moreover, I've only seen a few (short) posts on the internet and Reddit describing requirements for a Data Engineering intern as well as what the experience is like for them. The very little info in these sources makes it hard for me to figure out what a(n intern) position in the DE field would be like and thus makes it harder for me to commit to learning relevant stuff and get excited about the different types of work I might be able to do.

All this said, I have seen various DE posts out there, but they seem to be targeted towards people already in industry, but I'm trying to figure out how to get started.

tl;dr 1) How should I start learning/practicing DE-relevant stuff? 2)  What would it take to get a DE internship?"

I hate it so much. I work for a retailer I've been at since I was 18. I'm now 21. I have been working there for 2 years part time and ever since I got accepted to my university, I work there seasonally. I have already told my last day for the summer because I go to school a few hours away. I'm trying my best this coming school year to intern to manage social media accounts for businesses. I have experience doing data entry and remote work. I'm working my way towards my second degree. I just feel like no matter how hard I try, it won't be good enough. I hate it. I feel like I get paid nothing for everything I try to do. I'm tired of having to help people who do nothing but scream at me because nobody else will. I'm tired of feeling like I'm doing everything wrong. I'm expected to know everything from when I was trained a year ago and left alone when I need help the most. I'm so sick and tired of it. There's no job opportunity in my hometown. There's nothing but crackheads and my school is my only escape. It's full of opportunities for me and I'm doing my best to take advantage of them. I'll have a little bit of money coming in when I start school because I want an internship desperately. I have a business degree. I don't deserve to be screamed at and talked down to. I'm saving every penny I can to escape but I just don't feel like it's enough. I hate being here and I can't take it anymore. I'm so depressed because I still live at home when I'm not at school and it seems like time is just moving so slowly. I'm trying to save to move by my school and I'm trying to see what jobs I can get that aren't anything to do with retail. It's so hard, I feel like it's hopeless. My anxiety is through the roof and almost every day I go to work, it's hell. Sometimes I just think about driving off the road so I don't have to go in. I pick up extra hours not because I want them but because it's the only way I can make any extra money. I'd rather strip than do this any day. I don't want to go back for my breaks but I don't know what I'll do for money then.
A few years ago before I transferred schools, I was raped in my workplace. The person who did it has since been fired but I have never felt the same since then. I never told anybody but one person and they said I'd get fired if I told anybody, so I didn't. This has only added to my anxiety. I have never felt the same while I've been at work. It seems like every day has been nothing but a nightmare I can never escape from.

I don't know what to do. I have about 20 more days left until I leave to go back to school. I don't know if I can make it."

I'm a rising senior in college currently interning in the summer and have recently got an apartment for the summer months to work near my internship. The area, however, is pretty unsafe, and quite a few of the windows have gunshots in them. I didn't check out the area beforehand, so that's on me.

However, the apartment does not look like what was advertised in pictures, and the amenities that accompany the apartment are different as well. Additionally, for several nights in a row, we have had no air conditioning when it was included, because the owner is working on a construction project in the unit above mine and my roommates, causing sawdust to creep into my roommates room.

I have attempted to call him, but his voice mail box is full and he won't answer requests to stop construction at night. Myself and my roommate have work on the weekdays, so we're just trying to get to bed. Normally I'd be good with confronting someone, but given the area, I'm looking for advice on how to navigate it without something happening. Is this something I should consult someone for or just deal with it?

I am doing an internship this summer and I have the opportunity to continue remotely throughout the school year. However, I was a course tutor for the CS class freshmen at my university have to take this past semester, so I also have the chance to continue that. I definitely will not have time to do both because both are supposed to be ~10 hours a week.

I am not quite sure yet if I want to go to graduate school yet or not. I think I will if I do not get a job offer I really love and want right when I graduate. I personally think that continuing the internship remotely would look better on my resume but I do not actually know. My internship is at a well known company, but not one of the big 4.

On the other hand, tutoring allows me to network with students at my school, especially with other tutors for the course. It also gives me the opportunity to become closer with the professor leading the course. Continuing tutoring also allows me to have the possibility to become a TA in the future.

Just for some context, I am going into my 2nd year of university. I am worried about which decision to go with, in case I miss out on the better option. I enjoy both my internship and tutoring, so I would be happy either way. I just wanted to know what experienced people’s opinions are on this, since I do not know myself which one looks better to employers and/or for applying to graduate school in the future.

I graduated with a computer science degree in May, no internships but some interesting projects and a relatively high gpa (3.86) . A week after I graduated, I applied to a batch of positions and got 1 rejection and no reply. Two weeks after that I applied to another batch of positions and got 4 interviews and accepted the first offer I got. Why? Because I was scared as hell and desparate for something, I was even offering to work for below average salary when asked during the interviews.

Fast forward to starting at the new job, I sat there with my heart sinking that I made a huge mistake. Not only am I getting paid well below average, but there is around 40-50 internal applications and we are in a team of 3 developers. There is no communication or collaboration between anyone, everyone is working on completely separate applications.  On top everything is done with really old technologies and the applications have quite a lot of technical debt, no tests or documentation of any kind, not even a few lines of comments to explain what this class is for.  The other guy who has been working there for 2 months, everyday he comes in sits down for 8 hours and leaves.  Often days, not a single word said and when you do hear from him, its just the occasional hello or cya tomorrow. I do not want to work like that.

I know the low salary is my own fault really,  I gave a low salary expectation when asked but I also feel like my interviewer misrepresented the position. He made it sound like I would be working in an open room and we would be doing things like code reviews and design plannings. He did mention about the old technologies but also said that he would like to shift them to newer things and that I could work on that.

Instead what I got was sitting in a cubicle for 9 hours ( 1hr for lunch) and no discussion of any kind, design whatever you want as long it works we don't care. No documentation or tests needed, the business just wants to be able to access their data and they don't care how its done.

So after a lot consideration over the weeekend after the first week, I quit after my shift on Monday.  So today I'm back to square 1 again, applying to jobs cold and hoping for a bite. Again I'm scared as hell I won't be able to find something and super anxious to start working, but I want to avoid what happened last time of course so I'm trying to take my time. But at the same time,  am I really in a position to be even a little picky? No internships or experience outside of my own personal projects.

In the last year I did a lot of work in .Net related things (MVC , web api , entity etc) so I was mainly looking into C# development positions and the job I found was C#, but again it was old technologies so legacy web form applications with some sort of home grown ORM.

After looking around again this morning, it seems like a lot of jobs in my area for .Net developers are for more experienced developers (requiring 3+ years of experience), while I actually found a few positions for junior java developers. Should I invest some time in learning Spring + MVC and Maven etc so I can apply to these java positions since they are labeled as junior/entry level.

Anyways just curious to hear what everyone thinks, any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. I can' t help but wonder if I made the biggest mistake of my life quitting, but at the same time I was miserable there and I figured quitting early before either side makes a huge investment was best.

Oh and I almost forgot to mention, after the first offer came in and I accepted, I actually turned down several interviews since I didn't want to waste anyones time. Now I'm regretting it of course. "

I chose it because it fit my multi-cultural background.  Until I finished, my main focus had been sports (I was a D1 wrestler), so I never really thought about what I'd do after college.

After wrestling, I kinda fell in love with travel, and worked at my university's international exchange program. I worked with French students traveling to my school, showed them my hometown, and then studied abroad in France and my french friends showed me their hometown, it was dope. That was about as professionally experienced as I had become in regards to what I wanted to do after college. All my teammates went into sales and made beaucoup $$$... but I thought I was too intellectual for that shit. Stupid me, right?

My dad suggested I take the GRE and helped me apply to grad schools. I got into all of them -- American University, George Washington, and Maryland. I ended up going to George Washington for the Global Communications master's degree. Great school, top 5 in the country for International Relations.

I thought I was gonna be a reporter or something, like a talking head on Al Jazeera. I had no clue what I was getting into, but fuck it -- I had no other plan, and my would parents pay for my Grad School if I went. I'm an only child so they've been saving for this all my life, and it would help get me ahead so I did it. I ended up finishing with like a 3.75 GPA.

This program had no thesis, but had a language requirement instead. I tested out of it because I speak fluent French, and pretty decent Farsi and Spanish as well. I learned NOTHING about journalism, video or graphic editing, professional writing, or anything. No hard skills. Everyone I worked with was very career-focused, was trying to work for the government, and just generally kind of... straight and narrow and not weird (like me) at all. It was a feeder program for the state department and all that, basically. That wouldn't be me, no thank you sir. It was boring for me.

My concentration was International Development so I took like 75&amp;#37; International Development theory courses, and 25&amp;#37; Communications/Public Diplomacy theory courses. A ton of fucking theory. I could talk to you cynically about why international development is bullshit and give you case studies on Rwanda and Grameen Bank for ages, or about whatever theoretical stuff I learned like, 4 years ago. None of it really applies in real life, though.

I also did like, 3 professional internships that were all research and communications, so I got a decent grip on copywriting and social media management. Any fresh-out-of-college keyboard monkey can do that for free though, and it's all about developing subject matter expertise, and at this point I'm kind of a generalist and past the entry-level positions (though I'll take them, fuck it, I'm broke).

After I finished, I worked at a USAID contractor for about a year. After they sucked all the work out of me that they could at the low low price of 40k a year (not much in DC), and we finished the comms stage of our project, I was laid off. I kind of hated the place and the work and the monotonous nature of it anyways.

It was summer 2016, so I went back to my original love -- traveling. I worked for an international service learning company for a summer as a communications guy in Thailand, and then I worked for them again the following summer in Costa Rica leading high school kids on programs. In between I helped a research project in Kenya, and volunteered as a translator for refugees in Greece. Traveled to tons of sweet places. Learned pretty good Spanish.

Side note, I've been a wrestling coach and music tutor my whole life. I love teaching people things and breaking down things I'm knowledgable about.

All of those things were great, but now I'm like ""wtf do I do with my life"". I have a master's degree. I don't think my personality fits IR work in Washington D.C. I'm thinking about getting a TEFL/TESOL/CELTA and being an English Teacher abroad. Maybe in a Spanish-speaking country and I could come home and work as an ESL teacher or as a translator (I loved translating, if anyone knows ways of making a profession out of this). Thinking about maybe even moving to Australia and bartending, fuck it. Maybe try and build a career somewhere here, but I feel like I'm stuck in DC if I do that... and lordt I can't handle this place anymore either.

I know some people might disagree with my decision to go back to school instead of learning on my own and moving into that area through engineering but it is a decision with many factors which I have put a lot of thought into. As it stands I have 20 credits which will transfer from my original degree to my CS degree, and I have completed 3 additional credits this summer. Unfortunately my school has a policy that you must have a certain number of courses remaining before you begin co-op (presumably to aid in scheduling school terms with co-op terms.) 

Unfortunately if I choose to do co-op I can only take 4 more courses total during the fall and winter terms in order to be eligible to enter the co-op program.

As I am a mature (27) student with previous STEM training I'm leaning towards not doing co-op and focusing on doing well in my courses and finishing school. I will also work on some side projects and try to land my own internship during a summer term (probably a tough feat). Is this an advisable approach? I don't want to extend my time in school longer than necessary."

I have decided to switch career fields and am finally finishing up my first college degree (I'm 30 btw).  My degree program gives me the option of either an internship or a capstone project to finish the degree which I will need to complete closer to the end of the year.  I would prefer to find an internship, as I would like to get my feet wet in the field before jumping in.

Please let me know what I can change in my resume to make it more appealing for a career in IT security (or IT in general).

My career is a bit of a rollercoaster.,DawnTreador,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8xvt6m/what_next_my_career_is_a_bit_of_a_rollercoaster/,"Hello I.T. Redditors! I'm looking for suggestions on how I can become more rounded for being a sysadmin, although becoming a network admin wouldn't be so bad. Here's a chronological readout of my news ticker over the years:

1. I went to school, got a bachelor's called Computer Networking and System Administration where I learned about Linux, Windows, networking with a plentiful portion of Cisco, security by means of ""having a good offense is your best defense"". Every class related to my major had a required hands on lab so that not only were we being told how things work, we got to experience it as well.
2. I got a job as a DBA in a Microsoft shop. I did SQL development, tested software, consolidated systems, and learned a lot about politics. Politics eventually worked their way into my tenure there, and to make a long story short, I lasted over 3.5 years.
3. I was out of income, and took up a position as a first level tech for a local government. They couldn't get approved for a full time/permanent position, so I was the ""intern"" for 6 months
4. The Monday after my last day at said government, I took a job as a first level tech (not help desk) at a very large healthcare company (medical side of healthcare). I'm not on the help desk, but I'm also not where I am satisfied.

In the meantime, I've run a mix of Linux and Windows server at home on a production grade server using different hypervisors like KVM and virtualbox. I also have a production grade switch that I've set up to keep up on that side of my knowledge. I've on and off studied for CCNA and Security+ exams, which I have had a difficult time funding until recently.

That's me! Is there anything that I should do that would really stand out? I have a very strong will to work my way up to a spot where I feel challenged and can look forward to figuring out more complex problems."

There was a lot of drama about my grades in 8th grade (took classes at my HS) and 9th grace as I had earned a few B's (2 in total) as well as my SAT score (2270, 30 points lower than the 2300+ they wanted).

The pressure really sucked, as did the threats that I'd only end up at a CC, which they think sucks. But I made it despite feeling very depressed and pressured, and an entire week of my dad yelling at me to study for the SAT Math II and SAT US History (got 800 and 780 respectively), to make up for my SAT and SAT chemistry, in which I felt very depressed and suicidal and pressured just like now.

Anyway, it's summer for me now, and I'm taking an English class at a CC, doing work for an internship over the year, going to another internship in 2 weeks or so, and my dad just came into my room and told me that if I didn't graduate from Berkeley with a 3.75+ GPA I'd never get into med school, so I'd be homeless with a biology degree, and that just because I was lying down (tired, less than 5 hours of sleep last night) I wasn't doing anything for my future and wasn't goal oriented enough.

It made me feel depressed, suicidal and pressured again. I barely survived the high school version of this and college is just it all over again. Replace the need for good GPA to get into undergrad for med school and the SAT with the MCAT, and yeah.

Honestly I've just thought of going into teaching, not because I want to but because I could see myself making it through training and such but then my parents wouldn't approve of that either.

Sigh. This is the first time I have cried in months lol. Weeping silently in the bathroom rn and I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to l o l

If I died I'd have nothing to lose, only stuff to gain. The pressure would be gone and I'd just lose consciousness. I have very few happy days anyways so staying alive brings no benefits.

I contemplated doing so during my second semester at Berkeley and I don't know why I didn't honestly. Student Conduct even brought me in to talk about it lol.

And honestly, if this pressure doesn't disappear or something drastic doesn't better my life soon, I should just die lol, no point in being alive. My personal life besides my family isn't that great either. I have some friends and stuff but yeah that's it. I get some laughs, humor, and reassurance out of our conversations but that's it.

And yeah I know I'm in college and can escape for most of the year and that it was my choice to stay home for the summer but the pressure never escapes lol, just because they're not there to yell at me doesn't mean that I don't put pressure on myself and that the pressure isn't there from medical schools and whatnot, and on myself to make something of myself.

I know that life is full of uncertainties but like no one can do anything about that lol and I've just been trying to do my best for myself even though I haven't earned straight A's at Berkeley and am not productive every single minute of my life.

And in terms of life skills, I can't help but be resentful that I'm supposed to be as functional and independent as an adult in their mid-50's (my dad). I'm barely 19--I turned 19 yesterday. Is it fair to expect a 19 year old to know how to live like an adult well into their middle ages?

I honestly wonder whether any other Asian kids or kids of any race in a similar situation have ever killed themselves because of the pressure to succeed academically, professionally, and in other aspects.

Yeah, I know that not every single day will be as heavy and dark as I feel right now but honestly, not much has changed in my life overall for many years, so there's no point in living. There will always be pressure and stuff and I don't have any objective adults to turn to when this happens. I can talk to my friends, but they're under similar pressures and all they can do is offer words of support, not end the pressure from society, from within, or my parents. 

I get that there's a lot of pressure for parents to make sure that their kids turn out fine across the board, not just for Asian parents, but moms and dads of every race, but like the kids are just as scared as the parents about their life and being independent. No one knows what's going to happen 10 years from now, or even tomorrow. I personally get anxious very easily and what just happened didn't help.

Whatever. I just look forward to being released from the clutches of life and all this pressure someday, even if it's from pills, hanging, or jumping out a dorm building window.

Survived HS pressure, weeks of unhappiness, got into Berkeley, now it's time for the same shit again at an even more competitive school, much harsher grading, and higher stakes. There's no end. It's very hard for me to believe that life will ever get better right now. "

Assuming the same student going into any of them - What separates a high value internship or project from a 'box ticking' exercise - and anything in between?  How can a student tell? 
Are their experiences that can be beneficial for learning but do not necessarily add direct value to 'employability'? How can someone tell if they are going to get some ROI on what they are putting in?

Here are some indicators / elements i've been thinking about, would love to hear others or to hear why these might not be relevant!  What do you all think is important?

- Intentional practice of specific abilities, skills and competencies relevant to targeted employment / field
- External stakeholders and constraints to navigate
- Using professional methodologies and tools 
- Ongoing feedback from industry practitioners and opportunities for mentorship, reflection
- Ownership / accountability for decisions in a role
- Authentic objectives, ideally quantifiable deliverables

I would appreciate if you could give me any advice on how to improve my chances or just any general feedback would be nice! I'm hoping to apply in the fall for the spring 2019 admission timeline. Thanks in advance!

* **Academic Goals:** Get accepted to OMSCS and learn the most I can about machine learning.
* **Career Goals:** Currently my goal is to become a technical expert in the field I choose to go to. Currently I am interested in joining Fintech and writing trading software.
* **Academic History:** (GPA 3.16) - University of Texas at Austin - Electrical and Computer Engineering
* **Professional Experience:** 3 months as a Java developer for a University research group, 2 years as a software developer intern at Intel, just started working as a software developer at General Motors for the Data Science and Data Analytics team.
* **Programming Languages:** Python, C, C++, Java, SQL, Javascript (Angular and Node)
* **Personal Projects:** Embedded systems projects with C and Arduino and Raspberry Pi, A few random Kaggle projects to practice some machine learning concepts I learned from online courses, Data visualizations of public data in Python, Weatherbot to tell the weather data outside based on current zipcode...(those are all the ones I can think of at the top of my head right now)
* **Volunteer Work:** N/A
* **Awards:** N/A
* **Additional Comments:** I know my GPA is a bit low, that's mainly because I was working and doing full time school work at the same time (I do mention this in my statement of purpose a little bit).

Another thing I would like to note is that although my degree is in ECE, the majority of my focus in undergrad was in software engineering. So I took Operating Systems, Software engineering, Discrete math, Algorithms, Data Structures, and other courses that are considered the foundation courses for any CS student. 

Given this quick rundown of my credentials, how much of an impact would a well written statement of purpose have on my admissions chances?

So I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I'm currently working on finishing my degree in business, with a focus on information systems (big data) and accounting. Of course, I didn't start out with aspirations in this major, but it just came along as a result of me taking an accounting class one day and also because of my circumstances.

So when I was in high school, I basically got into trouble with the law. Big enough trouble to where I was tried as an adult, let loose in probation but ultimately messed that up too and went to prison for two years. Long story short, I'm an ex-convict, and the conviction took place when I was a juvenile, although the record will stay for a while as it was in the adult system.

I'm currently working on completing my bachelors degree, and doing everything in my power to build up my resume. I have work history mostly in restaurants, as they are more forgiving when it comes to hiring those with a criminal record, but recently I've gotten a couple of jobs as tech support. Currently, I'm actively looking for internships that would pertain to my major.

So you might be thinking, why Thailand?

Well, it just so happens that I am a second generation Thai American. I have a good grasp on speaking Thai, but I have basically no reading or writing skills. I do, however, have a few relatives that do have a few vacant properties that they have offered me to stay in should I move there. They have also offered to ask friends for job opportunities that would pertain to my interests and skills, and it is to my understanding that knowing someone goes a long way in Asia, much more than it would in America. 

I've visited Thailand recently, and it has given me a sense of relief. Living as a felon in America always gives me a feeling of unease. I mean, I've had to go to high school with an ankle bracelet. Of course, all of it is in the past, but having to check in with campus police every semester and also the nerve wracking moment of anticipation of hoping every job I apply to doesn't have a check box where I have to indicate if I have a criminal history makes it seem like it just isn't. 

Although this will seem like someone running away from their problems(and I would agree with you on this point of view), I really just want a fresh start. As a minority living in America with a criminal record, I feel like I am at a disadvantage. My thoughts: if I were to move to Thailand, and having graduated with an American degree, along with being eligible for a citizenship there due to my descent, I may have a good shot at life. Perhaps the only things that are stopping me from going is the fact that I would be leaving all of my friends to live in a country that is foreign to me, and where I know no one.

I have only lived in one city in my life. But I could imagine that if someone were to move, they are either looking for something or running away from something. In my situation, it is both. "

It’s been a month into summer break and I’ve been thinking a lot about the future to no avail. I’m going to be a sophomore in college when school starts and I was thinking of switching my major from biology to computer science. I was a pretty unmotivated kid in high school (but supposedly smart according to others) and bombed biology and computer science. Coming into college, I planned on going into premed. However, I bombed my first semester (took calculus, chemistry, physics, and English) with a 1.5 GPA. I didn’t realize how much studying college required and seeing my GPA at the end of the semester really ripped the remaining bits of confidence out of me. I studied harder second semester and got a 3.6, with A-‘s in calculus (retake), biology, and intro to computer programming. I have a 2.6 GPA right now. I quite enjoyed my computer programming class and was thinking about changing my major to computer science. I currently know only the basics of Python and it scares me that others started computer science in high school and are a lot more knowledgeable than me. I was thinking about studying computer science during my free time this summer but I stop myself when I think about whether or not I should take this path. I want to say that I will work really hard the next 3 years to make sure I come out of college with a job. However, I don’t know how plausible this is and I’m scared of wasting effort and money. The college I go to right now is pretty expensive and I was unhappy there during my first year, but I guess I’m considering still going there in hopes that a better name will get me a job in the future.

A little info about me to add a few more lines to the post. I work in a big company with several branches around the world. I don't work in Tech Support, I'm an intern in Infrastructure department. Just an immigrant being forced to work as an intern due to visa situations. I've been reading a lot of stories lately and a few remind me of the situation that happened on Monday.

One day I arrive to the office and see the new intern with annoyed look. He's the type of cheerful kid, always talking person so that was weird. I asked him about it:  
$Me: Good Morning, what's up $intern?  
$Intern: My pc doesn't work, I've been here one hour doing nothing (He starts one hour earlier than me)  
$Me: Let me take a look.  
$Intern: Sure, it only shows the cursor tried everything and nothing works.  
I take a look of the PC and it only shows a black desktop with the cursor hover.  
$Me: Did you force a restart?  
$Intern: Yes, still nothing.  
Proceeds to manually shutdown the laptop by pressing the button.  
\*My Mind\*: Shhh... Soon all the pain will be over.  
The laptop shutdowns, wait a little while $intern is complaining about doesn't want it to go to the main office to repair the pc (1 and a half hour trip).  
Then push the button and the PC starts without issues and ask for Bitlocker pass.  
$Intern: DUDE! It never worked for me!  
$Me: Luck I guess. \*shrugs\*  
$Intern: You're the fucking best!! Now I can ~~keep watching Death Note~~ resume my work!  


The next day I got greeted with chocolates, not bad at all."

Of course, I still have very little experience in the actual field. Aside from coding little projects of my own, the closest thing I've done in school that was close to devOps (I think) was setting up CI (Travis) and testing tools that would automate the testing process in one of my group projects. While it does get frustrating (having to sift through documentation), there is a tremendous satisfaction knowing that I have all the cogs set up and the machine is up and running.

**What was it that go you into DevOps?** I know software engineering, in general, is a very young field and it seems it's trying to get its shit together and DevOps seems to be more organizational but on a technical level with a strong understanding of how each group can fluidly work together.

I still have a few internship opportunities and one of my first internships was database maintenance. **Should I attempt to try for an internship in DevOps or should I focus more on a programming/developer path (and THEN later, when i am done school, attempt to get into devOps)?**

I would just really like to hear how people deal with constant situations like this.

 I'm a senior engineering student (civil) BUT I'm a girl.. I'm pretty relaxed and grew up with brothers all my life so I like to think of myself as one who can easily get along with guys. Obviously there's a lack of women in the field but I never really put too much thought into it.

This summer I'm doing an internship with the DOT and learning a lot, having an awesome time hanging out with the engineers and listening to them tell stories, but some days I am around the contractors, construction workers, and the public alone (basically in charge of making sure the workers are doing their job and testing material). Anyways I can usually shake stuff off but the past three days, there have been three instances back to back that are making it hard to just brush off.

Monday:
Old guy from his house comes to my car door to complain about how long the project is taking yada yada (this one weirdly put me in a good mood because I just laughed it off). He's about done with his rant and I say something like, ""yeah I'll let the crew know"" and he proceeds to reach into my truck and grab the front of my baseball cap and give it a couple tugs while saying, ""atta girl"". Okay f**k off old man. And I understand old timers will often feel comfortable enough to touch you in some way so I didn't care too much but still gave me an irritated feeling. 

Tuesday:
Older gentleman in his car approaches a construction worker so I pull up to check it out. The guy is basically yelling at the worker about his lawn (this is in the country so it's not really a lawn but more so the ditch). The worker just says sorry I don't really know where I intervene by offering my help to which his initial response is a snear, but then he notices the DOT logo I believe, so he walks over. 
""This project should have been done in 2 weeks and it's been 5""
(It has absolutely not supposed to take 2 weeks and I don't know where he pulled that number from) 
""Well I'm sorry sir but there have been weather issues and mechanical difficulties, the end date is set to be this Friday though""
Basically goes on a 15 minute rant about how much work he's put into his yard and how we ruined it and how one of our plows broke his mailbox, *it's the summer currently so no plows?* 
Then he does an odd shake (out of anger?) then asks what I'm doing sitting in my car. I tell him I'm on the engineering crew and am in charge of monitoring the workers. He does a weird snear again, and walks off shaking his head. 
""Have a good day sir!""

Wednesday, Today:
This one is from a contractor and is long so in short he was talking crap about the DOT technician that's working out here with me sometimes and I defend him with jokes because that's usually how I deal with off situations. The contractor is also sitting in his pick up the entire time so I don't know what his motive was. The guy got me when he says, ""well the construction crew is out here doing the hard work all day in the sun and you two sit in your cars, I know you're a girl but ______ is a guy and could be helping"" 
It's important to let you know we're not allowed to touch any of the work equipment because it is simply not our job and we're just here to monitor. I always think how I would absolutely hate to do construction work but engineers don't really get their hands dirty often (last summer I definitely got my hands dirty) so I was pretty offended by this. He was still kind of talking like that so I just said, ""yeah.. well see you around!""

I need advice on how people (young engineers, women in male dominant fields, etc.) deal with this besides brushing it off. Search engines just have articles on ""why women quit their jobs because of male criticism"" or ""how 4 women are changing the world of engineering"" and it's just not advice so much as it is whiny stories or puff pieces on the gender gap.

Tl:Dr
Work with lots of old grumpy men who lived in a time where women weren't engineers or in other male dominant fields, Google search tips are worthless, pls help."

Will this have a negative impact on me finding a job out of College, or will getting internships and doing projects be enough background to help me get a stable job out of college?

I found this note from my daughter yesterday after work. She just completed her first year in college. She’s been working at an internship for the summer near the university since there are few jobs in our little Arizona town. Contrary to all expectations, she has informed us that she eloped to an unknown location. However, I am afraid that the note may indicate that my baby is in grave danger. Here it is:

&gt;Hello mom and dad. I just wanted to tell you that  
&gt;  
&gt;everything is okay. I have decided to elope with my new  
&gt;  
&gt;love, Charles. We adore each other so much.  
&gt;  
&gt;Please understand that I will never return home.  
&gt;  
&gt;There is a time in everyone’s life that they must start their  
&gt;  
&gt;own. And for me, that time is now. I must leave the  
&gt;  
&gt;rural for the tall trees. This is best for the  
&gt;  
&gt;two of us. I am safe. Do not worry. He makes me  
&gt;  
&gt;unnaturally happy. This is the truth,  
&gt;  
&gt;really. Sorry for leaving on such short notice.  
&gt;  
&gt;Evelyn.

I found it after work yesterday evening. It was peculiar to receive a letter on my doorstep, and with no return address. Anyways, I read it. My wife works from home, so, after walking in the door and looking at the letter, I called, “Honey! You need to take a look at this right now!” She ambled into the living room from her office. Normally, she would be unhappy that I demand her presence, but she must have seen the concern on my face.

“What’s going on dear?” she asked.

“Evey eloped.” I quavered, handing her the note. She read it.

“Where did you get this? What is she thinking?”

I responded, “It was on the porch. Seems like she doesn’t want us to find her from a return address.” We were both reading the letter now.

My wife confessed, “She tells me all about the boys she likes. She didn’t say anything about a Charles. She is smarter than this: eloping on a whim! I knew sending her to that liberal university would ruin her!”

“Well, maybe this is a practical joke or something,” I offered.  We called our daughter, her employer, and her friends.  No return from her, no leads, and no knowledge of a Charles.

“This is her handwriting Tim! Look, I can show you some letters that she sent me from college.”  She produced some letters from her dresser. I compared the typefaces of the recent letter and the other letters.

I concluded, “You’re right.” I massaged my temples to remain calm. We cried for a good bit. There were no more words, just tears. Holding and being held by my wife did not bring any relief from the tragedy. Though speechless, I know that we were both heartbroken at the thought of our daughter’s life being ruined and never seeing her again.

Once my wife took some sleeping pills to knock herself out for the night, I examined the note on my own. The initial shock had passed, so I had the space and silence to take inventory of Evelyn, myself, and our relationship. I drank for the first time in a while. A sudden elopement was truly the last thing I expected from my daughter. She was doing well for herself. She was working towards a chemistry degree and had straight A’s. Evelyn always made good decisions too. We never caught her doing anything worse than being a few minutes late for curfew. And, besides some blemishes, my wife and I had decent relationships with our daughter.

After reading the note dozens of times, I could not help but notice that the letter was so poorly written.  Evelyn is very smart, and a great writer. Her mother is a copywriter after all, but Evelyn’s goodbye letter had terrible composition.  ‘Rural’ cannot be an object; it is not a noun.

“Leave the rural for the tall trees,” I whispered to myself, reading aloud. ‘Tall trees’ is what Evelyn called California as a child. We took two trips to the Redwood Forest when she was about five years old. She had trouble pronouncing ‘California’ so we accommodated her by calling it the ‘tall trees.’  I suspected that Evelyn was speaking to me in code. That made some sense because we did like to use the Pigpen Cipher when she was younger. It was once our little daddy-daughter activity to write secret notes to each other.

Here is the part that terrorizes me. I started looking for other codes. I found that the first letter of every line forms: ‘help torture.’ That is when I knew that my daughter had not eloped! She is being held against her will! I suppose that her kidnapper forced her to write this note to prevent an investigation. Evelyn left me some clues to find her! I resolved to go to California tomorrow to look for my daughter and that bastard who took her. I have already called the police station. They said that they will get in touch with us once the detective comes back from vacation. Wish me luck.

I graduated in May with a double major in computer science and cybersecurity. I am currently in a financial internship with a cybersecurity twist. The only relevant fact is that it has nothing to do with CS or SWE. 

I’ve never had an internship or job in the computer science industry and I want to change that.

This internship is definitely fun, and was worth trying. It’s a stressful 9-5 along with commuting so I really don’t have much time for applying to jobs or nailing down my CS fundamentals or personal projects and all the kinds of things to do at home (I also just heard of LeetCode?).

My dilemma: I’m home and usually showered by 7pm. I go to sleep at 10pm as my commute requires me to wake up at 6am. I am a very social creature and my social life is important to me. So is sleep.

I just need you guys help me figure out what my plan should be. I have Saturday’s and Sundays off, and this internship ends on August 17th. 

There is a time constraint for looking for a position but my parents aren’t the kind of people that are going to kick me out because I’m struggling to find a job (thank god).

You’re welcomed to flame me, as I can handle it. Thanks!

And of course, every job listing I see is only interested in people who already have those first 2-3 years of previous industry experience, even for positions in local community banks and similar.

I'm very much looking for low(er)-salary, lower-hours / stress.  As in, I'd have a preference for a position asking 35-40 hours a week making $40K a year than to work 45-50 making $65K.  This is mostly because of some minor disabilities that would make a high-stress, long-hours position a very poor fit for me.

However, it is discouraging as I only got this internship because I had a connection, I must've applied for 50+ internships and this is the only one I got an offer from, again I had a connection. However I moved past that and was grateful that I at least landed something. 

1) At this internship I have been introduced to many different tools -&gt; kubernetes, ansible, terraform, etc...however, I am feeling very overwhelmed and way over my head. Configuration and all these tools being used at a large scale just isn't making any sense to me. What should I do in this situation? I have been watching youtube tutorials, reading documentaion, trying to set things up myself, yada yada. My managers will answer questions if I ask them and are nice, I like them, however they are clearly very busy and have much more important things to do (more to come on this later), so I try to limit the questions I ask. Should I just continue to try and teach myself as much as possible and keep trying to understand their infrastructure? Or is their another path I should take.

2) This internship will last until the beginning of September, per the offer letter, which is relevant considering I am done with school and will need to have a job to pay the bills. As a result, I have been applying for jobs since the beginning of June, hoping to have one lined up at the end of this internship, but I have had no success. I have been applying for everything: Software Engineer, Software Developer, DevOps Engineer, Data Analyst, you name it. And I have had countless phone interviews and inquires but nothing too serious. Combine this with the little luck I had applying for internships, it is very discouraging continuing to get rejection emails everyday. It is also becoming more stressful as September approaches. Are there any tips for job searching?  I do not consider myself to be a super awkward and shy person in the phone conversations.

3) Lastly, my internship has offered for me to fly out with them to their headquarters located in a different state, and spend 2 and a half weeks with them as they complete a big project (this is why my managers have been so busy). I feel like this is a great opportunity, but it is also 2 and a half weeks where I will not be able to job search. Thoughts on this?"

Most of the time we discuss how she's treated me. Her most common tactics of abuse have been: cussing me out, calling me names to my face and behind my back (usually when I'm nearby so I can still hear it), and ignoring me for days on end with any attempts at starting a conversation/apologizing met with immediate dismissal. She acts this way with anyone around her, meaning she has no friends and has cut off all but one member of her surviving family. I 100% cannot recall an instance where my mom has treated my dad with sincere kindness and appreciation.

The only reason I moved back in was because my dad said she was starting to act nicer, at least to him. He wondered if maybe she'd started to change since she's getting older.

Well, this was wrong. My mom is addicted to several things -- diet soda, cigarettes, and painkillers -- and frequently asks those around her to buy her these things (she has no source of income). She asked me to buy her soda and I refused. I told her she needs to start drinking water because it's good for her (lately her stomach has been acting up, and I assume the soda hasn't been helping). This was met with an offended, ""Okay, wow"" and immediate dismissal. She ignored me the rest of the day, going as far as to blow cigarette smoke in my face when I was in the same room as her (side note: when in direct proximity of cigarette smoke, I involuntarily gag; for some reason, I've always been super sensitive to cigarette smoke, camp fire smoke, strongly scented candles, etc..., so this makes the offense even worse in my case. She knows about my sensitivity, making this offense even worse imo).

This happened about three days ago. I have been avoiding her completely, taking routes through the house where I can avoid interacting with her, waiting for her to leave the kitchen so I can eat, etc....

Quite frankly, I'm tired. I'm depressed. I hoped maybe she'd changed, but it seems like she hasn't. At this point, I'd rather have nothing to do with her, but living like this is taking a toll on me and I can't help but feel like I'm just as bad as she is (since she used to give me the silent treatment growing up). What makes things worse is she still seems to care for me -- in her grocery trip, she bought some things that are obviously meant for me.

Do you think it's worth trying to talk to her? It may seem irrational, but my anxiety makes me feel like any interaction with her will be life-ending.

TLDR: My mom has a history of emotionally abusing me, it happened again, and now I'm refusing to make contact with her while living under the same roof. Is it worth attempting reconciliation?"
8y4d68,5,2018-07-11,VDI and other virtualization models,JamesFrancosHair,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8y4d68/vdi_and_other_virtualization_models/,"Hi,

I am an intern at a local university and was tasked to research some virtualization models and come up with an ""advisory report"" type of thing comparing virtualization solutions.

Basically what they are planning to do is to ""virtualize"" the computer labs and practical classes. The goal is to let students BYOD and do the programming/GNS3/MATLAB/etc. labs without having to install the environments on their machines. The solution must be efficient and free (as in beer).

Being quite a beginner in the IT domain, the first thing I thought of was an OpenStack-based solution. However I believe that it is not very user-friendly (students would have to instantiate VMs on their own) and there would be a lot of OS overhead (each student using a whole VM to run one or two applications).

I have then stumbled upon the world of VDI. I have looked into Ulteo and QVD which are free but I am not sure they can run all applications (still have to check on that).

What do you guys think? Is OpenStack the way to go or should I focus on VDI? If so, which free and efficient VDI solution have you worked with and would advise? Is there a ""private SaaS"" kind of solution to virtualize single applications? What about containers?

Thanks!"

The internship is with one of school’s departments and I have been working full time over the summer and will work part time during the school year.  By the time I graduate I’ll have about 3 years of experience if I hold the internship.  

I think I have a pretty good opportunity to get in a wide variety of software development experience, I’ve been doing some web development and will have the chance to work on projects I’m more interested in the future and I’ll also have a good amount of time to finish these projects since I’m expected to hold the internship until I graduate.

My question is would it look better to hold this one internship that I work in year round for the next 3 years or should I be actively looking for internships that are maybe more “prestigious” with larger companies and try to find multiple different internships by the time I graduate?

Thanks for any help in advance."

I'm located in the US, east coast. I've been in college for approximately 4 years now, and I'm in my early 20s. Some years ago, I transferring from a small college to a university, I lost a few credits and switched from IT to CS.  At the larger university, I failed Calc 2 and passed it the second time (which I've been informed is relatively common by an older associate of my father's), and have been struggling with depression and anxiety, which is beginning to manifest as a loathing for the direction my life is leading.

I'm approaching the final stretch of a CS degree, and have completed Calc 2 and Data Structures/Algorithms, which, at my university, represent the threshold in order to progress to the upper-level classes. I'm enrolled in the Cyber Security track offered as a part of the CS degree, but it's taking a long time to get out of college.

My situation is that with a CS degree without a track, I could graduate at the end of Spring 2019. That's 5 total years of school. I'm getting a little burnt out on academia, and I'd like to move out and start making real money before the age of 30 sneaks up on me. On a personal note, I have a slightly older autistic person that is closely involved in my life, and I fear that my life will begin to mirror that person's if I don't find more ""adult"" employment within the decade. I often compare my age to my peers/competition, and I feel like I'm more stupid or lacking because it's taking me longer to get the same degree.

If I remain in the Cyber Security track, as I am currently enrolled in the track, I cannot graduate until the end of Fall 2020. That's about 6.5 total years of school, a long time. The track offers classes like Operating Systems Security, Application Security, etc., and has two capstone classes that are hands-on/lab-based. It's the capstone classes that enticed me to join the cyber track, as they are practical instead of theoretical. However, in the time between now and those classes, based on my situation, I'm also forced to take a gap semester in Spring 2020 as cyber classes are only offered in the fall, so in that time I'd try to get an internship. I have a casual employment set up with a sizeable defense contractor, but it's nothing serious until closer to my graduation date.

Much older men (60+) in my life that are in the CS field say to pursue cyber security, and they think cyber is going to be a booming industry. Slightly younger men (50+) I know in the military also say this.

So, what am I to do? Is cyber security worth the additional 1.5 years to pursue over trackless? Will employers notice the time it took me to get a degree, or my age? On a personal level, it has impacted my self-image, but that's beside the point and I will cope. Are there even any entry level cyber security jobs, or do they all require prior experience like what I see on Indeed?"

8y4sik,2,2018-07-11,Will a BAS in App Development from a community college get me as far as a CS bachelors from a large university?,taternut,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8y4sik/will_a_bas_in_app_development_from_a_community/,"First, thank you for your input. 

I am in my mid 30s and will be moving to Seattle soon. I already have an associates degree in medical lab technology and have been working as a lab tech. However, I have wanted to work in programming since high school, so I have decided to go back to school.

There a couple of opportunities available in Seattle. One of the community colleges actually offers a Bachelors of Applied Science in Application Development. This is a very appealing program, as I will be working full time and it's geared towards working adults. It is also much more affordable than a traditional university. The website states that they focus on Web application development, mobile application development, cloud computing, and relational database technology, which are all in my interests. They also offer a mentor-based internship towards the end and portfolio building throughout the program. They are accredited by Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

The other option is getting a CS degree through the large state university. While this degree may hold more weight, it may be more difficult financially and with scheduling. 

I do have some experience with HTML/CSS/JS, and web development/app development has always been in my interests. Is there a substantial advantage to attending the better known state school or will the focus specific bachelors from the community college be enough to get my foot in the door for interviews?

I was recently fired from a job. It wasn't for anything illegal, harassment, other gross misconduct or anything like that (no specifics for anonymity), but I won't be able to use them for a reference. I am an engineering student who is about to graduate in a month and worked at this job in my field as an intern in from my university for a summer two years ago and then was hired on until recently.

My debate is what information, if any, from that job I should put on my resume. It would be nice to list something so that I can say I have experience working in my industry and list skills that I used there, as well as having a smaller gap in work history. I am considering putting down that I interned there for a summer two years ago but not providing any references, but that feels like it would be a bad idea. I will likely be applying for similar jobs in the same area as the employer who fired me.

**If I did that, what are the chances an employer would cold call the company even if I don't provide contact information for them?**

My other option is just to leave it off my resume completely and apply for entry level jobs with just my bachelors degree on my resume.

I'm not sure how much of my work history potential employers will investigate1. I assume if I am offered a position somewhere they will run a criminal background check on me using my SSN, so I don't know if that might show up and cause issues.

**If I was to leave this job out completely, would it cause problems for me?**

I also have no other work history from my time in school that would be relevant to an engineering job, and didn't work for about 2 years before this job either, living through a combination of student loans and living with family. Before that I just have some food service for a few years between high school and college.

**Will having no job history hurt my chances at an entry level engineering job?**

Lastly, I applied for unemployment but don't know yet if I will get it. If I am on unemployment while applying or being hired at a job, will that raise any flags about why I am on it?

Any other advice is welcome. I'm not sure if there is any other information to include, but I can add any more details as long as they aren't to specific to me.

Thanks for taking the time to read."

It's a developer position in a ""code farm"" environment. I absolutely dread programming despite passing the few programming courses I had with A's. I accepted the offer because everyone is constantly reassuring me how good it would be to have the company name on my resume and how much I'll learn. 

I start on Monday. No idea what I'll be doing but I'm getting panic attacks just thinking about staring at code from 9 to 5 (more than likely 9 to 7+).

Is there anything I can do to prepare? Should I just stick it out for at least a year regardless of how daunting the work may be (common suggestion)? 

How soon until I can voice my desire for a more client facing role? Again, I'm a fresh graduate - I don't know how much leverage I have (thinking 0).

I know almost everyone says this but I got it bad, like put it off till last minute then decide to do it late then just don't do it cause its already late so fuck it (and this applies to everything including homework, shopping, texting people, etc). I am pretty smart (and have a big dick and sex eveyrday haha im so awsum) but I would give up all of the iq points to be able to actually sit down and get something done. 

So i just graduated high school, barley, and my parents made me get a summer internship at a company my dad works for. I did this last year and they pretty much had me doing nothing just some basic filing so I knew it was gonna be super boring. First day, in the HR department, and they have nothing for me to do. I just sit their while they start looking for paper for me to shred. Its pretty obvious they don't really need me and I'm probably making them work harder than normal. At the end of the week my employer gives me a big stack of awards and performance reports and I'm supposed to scan them and add them to peoples files, no biggie I did this last year. i happen to know that this is pretty much all the have for me to do the whole summer from the previous year, so I figure I'd take my time. You know, scan one paper, read reddit for an hour, scan another, take a 2 hour lunch break, then go home. They put me in a little office space with a computer and for the most part the whole office just leaves me alone. So I'm in a closed office space with a computer, also my friend works here and also has nothing to do... basically we just grind zelda on his switch in my office for a week straight. I literally get nothing done. The next week nba free agency start (fuck the lakers pg and russ 4ever) so I just f5 nbareddit and watch basketball highlights. Of maybe close to a thousand documents I've scanned and filed 30. Thats a fucking lie I've done 2. 

This last week someone in the HR office took a vacation so I've been at her desk which is in the same office space as several other employees and my boss. Which means I put my head down, turned off the distractions, and grinded out my work. Just kidding, i was just discreet about my reddit usage, you know quickly switching tabs and closing out of browsers and biting my lip so I don't lol irl. The last 2 days my employer keeps asking to check some of the filing to make sure I do it right. She Literally just wants to see one person with a couple of files it would've taken like 5 minutes. But genius me I put it off and tell her some bullshit and tell her I'll show her later and then take an extra long lunch break or just go home so can avoid her. 

Today she come by and seems kinda annoyed which is weird cause she's normally pretty happy so I'm already a little on edge. She then asks me how much of the filing I've completed. ""Uhhhh well \*I'm clicking on the computer and making big movements so it seems like i'm looking for something"" let meeeee checkkkkkkk uhh it looks like Im almost done with the awards and then I'll start on the performance reports"" She glares at me and trys to look over my computer but the brightness is super low (pro tip) and she can't see anything which is good because there isn't anything there except my work email. She then says, ""really, because I checked the filing system and I don't see any done"". Fist of all how dare she. At this point I had completed 3 documents so clearly she wasn't looking hard enough. Second of all, well fuuuuuck. My brain go's into a primal ""fight or flight or play reeeeeally dumb"" mode and I look at her with what I hope is a quizzical face. ""hmmmmmmm thats weird"" and as I say this I'm wondering if its too late to take a lunch break. I go into the filing system on my computer and look around ans say, ""hmm yahh that's super bizarre they were right here just a moment ago"". She doesn't seem to be buying it and is only getting angrier. I start to say ""I guess I'll just have to restart"" but she cuts me off and at this point reveals that she has already checked with the IT department and learned that I have spent an excessive amount of time on social media. At this point my brain goes into a primal ""fight or flight or stare dumbly probably drooling while you picture your dad grounding you for the summer"" mode and I just some mumble some nonsense about getting to work and she storms off saying how she is going to let the summer intern director know about this. At this point I grit my teeth, get my head in the game, and type this post out. Instead of working. Something is wrong with me. Help pls. If my dad finds out I can forget having a Popsicle after work cause deserts are a privilege also he will ground me and drain my bank account into my college fund which is good but also bad. I will update when more happens

I had the job lined up in early March, and started after I graduated in April. I realized that I wasn’t happy after the first 2-3 weeks. The work is boring, and I feel like I’m not using my skills. The department is small, but my coworkers don’t get along well and I generally don’t fit in with them. It’s an hour and 10 minute drive, which sucks, but before I started, I thought I would love the job and that would make up for the shitty drive. Also, I haven’t had much work to do at all in the past 5-6 weeks. 

I honestly dread going to work. By the time I get home, it’s not even a relief because I am so anxious about going in the next day. I have never had sleeping problems but now I wake up at night and can’t go back to sleep because I am so upset about getting up and going to work. I feel like I’m all alone because my fiancé doesn’t understand how bad it’s affecting me and my parents are no longer with me. 

I have been looking at other opportunities and applying. I had one interview this past Tuesday at the company where I had an internship at, for a job that I think I would love. I feel confident about that interview and I really loved my internship there so I am hopeful that I will get it. However, they informed me that the position has been open for 2 years now and said that the HR process there has stopped them from filling it. I know from the hiring process to get into the internship that it can take months to fill some positions after interviews... 

My dilemma is that I really don’t want to wait forever to leave this job. I am seriously unhappy and it’s starting to physically affect me. I know you’re not supposed to quit before you have something else lined up. But I also worked in a local restaurant all through high school and college, and I know they still haven’t replaced me since I stopped working there after graduation. I could go back temporarily until I find something in my field. I would be making much less money but I would only drive 5 mins to work and I know I would be happy. 

My question is, how terrible would that look to potential employers if I leave this job after 3 months? My previous work history shows that I keep jobs for a long time, up to 6 years. I have never worked in a job less than a year, and the only one that lasted only a year was my internship, which ended after one year. I’m only 22. But I wouldn’t be unemployed. 

Any thoughts, suggestions, or advice? "

8ya64w,1,2018-07-12,What else do I need to know about the cloud?,gentleboys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8ya64w/what_else_do_i_need_to_know_about_the_cloud/,"Last semester I helped my professor and his PhD student build an app which used Google Firebase and Cloud Functions. It was probably just a few hours a week, but I learned how to use promises in JS and I started to get a feel for building apps in the cloud. 

This summer I just happened to be placed on the Cloud Development team at my company. Haven't gotten any experience really working with the cloud because of some security issues that the company is having, so I am designing a GUI to monitor internal cost of operation for the cloud. Basically just a website that the upper management can go to when they need to discuss stuff in meetings. 

But I have definitely learned a lot about the cloud ecosystem from this experience. If fact this is what I am feeling most confident about learning during this internship. I learned how to communicate on a team at a large company, learn about CI/CD, learned about tools like jenkins and open policy agent used to automate development, learned about microservices, learned about auto-scaling (I was originally supposed to write an auto-scaling algorithm but then the security issue happened before I could get started), learned about PaaS, IaaS, and SaaS, but really didn't get much experience in any of these things (besides communication I guess). 

Does this put me in a good place to apply for cloud internship or full time jobs on cloud teams next summer?

More importantly, **what should I make sure I learn before I leave this team/company in 5 weeks?**"

I wanted to know if there is anyone who knows about careers in cyber security after Cal, and what courses would be important to take to pursue this interest. Looking at what jobs Cal CS majors get, there are very few who work as cyber security analysts or in similar jobs. Also, there are obviously strong networks from Cal at top software engineering companies, but how are those networks for Cyber Security jobs? I know these are very specific questions, but if anyone has any pertinent information, it would be helpful. It is hard to find this kind of information online since there are far less students who pursue this field.

Edit:

Also, forgot to add about what kind of internships to pursue. It seems as though all the CS related internships are only for software engineering. This could be companies, regions, or specific jobs to try to pursue."

I hope to get an internship next summer, ideally in the automotive field, but any application of Computer Engineering would be great. I've networked a little with a company called Denso, but besides that have little direction. Of course, my priority is to do well in classes, but I'm seeking a resume-building project that I can do on the side during the school year. There are a few clubs for student projects, and I'm definitely trying to get involved in that, but I feel like there's something I can do on my own too. I have a passion for cars, and at one point tried to get involved in an open-source ECU project, but these projects are complex (probably beyond my programming skill level) and already complete; just updating and working out bugs. I don't really know how to start contributing to something that big and well-established. I'm teaching myself web development because I figured freelancing could be fun and profitable, but I'm not sure how much that will help me in the long run. I don't really want to be a software engineer; I want something a little more hands on than that. Automotive engineering for a company like Dinan (they tune BMW's) would be my dream job. If anyone has ideas for how to gain experience in a way that will help me land an internship and ultimately a good job, it would be appreciated- I feel like I can be more than just a good student.

Extracurriculars

 FIRST Robotics - I'm the captain of my school's robotics team, where under my leadership, we've expanded our STEM outreach to middle schools in the area, as well as developing a comprehensive training program for new students that enter our program, allowing us to be fairly competitive within the Southern California area, placing as quarterfinalists and semifinalists in our local events. I was nominated to be on the Dean's List by my team, which is an award that seeks to recognize those who have made outstanding achievements in their own team to further the goals of FIRST. In that pursuit, I, in collaboration with the team captain of another team in our area, have started a cross-county robotics alliance encompassing 11 teams so that we can collaborate and share ideas to improve the overall competitiveness of our area.

&amp;nbsp;

 Teaching Middle Schoolers Programming - I'm the co-president of a club at my high school that helps middle school kids how to program in both Java and HTML, which occurs once a week at the high school. We have around 8 tutors, all of which contribute to the teaching of basic programming ideas to middle schoolers.

&amp;nbsp;

 Band - I am in the highest level ensemble at my school, playing the baritone saxophone. As a band, we've been very competitive in local festivals. At our banquet last year, I received the ""Outstanding Sophomore Musician"" award.

&amp;nbsp;

 Science Olympiad - Currently, I am VP of our Science Olympiad team, and historically, I have generally placed in the single digits for my competitions, and I earned first place in Materials Science at our regional sophomore year. Coincidentally, that year we made it to the state competition for the first time!

&amp;nbsp;

 Summer Internship at a Local Startup - I undertook the administrative task of compiling information of high profile tech companies with the goal of increasing exposure for the company, which has developed an innovative solution for world hunger. We are working with the PM of Cameroon to implement this project on a large scale.

Needless to say, I'm pretty happy with the way things turned out :) MIT has been my dream school since middle school and I emphasized that fact in my application lol.

I also wish I didn't forget to send my test scores to CMU and BU until February :( CMU was one of my top schools, but thankfully it worked out in the end.

I have considered the self-taught and bootcamp routes and decided I would prefer a formal education.

Decision: The university I am planning to attend offers a BS in CS, but the only relevant MS offered is in Computer Information Systems. The MS does offer an emphasis in software development and past students have gone on the development roles. I need to decide which to pursue.

Other Information: I will be a full time student, and I have no professional tech experience. I spoke with the faculty and they recommended the MS given my existing knowledge of basic programming and my BBA. My only concern is that CIS might be viewed as ""CS lite"" by future hiring managers. That might be offset partially by the fact that it is an MS rather than a BS. Both programs would take the same amount of time to complete. The BS has a required internship built into the program, while I would be on my own if I wanted an internship during the MS. I would likely try to do an internship during the MS, but I'm not sure if many companies hire grad students as interns.

Any insight would be appreciated!"

I'm thinking of doing an internship this year or next year maybe. I created a LinkedIn a few months ago and I've gotten a few full time offers that I've denied since I want to keep studying for 3 years (to finish my degree and masters).

Today I declined another full time offer and they proposed a summer internship/trainee program for a full time position when I graduate. Probably won't go through since I'm still three years away from that but it got me thinking that I basically understand zero of this.

Are internships generally made by companies so that they get future employees? What expectations should I have, and what do they expect from me?

I probably don't even have the qualifications for this since I'm still fairly inexperienced. I think it's obvious from my profile that I only have two years of college done. Are they expecting more? I had zero knowledge of the field before college. It's computer science by the way.

I always think that I don't have the qualifications but maybe they are expecting this. Or maybe they are expecting more than I have in which case I'll disappoint, which I don't want.

I'm really overthinking this, but I don't really have anyone to discuss this, and have no idea how anything works.

From reading through multiple posts and various forums, I already know that a BS in CJ or PS is already somewhat risky, especially for someone that isn't sure yet what she wants to do. I did an internship that allowed me to explore the court system, specifically the probation and clerk's department, and found out I was definitely not fit for it. I tried being in the debate team in HS when I considered being a lawyer, and I failed horribly in it. My main considerations had been Government agencies such as CIA/FBI etc., and law enforcement overall. I've read enough posts saying that a CJ/PS degree alone was not competitive enough for gov. positions, and therefore have been frantically trying to learn new skills. I am hoping to try and add a minor and am leaning towards CS, but overall I'm just not sure if I am employable for a CJ or PS job, and if I am whether I'd be happy in it. 

I am currently trying to learn Python, HTML &amp; CSS, Blender (the 3D modeling and animation program), and Spanish on my own. I have always liked art but did not major in it because I knew I would start to hate what I loved if I had homework assignments in it. I have decent PS skills (I can design t-shirts, and make decent traditional and digital artwork), and was hoping to keep art/animation on the side for now. Maybe by learning more CS and animation skills, I would be able to go into designing games or character designs. I am now seeing that I should have majored in something like CS, and severely regret dropping the one CS class I took my freshman year. 

I am completely lost and unsure as to what I should do. 

1. Should I still attempt to change my major? Does it matter? 

2. Should I try to get the CS minor? Would it matter at all? Or should I just save myself the stress of taking more classes for a minor and just keep on self-studying? 

3. I have been considering the military, both for CJ career reasons and because I'm lost. Would this be an awful reason? Would this be an awful choice? 

4. Should I just finish the major and forget about CJ, and try to pursue something in CS through going to a bootcamp after graduation or something? 

5. I am eligible for a program at my college that will allow me to get my masters (in CJ) in just one semester (because we would take grad classes in senior year). Should I take this opportunity? Will it even make a difference in my pursuing a CJ career? Will it make a difference in what I pursue at all? Will it just be unnecessary stress? 

6. Does anyone have advice on which skillsets I should look to expand or learn, what skills I already have that I should focus on, or any other options that I can consider? (gap year? peace corps?)

7. For something broader, if anyone has ideas for hands-on or ""creating"" work (either something active or something like making programs, creating designs) that doesn't involve a Bachelor's degree (maybe even if its something I can pursue with a master's) I would love to hear it to expand my options. 

tl;dr I severely regret my CJ/PS major, don't know what I want to do or what I'm doing. Have an interest in many things, but overall confused, lost, stressed, and would appreciate any input or help for future paths. Thank you! "

He states that the company itself doesn’t make money but when I checked their website their description states that, “We are a small R&amp;D company located in NY” with non-profit being nowhere to be found. In addition, he states that the money that he gets from the products he creates go to a PayPal account that the employees control. Then the employees buy the materials for the projects. I have stated that the entire thing sounds incredibly fishy and that with a mechanical engineering degree in process, you shouldn’t be doing unpaid internships. Especially since unpaid internships that generate profit for the company are illegal. When I asked him if the company sounds suspicious, he responded by saying that, “The guy at my internship gives us side projects to build that’s related in our field which we don’t sell, he also put in his own money in case we don’t get enough clients for our side projects.” I want to help my friend but I am unsure about the next steps he should take or if the whole thing is legit in the first place.

8ye3fo,6,2018-07-12,At what point do I remove jobs from my resume?,othermegan,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/8ye3fo/at_what_point_do_i_remove_jobs_from_my_resume/,"So here's the deal, during college (2011-2015) I worked at a summer camp. I worked my way up from assistant counselor all the way to program director which was the second highest administrative/management position. Back when I didn't have a lot of job experience I made sure to have that on there because I worked my ass off to get there. Then there was an ""employment gap"" I guess you could say because my last year at the camp ended in 2014 then I began my final year of college, took on various projects with the university (TAing and interning with two separate departments), and got a job 2 months after graduating. After about a year at my new job I left that and got hired by my current company and have moved from entry level to supervisor to management in about a year and a half. 

I'm struggling on my resume right now. If I just put my last 3 positions held, it looks like I've only ever worked at this company. Previously I've added my TA and Intern experience because otherwise there would be a year and a half long gap where I was unemployed (plus I did get paid for those positions so they were jobs). But they are irrelevant to the industry I'm in now so I want to remove them. 

So I guess the question is, do I remove everything from my camp management experience through my university work and just start the resume with my post college job? Or do I get rid of the TA and intern jobs and hope it doesn't hurt me?"

Entry levels and internship positions are supposed to be for those who are still in college. Most of the time the students don't have any previous experience, hence why they're looking for internships.

Some job postings ask me to fill a ""REQUIRED"" field, which is a previous job experience/previous employer and won't let me continue until I have filled at least one.

I'm only on my second internship so I realize it's probably too soon to make any generalizations but I can't help but let these experiences bring me down.

My last internship had very little work available except for two to three weeks, but my supervisor was very kind and she made me feel like it was okay.

But for my second internship I feel so stressed out. I feel that the people who are running the company are just too cheap to hire enough employees. On our entire team I am the only person fulfilling the role(automations, mobile stuff etc.). There was another fultimer but she was always texting her boyfriend or on wechat and never did any work. I'm not trying to sound arrogant or anything but the work which was assigned to both of us I had to do all on my own while she would dissappear for a four hour ""lunch break "". Then she quit three weeks in and I had to do everything on my own.I honestly feel so betrayed because during the interview she said i was supposed to be helping her and she would give me guidance, and now I do everything.

The other team members help me out but I feel alot of them are overwhelmed with their work too, and it doesn't change the fact that I have so much to do. The boss said that they won't be able to hire anyone soon because apparently the process is very long(over a month or something).

Im honestly just feeling so tired with all this. I can't even quit because the coop program is offerred by the school and apparently they'll kick you out of it if you quit midway. 

The thing is, everyone I talk to says this is real life, or this is the nature of the tech industry.Im wondering how much truth there is to this? Is this the way that things are always going to be? It's not that I'm lazy or don't want to do work, I just wish I could have a balance. Maybe I'm just spoiled from all the freedom they give us in school. 

I only have two and a half months left but I can't even make it through another day. I really just want to quit but everyone says its a bad idea and things will get better. But that's what they said at my previous internship and things only got worse. I worry how I will survive if this is going to be my life. Maybe I am just not cut out for the field. "

The CFA sounds like it would be extremely helpful when it comes to the job search and future career development, but is very expensive even with help from my parents.

School: California Polytechnic State University-Pomona

Major: Computer Information Systems-Concentration in Cyber Security (Information Assurance)

GPA: 3.2

I'm a very tech savvy person, but I have no foundational knowledge in IT. Here is my plan

1. Studying for my **CompTIA A+ Certification right now. Should be done within a month**

2. Going to get very involved with Cyber Security club at school. Also planning on trying to find a job as a helpdesk position to get experience while attending school in my third year of college (graduating in 5 years).

3. I already bought the Todd Lammle book for the CCENT/CCNA and started studying quite a bit before I realized that I'd be better off with getting the A+ first. I made the mistake of trying to go for the CCENT with no experience. **I am planning on studying and passing the CCENT after I pass the A+**

All this should take about six months. And although I can't plan on what's going to happen in the far future, here's my general guideline.

4. **Try and get an internship** over the summer going into my second-to-last year of college. If I can't get a cyber security position, I'll do my best to at least find an IT internship.

5. **Study and Pass the CCNA, then Security+.** Not sure which one I should do first. But either way, I want to have the CCNA and Security+ before graduating.

6. **Find a Cyber Security internship** in my last Summer before going into my 5th year of college.

So in summary, I am going into my third year of college and I realized that I haven't done shit except for maintain a decent GPA throughout school so far. In my ""plan,"" I want to earn the CompTIA A+, CCNA, CompTIA Security+ certifications in three years. Will/Should this be enough to have a solid resume going out of college?"

I had no internship in college so I took the first job I found out of college. I got hired as a health data analyst at a midsize company.

I’m making $40,000 salary with good insurance and I’m eligible for a $5000 bonus every year. To me I’m not making enough for myself but since I have no experience, I find it fair for now.

At my job, I’m becoming really good at using Excel. I’m also learning to master AdHoc, Microsoft SSIS as an ETL tool, several in house software products, and SQL/C++ as programming languages. I feel these skills will help me later in my career. 

I guess my questions are:

1. Is my taking of this job justified even though the salary is very low?
2. When should I plan on leaving this job? How long to stay?
3. Looking at the skills I’m learning, could I transfer over to other types of analytics jobs, say real estate or financial analytics? 
4. What is the most profitable direction to go? Work is work and I want to make money to have fun with.

I basically have to design, write and finish a standalone web application with its own database and mobile app.  My supervisor knows how difficult this is especially for someone who lacks experience, and he decided to help me by setting a timeline that would help me plan my work better. Today, I am supposed to deliver the UI/UX designs, which I had 2.5 days to make. To create those designs, I have to use Adobe XD, a decent piece of software that has one major flaw - it only works in fucking Windows 10 and iOS. Since I hate Windows 10 and everything that comes with it, I have installed it on a VM on my main computer and on an old laptop I have as a backup.  
After creating the basic wireframe mockups and a list of the functions of the UI, it was time to create the actual prototypes of the interface on Adobe XD. I power up the VM, check the screen - HELLO, WINDOWS UPDATE PLEASE WAIT. I wait, and wait, and wait, and the VM tries to restart itself. Then all of a sudden, it's unusable. The update fucked something up (of course) and the VM won't even boot. 3 hours down the drain. I open my laptop, download Adobe XD. SORRY YOU NEED TO UPDATE WINDOWS FOR THIS TO WORK. I open the update service, it's stuck on ""looking for update"". One more hour down the drain.  
At this point I'm fed up, so I try to find the update online somehow and force windows to update itself. I download the media creation tool they offer, I run it (thirty minute shitfest of ""please wait"") and... WE WERE UNABLE TO UPDATE YOUR WINDOWS, RESTART YOUR PC AND RUN THE APPLICATION AGAIN. Somehow, after the restart, the update service finally realised there was actually an update to install, and it started applying. Guess what? I started the update 5 hours ago (2 am). It's 7.48 now and it's stuck on 97%. I need to deliver my designs in 5 hours. FUCK YOU Microsoft.

PS (While I was waiting for all these retarded updates, I tried reinstalling the VM twice. However, Adobe XD refused to work without the latest updates, and the updates kept making the VM unusable. I'm royally screwed)."

I'm worried that I'll have an issue with learning the language within about a year to study at a university, or that my degree will make it harder to get into a US grad school or become employed if I don't (especially concerned about the ones in Russia). Additionally, I'm worried that with European bachelors being 3 years instead of 4, that may present a problem.

Has anyone here applied to US graduate programs after doing a degree abroad? Do you feel that it was a benefit/downside to your application? Did the system of the university (ex. 1 less year and therefore 1 less opportunity to intern or do research) played a role in the quality of your education?

*Short reminder of who I am:*  
LTL, not so first time poster.   
Intern at two companies owned by the same man and solely responsible for the IT these days.  
Generally nothing going on but handling simple problems and looking forward to the next Friday company lunch.  


I got a super short tale that concluded 10 minutes ago.  
Yesterday we put in a ticket with our external IT desk to open FTP connections to our NAS.  
And after a short response asking if we wanted any IP filtering the ticket seemed abandoned (higher priority tickets maybe who knows?).  


Until about 2 hours after I put it in when the NAS suddenly becomes unavailable.  
No FTP, no SSH, no telnet (only internal for emergencies), absolutely nothing internal or external.   


I wobble over to the NAS in a panicked fit to find it's quietly started rebooting. Now this is a 10Tb NAS and it does some verification of the drives while booting so for the next 45 minutes nobody can upload anything. After it finished booting I grab the logs as I want to know who or what queued that reboot.   


Some of you might have guessed it but our external IT desk just rebooted a machine in production under active workload without notifying anyone. General protocol is that quick reboots are allowed but everyone should still be notified before doing so to give them a chance to finish / delay their file transfers.  


I still have to call them over this but thankfully nothing was lost and nobody was uploading anything large.

When I was doing my masters I became aware that I like to code, and actually had some courses involving programming (ranging from C to Matlab and ultimately Python by my choice as an optional course). After finishing college, since I don't really care if I work in a medical environment, and the opportunities at my country of doing stuff related to Biomedical Engineering are just a few, I opted to try the CS route, even knowing I'm not as qualified as someone who took CS in college.


Actually I've got my first job relatively quick, on a known company. The first two months were good since I was working as 
an intern in IoT related stuff, using AWS Lambda, with Python and Alexa. Also involved some electronic stuff (soldering, mounting small circuits, etc) which I've had experience because of my background. After that, unfortunately I was moved to a project just fixing errors (Java), that was already ""burning"" with the client. I also was located in a new building, that just opened recently, and there was a lack of senior people to guide most of the interns. Most of the time either I didn't have nothing to do, or if I did, it was stuff that was boring and not challenging at all. 

So after a full year there, I've decided to leave the company and search for a new opportunity. I went to a interview on a company that I've already knew someone working there, but in a senior position (very high actually). I only had good indications from this person regarding this new company. On the interview, the guy that was interviewing me, just told that I would be working for an IoT project, the interview wasn't very technical to be honest. And that was my mistake, the rush to switch companies, I didn't try to understand fully what I would be doing exactly.

Right now I'm stuck doing support, answering tickets, and searching through logs, and also giving assistance to other persons. I feel like I'm wasting time and not progressing at all since I don't want to do this for the rest of my career. Since I don't have anyone depending on me (kids or wife), I think I'm willing to make the jump and just leave and try to build more skills and actually try to find a job that I have a passion doing it. 
I love Python, my master thesis was done on [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), revolving around machine learning.
I think it won't help me landing a job, so I'm thinking on taking some online courses with a certification in the end of completing it, on Flask or Django, since I know they are actually used a lot today. Should I just jump ship (only 4 months on this company)?



**TLDR: I don't like what I'm doing right now, I feel like I'm not progressing at all, I have a bit of financial stability, should I just leave this company that I'm working only for 4 months, and try to improve my CS skills?**

And sorry for any spelling/construction mistake, English is not my first language."

Once upon a time I posted here at r/work asking for tips about what should an introverted person (me) do in a very crowded work environment (just to recap: I'm an intern in a Software Dev company). And also how to befriend my fellow teammates without being socially awkward. **Result**: Three months later the shyness naturally dissipated, I made significant progress and going to work turned out to be a habit I so much enjoy! I feel A LOT more confident than ever! (Thanks y'all for the tips by the way). A valuable lesson I learned is to give time time. 

So I am entagled in yet another problem: a sarcastic prick of a teammate. I'm an intern, meaning I just happen to NOT know how everything works, and three months in taught me more than I could imagine, yet it is not enough. This guy is a veteran and so knows a lot about coding (more so than my other teammates), being exactly the kind of guy I confess to admire for his intellectual prowess and aspire to one day become like him (or at least close enough). But this chicken-headed ignorant fuckheap as a person is worse than a voluminous moisty pile of feccal matter. Every-single-bloody question of mine turns into a joke. A sarcastic answer which leads me to believe I'm the idiot, as if being an intern means the same as ""clown"" does.

I ask you, dear Redditor, what should I do in those circumstances where I'd very much like to throw this guy out of a window four stories down? (Not literally, mind you heheh). I do not believe complaining about him will do anything, I've got to maintain a professional stance since he's done nothing wrong, he's only being a jerk."

Hi everyone,

Back when I was a senior in high school (4 years ago) me and a few friends of mine got caught drinking at a house party and subsequently got arrested for it. Unlucky enough for me, it was just a few days after my 18th birthday, so i was charged as an adult. The charges have since been resolved (not dropped), however the ""arrest log"" still appears on the town's website, and is one of the first things to appear when you google my name, directly under my LinkedIn profile.

I am worried that this will stray some employers away in the future. It didn't interfere with me getting my current internship, but I am afraid that when I go to apply for bigger companies that they will search my name and immediately associate my name with an arrest log from when I was 18. Is there any way, legally, that I can get this taken down? Or is it a matter of just reaching out to the person in charge of the website in hopes that they are kind enough to do so... any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I'm working on a pretty big project for a summer internship, and currently I'm working with three pieces of data.  These pieces are....

**1.  Total number of ""Days"" purchased by the client.**  (My company does lots of work implementing new software for healthcare providers.  How many days a client purchases determines how expensive the project will be)


**2.  The total number of Days ""approved"" by my company.**  A client might buy ""x"" number of days, but as long as we complete the project within the ""approved"" days our profits will be maximized.  Approved days are always &gt;= days purchased.


**3.  The *actual* number of days it took us to complete the project.**  Obviously our goal is for Actual Days &lt;= Approved Days.  Anything else is considered an overage and we start to lose money.


I want to cluster the first two pieces of data and overlap the two bar graphs so we can see the difference between the two.  For the third set of data, I want to stack the ""overage days"" on top of the clustered bar graph I just mentioned.  Is it possible to do this?  I've looked everywhere and can't seem to find any example where a stack is placed on top of a clustered graph.  This is what I envision it looking like...

Which I'm excited for because I thoroughly enjoy working in IT. Unfortunately my area in Kentucky is relatively low density for IT jobs and most do not pay anything so I plan to relocate. Luckily I have some experience from an internship with my county's Fiscal Court office doing helpdesk work and cost analysis for new hardware directly under the IT manager as well as I developed and implemented a website for the church my parents went to. So I have some experience to show my technical capabilities. 

To graduate I have to take and pass the Comptia IT Fundamentals exam. But I have a version of the A+ and Network+ from my community college that I can show until i take them from Comptia. 

So, to my first question. I plan to relocate to Charlotte, North Carolina due to the amount of work I see posted there. How hard is it to begin a career with relocating? 

Second, should I be looking for Helpdesk level 1 or level 2 positions? I'm not too good for any position but I'd like guidance on a proper starting place. 

Lastly, would pursuing the actual Comptia A+ benefit me or should i bypass it for something better to lead me to being a systems administrator in the future. 

I understand I'm looking very far out but i love systems work and that's where I'd want to settle down at so any guidance there is greatly appreciated. Most of all thank you all for the time you spent reading this and answering any question I presented. "

- Biology internship 
- STEM Club founder 
- YouTube channel with claymation biology videos (obviously I don’t need a ride for this one)

Now, since I’m doing all of these towards the latter end of my senior year, it probably will look like resume padding to AOs. The truth is, I couldn’t really do anything outside of school during freshman-junior year because my parents couldn’t drive me and there isn’t really public transport where I live. If I explain this, will it help excuse the fact that I just added so many ECs the summer before my senior year?

I thought an entry level position at a bank would get me started and then I would get some certifications at the same time to go up in banking.

I started low as an intern and eventually moved my way up to a senior position. I know it sounds a little crazy, but I did it. However I’m finding it hard to be equally compensated as my male peers are compensated. 

Recently, I got a promotion. I know for a fact that the man in my position before me was making 150 K a year and was doing a horrible job because I fixed a lot of the mistakes that he made which drastically affected the company. I’ve been in this position for two months now and when I finally approached my boss about my salary adjustments, he said he would be giving me my raise with everyone’s annual raise. After receiving this raise, I realize that it wasn’t much more than I was making. This brought me at 90 K which means my boss wants me to do the job for 60 K less than the guy before me even though I have an engineering degree and he didn’t have a college degree at all.

When I approach my boss about this, he just said that we will talk about it but is now avoiding me at every turn and not even saying hello to me when he sees me in the morning.

This has not been the first time that I’ve had to fight for an equal salary in this company. I am very frustrated and I am finding that loyalty doesn’t mean much. 

This ordeal, being ignored, being underpaid, has made me want to switch careers. I know you will say that going from 90 K to 150 K is unheard of in industries but my responsibilities have multiplied by 12 and this is technically not a raise but his salary adjustment for a much bigger position than I previously had.

I have applied to multiple jobs in various industries because I want to be in a more inclusive environment where it’s not a boys club and women can be treated fairly and paid equally. I have a lot of anxiety about this, and was wondering if anybody can offer any advice.

Has anyone made a drastic change in their career? Do you have any advice? Or words of encouragement?"

Just had a chat with my manager today and he basically hinted that I'd be getting a return offer at the end of my internship! Only thing is that I'm currently located in an area that's kind of boring. The company is solid overall, but there's nothing that makes me really really want to come back after college. Coworkers are great which is good/manager is cool, but everything else about the company is pretty average. Also, some of the devs worry about the future of the company, but I take everything they say with a grain of salt. I think it'd be awesome to work in a city (NY, Boston, Philly, etc) for a few years, but that will make things a bit harder financially. Basically, based off any of your experiences, what do you think I should do?

A) Accept the return offer, work at a place I'm already comfortable at, decent pay, medium CoL, but boring lifestyle and potentially hit a plateu in regards to learning new things in about a year(based off what some of the devs say)

B) Deny the return offer, look for another job in an area I'd like to live in, better lifestyle fit for me, potentially working with a much more marketable/interesting tech stack, but higher CoL and not have a secured job going into my senior year.

Ultimately, I'm leaning towards B but I'm wondering if anyone has been in a situation like this and has had any regrets in the decision they've made. Sorry if I come off as one of those kids who thinks they have it bad in this field, I'm just genuinely trying to make the right decision for when the time comes!

TL;DR - Probably getting return offer, good company but not 100% on going back. Take the offer and be safe with boring lifestyle/potential work issues or look for a job where I want to live but risk not having an job."

The reason why it's my 5th year is because i'm unable to take extra credits or summer/winter classes due to also having 3 part time jobs just to barely support myself. I'm an international student, and the minimum wage where I live/study is shit and i'm paying for everything on my own. No scholarships, no loans, no financial support from anyone else. So it's been really tough. 

As a result my GPA is just average. Nothing extraordinary. Not to mention that half of my courses are taught in my 2nd language, so it's not even easy to get a good grade in the course if one just studied the material really well. If i could take the same courses in English, I'd have a better chance of getting A's. But my limitations in expressing myself in essays or catching terms and specific material during lectures due to the language barrier make it a double effort than the regular students just to pass the class because i essentially have to study everything twice over in both languages - which takes up a lot of time as well. 

So as i'm looking at my CV/Resume, I'm feeling really depressed. All of my work experience is in retail, bartending, tutoring...all the part-time jobs I've ever been able to do since I turned 20. I can't get any related work-experience, no undergraduate research positions at my school (they don't pay and demand a ridiculous amount of time commitment, it's practically slavery) or internships. My field is linguistics and cognitive neuroscience - so not exactly popular either. 

I have no statistics skills, no computer language skills, and I have a lot of self-studying to do as it is during the summer just to prepare for graduation exams, language qualification exams,  and I need to use my free time to work my ass off to save as much money as possible because i don't have the time (or legal right, technically) to work as many hours during the semester. 

I'm stressing out because if i send my resume to an employer or for grad school applications - they are gonna take 2 seconds to look at it, and they will throw it away because it's beyond nothing special. My GPA isn't stellar and I have no applicable working experience. If i want to get into Grad school admissions committees aren't going to care about how many years I spent making sandwiches or shaking cocktails and dealing with children. They won't even give me the chance to explain my situation to them because my CV is so terrible. 

so now i'm panicking about what value my life has and what all this was worth when it feels like I've just dug myself into a huge pit by having to work so much and put aside focusing on my studies and building myself as a skilled and marketable person who could actually contribute to society...

I'm going to be 30 when i finally graduate from undergrad. I am a woman who wants to date and someday have a family too so i have my damn biological clock playing against me as well. I have health problems so if i tried to have kids past age 35 there would be major complications.

I feel like i have 2 choices: 
1) sacrifice my happiness and forget ever getting married and having my own kids so that i can focus on excelling academically and establish my career and for once make at least enough money that can support myself without living off scraps.

2) sacrifice having a career and academic success so that i can have a social life and actually be able to build meaningful relationships with people and start my own family. 

I really wanted to go to grad school, but looking at my experience and grades nobody is going to want me, and even if by some miracle someone did, i wouldn't be qualified as any other student in the field because i am stupid and know nothing. No lab or real research experience, no statistics or computer skills, not even the right basal degree track...it seems so hopeless and I'm just so exhausted of living like this and i don't see the point.

The last few years, I didn't make many close friends, despite joining a frat and being involved in SGA and clubs. I also had little to no income, so I often couldn't hang out with the people I met or ask girls on dates.

I'm hoping that my life will be exponentially better once I graduate. Hopefully, I will be able to get an okay job that gives me some income. That way, I can pursue some hobbies that I am interested in like golf, fishing and hunting. I'm also hoping my social life will be better. In school, socializing with people often times felt forced and unnatural. Join this fraternity, get involved, etc. The real world doesn't just hand you these relationships through institutions, you have to actively seek them out and be intentional.

8yr1qd,1,2018-07-14,How can I get a high paying software job? I live in Canada.,dontwanttowork1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8yr1qd/how_can_i_get_a_high_paying_software_job_i_live/,"\- I studied computer engineering at UofT and graduated with a 3.9 GPA

\- I have 16 months experience working as an intern in software development, C++, where I've designed a complicated system used by the company. I stood out among other interns and even among all non senior engineers in the company, and demonstrated exceptional skill.

\- I've written optimizing compilers from scratch and wrote a basic operating system (although not very proud of it, to be honest).  I've been programming since I was 10 years old, and have coded projects over 100k LOC.

\- I have reverse engineered large programs before on the Windows operating system.  Such as games and malware.

Despite this I can't seem to get any good jobs. I know some peers from school who aren't half as good as me but managed to get 150k/yr jobs in USA.  Meanwhile all I can get are 50k-65k entry level jobs at small companies.

My goal is to get a job that would compensate me fairly for my skills (at least 90k CAD in Canada, or 100k+USD in USA).

What do I need to do to get those jobs? I can't seem to get interviewed for those positions.  Should I just focus on competitive coding? Should I go to grad school? Open my own business?

My goal is to make as much money as possible, and I don't know how to do this. I'd rather not work than accept a 50-65k job offer, as that is an insult to me in my opinion.  I worked extremely hard as an intern for very low compensation (50k) and don't want to be exploited by a company unless I'm being compensated fairly (90k CAD in Canada, or 100k+ USD in USA)"

Just wanted to share my build! https://pcpartpicker.com/list/ry67Cb
I've just finished ordering all my parts and I can't wait to start building in August, when I get back home after my internship.

This kinda ended up being twice as expensive as I originally planned to spend but oh well, I'll just make sure to make this last. I'll be moving on from a 3 year old laptop that runs Fortnite at 40 fps with the lowest settings, so I'm sure I'll love it. To be honest, I know that a GTX 1080 would be much more cost effective, but I got a little carried away. Decided to just spoil myself a little after working this summer.

If anyone's got any suggestions, I can still change parts if there are better/cheaper options.

Had an interview yesterday, didn't get it. Fine. They called back and said I was great, confident, fantastic test results, but that I didn't have enough experience.

The job was for a trainee position! In a field that is related to my degree! What more do you want from me?? 

I work full time, I can't get random office work experience, I have to bring money in. 

Sure, it's my fault I didn't do any while I was at university but it's not like I didn't try. There was nothing related to my career in the area I lived. I was skint, I couldn't travel across the country for some unpaid experience. And internships are a laugh, as if there was any close enough worth my time. 

I've been in full-time work since I graduated, sure it's not related but it's not like I've got nothing. 

I can't just drop my current job to get some shit, unpaid experience just so I can actually get into my chosen career. I assumed a trainee was, ya know, there to get the experience to move up in that department, not there to already know how to do the job they're training for.

I'm starting to think I should just give up and completely change my career path based on the experience I do have. I've got a computing degree but I work in electronics. I DO NOT want to work in electronics but if that's the only experience I've got then at this rate it's the only career that I can progress in.

She did actually tell me once they called back that they had someone with more experience and honestly it just feels like to me they already had someone in mind before they even interviewed me. I don't know if that pisses me off more.

Plus side, at least I already have a job (as shit and unrelated to my degree as it is), and now I'm just angry over the whole thing so I'm not feeling anxious about it all anymore. Ew."

I am lined up to graduate in the fall, but I’m not sure if I’m ready to graduate.  I still need to practice for interviews, work on personal projects, etc.

Is it feasible to graduate a semester early and then take around 6 months off and join in the summer like most new grads? I’ve saved up a bunch of money from an internship I’m at this summer and I’m looking to use it to travel for a few months next year. How does this gap look on a resume? Do recruiters have a problem with it?

Alternatively, I could go to school part time for the whole year and then work part time for my company and just kinda breathe and enjoy life a bit. I feel like I need some personal time before I jump into full time.

Going to school part time for the year may look bad if I ever decide to apply for grad school, I don’t know. I could pick up a math minor and go full time the whole year but I’d be loaded up with a few upper div math courses each semester. I’m good at math but don’t want to handle the stress.

Does anyone have any advice on my predicament?"

I thought I'd best write this tiny section here before someone inevitably goes ""Errr, actually...."" in the comment section.
I write this mainly as a reflection, but also aiming to give insights to those that are to become a fresh graduate in the years to come.
Because a significant part of this is subjective, when I talk about my experience take them with a grain of salt. They're not the gospel.



___________

# Before an applying for jobs

## The CV
(Take this with a grain of salt) I'm not in HR, nor am I a hiring manager.
But after looking at the CV of some friends that didn't have jobs they had a few things in common. There were two main areas in which they fell down.

#### Aesthetics
They had a bunch of fonts of varying sizes, this made the CV look messy right off that bat to a human eye.
Make sure to look at the typical format for an Irish CV. Most people don't have age or a photo of themselves for example.
If you're putting down start dates for a job, put down the end date too, otherwise it looks like you're still there.
Another thing is general formatting of the document, word does a lot for you, don't center by tabbing across, use the justify tool. This seems like common sense but not everyone gets it.

#### Content
Have the relevant keywords in your CV to the job itself. It seems obvious but I thought I'd state it again.
If you're going fora job they probably want to know what technologies you're comfortable with that are relevant to the job, feel free to talk about them.
This links to the message of modify the CV for each job, but have a good base CV that you can easily build upon when necessary.
If you have cool projects, write about them in interests/contributions, employers like to ask about them. 
Finally make sure about having an *overall coherent message* If you're marketing yourself as a web developer in your CV, it's gonna look goofy if you are applying to an OPS role with that CV.


You're college most likely has a CV clinic, or someone to look over it. Make use of this while you're still there.




## Prelude to applying
___________

Know your strengths.
By this I mean know what you're good at. Find your forte, not everyone is perfect at everything.
An example would be knowing if you're good at web development in comparison to being good at low level C development.

Use this  to help direct what you will be applying for (This also applies to internships)

If you know you're good at something and enjoy it apply for that over other roles.
Keep in mind though, don't *only* apply to jobs that you'd be perfect for at the start.

In my opinion, try cast a larger net when applying for job.
Why? Interview experience. Since you're a graduate you probably don't have hours and hours of interview experience.


## Knowing where to apply:
___________


- College Engagement Office
Your college is probably sending you emails about jobs, look at them and apply.

- www.indeed.ie
I had the best results on this site when I was applying. Monster and jobs.ie are also optional but I personally had less success there.



#### Temporal applications
 (These are places where you can get a job, but are constrained to certain days/weeks)

- GradIreland : 
Didn't find it great personally, it was packed when I went. But there are companies there that hire a lot of tech talent.

- College jobs fair :
Almost every college has a fair where companies come to the college.
This is a good place to talk to companies and attempt to get a job.

- Project Fair :
If you do a good final year project, make sure to market it well at the project fair.
Personally I had a lot of success here. Companies come up to you and give you business cards.
Most decent projects had 2-3 companies interested in interviewing the person. 


Side note: Have a good LinkedIn recruiters can message you here.
Setting up Linkedin is a topic for another day though.


## Knowing when to apply:
___________

The answer is as soon as possible. A lot of positions will be going up from September to January. After that pickings get slimmer, although they still exist.

# Knowing your worth

I made this it's own section although it could fall under the above easily, but I thought it was something important most don't consider heavily enough.

The idea of this section is to know what you think your value is before you apply.
This was something that really helped me when it came to making the right decisions about accepting offers. Does my perceived value align with the value companies place on me?

How I'd define your worth (the level at which someone or something deserves to be valued or rated) is based on the following:

#### Factors out of your control:
Have an estimate of  of the following:
- What others are getting paid for a given role.
- What technologies they'd work with in a given role.
- What benefits others get.
- What hours they will be working.
		
The above will give you a general idea of how much others are getting paid and how much you should be
getting paid. This isn't gospel though, as with everything, there's exceptions to the rule.
If someone is working in a proprietary language they tend to earn more but the trade-off is it's harder for them to move around company wise.
Most of the people in your year will be getting a similar enough pay. +-5k
	
#### Factors in your control:
- Academic grades.
- Any previous experience.
	- Tech, what software
	- General workplace for teamwork
		
Mostly though the above will be the defining factor is defining your worth.
Work placement in a tech company helps, it will show you have some level of standards and can refer to it in teamwork.

As of the time of writing this, you'd expect a salary of 29k-36k +-2k



# Interview Phase

## Playing the game:
___________
I write this to act as a not so brief interlude to this next section. Ultimately when interviewing you're playing a game of cat and mouse.
The interviewing process is busted in so many ways. I still believe not a single company has nailed it down correctly.
This is because it's incredibly hard to define what makes a good engineer. You could have high grades, that's a good indicator you have at least work ethic but you may not be able to even finish fizz-buzz.
You can have a good understanding of b-trees and sorting algorithms as they show a good base knowledge of core concepts. But that doesn't guarantee you have the decision making skills to know when and where to use them, not to mention I know a lot of people moan they never ever use sorting algorithms past an interview stage.
Without a doubt there's an awful lot of bullshit to it. There are so many factors out of your control that it can sometimes feel really painful to get rejected.
An example of this is a friend and I both applied to the same company for th same role. I interviewed a week earlier, had a completely different interviewer with different set of questions and expectations out of us.
If anything, I think you need to simply take each interview as they come and try learn from each one, no matter how bitter the pill is to swallow.

So there's no auto-magical way to get a job (aside from nepotism /s). Companies filter out their applicants in a bunch of ways. Each company does it differently.
I think the main thing is getting past the first filter or as they term it ""phase"". Thinking back, I actively avoided companies that too many phases to their process. I think it's because a greater disparity comes into play.
You invest time, possibly countless hours only to possibly be rejected. When they could easily reject applicants on a whim. From a business perspective I really wonder is the cost of dealing with so many phases (4+) worth it? Anyone care to comment?

Ultimately to be considered for a job, you need to think carefully about the typical filters a company will have.

- #### Filter 0) Keywords

    This is from your CV to even get you to a place where you will be reviewed. Does your CV hit the correct keywords a company may have set up when they're looking for applicants.
I know for a certain large multinational in the center of town they filter by recent graduates that got a 1:1 first then trickle down.
Do you also hit the technologies keywords for the job? If you do well then you will probably get at least seen. 

- #### Filter 1) Aptitude test

    Metrics Metrics Metrics is all I have to say on this one. Personally I hate aptitude tests and wish there was a centralized aptitude center so you could submit ones from previous companies.
Common aspects to aptitude tests are

- ##### Maths
	If it costs a company 50€ to make an item, they sell 125 for 3 years at 123€  how much profit do they make.

- ##### Logical puzzles / Sequences
	These can sometimes seem absurd. It's really a coin flip on how painful this will be.
	
- ##### Workplace related scenarios
	Hands down the most stupid and time wasting part. The answers they want are obvious most of the time.
	Do you enjoy public speaking? Y/N
	Would you consider yourself a team player? Y/N
	
- ##### Reading comprehension
	99% of the time these have a shit UI with multiple tabs you have to navigate around wasting most of your time going from case to case than actually reading. They should call these memory assessments.

- #### Filter 2) Phone interview
	These are nice in my opinion as they're quick and both parties get to know more before they proceed. Although nothing technical can ever be strongly assessed.
	I found that HR generally conducted this filter. So I rarely felt like they'd ask me anything super technical over the phone.
	Although a note here for those that tend to become one with the night by sleeping during the day, companies can and will call you as early as 9AM. So at least try maintain a normal human sleep cycle.
	
- #### Filter 3) Take home assessment
	I personally hate these. They take up a significant amount of time only to be quickly reviewed. Strongly in favour of the employers time not yours.

- #### Filter 4) Online Code test
	A more fair assessment, but given you're not using a real IDE and often solving problems you'd never encounter in real life they can be highly frustrating.
	Given that you're fresh out of college it shouldn't be a huge issue dealing with algorithm questions that I found they tend to ask commonly in this phase, from my experience the only way to get good at this filter is to simply grind hacker rank problems or leetCode.
	

	
Mostly it's just luck of the draw in terms of what filters companies are using to narrow down the candidates.

#### What to wear:
___________

 Ladies: Sorry I don't know, I'll put here what's commented.
 Men: Nice shirt, Jumper, Chinos, clean shoes. For the most part you don't need a full suit or 200€ business shoes in tech, just looking nice is key.
 

## Interview Types
___________
In person interviews:

Can be a long commute and make it seem unrewarding sometimes, but I really enjoy these as you get subtle information about companies.
Sometimes you can see their office setup, do they have physical boards for tracking issues/JIRAs? How do employees dress normally? Do they all use macs? Do they have multi monitors?
All this information makes it easier to see if you can envision yourself working there.
	
Back to the actual interview itself, I found the main thing was to honestly just be a genuine and nice person. Don't bullshit and lie saying you can do everything under the sun. After that I found having examples of teamwork and a general understanding of the company helps the most.
The in person interview is really broken up into two catagories.	
	

HR:

This is the people skills interview.
Common questions:
- Tell me about a time you didn't agree with a coworker?
- Tell me about a time you did something under stress?
- Tell me what you do in pass-times?
- Do you know our company values? (Checking to see if you did your research)
	
The take away to doing well here, is to have solid wording. *Think* before you talk, they'd rather you stop and think than blurb on shit talking.
Another thing is the STAR (Situation,Task,Action,Result) model, this can help you stay on point and give a solid answer. Some employers tell you and encourage you to use this, but some prefer other approaches.
	
Tech:

Keep in mind technical interviews really vary, there's no hard advice.

- Tell me about your most interesting project?  Usually if you have multiple projects you can cater to this by asking _""Is there anything in specific you're interested in?""_
		
- Reverse a whole string while preserving order of words ""This is a string"" to ""sihT si a gnirts""
- Print out a tree smallest value to highest.
- What are the components of the OSI 7 layer network model?
- What's the big O of inserting to the middle of a Linked List vs an Array.
	
With that said though, technical interviews really do vary company to company. I don't think there's a hard steadfast rule as to acing them.
	Having a good general standing on algorithms and big O helps.
	
From personal expierence though, I literally I had an interview before where they sat me down and made me do HackerRank. In a meeting room that had walls so thin you could hear someone eating crisps in the next room over to interviews that were incredibly laid back UML. You never know what to expect.

Like mentioned before, some companies like to look at HackerRank and leetCode. They're reflective of interview questions, rather than actual problems imo.


# The Offer

OK so the time has come where you have been offered a role. Chances are you probably want the job.
You should have a good idea of this at the start. But some companies don't like to talk money until the offer stage.

## Know what you're willing to accept:
___________
You need to know what makes the contract worthwhile. You could be offered a contract to a fortune 10 company. But the contract could be crap.
	
Here's a guideline to consider if it's the right contract for you.
#### Work being done
- Is the actually work being done right for you.
- Is it proprietary? Do you mind that?

#### Company culture
It can be a buzzword so forgive me on this. But does the company culture suit your needs? Most have something along the lines of ""Innovation, Customers, Integrity"" + 2 others.
Glassdoor is your friend. This will help you know if the company is talking shit.

- Also look at employee turnover rate. If 70% of people leave the job after a year you probably don't want to work there.
		
#### Time to commute
- This will make your life hell if it's a long one.

Personally I keep this as a priority. Anything above an hour will probably make you sad/depressed. But it all depends on your conditions and resolve.
	
#### Pay
Pretty self explanatory. Is the salary they offer up to standards for the hours worked a week?
	
#### Benefits
- Do you get health insurance?
- Bike to work?
- Parking space?
- Free bags/t-shirts etc?
- Is there a pension scheme?
- Do they have free snacks?
		
These are things that will make life better. If a place offers no benefits to a graduate they probably don't care that much.
			
## Contemplating the offer: 
_________________
There's lots of pressure to get a job out of college, trust me I get it.
Don't be afraid to say no to a bad contract. This falls back to the concept of how much you think your worth.
I did this, and for months I was thinking about if it was the right path. It's hard to turn up offers in hopes you get something better.

As a graduate, chances are it will be hard enough to negotiate pay, since you most likely won't have expierence in the role.
If you think you're worth more though, try negotiate, it can't hurt a whole lot. The worst they can say is no.
With that said, most companies aren't interested in negotiating, they take on a burden of training noobs.
Trying to play company offers against each other can work well, but not always.

I’m in incoming freshman CS major at a fairly known and respected state school.

I wanted to maximize my chances of getting an internship for the summer (2019). I know it may be difficult to get one but I want to try.

Since I won’t have any work experience, and little coursework, I wanted to beef up my skills using some personal projects I created in high school.

One of them (probably my best one), is a maze solver that was written in Java. It takes in an image as an input and outputs a completed maze, and shows the different paths it took. Would this count as an effective personal project and what skills could i say that I used to create it?

Another one is a smaller project but it takes in a text document as an input, and exports the different unique words and how many times it shows up.

I’m just wondering if any of these projects would be worth putting on my resume, and how I should market them?"

So in meantime I have created simple dashboards for their old balance sheets using tableau. But right now I need to figure out what to do. So I have come here to ask for advise.

Thanks for reading out my post."
8yvngr,3,2018-07-14,I’m an intern at a small firm and I made a mistake. I’m very anxious to go back to work what should I do?,Komg122314,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8yvngr/im_an_intern_at_a_small_firm_and_i_made_a_mistake/,"We have a routine procedure for a spreadsheet which I’ve done many times and should not have messed up. I’ve been with the company for 6 months so I’m somewhat new.  

I was assigned to do very many spreadsheets and I thought doing the process in a slightly different way would make things a bit more efficient. However, I didn’t realize that it would throw off a couple of numbers. 

My coworker/good friend texted me saying I did this wrong and now the numbers are off. She’s the type to be a perfectionist and takes mistakes very seriously. She’s an intern as well FYI. I have a feeling she’s been giving me the cold shoulder a bit (I could be imagining things) due to this mistake. I texted her and she didn’t reply but it could be because she’s busy. I’ve always been afraid to make a mistake and get finding out because she can be a bit condescending

The mistake I made wasn’t very major. It could all be fixed in 30 mins or so. However I have to go back on Monday and I’m very afraid to do so because my boss is going to confront me. 

Another reason I’m afraid to go back is. On Thursday, my boss noticed the numbers were off and asked all the interns that it was not supposed to be done this way but I didn’t confess right then because I was a little confused on what she was saying and didn’t think it related to me. However, on Friday I wasn’t scheduled to work and this was when my friend texted me more clearly what the problem is. Then I realized that I did this mistake and started panicking. 

I shouldn’t have made this mistake because it was a routine procedure. I feel horrible about it, to the point I don’t want to go back to work. I’m not sure what to do. Should I email my boss or tell her in person Monday when I go back that I’m sorry and it won’t happen again. My boss was an intern too at one point so she might understand. I’m not sure though. "

8yybwt,2,2018-07-14,Accepted off NYU MS Data Science waitlist. Still 99% sure I’m doing OMSCS. What are your thoughts?,scoobyboo,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/8yybwt/accepted_off_nyu_ms_data_science_waitlist_still/,"Hey OMSCSers!

I was accepted to the OMSCS program a while back, and I’ve been eagerly awaiting the Fall 2018 Semester to begin taking courses. I plan to specialize in ML, with the ultimate goal of working as a software engineer in Machine Learning and Data Science after graduation. Also, I plan to do the program “full time”—i.e take 2-3 courses a semester and do an internship in summer 2019. 

With that said, I was also just accepted off the WL to NYU Center for Data Science (CDS) for the MS Data Science degree. Getting accepted here gives me a great feeling of validation, because I left my job—which was in an unrelated field—at end of last year, to devote all my time to grad school apps, and taking a few Data Science and CS courses to prepare for grad school.  

I crunched the numbers on both, and with NYU I would incur ~$50K in debt, while with GA Tech, I would incur $0 in debt.

Costs  Estimate for reference for 2 years:
NYU Tuition: $66K, Total Living Costs: $44K
NYU Total Costs: $110K
GA Tech Tuition: $7K, Total Living Costs: $42K
GA Tech Total Costs: $49K

Both are top programs and will give me an equally prestigious piece of paper at the end, so when comparing them, I thought about the educational experience each would offer me. The questions I asked myself are; Is $50K debt worth the on campus experience of NYU, interacting in person with students and professors who are at the top of their field? Is it worth the networking opportunities? Is the on campus live learning experience worth it?

If a program like GA Tech didn’t exist—a top 10 CS program with ML focus, for $7K, with no online designation on the degree—I would do NYU in a heartbeat, but that is not the case.

So, I am 99% thinking to stick with OMSCS. Do you guys think this is the right decision, given my situation and goals? If you’ve already graduated from OMSCS with an ML spec, I’d love to hear what sorts of things you’re working on now! "

**Areas of Interest**

* Computer Science
* Engineering (not civil or biological but more like electrical/mechanical)

**Colleges of Interest (open to more suggestions)**

* Generally in order: Georgia Tech, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Duke, Brown, NC State, Princeton, U of Southern California, UPenn, U of Michigan, Virginia Tech, Cornell, Stanford, U of Virginia.
* I intend to apply Early Action to as many as I can. I am mostly interested in schools with good computer science that also have engineering in case I decide that is a better fit.

**Demographics**

* While male
* Household Income \~$190K/year
* Dad is first college graduate in his family
* Mom and her parents all went to college

**Academics**

* No GPA because I go to a small private school that does not use grades. Instead teachers write 1-2 page evaluations for each student in their class every term. They have figured out a 'good' system for applying to college and our evaluations supposedly force the admissions counselors to look deeper into us. I have gotten an average of &gt; 93&amp;#37; in every class except maybe 3, one of which everyone struggled.
* Likely top 1&amp;#37; of my class (41 students in my class so possibly best grades overall(?). Almost positively best SAT/ACT scores in grade.)
* Have taken every science class not Biology related except for new ones offered this coming year (I plan to take 3/5 new science classes if I remember correctly).
* PSAT: 1450
* SAT: 1440 - 730R/W 710M 6/6/6Essay
* ACT: 33.25 Composite 34.0 Superscore - Best date: 33E 35M 35R 30S 8/8/8/8Essay- Other date for superscore: 34E 27M 34R 32S No essay (some schools may not superscore unfortunately)
* SAT Subject Tests: 730 Math II, 580 Chem (did not study for chem due to taking other tests. Will be retaking both and hopefully get &gt; 680 on chem.)
* APs: Calc AB 4 (school only offers AP bio which I really do not like but I was able to take an extra class to prepare for Calc.)
* Science classes: Intro-Bio, Chemistry, Advanced Chemistry, Forensic Science, Biotechnology, Geology, Astronomy, 3D Printing, another 3D Printing class, Advanced Physics this coming year, 3 programming classes, and \~3-4 more science classes to come this next year.
* Math classes by graduation: Algebra II, Precalculus, Calc AB, Calc BC (equivalent), and Statistics.
* Language: Spanish 4 years (will take highest level offered this coming year).

**High School Extracurriculars**

* Student Government (2015-Present. Pretty sure I have the best attendance because I am almost never sick.)
* Investment Club (2017-Present. Will be co-leader Senior Year)
* Happiness Club (2015)
* Design Club (2017-2018)
* Ultimate Frisbee (2015-2016)
* Soccer (2015-Present Varsity)
* Basketball (2016-2018 Junior Varsity -- 2018-2019 Varsity)

**Recognition**

* Duke TIP Member; through Duke TIP, took SAT in 7th grade and earned a score resulting in recognition at Elon University
* Certificate: Programming Foundations with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (from Duke University through Coursera)
* Selected for month-long camp at UNC Charlotte to take a math course and work on a research project. Over 1000 applicants and \~250 selected.

**Community Service / Volunteer**

* Annual Homeless count (2016 and 2018)
* River Cleanup (2015 and 2017)
* Nonprofit that helps refurbish donated computers to give to low-income students in the state (12 hours + later mentioned internship)
* Summer Day-Camp Counselor-In-Training (Summers 2015 and 2016. 45 hour weeks for 5 weeks each summer: \~450 hours)

**Other Hobbies / Extracurriculars**

* Have taken 13 computer/science camps since 7th grade (probably a few more before) including the topics of: Web Design, 3D Animation, Aerospace Engineering, Game Design, Game Mod Design, Duke TIP Stock Market Modeling, Character &amp; 3D Modeling, Design Sketch-Up, and Artificial Intelligence with TensorFlow.
* Have taken every programming class offered at my school (3). Will take 2-3/3 new ones offered this coming year (new teacher).
* Learned how to trade a computer game's virtual items online and went from $110 to $900 in 3 months.
* Basically taught myself the majority of the programming knowledge I know through working on a program for the same computer game. The program allows the user to create items with specific decimals attached to them (hard to understand but they are cosmetically pleasing). Spent all of 2016 working on that and started my own part-time business around the program that I coded in Python. Didn't really do it for the money so I estimate that I made &lt;$50. Spent much of 2017 working on making that program into a website so that I could share it with other people. I found a person interested in the project and made sort of a royalty deal with them where I would get \~10&amp;#37; of their earnings. Through that deal I made \~$70 in a few weeks but they lost interest somewhat. Later, I was approached by an individual who had been using my program but needed more help to make a super expensive item. I guided them through the process and they made an item that they have received offers of over $13,000 for and estimate could be worth around $18,000-$22,000 if the right buyer comes around.
* Have enjoyed metal detecting around my back yard and finding cool coins and other relics
* Enjoy programming projects (currently working with YouTube's API to 'jump' from suggested video to suggested video and am analyzing the data).
* Basketball with friends

**Work Experience**

* Freelance yard mowing (2011-Present 4 paying clients total.)
* Freelance tech support (2017-Present 1 paying client -- not family.)
* Summer Day-Camp (Summer 2017 after Job still available 2018 but no time.)
* Freelance assembler -- put together a toy kitchen set (2017)
* Two-week internship with aforementioned nonprofit that helps refurbish computers. Internship was 9-5 every day and I was given a special rank that basically makes me the boss of other volunteers.

**Miscellaneous / Before High School**

* Tennis (2013 and 2015. 2015 was seed 4)
* Baseball 4 years (before middle school)
* Basketball 4 years (before middle school)
* Soccer 11 years (including on team 3 years in middle school)
* Ultimate Frisbee 3 years (in middle school)
* Won science fair 1st place 6th and 8th grade (only offered 6th and 8th)
* Went to Duke Writing camp in 2014
* Created a YouTube channel for Origami tutorials. Videos averaged around 300 views (2011)
* Created a YouTube channel for Stop-Motion Animation and Go-Pro Slow-Motion. Videos averaged \~10 views (2011-2012)
* Created another YouTube channel for video games. Videos averaged 20 views (2012-2013). All videos are unlisted now, thankfully.

**Other**

* In terms of applying to Duke, I have a lot of family history there. My grandfather was a professor and started his own department which is still around (no names on buildings though), my mother went there for undergraduate and is now also a professor there, my uncle went there for undergraduate, and my father coached soccer camps at Duke and was also the Women's Soccer Team's assistant coach for a few years. I do not want to apply early decision however, because I am more interested in a few other schools.
* I'm not sure if it matters for NC State, but my uncle and aunt both went there for undergraduate (and possibly some graduate school).
* I have not started college essays yet, but will be working on them for the duration of August as well as studying for Math II and Chemistry Subject tests."

I'm a high school student with a plethora of bad grades, but extracurriculars that are somewhat interesting (I think/hope?). Here's what to know about me:white, upper-middle-class background. Both of my parents went to grad school, so I've never really experienced much hardship and have no real reason to explain my bad grades other than my own laziness

â€¢ D well freshman year of HS, tanked the sophomore year and did okjunior year.

â€¢ ACT 30, weighted GPA 3.558, unweighted 3.351, UC weighted GPA 3.304. These totals do not include 2 AP classes that I've taken online and gotten an A in both and a PE class, which should raise my GPA (if only marginally so).

â€¢ Outside of school and not listed on my HS transcript are a few CC classes. I intend to send in my transcripts from CC separately.

â€¢ 740 US History Subject Test, 4 AP Euro, 5 APUSH, 5 AP Lang

â€¢ Planning to raise my GPA after 1st semester of senior year. I want to raise my ACT score, the goal being 33, but nothing is set in stone.

Extracurriculars:

¢ YouthFirst Impact Year Program: volunteereedall year to plan/organize events for Holocaust survivors and Jewish elders. Did this just my junior year so far, but I plan to continue my senior year

â€¢ Interned fora localsocial service agency. This was a paid internship that I did from Dec 2017 to May 2018 and will likely have the opportunity to return to in the fall.

â€¢ Internship with the local library: I didn't think very much of it (the only thing I did wasÂ shelvebooks), but I really like libraries and might consider a career in it. The librarian/supervisor really liked me and I have a letter of rec from her. This was unpaid, 40 hours spread over 10 weeks, and I may have the opportunity to do it again in the fall.Â

â€¢ Internship at a local tech startup. I live in Silicon Valley and got a position as a paid intern. This was part of a larger internship placement program from the aforementioned social services agency (that I later went to work at) and also involved volunteering and mandatory workshops on professionalism. I didn't learn anything, but I have a letter of rec from my supervisor. 120 hours over 6 weeks.

â€¢ Internship at Stanford Prevention Research Center. I kind of got this internship through a combination of nepotism and merit. It is unpaid and 95 hours (give or take 5 hours) over this entire summer. I'm currently at this internship and I really hate it. There just might be an opportunity to continue here in Jan 2019, but I honestly hate it so much I could quit on Monday and not give a crap. I'm mostly doing this for the Stanford name as a resume builder.Â

â€¢ Starbucks: started working here this summer. I really love it so far and I'd love to be able to work here throughout college. Ofc, I say this only a couple of weeks in.

â€¢ JSA: helped organize my schools' club. I really love it and feel that I basically act as a co-president of this club without the title, but this is probably narcism on my part. FYI tho: I've brought snacks for basically the past 2 years, tried to recruit ppl to join, put up signs, attended overnight conventions, and organized rides to and fro. I'veÂ participated10th and 11th grade, and plan to continueÂ with in12th grade.

â€¢ Debate: technically competed at Novice, Junior, andÂ Varity/open levels for Extemp and Parli. However, I never did well, competed only a couple times a year, and totally hated it.Â Debateis both a club and a class, which was available starting my junior year, at my school. I was involved in the club component soph year, and just the class/tournaments junior. I do not plan to continue my senior year

â€¢ Local student advisory board. My representative in Congress has a board for teens within her district to write position papers over the course of the year and at the end of the year, present them to her and the rest of the group. I've done this just my junior year so far but plan to continue my senior year.Â

Classes I've taken thru community college: Physical anthropology, information science, pilates I, into to sociology, college success, history of animation, college planning, oceanography, general psych, and courtship marriage and family (listed as both a psych and sociology course but transfers to UCs as aÂ socicourse). Cumulative CC GPA is abt 3.6-3.7.

8z1a6m,1366,2018-07-15,GoFundMe,FirstBreath1,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8z1a6m/gofundme/,"""**Hey boss, did you see the GoFundMe link I shared in messenger?**""

It was the middle of tax season. I didn't have time for this shit. When John the Intern sidled up to my side; I granted him some serious side-eye from the corner of my morning's first spreadsheet.

""*No, what's up, man?*"" I asked gruffly. ""*Did you just get here?*""

He paused and shifted the weight of his work bag on his shoulder.

""**Yeah... traffic was pretty bad on the Parkway.**” He lingered. “**I actually had a quick question.**"" 

""*Shoot,*"" I mumbled, allowing my eyes to drift towards my e-mails.

""**So, hopefully, my sister will be getting married in a couple weeks.**” He paused; expecting a congratulations while holding his hands together like a beggar. 

""*Where you going with this, kid?*”

""**I know it's last minute... but, I really need the time off. My sister can't get married without me there.**""

I had to compose myself, just to keep from laughing in his face. My heart was racing. We had reports due for five accounts before the April 18th deadline. A lapse in filing could result in tax evasion charges for *our clients*. I had barely seen my own family in weeks. We were understaffed and underfunded as it was... and this dickhead wanted a vacation?

""*Look man, there is absolutely no way we can swing that right now,*"" I said, as his face fell to his shoes. ""*If you want the job, you work the hours agreed in your contract. This is for college credits. You already used vacation on your mom's birthday.*"" 

I paused; for empathy's purpose. 

""*If you miss anymore days, we have to replace you in the bullpen. Take the day to think about it.*""

Without another word, I returned to get back to my work. Honestly, in my head, I was accounting for the man hours we would miss with the Intern crying at his deck.

""**Thank you, sir,**"" John said awkwardly. ""**I'm going to send you that link again...**”

I nodded and waved an arm over my head while the phone ran off its hook. I picked it up and began the day's discussion on our client's mysterious offshore funding habits. 

It was not until well past lunch that I emerged from my office for a bottle of water. My boss, Mike, caught me on the way there and pulled me to the side. 

""**Did you know the situation with that tall intern? Name escapes me. We just off-boarded him. He packed his bags and left without notice.**""

I chuckled. ""*Most of these kids can't last in the jungle.*""

He nodded and walked away with a wide grin. ""**That's why they pay us the big bucks.**""

Back in my office, the rest of the afternoon was much more relaxing. Most of my assignments were delegated. I had my remaining intern interviewing new potential interns. That felt fitting. If you kill a bug in the house, leave it out to rot as a warning to the others. 

They were truly worthless, I thought, as I watched from the glass window. A monkey could do their job. It was basic data entry, after all. Barely worth a second thought.

Some time around two, I came across John's farewell e-mail, dated hours earlier. The latter thanked his mentors for giving him the opportunity to learn. He cited my boss, Mike, as well as his fellow coworkers. Even the security guard. Everyone; but me.

Whatever.

The next email was from an address l did not recognize.. Inside was a link to a GoFundMe page. 

I clicked it for curiosity. 

The website took a minute to load on the old Windows machine. I smacked the monitor for a few moments, and thought about calling the IT guy at home. The fucking thing was always so slow. Finally, the browser loaded and a grainy image appeared over the screen and readjusted to the resolution.

It was a picture of me. 

I was sleeping. The photo had definitely been taken in my bedroom. I could see our black alarm clock in the background. It also looked like the photographer was by my side. 

I dragged the bar down to find the summary under a broad and bold headline.

---

!!**Nearly Funded**!!
----

**Help me kill my boss. If you pay me one million dollars, I will finally fucking do it.**

*This sum may seem ridiculous. But many of us have the same goal, here. This asshole steps on everyone he meets. He needs to be stopped. I will do it. The money is for my escape and inevitable legal fees.*


-----------

The sponsor was anonymous, but it didn't take much for my mind to wonder. I clicked over to 'Updates'. 

---

*He actually fucking fired me. I never thought he would have the balls. Today's the day.* (2h ago, 200 comments)

----

I scrolled down a bit more.

----

*How do we do it? Au natural with pills, or something rough? Hitman or traditional homicide? Vote in the comments! Don't forget to share with anyone likeminded, that might have a boss like mine!* (4d ago, 563 comments)

----

*He never even looked at this page once. I have asked, as a prank, for days. I'm serious now. We all are.* (8d, 1.2k comments)

----

That was enough for me. I grabbed my jacket and threw it over my shoulder, all the while stuffing my laptop into the work bag. I waved over my shoulder at Mike on my way out.

""*Family emergency!*"" I shouted over my shoulder.

My Rover was parked in a priority spot. I headed out the front door and hopped in. The drive was only ten minutes. Five l; if I was able to hit the gas.

Of course, that was not possible. I panicked and pulled out my cell phone in traffic. The pledge was up to $998,000. 

My wife's car was missing from the lot. I checked the garage quickly before going inside. There was no familiar bark from our dog, Lola. The security system did not require disarming. The entire house was nearly empty, with only a shallow light casting shadows into every corner of our large foyer. 

In the middle stood this old wooden desk.There's a cup of hot coffee on it, an un-smoked cigarette, and some matches. 

There’s a laptop here, too. My GoFundMe page is pulled up. The picture of me sleeping almost encompasses the entire screen. There's one final update at the top.

---

*Goal achieved!*

---

I refreshed. The entire page was removed altogether. A short, generic message at the top stated it was deleted by the administrator.

8z295a,595,2018-07-15,Community College is NOT Always the Best Option.,Ghartin007,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8z295a/community_college_is_not_always_the_best_option/,"I’ve seen a lot of people here suggest that if you don’t go to community college for two years, you are making a stupid decision since there are absolutely no downsides. According to them, every single person should go to community college first.

Community college can be an amazing option for many people, but it is NOT as black and white as many of you make it seem.

Here are just some potential negatives of going to community college

- If you want to go in to a field that values prestige (say, finance) you will have a very difficult time getting internships your first two summers. In fact, most big banks now recruit Junior summer interns during their sophomore spring, so make that your first three summers. That will seriously impact career prospects out of school. Also, contrary to what some may adamantly say, almost every field values prestige to an extent. 

- Even if you only want to apply for an internship Junior year, employers will likely not like the fact that you only have a semester (or less) of grades to show at your school.

- Networking is an important part of college. You are missing out on a lot of important opportunities to cultivate friendships your first two years if you aren’t even there until Junior year.

- Will be very difficult to gain leadership positions in student organizations coming in as a third year.

So, the reality is, Community Colleges are an invaluable asset to many students, but there ARE downsides. I feel that students are being misled by people on here claiming that there is absolutely no reason to not go to community college.

8z3o5p,1661,2018-07-15,When Science Found God,zachariusfrost,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8z3o5p/when_science_found_god/,"I’ve never much cared for religion. I mean, it’s interesting and all, the old parables and philosophic insights from people two millenniums removed from the present. I particularly enjoy the books of the Apocrypha, and the Bible’s magnum opus of Revelation if for nothing else than interesting stories. Even some of the tenants like an emphasis on strong family bonds and moral stature I can resonate with, but in terms of a giant omnipresent entity that created everything yet loves us unconditionally watching our every move from unseen planes, yeah, I don’t know about that.

I still don’t ascribe to a singular religious doctrine, but knowing what I know now… well, let’s just say the title of atheist would be a little disingenuous. Staking my flag in that camp would contradict all my principals of the scientific method and firsthand observation. Try as I may, I cannot in good faith deny or refute what I myself witnessed. Calling whatever we discovered ‘god’ may prove a bit remedial or inaccurate, but there is no denying it, we found something.

Science has at times become this sort of monolithic and infallible institution. One that suffers from the ostracization of fringe concepts that fail to breach the egotistic blockade. It is all too often wielded as a trump card to negate all that doesn’t assimilate to the prevailing narrative. Too often outlandish claims are torn asunder because no metrics exist to properly digest them.

For all the good it has brought, science is still not and will never be an absolute. Nothing is. Absence of proof, is not proof of absence. And what happened out there, in that lab deep below the frozen streets of Stockholm now stands as a testament in my life, to all the ventures humanity has yet to embark upon. It serves as an anchor, and if ever I find myself drifting away into the blissful seas of cognitive dissonance, it is there to remind me how small and naïve I truly am.

I graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor’s in physics, and an incredible opportunity landed in my lap. One of my professors had put in a good word for me, and I was contacted by a lab out of Stockholm and offered an internship. They were apparently impressed with my thesis which delved into the topic of string theory and mathematic application to universal process. I of course accepted the offer without a moment’s hesitation.

From there I uprooted my Californian lifestyle to move halfway around the world to the frigid north of Sweden. I was not prepared for the cold. Most of my summers were spent in a bikini, frolicking on the sandy beaches of Santa Monica and lounging in the sun. Sweden might as well have been another planet. Temperatures would plummet to a bone-chilling negative 30 in the winter. Luckily for me though, I had a marvelous host family who helped me acclimate myself and integrate into Valhalla.

I was brought on to the team and slowly began the arduous process of melding into the group. They were all incredibly kind and welcoming, but still the feeling of being woefully outclassed by my colleagues was thick as tar pitch. The project consisted of over fifty men and women, all of them among the best the world had to offer. They hailed from Germany, Japan, Poland, Hong Kong, South Korea and many other sovereign states. It was a melting pot of some of the greatest minds the world had to offer. Seeing them in their element, and marveling at the way their minds hurdled asinine topics to delve straight to the cortex of reality was altogether incredible, and more than a little intimidating.

The expressed goal of the coalition was to study the behaviors of particles and the subatomic realm to further decode the complex world of theoretic energy matrices. By extension the group also allotted resources to develop tools for observing and decoding quantum entanglement hypothesis’ and the aforementioned string theory. These principles were still in their infancy at the time, and none of us could have ever imagined the enormous magnitude of the things that were to come.

The lab had its very own particle accelerator, which I myself pretty much obsessed over from Day 1. Most of the concrete data however, was relayed from the lab in Geneva, home of the large hadron collider. I even got to see the magnificent machine in person on a few occasions. One thing that has always staggered me, is the amount of incredible achievements capable when pursuit of knowledge guides the way. However, the complete polar opposite is also true, as curiosity without empathy all too often yields crimes against humanity.

As you may already know, the large hadron collider was the first machine capable of synthesizing the particle known as the Higgs-Boson. The machine is a particle accelerator built in a 27-kilometer loop. It uses a state of perpetual vacuum and temperature colder than that of outer space to accelerate particles to 99 percent the speed of light. The particles collide with one another, creating spectacular outbursts of radiation and results theorized to be similar to that of the big bang on a much smaller scale. It is also through this process that the infamous Higgs-Boson can be synthesized.

Some call it the ‘God Particle’, but many physicists are not fond of the omnipotent moniker. It is in a way suitable though, as it is ubiquitous and can spontaneously manifest or dematerialize through processes which are not yet entirely understood. It is a sort of bridge between matter and antimatter. The entity that binds the ethereal with the corporeal. It is the place between light and dark, hard to define, as once light ends shadow begins and vice versa. The exact moment of intersection is difficult to pinpoint, but there is a definitive moment, and that moment is the Higgs-Boson.

It was once thought that matter could only exist in one place at a time, however the particle slit test of our progenitors proved otherwise. A particle accelerator was used to eject protons between one of two microscopic slits. They naturally assumed the protons would pass through either slit A or slit B, and when directly observed their premise was corroborated.

However, when an imprint background was installed to bypass direct observation, they noticed a peculiar detail. The particles produced what is known as a wave, or interference pattern on the imprint like ripples in a pond. This meant that the particles were interfering with themselves while simultaneously passing through both and neither of the slits. It was at first thought to be a false-negative and outright impossibility, but thousands of repeated experiments all reached the same conclusion. There was denying it anymore. Matter *can* exist in more than one place at a time, and reality is altered simply by perceiving it.

The world of particle physics is a strange one, and one which we have only just begun to glimpse the majesty of. At times it may even require us to suspend our own limited human understanding of things, to contemplate things beyond our minds comprehension. It was this idea which was the tabernacle of all the group was trying to achieve. To unravel the mysteries of the subatomic universe, and better understand reality itself.

The group was funded exorbitantly, and state of the art equipment was provided from lavish donors from all around the world. My contemporaries and I began to study the processes again from square one. This consisted primarily of monitoring the nature of protons and testing the same process over and over ad nauseum. Progress was slow, and many failures and errors were soon under our belts, but you can’t build a house without chopping down a few trees.

It took years to decode part of the formula, but eventually we learned that the behavior of these particles could be predicted under certain pretenses. They could also; to a certain extent, be directed. Programmed to inhabit separate locations at the same time, giving them the perceived ability to exist in two places at once. In reality though, it was more akin to a transfer of locale via microscopic slits in the Higgs-Boson. We realized it was not a matter of travelling to, but instead travelling through. Through the fabric of space itself.

With electrical stimuli and coordinate based geo-synchronization, one could manipulate these particles to transfer locations faster than the blink of an eye. The machine used was primitive compared to later iterations, but it’s true potential was not lost on us for a moment.

Time went on, and the technique was further refined, most readily in the distance particles were able to be transposed. It started as only a few nanometers, but eventually we could transfer particles several feet.

It was through this process, that blueprints for an entirely new type of machine were first devised. It was to be a machine unlike any before it. Instead of electrical stimuli sent through circuits and wires, it was transferred directly from one location to another. Wireless energy transposed through space. This greatly improved computing capabilities and allowed the machine to act much quicker than anything ever seen before.

Initial ideals for the machine were skeptical at best, but as time went on the real significance of it’s potential became apparent. When combined with a suitable processor and digital interface, it soon began decoding encryption and translating mathematic cipher in a fraction of the time of anything seen before it. It didn’t stop there though.

With a binary convertor, it wasn’t long before human physiology itself was deciphered and converted into convenient little anagrams and simplistic formulas. This soon gave the machine the ability to replicate human tissue and organs from fetal stem cells. When given raw biomass it could manufacture a duplicate heart or a lung. One which was genetically indistinguishable from that of the donor’s DNA.

On one occasion, the machine even managed to regrow the arm of an amputee war veteran. Most of us thought it couldn’t possibly work, that the nerve endings on the man’s arms would be unable to be resuscitated after so long. But after seventeen hours in surgery, when I saw the vet move his new fingers for the first time after transplant and cell resuscitation, I knew we had discovered something special.

Disease and deformities were also unlocked, able to be observed on a molecular level and eradicated before gestation. A virus or bacterial strain could be genetically reprogrammed to attack and destroy itself rather than the host. HPV, AIDS, the black death, the common cold, strep throat, gonorrhea, none of them stood a snowball’s chance in hell against the unrivaled power of the machine.

It could even reprogram human DNA to desired proportions, eliminating extra chromosomes and restoring neural pathways to reverse entropic cognitive illness like Dementia and Parkinson’s. Even pre-birth conditions like cerebral palsy and microcephaly were in the process of being all but eradicated.

It wasn’t just organic material either. The machine could take a block of carbon and alter its isotopes to create carbon-14 and elicit radioactivity. This proved interesting for further power possibilities as the machine demonstrated potential of creating it’s own fuel source, but there was another more pertinent discovery. By rearranging the number of protons in the atomic nucleus, the given element’s atomic weight was altered, thereby turning it into another element altogether. The machine held the power to change the very building blocks of the universe itself. It could turn copper into gold, bromine into iodine.

I think it was then that we first realized the scope of what it was that we had created. The applications for the machine seemed endless. It could write books, clone living organisms and alter the very elements beneath our feet. It was the philosopher’s stone, the holy grail and the all-seeing eye in one convenient little package. The Deus ex Machina. The world’s very first quantum computer was born.

One important distinction I would like to make, despite prevailing rumors, the quantum computer was not in fact an AI. It had computing power which trumped almost everything else on earth a thousand times over, and the ability to perform almost any task given to it provided the necessary accommodations were implemented. For this reason, it was not allowed to make decisions for itself. Many of my colleagues were justifiably nervous at the prospect of an artificial intelligence somehow gaining sentience and going rampant with the power of quantum manipulation. We really had no idea where our experimentation would lead us, and so the decision was made early on, to prevent it from thinking on its own and going all Skynet on us. The computer was a beast of burden, happily doing any task given to it, but it was us that held the reins.

That was when the bureaucratic troubles first began. A lot of donors for the project, and even a few of my fellow team members had their own ideas on how to best utilize the machine. Every nation involved wanted it for themselves and had their own vision on how best to implement it’s capabilities.

Several members of the coalition ended up leaving the project or being outright dismissed, promising to return with a battalion of lawyers at their back. One man was even caught attempting to smuggle data from the lab, and detained to await prosecution. The reigning project overseer was also relieved of duty. In his place; Dr. Henryk Lundgren assumed the role of director of operations.

Dr. Lundgren is a dear friend, and a brilliant mind. That’s what makes his fate lie so heavily on my heart. It’s a tragedy what befell him, but I won’t act as though he wasn’t responsible for stoking the flames.

Lundgren managed to settle the group down and unite a divided faction of scientists who all held their own agendas. He made the executive decision to keep the computer in the hands of the international team and continue to study it for optimum replication and continued data analysis. All those who didn’t abide were dismissed or removed physically as the need arose.

Lundgren had toiled for years on development of the machines virtual capabilities, and decided it best to invest more heavily into it. It took months of development, but soon a fully-functional Sims-esque program was up and running. It was incredible. The simulation was modeled to be an exact carbon copy of our own world and held all the coordinating pieces within it. All the people, animals and nations. Augmented control apparatuses were then developed to allow us the ability to view the computer’s creation firsthand.

The simulation it created was so visceral, that none could even perceive that they were in a simulation at all. Test subjects were exposed to their own loved ones within the program and could not distinguish them from their real-life counterparts. I even took it for a spin a few times. I was hooked up to the monitor via a neural cortex interface, and had my mind rendered into the simulation.

I awoke to the sights of sunlight peeking through my blinds, and the sounds of cars outside. Around me on the walls were posters of Harry Potter, JoJo and the X-files among countless others. I recognized immediately where I was. It was my childhood home, an apartment complex in Sacramento. My parents were both there and acted in accordance to how they would behave in real life. My dad even made new corny jokes in a fashion that suited his personality. It wasn’t a memory though, it was an entirely new scenario, concocted by my mind and the quantum simulation.

My parents are both deceased in the real world and getting to spend time with them again was… indescribable. Even if they were just simulations, the experience was profoundly cathartic for me. I ended up leaving the simulation in tears, overwhelmed by the experience and the ability to speak with my parents once again. The event was so enlightening for me, it even made dealing with their absence a little easier. After all, I could now speak to them any time I wanted. I found myself never wanting to leave the matrix.

Dr. Lundgren subsequently questioned me about my experience, and I was all too happy to relay the things I had seen. He listened intently, with simple occasional nods and one-word responses. His grey face wore a smile, and cheeks dimpled in delight, but his eyes were far from the present, and worried.

We held a meeting with all staff members sometime after. Lundgren stood and paced in front of the group, silent and lost in thought. When he did finally speak, he held our undivided attention. He walked through all that our little group had managed to accomplish, and all the things we had learned on our journey. All the miracles unraveled and translated into digital coding, and all the advancements made. It was not a triumphant voice however, it was somber, as if none of it truly mattered. He then first proposed his theory.

Here we were, with an entire simulated universe at the tips of our fingers. A digital reality created and maintained by a machine we had built. A simulation which was so authentic, that none could tell it apart from reality itself. And if we had the power to create that, how did we know that our own universe was not the result of the same process? How did we know our reality was not in fact just a simulation?

An unnerving silence befell the rest of the group as Lundgren concluded his epiphany. All in attendance seemed to silently contemplate the idea, with a noticeably nervous aura now lingering. There wasn’t much said after that, but there didn’t need to be. We had an entirely new goal.

Upon returning for work the following day, I immediately noticed that several of our colleagues had abandoned the project without so much as a ‘goodbye’. Only 7 of us remained, among which was the prestigious Henryk Lundgren. He was changed though, his upbeat optimism and inquisitive attitude reverted to an impatient gibbering wreck of a man. He became hostile to prolonged questioning, and I could see the idea gnaw on his mind as he walked the tightrope between madness and genius. At times he appeared on the verge of catatonic psychosis. He would ramble and talk to himself, and pretty much stopped leaving the laboratory altogether.

We set our sights on a new task; to dismantle and test the hypothesis of Lundgren. To develop an ability to break through the boundaries of our suspected simulation and pier beyond our own reality to glimpse whatever may lie on the other side. Nothing else seemed to matter anymore by that point.

Life may be accidental, consciousness too, hell even complex organisms like human beings the result of genetic evolution and a bit of luck. However, simulation is not accidental. It requires an immense amount of dedication, programming and logistics, not to mention, power and maintenance. The ability to synthesize digital worlds is not something learned or accomplished by accident. It takes time, resources and brainpower to even attempt it, and even then, it’s no guarantee. The one concept that was off the table immediately, was that the theorized simulation was the result of natural phenomenon or random cosmic alignment. If Lundgren’s hypothesis was correct, and our universe was indeed an illusion, then someone or something had to be pulling the strings behind the veil.

Powerful as the quantum computer was, even it did not have the ability to glimpse directly into higher dimensions. As stated before, it took commands only from us, and could only perform tasks which we could coherently articulate to it. We realized rather early that directly viewing outside the boundaries of the universe was likely not possible. The only option was to send a message.

Through remedial experimentation and dozens of ponderous sleepless nights, we finally had a breakthrough. Our reality is based on laws. Laws of motion, laws of attraction, laws of physics. These laws cannot be broken accidently, but with quantum technology, they can be manipulated. Many believe that intelligent extra-terrestrials were first alerted to humanity when the atomic bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Ours was essentially the same idea. Demonstrating that we had the capability to toil with the quantum world in hopes of eliciting a response from a higher being. If we could ‘break’ or ‘bend’ one of these laws of reality, then perhaps the supposed orchestrator would be compelled to respond.

One of the earlier discoveries we had made was that of the concept of reverse time. Time is a measurement of something that occurs, and without anything to observe, time is meaningless. The concept only makes sense when in the presence of matter. The two concepts of space and time are coterminous, like light and dark or hot and cold, one does not exist without the other. Where there is space there is time, and where there is time there must be space. The opposite of matter is not nothing, but anti-matter. A true nothingness or void of anything substantial does not exist. It cannot exist based upon the nature of existence itself. Anti-matter is the invisible material which operates unseen and fills all the gaps which matter does not. All of it held together by the Higgs-Boson.

If an opposite of matter exists, then an opposite of time must as well. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and all reactions must remain proportional to force exerted. By utilizing the quantum computer, we had the ability to send protons back in time, sort of. We could make them exist where they once had not before they existed there, by using dark energy matrices and particle superpositioning to make them exist in two places at once.

The discovery had actually been made some time earlier, but never officially tested. It was restricted and marked as unbroachable, as many of our patrons were rightfully concerned by the prospect of unintentionally altering the past. Doing so could create a butterfly effect and wreak havoc upon the present. We were told vehemently that the reverse-time experimentation was forbidden, but now we had a legitimate reason to take interest.

It took some convincing on our end, but eventually we were successful when we promised to unveil the greatest discovery yet. The parameters were set within the computer and the lab was prepped for the operation. A single seed of dianthus caryophyllus was placed in a transparent reinforced container in the center of the room. The specimen was placed on damp resin paper, and several little green tendrils had sprouted from its shell.

The idea, was to reverse the symbiotic metabolism of the test subject and cause it to rapidly revert to a zygote state. The seed would be directed to perform it’s life cycle backwards, thereby contradicting the natural forward flow of life and time.

The parameters were finished, and Lundgren stood by the machine. He glanced to each of us individually a sullen demeanor and nervous twinkle in his eye. He looked to me last, and I nodded. Lundgren took a deep breath, adjusted his glasses and flipped the switch.

Immediately the tendrils within the seed began to retract. They disappeared within the shell soon after, and the seed shrunk until the point in which it was no longer visible. The computer alerted us that the task had been completed, and silence descended upon the crew.

We stayed that way for several seconds until a commotion from the computer drew our attention. An array of flickering lights and sirens began to wail like banshees, indicating an error of some sort. Suddenly, the seed reappeared and began to grow at an impossible rate. A mass of wriggling green tendrils erupted from the shell and pressed firmly against the case within seconds. It swelled within and the chamber violently ruptured a moment later sending shards of glass catapulting throughout the room. I managed to duck away just in time, but others in the group were not so lucky.

One man; Reginald Diabek was struck with a shard in the neck. The piece cut a gash across his throat, causing a thick crimson to spill forth from his gullet. He collapsed to the ground, as others began to rush to his aid. Before we could reach him, the engorged serpentine appendages of the seed ensnared him, slithering around his neck and abdomen. Diabek gurgled and terror filled his eyes as the green pythonic roots began to constrict him.

I watched, at a loss for words as Diabek’s wound sealed. His grey hair turned to a dark brown. The wrinkles on his forehead and bags below his eyes dissolved into his skin in a matter of seconds. The blackheads and liver-spots on his cheeks soon followed suit. All of us watched, stupefied as the process continued onward and Diabek appeared to age backwards.

Diabek had to have been nearly sixty years old, but in a matter of moments he appeared as though he was a young man in his early thirties. He then went young adult, then juvenile, then teenager. Diabek screamed in terror as his voice cracked from a gruff, raspy tone to a high-pitched pre-pubescent shriek. His body shrunk in his clothes and his extremities retracted within his coat. By the time we had reached him, he was gone.

We didn’t have time to gawk, as our stupor was interrupted by the computer blaring a warning siren, and a flickering plethora of lights designated an external problem of some sort. The display was a failsafe designed to protect the computer from malicious outside sources. Most of us thought the firewalls of the quantum computer were enough to prevent any attempted breach, but apparently, we were wrong.

One of my colleagues scrambled to the kill switch. He was poised to throw it, when he was halted by a sudden shout from Lundgren. Lundgren stood, eyes wide as dinner plates and mouth agape as he stared at the main monitor of the computer. The warning display had ceased, and only a single screen remained active. Upon it was displayed a single loading bar, with approximately twenty percent of it being filled in. This indicated only one thing, something was being downloaded.

We immediately surmised that it must be a virus or other malware of some sort. A prospect once though impossible based on the security measures of the computer, and yet the download persevered. All attempts made to restrict the download and halt it’s progress proved futile.

We exchanged nervous glances with one another, torn on whether to pull the plug and save our creation from hostile insurgence or allow it to continue to whatever ends. The call was eventually made by the investors outside the room, who had since been notified of the development. They demanded power be cut, and the machine be saved. The computer represented a colossal investment, and the costs to repair or replace it if any damage were to ensue was not something taken lightly.

Begrudgingly, Lundgren followed orders and commanded shutdown protocol. It was done straight away, but the machine did not power down. It continued, impossibly, and without a direct power source sustaining it.

Panic began to erupt from the lab, and power to the entire facility was ordered to be cut from the mainframe. It was done within seconds, and the room fell into darkness. The only light that remained was that of the main monitor as the download reached the halfway mark. The computer groaned and whirred under enormous duress as hundreds of fans shot to life to attempt to cool the leviathan machine.

We stood back, unable to make heads or tails of the development. There was simply no possible way the machine should've remained active, and yet it was. It continued to fill up the progress bar, powered by the fuel of some unknown outside source. With no other viable solutions at hand barring physical destruction of the computer itself, we could do nothing but await the culmination.

The download finished several minutes later, and the room fell into pitch black. We deliberated for a moment, before deciding our only recourse was to power up the computer once again. The mysterious file weighed in at an impressive 100,000 terabytes, enough to fill hundreds of normal hard drives, but just another drop in the ocean for the quantum computer. Once full mobility was achieved, a single never before seen prompt filled the screen.

""Unknown file type. Do you wish to execute the file?"" All attempts made to bypass the prompt failed. We quickly used a separate program on another screen to trace the file’s origin, but to no avail.

Now, there is no hiding from a quantum computer behind a proxy or VPN. It uses algorithm-based process combined with ping response speed to determine probable origin up to an accuracy of 99.999%. We’re talking response time measured in millionths of a second, but for a quantum computer, it’s as simple as the ABC’s. Sure, it gets it wrong once in every million attempts, but the point is: it *always* has a guess. This time however, we received a new message.

“Unable to determine file origin.” Lundgren took a step back and pondered the situation and wiped the beads of glistening sweat from his brow. With nothing else at our disposal, he realized there was only one option left. And so, he gave one last command.

“Open it.”

The computer began to render the file, the process taking several minutes to complete. It was entirely in binary code, and eventually translated to a single message. Upon completion, two words in white font sat silently amidst a black background.

I never thought two simple words could have such lasting effects on my psyche. Those two words that have made me question everything I thought I ever knew. The computer fizzled out moments later and shut down. All of us just kind of left after that.

I returned home, overwhelmed by the events and left with a mystic sense of terror instilled deep in my stomach. The following morning, I was called by one of the investors. He informed me, that someone had broken into the lab late the previous night and sabotaged the operation. The lab was lit ablaze and soon reduced to a smoldering pile of ash, and the quantum computer was damaged beyond repair. Whoever had done it, possessed a security card and seemed to know the exact process required to dismantle the automatic sprinkler system.

Police held a single suspect in custody. A man who appeared as a neurotic mess in the center of a maniacal nervous breakdown. He was tried and convicted some time later and declared clinically insane. He was ordained to a mental health facility in northern Sweden, and it is there that he remains to this day. That man’s name? Henryk Lundgren.

I’ve never been able to properly assess just what it was that happened that day. The event has left me shaken and confused in more ways than I could possibly list. I don’t suppose I’ll ever be whole again, I just can’t be.

I know the truth, the reason for our meager existence. We had reached out far beyond, and something had answered our call. Whether or not it was truly what we would call ‘god’, I cannot possibly say. But I will say, after what I saw happen to Diabek, and what became of Lundgren, I can’t think of a better word for it. I think god is something we never could’ve imagined. It holds us all within the palm of it’s hand, and with a simple flick of the wrist, we would cease to be. There is no love, there is no salvation, there is only that which lies beyond the margins of reality. That which we have no possible hope in understanding, let alone combating.

One thing is also certain; it is watching us, and it does not want us meddling in that which we have no business seeing. We are set amidst an ocean of infinite black seas, and it was not meant for us to travel far. That final message could not have been clearer, and anytime I find myself drifting, I remember those two simple words relayed by the quantum computer in it’s last moments of life.

“TURN BACK.”"

**What is your parts list?**

TUF GAMING Z370-PLUS Motherboard
ASUS GeForce GTX 1080 ROG STRIX

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

After a Windows Update yesterday my PC used the CPU graphics instead of my 1080. Checking under ""devices"" the card was activated. Since reinstalling the drivers of the GPU did not work and the NVIDIA panel told me that there is no NVIDIA graphics card detected. The one month old card that did not have any issues before had its lights glowing just normal though.

At this point I did a large mistake, totally underestimating the dangers of BIOS. I went to the Bios Settings and changed [Primary Display] to [PCIE] and since then the screen is black.

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

I tried resetting and plugged my PC off several times, but every time I boot it, while the tower looks normal with all lights glowing and the fans moving, I do not get any Video Output and therefore can't view BIOS settings and undo my mistake.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Right now I'd like to know if maybe removing the Video Card will start the PC with the intern graphics card or if someone can provide me with a list of keys so I could reset the BIOS settings blind."

I'm a senior at Auburn, graduting in Media Studies by the end of next year. Most of my courses have been a mix of filmmaking, web design and scriptwriting courses with more general communication history courses here and there. GPA isn't impressive, though working on helping that much as I can.

I'm soon to graduate and I have a required internship to consider as well as a career choice beyond that. To be honest, I'm biting my nails because I have no clue where to go from here. A little funny since I'm 28 now, soon to be 29 and I figured I'd have figured it all out by now.

Auburn is a great school but it has little to offer in potential pathways in digital media. I really enjoyed scriptwriting and film editing, but I worry about the ease of landing a job in those fields after graduation. I co-hosted a pop  culture radio show at AU for a couple years, worked on the station staff for a couple semesters, but was turned off by how poor job prospects were in the radio industry (unless I'm completely wrong?) 

I have a strong passion for wildlife and conservation work, but aside from volunteering with animal rehabilitation and teaching horseback lessons, I have no clue if there's any place for my degree in such a field.

I've done a college program with Walt Disney World in FL and have another coming up very soon. I was much, much happier there than here in AL and have considered simply jumping into the company and moving up, eventually finish my degree at UCF or somewhere, and getting an even better job somewhere in the company afterwards. 

Still, that's a big change and one I don't want to lightly make. Family's invested so much in me finishing AU that I feel it'd be a betrayal to them if I didn't finish ASAP.

Of course,  I've been told by some that I'd be better off sticking with learning to code or going into a medical field or law enforcement so that doesn't help the worry. 

I also don't have a portfolio of any kind, aside from a couple small school project videos and a few scripts I've written; worried that it may be too late for me to build one up by the time I'm finished. 

I'm sure this looks like a vent more than a cry for advice; my apologies! 

I guess I'd just really appreciate some advice, any advice, on where I need to go from here. I need a path to walk on really, if that makes any sense. Thanks for any help. Be happy to answer any questions.

8z81ya,3,2018-07-16,Seeking advice to break into the IT while in college (plus resume critique needed),JGMURPY,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/8z81ya/seeking_advice_to_break_into_the_it_while_in/,"(recently made a new Reddit account because I disliked my previous username)

Hope you're all doing well.

I'm a regular lurker on this and several other career subs, and I need advice from you guys on what my next move should be. 

Some context: I am a soon-to-be Junior studying Information Systems at a relatively nice university in the Midwest. I want to begin my IT career soon, and am actively applying for entry level help desk positions that come up. Is the most effective way to move up the ladder to begin with a help desk job for a year, intern somewhere the next summer, and find another job for my final year in school before graduation? That has been my plan so far, and am actively pursing it. 

I have had a stable job working at a family friend's insurance agency that is 10 minutes away from campus for 2 years now. It genuinely is an incredible job (pay is kinda low since i'm not selling often) since I have a lot of free time there to do homework or study when i'm not on the phone or have something to work on. My boss &amp; co-workers are incredible people who are understanding of my situation and always allow me to have flexible work schedules during school, and are family friends (as mentioned). While I am very grateful to have had the job since my freshman year, I do not like being a salesman. I seriously want **nothing** to do with sales (or anything commission based) for my career. I dread making cold-calls and trying to sell my friends' parents insurance policies. For whatever reason, it just is not my thing.

One great thing about the insurance agency job is the vast amount of people i'm exposed to. I have met several IT professionals in my work, and have freely emailed them asking about what they do and how they got there (everyone is very happy to tell me what they do and offer help). About a month ago, I asked a lady who does Information Security at a very large agricultural biotech corporation based in the Midwest if she'd tell me a bit about her work, and she actually invited me to come to their campus and eat lunch with her and a few colleagues! I met with them and had a very productive conversation on what they did to get there, what their day to day work looks like, and what I can do to get where I aim to be. They seemed to agree that with my position, I would possibly be able to skip past the regular IT help-desk and directly into a junior system administrator type position thanks to my customer service experience (and the fact that they'd be able to pay me far less than a regular employee).

With everything being said, I want your opinion. Should I continue my search for a full-time help-desk job to gain experience while in college? Should I keep working at the insurance agency part-time for this year, and jump straight for an internship next summer? Would I be able to land a junior system administrative role before I graduate? I just don't know where to aim at this point.

I had my first in-person interview last Tuesday, but haven't heard anything back from them since (despite that I feel like I seriously nailed the interview). If I don't hear back from them this week, I'll write it off as an L (I have sent them follow-up emails thanking them for their time to no response). The main reason why I want to get a full-time help-desk job is to have the relevant work experience on my resume, **AND** the $5,000 of tuition reimbursement that they offer every year. I haven't had to pull out loans for school yet thanks to cutting costs by living with my parents &amp; commuting, and them generously paying for my tuition from a college savings fund they've had for me. I will need to take out my first loans this year, unfortunately. This job would put me in much less debt after graduation, which is an important thing for me.

**TLDR: Junior in college. Have 2 years of customer service experience working in insurance, and want to get into IT. Should I continue my search for a full time help-desk position, keep working in insurance until next summer when I could look for an internship, or continue my search for a help-desk job, work there for a year, THEN look for an internship?** 

[HERE ](https://imgur.com/a/leXz9lv)is a copy of my redacted resume for your critique. Would I be able to land an administrative type gig, as the people I've met with told me i could? Any certifications I could try to snag that would help me get there? "

I have a bachelors in computer science and very solid C++ and java programming skills. My area of expertise is with creative coding toolkits (processing, openframeworks and cinder). These are quite niche tools but are used to make interactive visual applications. Things like interactive touch screen environments, interactive installations, digital art pieces, generative graphics etc.

I’ve been living in London for the past 5-6 years working as a freelancer in these fields while also pursuing my own art practice which uses these tools with the end goal to set up my own studio. Things have been going well and I have found companies in my area moving away from hiring freelancers. Due to visa restrictions I am only able to work as a freelancer and it is almost impossible for companies in the UK to hire non eu foreigners. At the end of 2019 my business visa will run out with little chance of being able to renew it, plus I am tired of the political situation and people's attitude in the UK and the stress of living in London, i’m looking for a change.

I’m considering moving to Berlin as I often see jobs advertised there that I can possibly apply for, plus I speak some German (not enough to work in a german speaking company) and I have spent 6 months living there in my early 20s and loved it. 

My main fear is that i’m just into my 30s, have quite an impressive portfolio of projects but have never really had a proper full time position with a company since I finished uni. Just a long list of freelance work. I’ve never really had to develop my cv as all the work i’ve found has come through contacts or showing my portfolio. 
I’m looking to retrain in my spare time to learn more web based stuff which is the direction my field is going. Ideally i’m looking for work with design/branding agencies or large scale artists/collectives working with technology, but open to do anything that my skills would be appropriate for.  

Basically i’m looking for any tips or advice or if I am making a bad decision. Any Berlin tech scene cv tips or other things that will help me find a job would be appreciated as well.

TLDR: Been in London for 6 years, work in a pretty niche field of interactive, generative, graphic environments and considering moving to Berlin/Germany (or another country with favourable immigration laws for Australians). My cv is quite patchy but I have an extensive freelance portfolio but never worked full time for a company other than an internship years ago. Looking for advice on finding jobs, connections, connections, networking and how to present myself to employers. Or suggestions of other cities in Germany that might be worth visiting to find work.

To present myself: I am a recent Industrial Engineering grad (bachelor's degree) from Brazil and situation here is not very good (economically, socially and politically).

During the course of my degree (in Brazil), I have had the opportunity to study (1yr) and work (6 months internship) in Germany through a scholarship (exchange period). I have felt in love with the country and it felt so hard to come back to Brazil after this period.

As I said in the beginning, I have recently graduated in Industrial Engineering (sadly, it's not a ""in demand"" occupation in Germany) and since situation here is not very good for recent grads, I do have this project in my mind to make the move back to Germany, somewhen next year.

I have put some thought into it and reached some upsides/ downsides on my current situation:

**Upsides are**:

\- work experience: 3yrs total of relevant internships in different fields -&gt; supply chain/ logistics, manufacturing and product costing (2 multinational companies from the USA, 1 big local company and 1 multinational company from Germany, this last one was accomplished in Germany);

\- 5yr engineering degree (things in Brazil are different, here a bachelor of engineering takes the same time to complete as a bachelor + master in Germany)

\- I am able to speak English as a full professional language (C1 probably), German as a day-to-day language (B2, but I'm already improving and pretend to reach C1) and Portuguese as a native;

\- Have a solid analytical skill (data analysis, statistics) and am improving my programming skills (R and Python);

\- I possess recomendation letters from my former managers and co-workers (including my former german boss);

**Downsides are**:

\- I'm not in IT field;

\- I have graduated in a field that is not in demand (I'm refering to that arbeitsagentur whitelist);

\- I don't have an european nationality;

\- I don't have ""real"" work experience, only internships.

I really value the opinion of you guys, and I'm here to ask if you could give me some insights on my situation. Is it feasible to land a job in Germany considering my situation? If not, what do you think I should focus on to make it happen?"

*WELL* I made the jump to the government internship and I love it. I get to come in at any time between 7-9 am and once I arrive I’m expected to stay 8 hours. (If I come at 7am I leave at 3pm etc)

The building I work in has a full gym equipped with showers, working flat screen tv’s and lockers, which I get access to for *FREE* since I work here.

The job loads $250 at the start of the month onto my smart trip card so that I can use the metro to travel to and from work at no cost to myself.

The best part? I live near the metro and my job is right off of a metro stop close to where I live. My entire commute takes me 20 minutes starting from the time I walk out my front door. This is insane for the DC/MD/VA area and anyone who even recently moved here can attest to traffic/metro/commute times. 

Did I mention this is a paid internship?

The real treat is that this is by far my most educational internship, I’m learning more here than I did at any previous internship before. Learning about Cyber Security, Infrastructure, Web Development, etc

My problem is, this job is a little too convenient and I feel like I’m being spoiled by benefits. My youngness might be showing and these benefits might be standard or substandard to a few of you, but its the best Iv’e ever encountered. 

What sort of expectations should I have career wise once this internship is finished? I have two more classes until I get my degree (December) in Information Technology and I plan to get my Net+ sometime in October (before I graduate basically)

8zbcoq,5,2018-07-16,How do you deal with lack of support at a job both morale-wise and technical-wise? (partly a rant),goatsnboots,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8zbcoq/how_do_you_deal_with_lack_of_support_at_a_job/,"I recently made a career switch to data science (I know it's not CS, but that's not relevant). I've held two professional jobs in another profession for a total of four years, and I just started my first software engineering internship seven weeks ago at a massive corporation (this is my fifth internship). To be honest, it's been a terrible experience. The only languages I know are Python and R, and I was very upfront about this when I interviewed. The team I'm on only programs in Java. They (rightfully) decided to not have me learn Java since I'm only here for three months and it would be a waste of time. Instead I've been given the task of writing an algorithm in Python, that I'm not previously familiar with, for some product. The problem with that is that there is not a single person here who can guide me, both in terms of the maths involved and the Python language.  

During my first two weeks, I was assigned something of a mentor, although not officially. He yelled at me twice in front of the entire team for not having results ready to show. I went to my manager about it, and since then he's not spoken to me. After I sent a couple more emails to my manager requesting guidance, I was assigned another mentor in another country. He also did not know anything about the specifics of what I'm working on, so he got another guy on the team (in same foreign country) involved who has actually been lovely: he's spent a considerable amount of time emailing me and trying to give me ideas. The problem is that I am struggling to understand the concepts he talks about because what I'm doing is so new to me. He's also a little annoyed with me for being so slow with the concepts, and I know he's very busy with his actual job. 

I'm just feeling so dejected and lonely. My manager is nice, but I only see him once every two weeks and I don't talk to him in between. He's also not involved in my work at all. Everyone on my team (about thirty-five of us) is male and aged late thirties and over while I'm a mid-twenties woman. I don't mean to bring age and gender into it, but it's just highlighting the empty feeling I have. This team has apparently had other interns in the past, but it feels like they're not set up to handle people with little or no experience. Does anyone have any words of encouragement? What do you do when you feel like inadequate or lonely at work?"

I understand it’s a startup, but I was hoping the pay would be more (I have another part time internship that pays $15/hour, but I am doing “busy work” instead of actual coding). Is the offer I’m getting good or should I negotiate for something higher? (I’d be fine if they were also able to offer me $15, I’m not expecting big tech company pay).

So I am an IT intern at a tech company, majoring in CS next year...so prior to this job I have no college computer experience.

Confused with one of my assigments, I want to create a python script in order to 'log in' into this webpage. As well as if you enter or click certain buttons or titles, it'll give you permission to edit certain things on the webpage itself. Also knowing what a user has put in (I assume using a form) and allowing that person to access certain things or have less access on that certain webpage.

EX: Logging into an administration system, if you are a newer employee you can only clock in to your job title. However if you are an admin or someone higher up, you can edit job titles and delete certain users if need be.

Only thing I really don't know how to do is to have two seperate languages work together as so. If anyone could give me some tips on how I can do this, I would greatly appreicate it. 

EDIT: I can also use another language other than Python, that's just the language that's already installed into my work laptop. I can program in any other interior language and figure it all out."

I'm going into my 4th coop term now and I've basically done something completely different in each one

1) Mainly QA, some Data science work in Python

2) Pure OO work in .NET

3) Web Dev

And now I'm doing an embedded internship in the fall.

I was actually thinking of doing some iOS stuff in my 5th term to keep trying new things but then I talked to a bunch of classmates I know who are all starting to focus on one type of work(front end, back end, applications, etc) and it makes me feel kind of bad.

All the work I've done so far has been spread out and I don't actually know what kind of work I've liked the most. It all seems pretty meh to me and so I'm very unsure of what I want to do in the future. I feel like I just fucked around when applying to jobs because I would usually just apply to everything and pick whatever seemed the most interesting or would be the best learning experience without considering where I wanted it to lead in the future.

Anyone else feel similarly to this? I mainly used my coops as a way of testing different fields but now I feel like I just did a variety of things and have no real identity of who I am as a developer. I feel like this will hurt me when I apply to full time jobs because my experience is so varied.

Does anyone have some advice or some similar stories that will help me get on the right track or am I worrying for no reason?"

A bit of a history first: After graduating from art school in 2014, I fell into a huge depression in which I felt worthless, didn't want to move back home to my parent's messy divorce, and applied to minimum wage jobs (with no success) with my equally depressed brother sleeping on my couch. Although I was skilled in technically (Adobe Creative Suite, extensive drawing/design skills, Sculptris, etc.), my portfolio at the time was not substantial enough for clients to take notice and I was terrible at communicating with other artists within my area. I was at a dark place in my life. 

After a long journey of therapy, working as a dish washer, meeting new friends, setting up healthy boundaries, becoming certified to build websites and a moving from my old college town, I was able to make the best of a bad situation. I am now an intern for a design company that may or may not be sold within the next two months who occasionally creates websites/illustrations/logos as a freelancer. When I'm not at my internship or freelancing, I am usually going to local social networking meet ups to find work and meet up other creatives. 

Right now, my primary focus is to find a job that would provide me with a stable base, as well as give me the chance to continue my work in design. I've been using whatever time I have to send out cover letters and resumes to companies across country, but would like a good estimate of how many applications a day I should send (my own mother once told me that when she was out of college, she sent out twenty applications a day and got a job within two months. Is that even possible?)

I understand that I have stumbled and have been the primary cause of my own misfortune. My primary goal now is to get my life back together, become truly independent and live my life the way I see fit.

So... Anyone suggestions?

8zdyv7,23,2018-07-16,Ordinary Police Work - The Traffic Stop,BigbyWolf343,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/8zdyv7/ordinary_police_work_the_traffic_stop/,"Y’all asked for some more stories and I guess I’ve got a few. A couple weeks ago we had a traffic stop up the road a ways that was a little interesting.

It was on one of the roads up near the old coal mines, where the woods press in thick and the lanes are barely wide enough for anything but the smallest cars – the roads nobody ever uses, at least not anymore.

I wasn’t actually there when it happened. I was eating lunch down at Prichard’s Diner when the walky crackled and Paul’s timid little voice gave a droning, “Uhhhhhh…..”

I answered around a mouthful of burger. “What is it, Paul?”

“Uhhh – Sheriff?”

“What is it, Paul?” I asked again, rolling my eyes. I sucked the last bit of Dr. Pepper out of the old plastic cup.

“What do you do if a traffic stop, ya know, disappears?”

I rubbed my eyes. “You go after it, Paul. What do you –“

He cut me off. “No, Sheriff, not like running. They just kinda – vanished. Like they were here one second and the next they just sorta, ya know, weren’t.”

“Vanished?”

“Vanished.” His voice had that tone to it that children have when they realize they’re in over their head, the kind of hesitant upward inflection that says, “Yeah, I need an adult.”

I sighed. “I’ll be there soon.”

I climbed in the Crown Vic and turned the engine over, waiting for that sweet, sweet air-conditioning. Barely even noon and it was already hot and muggy and ridiculously bright outside. Everything had that baking asphalt smell that pervades everything in summer.

While the air blowing out of the vents cooled down, I grabbed the radio.

“Carol?”

“Yeeeaaap?” she asked cheerily.

“You wouldn’t happen to know anything about disappearing vehicles, would you?”

“Paul already asked. I have no idea. Sounds mighty spooky, you ask me,” she said.

“Spooky?” I laughed.

“Well it is close to the old mines. Weird stuff happens up there.”

“Trust me,” I said. “I know.”

I pulled out of the diner onto a little side road, then took a left to get back onto Main Street. There was traffic backed up at one of the red lights and I ended up stopped outside TJ’s furniture store, one of those old buildings with big windows that let you see all the way into the store. The furniture inside sat in neat little displays set up to look as attractive and normal as possible. I could even see TJ standing at the counter near the back, dressed in a yellow tie, his grey hair slicked back with a big smile on his face, just waiting for customers.

The light turned green and I pulled away with everyone else, slowly. Everyone goes slow with a cop around.

I turned up one of the side roads that wound out of town, the road that read “Freighterville Miner’s Highway,” and I found myself alone. Like I said earlier – no one uses these roads. It was a thin strip that cut its way up, up, up into the rolling hills. The Miner’s Highway went so far up that each year in the winter it froze almost entirely solid and became just a glassy sheet of ice. The cracks and the potholes got just a little wider, a little bigger, a little deeper. Hell, in some places it’s about half in danger of crumbling away. Eventually, though, I pulled around a bend in the road to a small straightaway, where I found Paul’s cruiser parked behind an old purple Camaro.

The moment he saw me, Paul hustled over and started in that, “Hold on and let me explain” way where someone talks really fast to try and explain everything before you can start yelling at them. “Sheriff, I’m glad you’re here. So the car was speeding down the road near Main Street and I tailed it for a ways just to see what it was doing and about a mile back, I flipped on my lights to pull ‘em over, so they kept driving a little and I was about to radio in they weren’t stopping but then they pulled over right here, so I pulled in behind them and was running the plates, looked down at my laptop for a second, and when I looked up they were just gone.” He sucked in a deep breath and looked at me, waiting to see if I was still gonna yell at him or not.

I pointed at the purple Camaro. “So… how did you find them again? Did you tail them, or…?”

He cocked his head to the side a little and furrowed his bushy eyebrows. All he needed was a different set of ears and he would have looked exactly like a confused pit-bull puppy.

“What are you talking about?” he asked.

I pointed at the car again. “How did you find them again?”

He looked to where I was pointing and scratched at his dark buzz-cut.

“I… didn’t? I’m confused.”

I looked at the Camaro idling in front of his police cruiser. It was a seventies model painted a gleaming royal purple and it idled with that deep wob wob wob wob wob that old cars have, like a pulse.

I looked at Paul, trying to decide, one, if this was a joke, and, two, if it was, how mad I was gonna be about it. The look on his face, though, convinced me it wasn’t. I know what real confusion looks like on him, mostly because it’s an expression he wears more often than not.

I took a deep breath and pushed past him to the car, then leaned down.

“I’m Sheriff Rober – shit. That’s – weird.”

The car itself was immaculate, like it has just been restored, but the people inside were – well, not. They were all dressed the same, two in the front seat and one in the middle of the back seat, all wearing khaki pants with white shirts and yellow ties. They looked like they belonged at an Easter cookout somewhere, not driving deserted back roads. That wasn’t the weirdest thing, though.

They didn’t have heads. I really don’t know how to put it any better than that. Everything just ended halfway up their necks, like their heads were just cut clean off with a laser or that blade thing the French used to use, the gilly-teen. There wasn’t any tearing, just a clean line and pulpy muscle. Couldn’t even see any bone.

I blinked a couple times and looked back at Paul, who, naturally, was still staring, more confused than ever, now with a slight look of concern too.

“Sheriff, what are you doing?” he asked slowly.

“You don’t fucking see this?” I gestured wildly at the car. “None of this?”

“I see you acting crazy. I see you kneeling in the road and talking to yourself.” He walked a little closer. “Are you sure you’re okay?”

I growled at him, then walked back to the cruiser and grabbed the radio.

“Carol. Purple Camaro. Headless people. Look it up.”

Carol’s voice crackled over the speaker.

“Yeah, sure. I’ll just put that into my database here and oh boy would ya look at that, it says, here, let me read it: “I don’t have any files on that.” There’s a footnote here too. Let me read that: “What the fuck are you talking about.” Hmm. Weird file, Kent.”

I threw the radio back onto the seat and marched back over to Paul, confused and furious at the same time.

“You better not be fuckin’ with me, Paul,” I grabbed him by the uniform and shoved my finger in his face. To his credit, he managed to look terrified.

“Sheriff, what the fuck are you talking about? Headless people?” He held up his hands and shook his head.

“What car did you pull over. What kind of car was it?” I snapped. I watched the Camaro, though while I talked, in case it tried to disappear on me too.

“A grey Toyota Camry, like maybe, uh, mid-eighties?”

I growled at him again and walked back over to the car. Honestly I couldn’t think of any words that would convey what I was feeling so the growl was the best could come up with.

“License and registration,” I said. I felt my teeth grinding.

The driver handed them out to me, then fumbled them as I tried to take them. They dropped on the ground with a clacking sound and the sound of something metallic. I knelt down to pick them up and, underneath the registration, a half-dollar coin glinted against the dark asphalt. I picked it up and turned it over, looking at the profile of Kennedy on the front and the shining Eagle on the back.

I looked up to find a grizzly sight that startled me more than I’d like to admit.

Underneath the car, less than a foot away from my knee, was me, pale and cold, with a long, deep cut across my throat. Blood poured out of it like a dark waterfall and inched across the pavement in a slowly spreading pool. Over my eyes were two glinting half-dollars.

“Is that a threat?” I asked the driver, standing back up and leaning into the car.

The driver shrugged, one of the only real gestures a headless person can make, I guess.

“What did you pull them over for?” I asked Paul.

He picked at his nails furiously. “The Camry? Speeding, remember?”

“Just speeding?”

“Yeah. They didn’t do anything else as far as I could tell.

I looked at the license the driver handed me. The picture was nothing but a neck. It might have been funny if I wasn’t so angry. I wondered for a second if I could arrest them – but I knew I couldn’t. The only reason they were pulled over was speeding, if it was even them. On top of that, they’d made a threat, and if Paul couldn’t see them – well, three against one wasn’t good odds.

I threw the license and registration back through the window into the driver’s lap.

“Have a nice day and fuck off.”

Supposedly, humans have this ability to detect when they’re being looked at. Even when you’re asleep, if you’re being stared at, some weird part of your brain knows it. It’ll wake you up with an uneasy feeling that something’s wrong. When I threw the license back into the car, I got that uneasy feeling. Those three couldn’t stare, not really… but they did. They stared. With hatred and anger, they stared.

I did my best to stare back, to show they didn’t scare me, but how do you meet someone eye to eye that doesn’t have eyes? Stare at their stump? In the end, one reached over and turned their radio up and they drove off, leaving only the smell of exhaust and the receding sounds of AC/DC.

After they disappeared around a bend in the road, I turned to Paul.

“What… the fuck?” he asked.

“I don’t know,” I said honestly. I realized then that I was still holding the half-dollar I picked up from the ground, squeezing it so hard it was hurting my palm. I looked at it for a second and the sight of my own body flashed through my mind.

I shook my head and flicked the coin to Paul. He snatched it out of the air and turned it over. So he could see that, at least.

We didn’t talk much the rest of the day. I think Paul was a little afraid of me honestly, so we didn’t talk. I sat back in the office, filling out reports and memos and invoices and… just doing a lot of stuff nobody tells you about when you become a cop. A lot of stuff that gets in the way. I don’t know what Paul did most of the day, but now and again I’d hear the sound of a coin pinging off the floor.

It was probably about seven when I got up to stretch my legs. I don’t know – might’ve been closer to eight. The light coming through the windows was distinctly red; I remember that. It was that time of the evening where the air conditioner starts to feel just a little bit cooler than you’d like.

I decided to walk down the hall to the front desk. Some kind of acoustic music was playing quietly through the computer speakers. That kind of music with long, plucked notes on guitars and no words. Paul was entertaining himself by spinning the half-dollar on his desk.

When I turned the corner, though, I nearly jumped out of my skin. They were there, all three of them, headless standing around the desk like arranged mannequins, all turned towards Paul. I stopped short. They swayed slightly.

Paul looked over from the desk, concerned.

“What is it, Sheriff?”

I tried to stay as calm as possible. “You – really don’t see them, do you?”

The color drained from his face. I had told him what I’d seen, but I knew he hadn’t believed me. How do you convince someone you’re seeing something they just can’t? He was struggling between the two possibilities of me being crazy, or me being sane – and I don’t think he knew which scared him more.

“This again?” he asked quietly, his voice quivering a little.

I nodded. “So here’s the thing. Either I’ve been having a stroke for most of the day or there’s something wrong.”

He started to look around.

“Don’t.”

He froze, and for a second, we locked eyes, the sound of the long-held guitar notes twanging from the speaker.

“Follow me down to the cells. Slowly.”

He nodded and eased himself out of his chair.

The cells were all in the basement. The precinct was small but the basement underneath was massive, with four long hallways running out in different directions like a cross. It was all lit by strips of long fluorescent lights that hung from the ceiling and painted everything a shade of sterile white. No matter the time of year, that feeling of cold never left. The cells stretched away down the southern hallway, old things with black iron bars running from floor to ceiling with white block walls.

We walked down to the very end, to the very last cells, all while they followed in perfect sync. Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. Right foot. Left. Right. Left. Right. Like soldiers in goose-step. All while the hollow heels on their shoes clicked with each and every synchronized step.

Paul shivered, and I put my hand on his shoulder.

“Walk into the cell and all the way to the back wall.”

“You’re just gonna lock me in there with ‘em?” he said, through teeth that were somewhere between gritted and chattering.

“No. Just trust me.”

He took a shuddering breath, then nodded.

I slid the cell door open with a loud clang and Paul stepped inside to the back wall, pressing himself flat against it. The three – things – kept on down the hallway. Left. Right. Left. Right. The cold lighting overhead made yellow ties shine like pale gold.

I wasn’t sure what I would do if they didn’t follow him into the cell, but luckily they did. They filed in one at a time and took up places in a semi-circle around, then stopped, then everything was quiet again.

“What now?” he whispered. Even whispering, though, his voice bounced around the cold stone and seemed impossibly loud.

“Just walk forward. Slowly.”

He did, step by step, and the three slowly parted for him, shuffling out of the way with nothing more than the sound of rustling fabric.

“Are they – moving?” he asked.

“Just keep walking.” Just keep walking, and be ready to run, I wanted to tell him.

He stepped out of the cell and I slammed it closed with a clankening BANG! I let out the breat I didn’t know I’d been holding.

Paul turned back and looked around in the cell, craning his neck this way and that with a worried look on his face.

“Are they still in there?”

“They are.” They stood lined up along the bars, all standing perfectly still, their hands in their pockets. They didn’t seem in the least bit perturbed.

“You don’t sound happy about it.”

“I don’t know.”

“Should we call the Coroner?“

“No.”

“Why?” he asked.

“Because I said so. I can figure this out. I just need time. Go home for the night. Get some rest.”

“Sheriff, I don’t think I could rest if I tried. Either there are things trying to kill me that I can’t see or you’ve finally lost it.” His eyes darted back and forth between me and the cell as he spoke, still trying to decide which possibility was more likely.

“Stay in the bunk room. There’s the old cot back there. But you’re off duty for the night.”

He nodded, and with one last look at the cell, then at me, turned and strode off down the hallway.

“That’s fuckin’ weird,” said Carol. I was talking to her through the radio in my office. The last dregs of red sunlight were almost gone and the office was full of shadows.

I flicked on the desk lamp.

“Tell me about it. So now the kid’s sleepin’ in the back, and I’ve got a cell full of things that apparently only I can see. Or I’ve lost it.”

“It could be both,” she said nonchalantly. Of course none of it mattered to her – not really.

“Dear God, don’t tell me that. Please don’t tell me that.”

“Sorry,” she said. She didn’t sound sorry.

“There’s nothing in the files about these people,” I said, absently flicking papers around on my desk. “I don’t even have an idea of what they could be, and I don’t think I can just leave them down in the cell forever – can I?”

“You could always –“

“I swear to God if you say I can call the Coroner.”

“Well, if anyone would know…” Her tone was the vocal equivalent of a shrug.

“I think I’m gonna go grab food. Maybe I’ll get an idea while I’m out.”

“I think that’s a good idea,” she said. “Just get something at least a little healthy.”

“Meat’s heathy,” I said.

The ride down to the diner promised to be the same as ever when I pulled out of the parking lot. I turned out and took a right onto Main Street, cruising past yawning black windows of closed shops. Only one shop had a light on, and it was TJ’s Furniture. Somewhere far back in the store, just behind the desk, it glowed, giving off just enough light for me to see TJ still standing at the counter. I could see his gleaming teeth in the dark – still smiling. It was right then that I remembered what TJ had been wearing: khakis, a white button-up, and a yellow tie.

I pulled a U-turn in the middle of the street and parked in front of the store, then grabbed the radio from its holder by the glove compartment.

“Carol. I’m gonna talk to TJ about something.”

“Okay…?” She sounded confused.

“If I’m not back in about thirty, you know what to do.”

“Want me to send backup?” she asked. I thought, just for a second, I could hear a little concern in her voice – but it was so quick I couldn’t tell.

“What backup? Kid’s asleep in the back. Unless you’re gonna help. And we both know you’re a little limited.”

The radio crackled with static for a second.

“Just be careful.” There was that concern again. Strange to hear, especially from her.

It’s amazing how strange small-town America looks at dusk. There’s no light but it’s not dark yet. The streetlights haven’t come on and fireflies blink in and out to the faraway whine of cicadas and frogs. There’s the signs of life everywhere, the signs of civilization, but everyone’s gone home, and everything’s quiet. A single car buzzed down Main Street, and once it passed, I was alone.

I looked in the big display window, cupping my hands around my face to get a better view. He was still there, near the back – still just smiling away.

I walked through the door and the bell tinkled.

Tingalingaling.

Most of the store was nothing but dark shapes now, vague outlines of chairs and couches and tables, all detail erased in the dark. How easy would it be for someone to hide in all that? How many people could be just behind those dark shapes, waiting to jump out? The image from earlier flashed through my mind again and I shook it away.

“TJ! How’s business, man?” I threw on a happy smile and held my hand up to wave.

TJ didn’t move or respond. He just faced forward, still smiling.

I picked my way down one of the aisles that ran between the displays. A long carpet was rolled out to mark the way and, walking on it, I didn’t make a sound. I wasn’t sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing.

“TJ?” I asked.

I reached down and loosened my gun in its holster.

“TJ?” I asked again.

I was finally close enough to see a little more detail. It was TJ’s smiling face I was seeing, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes. The smile was frozen to his face, like someone had pulled his mouth upward into it, but his eyes – he looked terrified, horrified. It wasn’t his body, either. The head was sewn on to the neck with thick, white string the size of a spaghetti noodle and he was leaning forward slightly.

I made my way around the wooden counter to get a better view. Halfway around, I saw what was keeping TJ upright: a thick metal rod driven into the floor between his shirt and his body. It just barely peeked out of his collar beneath his grey hair. His shirt stretched tight like a harness as his limp body constantly tried to fall forward.

“Shit. TJ. Fuck,” I whispered. I looked back towards the street, but with the light behind me, and the street outside now totally dark, all was a mishmash of mottled shadows.

A noise sounded on the other side of the door behind the counter. I spun around, half expecting something headless to come charging out, heels clicking, and grabbing for me.

Through the door was the upholstery shop, a big open space where TJ took on side projects reupholstering old chairs and couches and things. It was a big open room with tools along all the walls and pieces of fabric and old furniture scattered around – at least that’s how it always was when I’d seen it before. My mind raced wondering what was back there now.

I pulled my gun and clicked the safety off, then crept forward slowly and put my hand on the old door. The wood was so warm it was almost hot, and it vibrated under my hand like a purring cat.

I slowly twisted the knob, hoping beyond hope that it wouldn’t make any noise, and pushed the door open. It swung in slowly and my breath caught in my throat.

All the old furniture scraps were gone, and, in their place – dozens of bodies, all dressed just like TJ outside, laid out shoulder to shoulder on the cold stone floor. Every single one was headless. In the far corners, large lamps glowed a soft yellow, and, somewhere, a strange synthesizer version of a piece of classical music played like a lullaby. If it weren’t for the bodies, the room would have been almost soothing

Something shimmered in the air over all the bodies and I walked further inside to get a better look. Strings hung from the ceiling, one over every body, all different lengths, with some hanging almost to the floor, while some dangled at eye-level, but at the end of each piece of string, a coin was tied. There were pennies and dimes and half-dollars and quarters, some so new they were shiny and some so worn and old that everything was worn away. They all turned back and forth on their strings, sometimes tails, sometimes heads, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

The air was so still that I was afraid to breathe. There were rows between the bodies where I could walk and the image of a garden popped into my head.

I was almost at the end of one of the rows when I saw it: a shiny Kennedy half-dollar with a small hole punched in it lying on the ground, the outline of Kennedy’s head facing the ceiling. I picked up the little coin and turned it over in my hand. I looked at all the others slowly spinning on their little strings in the half-light. Sure enough, after a moment, I saw one piece of string that was empty.

I did my best to tie it back where it belonged, and, when I was pretty sure it wouldn’t fall (I was never the best at knot-tying), I gently pulled my hand away and the string went taught under the weight of the coin. It started to rotate back and forth like all the others, and Kennedy’s head seemed to smile at being back where it was supposed to be.

I smiled too, come to think of it, then started looking for the other two coins.

“Carol?” I asked when I was back in the Crown Victoria, back out on the dark, deserted stretch of Main Street. The streetlights were finally on.

The radio crackled for a second.

“Everything okay?” she asked. The tone wasn’t quite concern anymore, just – hesitation, I guess.

“Yeah. Figured out what's going on. One of TJ’s little experiments finally got him, seems like.”

“Ah,” she said. She didn’t sound in the least bit surprised.

“Yep. I’m pretty sure I got everything sorted, though.”

“Well, good. I’m guessing it killed him, whatever it was.”

“Oh, absolutely brutally. Of course.” I turned the car on to have the air conditioning. The heat was stifling, even at night, and police uniforms aren’t really known for being breezy.

“Looks like you have to call the Coroner anyway,” she said, the usual edge of laughter creeping into her voice again.

“I’ll call his intern. This is a job for him, anyway.”

“You’re probably right,” she said. “Are you still going to get food?”

“No, I think I’m going home for the night. I’ll have my radio if you need me.”

“Mhm.” It sounded like she wasn’t even paying attention.

“Carol?”

“Yeah?” she asked.

“Don’t need me.” And I hung the radio on its holster. I rolled the windows down, turned the AC up higher, and rolled down Main Street, hanging my arm out into the wind. The old street lights glowed orange on either side and the thick air smelled like rain.

I didn’t doubt for a second I’d find the cells empty tomorrow, but on the off chance they weren’t – I could deal with it then.

I leaned back and sighed that sigh that everyone knows – the one you give yourself at the end of the day. It wasn’t a bad day really. A little frustrating, but, overall, pretty average I guess.

1) Mainly QA, some Data science work in Python

2) Pure OO work in .NET

3) Web Dev

And now I'm doing an embedded internship in the fall.

I was actually thinking of doing some iOS stuff in my 5th term to keep trying new things but then I talked to a bunch of classmates I know who are all starting to focus on one type of work(front end, back end, applications, etc) and it makes me feel kind of bad.

All the work I've done so far has been spread out and I don't actually know what kind of work I've liked the most. It all seems pretty meh to me and so I'm very unsure of what I want to do in the future. I feel like I just fucked around when applying to jobs because I would usually just apply to everything and pick whatever seemed the most interesting or would be the best learning experience without considering where I wanted it to lead in the future.

Anyone else feel similarly to this? I mainly used my coops as a way of testing different fields but now I feel like I just did a variety of things and have no real identity of who I am as a developer. I feel like this will hurt me when I apply to full time jobs because my experience is so varied.

Does anyone have some advice or some similar stories that will help me get on the right track or am I worrying for no reason?"

* I also got accepted to a STEM MS program here. I really want to attend.

* Does it make more sense for me to attend University and slowly learn German over the next 2 years or spend one more year learning **intensively** to get a B1 certificate and then enroll in university next year? 
* Or is it better to learn German slowly over the next 2 years and attend University at the same time?

Recently my financial aid situation changed and my ability to pay for college was greatly reduced. I'm pleading my case to my college but barring some miracle I'll probably be compelled to work hard and graduate in 3 years just to reduce the amount of debt I take on (originally I was planning on spending the full 4 years and taking some extra courses and adding a math major). I haven't had an internship, and since this now figures to be my last summer, I'll enter the job market after graduation with no internships under my belt. One thing that might help my case is I have amassed a \~3.9 GPA so far in school.

I have a couple of questions here:

1. Should I take a senior project course? Main reason I ask is that this final year will require me to take a few intense courses simultaneously. I've always been fine with academic concepts and test taking, but I get stressed and struggle with large projects because I often procrastinate on them. I fear that taking a project course will be too stressful for me when I'll already have a significant CS course load. However if my job prospects go down the toilet if I skip this class, obviously I'd have to find a way to fit it in.
2. What do my overall job prospects look like? Like I said I will not have internships, and I don't have very many personal projects either. I'm confident I can whip up a couple of small projects to display, but I'll definitely be a pretty raw programmer overall.

Thanks in advance for any guidance, these last few days have been really stressful. If this is a question more for r/csMajors, just let me know."

I was wondering how difficult it is to land an internship abroad—preferably in the US or Canada, but anywhere in Europe would be great too. Do employers actually want to take on the hassle that comes with an intern from another country, housing, visa, etc?

8zfvye,1,2018-07-16,Who came out on top?,Mishellle,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/8zfvye/who_came_out_on_top/,"Warning: Long post ahead because I am an extremely wordy person. I've tried to cut the paragraphs down, which may result in some context missing. If something doesn't make sense, let me know!


I'm a new teacher; I look like I'm about 15. It's a curse that will turn into a blessing when I'm 40, but right now it's a curse, and it definitely exacerbated this whole situation. It doesn't help people take me seriously, and I'll be dealing with that for a long time. 


I convocated in the Spring of 2017 and received a classroom position in my favourite grade, Kindergarten, at the end of September 2017. It was not a maternity leave - my students were my own students, who had been in a failed split class for the first month.


It was a struggle. I went from TCing and doing my internship in a brand new school with very privileged students to teaching at a community school with students whose circumstances broke my heart. My classroom had many, many, many behavioural issues, some which required frequent evacuations of the classroom, and even with the support of several paraprofessionals (normally stationed outside of the classroom), I was drowning. Even they were drowning! It was a huge relief when the school's student support services teacher pulled me aside one day to reassure me that ""I have no idea what to do either"".


It was a bit of a saving grace when, post-Christmas, my class was provided with a full-time EA. With another adult in the room, my attention was no longer so extremely split - I could provide support to the students who needed it without having to stop every five seconds to deal with an issue elsewhere, and could find the time to help those students who were ahead of others really flourish. 


And then it became... not such a gift? I'm not sure when it happened - looking back, I was blind to it for a very long time, but this EA didn't respect me. They were a first time EA, but had several children and definitely believed that they were a better educator than I was. While I have nothing but respect for mothers, their experience does not invalidate an educator's or schools would be irrelevant. There were plenty of 'innocent' comments criticizing my teaching style, questioning my choices, challenging my authority in the classroom because ""I wouldn't do that"", ""Are you sure this works?"" ""This isn't working out well, hey?"" (When the lesson was going exactly as planned). 


Little by little, she became worse and worse until she was outright contradicting me and my classroom decisions in front of the students after I'd spoken to both them AND her about my expectations. Ignorance is only an excuse so far, and it definitely ends when I was being extremely explicitly with my expectations yet she still managed to question and contradict. At least I managed to stop the outright defiance in front of students, but the comments to me remained. I'm an extremely unconfrontational person - GAD and social introversion make me very prone to 'stay in my lane', keep my head down, and smile and nod. It wouldn't be until the end of the day or when relaying these events to my family that I would realize how bad they were.


I have always wanted to continue my own education. I feel strongly that the more knowledge I have, the greater benefit it will be to my students. So, I applied to do my Master's in an area that is both interesting to me, but highly applicable to all grade levels should I someday have a position in a non-ECE grade. I wasn't certain if I would be accepted, given that I only have a year of experience and the university that I applied only changed their experience requirement from 2 years to 1 the year before, but I knew that I wanted to do it. If I didn't get in, fine. I'd work another year and try again. If I did, great!


I made the mistake of telling this to EA. Highlights of the comments she made over the next three months include: ""You're not going to get in."" ""I just wouldn't get my hopes up too much."" ""Why would they let you in?"" ""What are you doing next year? (And, when I reminded her that I was waiting to hear from the university before I could know what city I would be in) I wouldn't bother waiting for them to get back to you before you decide."" ""You have no experience."" ""It's nice that you tried, but..."" ""Why would they want a teacher like you?"" (I believe she was referring to my lack of experience there, but I was too frustrated to ask for clarification). When I stopped responding to these comments she drew other teachers in. ""Hey Mrs. X, do you think a university should allow a teacher with one year of experience to do their master's?"" And then grinned victoriously at me when this teacher said something that was fairly neutral but could be interpreted as supportive of her point. 


You know what? Her years of raising her children did not qualify her to make the decision of whether I should be allowed to further my education. Her criticisms of my classroom and teaching style (which, by the way, resulted in 90% of my ragtag group of Kinders being on par for the beginning of grade one expectations) gained her nothing. Meanwhile, today I got the e-mail - I'm in. I'm officially a graduate student, and I am on top of the world. She can complain and criticize and try to contradict someone else, and in the end, she'll be as wrong with them as she was with me. I did it!


Tl;dr - I had an EA in my first year of teaching who contradicted me, criticized me, and questioned me. She didn't think that I was worthy of doing my Master's so soon. She was wrong."

8zg4vo,246,2018-07-16,Pros and Cons of NYU (from a current student),arctic_moss,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/8zg4vo/pros_and_cons_of_nyu_from_a_current_student/,"Hello all! I thought I would make this post for those thinking of applying to NYU or some fodder for your ""Why NYU"" essay. A little bit about me: I'm a rising senior at NYU in the Steinhardt school, and my major is Media and Communication. I've taken classes in Stern, Tisch, Gallatin, and CAS and have lots of friends in those schools that have shared their experiences with me. So, here's my long pro and con list of NYU!

**Pros**

* New York City. I would be remiss to not mention this first; it was the reason why I chose to go to NYU and one of the best (or worst, depending on your personal preferences) parts of the school. The main NYU campus is in downtown Manhattan, and the Tandon engineering school is in downtown Brooklyn. In my opinion, the main campus is in one of the best parts of the city, spanning the Villages with Washington Square Park in the middle of campus. There's tons of things to do just around the campus, from great food, museums, entertainment, nightlife, all the shopping you could ever need, etc. NYU also has great subway access, being close to 5 different subway lines, so you can really go anywhere in the city. It takes only about 15 minutes from campus to Upper or Lower Manhattan (if the subway isn't delayed), making it great for internships commute-wise. 

If you're thinking of applying to Tandon, you should know that you'll be in Brooklyn, semi-separated from the rest of the campus. There is a free NYU bus that goes between the Manhattan campus and the Brooklyn campus. However, I've heard from some current Tandon students that it kinda feels like they're not apart of the ""real"" NYU, so this location could be a con for engineering students. But the Tandon campus is in a great part of Brooklyn, also really close to fun stuff to do. So in my opinion, I don't think it's a con unless you make it a con.

* General level of education. I think NYU has a great curriculum, and basically allows you to have a well-rounded education while also diving deep into your major AND in my experience lots of room to try new things with electives. I've definitely had some duds in terms of classes and professors, but those have really been the minority in comparison to the amazing classes I've taken. Most of the specifics regarding curriculum will depend on the school, so here's what I know in general:

In general, you'll have a liberal arts core curriculum regardless of what school you're in (except Gallatin which has a similar requirement but lesser). This basically includes Writing the Essay, a foreign language, a science component, a math component, a history component, a social science component, a critical theory/literature component, and an arts/expressive cultures requirement (not doing art, more like analyzing it). This can be an upside or downside for people. For me, it was kind of a mixed bag—some core classes I *loved* and wanted to basically minor or major in those subjects, and others were so ""bleh."" BUT I've also found that a lot of core classes can be waived with AP credit, so DEFINITELY take as many AP tests as you can. I skipped both semesters of science because of AP Bio, my history component with APUSH, and my social science requirement with AP Psych. If I had bothered to take the AP Lit test, I could have skipped the critical theory requirement. Basically if you rack up as many AP test scores as possible (you basically only need to get a 4 in my experience) you can graduate a semester or even a year early. This will save you so much money.

Then, you'll have requirements for your major, which is probably some core classes and then electives within the major. These will usually be seminars unless you're in the big Bio and Chem stadium classes or maybe some Stern classes. Generally, my classes in my major have been around 15-20 students. Those classes can either be more lecture based, with lots of time for questions, or they are completely discussion based (my favorite).

Classes are typically either twice a week for 1 hr 15 min, or once a week for 3-4 hrs. Usually core classes will have recitation or lab sections as well. Foreign language classes are four times a week though. In terms of scheduling, I went from having class every day (due to the language requirement) to this year having class two times a week (leaving three days for an internship or honestly just sleeping lmao). Also, NYU offers lots of night classes (from 6:00-9:00 usually) to accommodate those with internships.

I wouldn't say that there's grade deflation or inflation except for Stern. I'm sure there's statistics out there showing that NYU leans one way or another, but I would say that it's very dependent on the teacher. Some classes I've really slacked in and got an A; others I've worked my ass off for a much lower grade. It really depends on the professor or TA doing the grading. In Stern of course, there's a curve where only 15% of the section can get an A. Those are tough in the classes I've taken at Stern, and sometimes I thought the grading was a little unfair due to the need to place students in a curve. But it's not enough to make it a con in my experience. I'm not sure about the curve in math or science classes; unfortunately, I've only taken one math class and I can't remember if it was curved. 

One more thing I'll say about the education is that I've found that attendance is required in almost every class. I thought that when we got to college they would stop making us go to class everyday but then I got to NYU and it's basically the same lmaooooo fuck. Usually there will be a set number you can miss unexcused without a grade penalty, but then if you exceed that your grade can suffer. Even in big lectures they can check it by doing a clicker thing, but there's ways to get around it. Ofc I don't always love this rule, but it does get my ass to class so that's good.

I would say that I've learned so much while I'm here and had so many opportunities to try new things. I've become more well-read, more cultured, and I've seen the world differently. I'm definitely sure you can learn new things and do all this in other schools too though! I just personally count the education as a pro for NYU.

* Study Abroad Program. DO THIS DO THIS DO THIS. Really. NYU's study abroad program is AMAZING. It's the one thing I'll really applaud NYU for. TBH this is where most of our tuition money goes, so if you choose to go to NYU, you should definitely take advantage of this. 

So, there's these ""global campuses"" all over the world, and they're all NYU based. Meaning, it's not like an exchange program where you go to like Oxford or something. Rather, you go to ""NYU London."" This in itself has pros and cons to it. The downside is that you won't have as many opportunities to meet locals through classes and stuff. BUT you gain a lot in convenience. I was briefly considering an exchange program to a country that had no NYU campus, and it seemed like a nightmare in terms of applications and paperwork. With NYU, you basically just have to apply to do study abroad and do your visa application and that's it. NYU also just hand-holds you through the process, which tbh I appreciated.

People usually study abroad either their second semester sophomore year or their first semester junior year. I went to NYU Sydney my sophomore year and I'm not kidding, I think I peaked there. This is where I'm kinda biased to my own experience, but I really just had an amazing time in Sydney. I had class three days a week, so I had a five day weekend every week to just explore or relax or do whatever. Every week, they would do a field trip to go somewhere in Sydney. I remember going to the Sydney Opera House to see a ballet, seeing a rugby game, going hiking in the Blue Mountains, etc. They really take you to see so much for free it's amazing. 

The classes were really fun too! I was recommended by my advisor to just take one class in my major and three electives and it was the best decision I could have made. I ended up minoring in one of those electives, spurred on by the class I took in Sydney. And in general, the classes were pretty chill; not so chill that you could just phone it in always, but really not as stressful compared to New York classes. Also, the professors would have to fit in a couple field trips during the semester, so you see a lot through the different field trips. I went to a taping of an Australian talk show, a ton of museums, and saw a lot of landmarks. 

The last thing I'll say about study abroad is that it's a great opportunity to make friends. It's true that NYU is not the most socially-friendly place, and the first couple of semesters you can feel lost. I only had one really good friend through my whole first year and a half. I will say that my experience turned around completely when I went to Sydney. I ended up rooming with amazing people that became my friends to this day. When I came back, I was so much more confident and sure of myself that I made friends through my friends I made studying abroad and I grew my social circle a ton. The study abroad programs are usually pretty small, and the advisors really try and make sure that no one is left out. I was super worried about not making friends, but I ended up with tons! And I noticed that there was no outsiders in our program; we all grouped up and I didn't see any loners by the end of the semester.

The programs that I have heard are really amazing include Sydney, London, Prague, and Paris. I've not heard anything bad about the other programs, but these are especially good programs. ESPECIALLY Prague. Everyone I know who went to Prague raves about it so much it kinda makes me a little jealous lol. 

* Career services and internship opportunities. This is a really big one, and I think it's definitely important. NYU has a great career services department in the Wasserman center. Every day it seems like they host job fairs and OCR. Especially with Stern, you're gonna get a lot of help with making sure you get the best job you can get. 

The other thing is internships. NYC is the greatest city you can be in if you want an internship, and most of the big companies offer school-year internships. The great advantage of being here is that you can have fall, spring, and summer internships giving you tons of experience for when you leave. And the competition during the school year is so little that I generally just email companies in August and get a job almost immediately. Also, as I mentioned before, NYU does a great job of accommodating for internships in that most of the classes only meet once or twice a week and also a ton of night classes.

**Cons**

* Cost. Of course this is a big thing. Honestly NYU has shit financial aid and shit tuition and it sucks. There's also just a general feeling like ""Where is my money going?"" There's a pervasive feeling of like NYU is screwing us. It seems like every other day there's a new protest in the student center about it. It's basically become a meme how bad the financial aid is and it stings when u think about how much ur paying and then it seems like every printer is just not working.

You also run into BIG cost of living problems in NYC. It can be really easy to overspend. Like why would you wanna go to the dining hall when you can have literally any type of food in the world and have it delivered to you in 30 min? Or like even if you cook, grocery prices are still horrible. A pint of beer is around $9. A mixed drink is like $11. Subway and Uber costs. It just all really adds up and can cause you to spend way beyond your means, and all of this is in addition to the exorbitant tuition. 

A hidden consequence to this is that you'll be surrounded by either people who have taken on hundreds of thousands in debt...or people who can pay for it right away. So you'll find a ton of rich people at NYU. These people can be really entitled and snobby. There's a large population of rich international students who only talk to other rich international students with their Gucci belts and Saint Laurent boots. And don't get me wrong, there's lots of nice people with a lot of money that go to NYU as well. I'm friends with a lot of these people. But being friends with them can cause you to spend more; like, you see these people taking Ubers everywhere and going to $40 per person brunches weekly and you start to think that you can do those things too. It's kind of like a Keeping up with the Jones's thing. 

You can definitely stick to a budget while being here. It's not that hard, it just requires a lot of fortitude that a lot of people don't have. I'm lucky enough to have parents kind enough to pay my tuition. And so much of it depends on your situation like your major, your family circumstances, your scholarships, whether you need to save for grad or medical or law school, etc. So I can't really give advice but to say that cost is a huge con to NYU and you have to think really carefully about whether it's worth it. 

* Large and disparate campus, feeling of isolation. You will not have a typical college campus experience here. There's no quad surrounded by university buildings (unless you count Washington Square Park which really doesn't have that feeling...), there's no football game tailgating or really any sense of school spirit, there's not even really a distinction between ""on-campus"" and ""off-campus."" This can be a big con for some people. To others, it might be a pro. For me, I do kinda miss the sense of college campus and school pride and that stuff. It's just a very different feeling to a lot of other schools. 

A consequence of this is that people can often feel isolated or alienated. You can feel really small in this big city, and it really can be very hard to make friends. A lot of people I know at NYU are depressed (to be fair, I think this is a general college feeling as well as tbh a generational depression shared by millennials/gen z). NYU can feel like a pressure cooker, when you have to deal with school, work, finding or keeping friends, money, etc. And it's really easy to feel like you're alone in feeling this. (The upside is that you learn and adapt and become a stronger person when you're done)


um yeah so this got to be a little long so i'll stop now lol. i hope someone ends up reading this. and the formatting got messed up so i hope its clear uh

TLDR: Pros: New York City, the academic rigor, study abroad programs, and internship opportunities. Cons: cost and feeling of social isolation

Also if you wanna ask me any questions about NYU or applying, this can be a casual AMA. My inbox is also open for whatever you wanna ask too. ok lol bye now

8zg5ic,158,2018-07-16,Advice for College First-Years,yawnmasta,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8zg5ic/advice_for_college_firstyears/,"I wrote this a while ago, intending it to send it to someone. Unfortunately, we despise each other now. But I didn’t want to waste this so I’m posting it here.

BOOKS:

Books in university are a massive money pit. I’ve heard of people spending close to a thousand on supplies and materials per semester. The reason being is that these books are extremely price gouging. New books typically cost upwards $100. What typically happens is that schools will attach an access code to the book where you will do your homework online. These access codes will cost between $50 and $120 in my experience. 

Suppose you go to the school’s book store and buy a new textbook and the access code. For some, it’d be easier to explain with the tangible example of my Gen. Chem 1 class. At my school, the textbook and the access code together were $300 new. I only paid $100. How? I bought an older edition of the book for $20 on Amazon and then went online and bought the access code from the site directly for $80. A really big price-gouging method that I’ve noticed is that schools will cut a book in half and sell them separately to two different classes. The first half of my $20 older and used book was completely identical the new textbook used in my Gen. Chem 1 class. The second half was completely identical to the Gen. Chem 2 class’s text book.

For classes like biology and chemistry, you’ll also need to buy supplies. Such as lab coats, goggles, etc. At the book store, you’ll find that they are extremely expensive here as well. You can spend $20 on goggles when you can spend far less at an equipment/tool store nearby. I saved almost a hundred dollars doing this.

Absolutely do not buy your books before class starts unless your professor has told you to buy these books and have them ready before class. What typically happens is that the first day of classes, the professor will go over the syllabus, then if there’s any time left they will start a lecture. However, you will not need a textbook for this. The professor will inform you of what you will need for the course, so you should buy the materials when you know you need them. If you run around buying textbooks from older students, you will get price-gouged. A student can sell you a $120 Physics textbook and tell you that he spent $200, but in reality, there’s an $80 access code that you will need to buy later.

If you like PDFs, pirate your books. I probably can’t link sites here, but you can find them fairly easily. 

CLASSES:

Do your research. Is this going to be a hard class? Is this class going to have a high workload? How much extra credit will be given out in this class? Will your grades be mostly determined by homework or tests? Most of this you can find through the syllabus. You can also ask older students for advice on the classes. If you plan on dorming, this can be quite easy. If you take some STEM classes like Calculus, Physics, or Chemistry, you’ll find that plenty of students will have taken those classes you’ve taken already and can give you advice. 

Build a study habit. Even if it seems too easy to study for. Build your studying habit. You do not want to get into more difficult and complex classes with the same “oh this is easy, I don’t really need to study. I can go goof off!” attitude. And if you do reach those classes with that attitude, it is very hard to break. So start early, begin studying. Build your discipline.

One thing that people don’t typically take advantage of are office hours. Got a question? Go office hours or email the professor. One very important advice is to go to office hours if you’re majoring in the department that the professor is in. By going to office hours consistently, the professor gets to know who you are. Talk to them about their research. And if you’re in the same department, that is a massive bonus because if the professor likes you, you can use him/her as a reference or letter of recommendation to a program or job.

CAREER:

Building off of office hours, you should be looking at internships in the field you want to go to. Ask your professors if they know of any reputable internships around. If you share an amicable relationship with your professor, you can ask him/her to write a letter of recommendation or refer you to the program.

The internship will help you figure out if you actually want to continue in this field. I did an internship and realized that what I wanted wasn’t actually the complex and abstract but rather the practical applications. And so I changed my major from Physics to Computer Science.

Should you get into the internship, try to keep an amicable and competent relationship with your supervisor. Your supervisor will now serve to be an effective and very important reference in the future. Not only that, the people you meet will be apart of your network. You can ask these people for job opportunities in the future or as references to other jobs.

Apply to scholarships, as many as you can. Take the time to write essays that sell yourself (not literally) to the scholarship. You’re essentially taking an hour out of your day to apply to some scholarships that may or may not make you anywhere upward a few hundred dollars.

Figure out if you plan on going into a graduate program. Build your extracurricular classes to fit into those. Are you certain that you’ll get into this one program? Well fuck you because there’s no guarantee you’ll get into that one. Go apply to other programs and look at their requirements. The sooner you do, the more prepared you will be. Study for the exam you’ll need whether it be the MCAT or GRE or whatever. 

EDIT: Maybe I should have posted this closer to when school actually started. But I wanted to get rid of this asap :P"

I've been an intern at other places before, and I've never been afraid to ask questions, even the ones that are kinda basic. However, as a full time employee, (can't tell if this is just me being over analytical/nervous) , I'm more hesitant to ask every question. I've noticed that some of the questions I've asked, my coworkers/leads seem a little surprised that I'm asking them, and I worry that they are either obvious or perhaps irrelevant. 

Furthermore, today, I had my first task, and my lead was walking me through the steps, and I was slow with getting some of them. Eventually, I was left on my own, and I got super stuck while using Excel (I rarely used it intensively in college) and had some questions about what I was seeing in the data (again, kinda new), and when I asked my lead questions, he seemed to encourage me to kinda try it out for myself/ didn't give too many details.
So I refrained from asking anything else for the rest of the afternoon, and tried to troubleshoot on my own, but I wasn't making much headway. I felt so stupid for barely making any progress (on excel of all things!) even though I stayed for an extra hour trying. 

So here's my question: How do I know if I'm asking too many questions/dumb ones? How long should I try on my own before reaching out? I'm so used to being an intern and asking for help, and in the past I've been praised for it, but I don't want to cross the line as a full time hire.
On the flip side, does anyone have advice on how to ask for helpful in a way that's thoughtful?"

2. Is there anything I should change on my resume?
3. Is Full time much harder to recruit for since they already hire the interns?
4. Is there anything I can do right now or reach out to the recruiter to introduce myself?

Thanks so much for the help, I'm just having a really tough time distinguishing myself.

8zhprl,5,2018-07-16,Feeling stressed at my first job out of college - big responsibilities?,RemarkableTowel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8zhprl/feeling_stressed_at_my_first_job_out_of_college/,"I am a recent college graduate. I did finance at a top 25 public college with a great business school. I was a stand-out student, but I didn't have a single *great* internship, and I'm realistic enough to see that my degree itself doesn't mean much (it's not really a specialized, employable field like electrical engineering). I was really lucky to have found a job very close to graduation - I actually started a few weeks before my classes and exams all wrapped up. I am between 2 and 3 months in right now. 

My job's characteristics could basically be described as this:

-I have way more direct responsibilities than a typical new grad would. In fact, nobody I see at other companies is this young. This is a double edged sword because I am basically paid like a newbie, but doing slightly more challenging work. Honestly, they probably hired a new grad because $, and also someone doing this job for years and years is probably not that great

-It is genuinely a really good company, at a broad level. The people are mostly very nice, it is small enough where there is quite a bit of fairness and transparency, and it acts very honestly in the industry.

-The lifestyle isn't that great with the job. An industry vet at another company told me that 'you have to choose the money, or the lifestyle...you won't get the lifestyle there'. Basically, it is not the place to have Friday's off, or leave by 4PM on the dot, etc, but there is a ton of opportunity to establish yourself. 

With all of that being said, I feel *very* stressed out and anxious by my job. There are four main things that really irritate me: 

1) I have to be ridiculously responsible. In school, if I make a mistake it is just one missed grade. If I mess something up here, it can mean ***huge*** money, and nobody even really checks over my work. And remember, I will hear it if I screw up

2) My direct boss is intimidating, and nearly impossible to please. In some ways, they are actually quite decent, but I think they carry some personal issues. They can be in a mood when they are constantly questioning us, and we will hear 10x more ""you need to do this"" vs ""great job."" It's definitely not just me, the other employees do not like him at all. Seriously, a better boss would make me *much, much* happier. However, I can see enough to understand he has a very hard job to do, with limited resources. 

3) Being a junior employee feels kinda crummy. I have a ton of exposure to some very senior folks in the company - who carry huge names in the industry - and they are quite helpful and approachable. With all of that being said, I think being a junior employee here is worse in ways than at other places. At XYZ megacorp, there's a ton of junior employees with codified norms. Here, I feel like I have to work the hardest of everyone, and never say no. I'm working 9 hours with *basically* a 30 min lunch break.

4) The processes at a small company feel inefficient. A lot of stuff would probably be automated at a larger place, or have a lot more 'safety checks.' Seriously, I can't believe the negative impact I could do with just a few keystrokes. It also feels like my job description changes day by day. 

My mood really does change day by day. One day, I'll feel great about the entire company, and another I'll feel super stressed and anxious. I've honestly gone through all the new grad blues, including thoughts of quitting to become a cop or travel to New Zealand. This is not an easy situation to do well in. With all of that being said, getting an opportunity like this is pretty rare in life, and if I kill it for a year or two - and put up with some shit along the way - I can probably build a great career for myself. My other, older coworkers are way better at not taking the bosses' antics or criticism to heart. Can anybody share some advice, or even inspiration? Thank you "

I could be earning at least 100% more at work than I am right now. My highest paying software developer job was $50k a year with no benefits, from a small company in the Chicago area. 

I want to increase my value and I believe that my lackluster network and experience is keeping me from nailing the dream jobs. 

What is the program like for launching a career towards reputable west coast companies?

8zignj,5,2018-07-17,Distaste for web tech and a penchant for data plumbing. Where to go from here.......,ClittoryHinton,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8zignj/distaste_for_web_tech_and_a_penchant_for_data/,"Hey folks,

So in my previous software internships, I have felt unfulfilled. I was doing fullstack .NET development, and really found it boring having to worry about things like authentication, cloud hosting, deployment, CSS preprocessors, basically everything involved in deploying a quality web app that isn't programming itself. I totally respect the engineering expertise that goes into these aspects, but it's not for me.

My most recent internship has been doing basic data analysis and data plumbing for an NGO in Africa. This has involved gathering csv data from various international organisations for policy research, cleaning it to fit a standard format using Python pandas, creating our own database to house the data, and performing various queries/visualizations, again using Python in Jupyter notebooks.

I have actually really enjoyed working with the flow of data without ever having to touch a web framework. I enjoy working with databases, sql, visualisation libraries, and want to learn more about machine learning and statistics. I think what I like most about it is the exploratory and informal nature of the programming, versus the strict and regimented practices of backend development. I also like being able to facilitate meaningful discoveries through data, as opposed to the sometimes mind-numbing applications of the web apps I worked on earlier.

I am in my last year of a comp sci degree in Canada, and wish to stay in Canada. Can anyone recommend career paths, given my distaste for web technologies and liking for data technologies? Is it naive to think I can be involved in software development without dealing with deployment infrastructure? I have the means to attend a masters program. Would a masters in machine learning help me get a job like this? Can anyone comment on the availability of data science related positions in Canadian cities (particularly western Canada) vs backend/fullstack positions? 

Many thanks!"

I'm using a throwaway for this, but I used to be a very active member of this sub. A few people (including /u/admissionsmom) might recognize me, but I'm helping freshmen next year, and I would prefer it if none of them knew my story beforehand. Below, I copied a little essay thingamajig (albeit not that well written) that I gave my counselor at the end of the year detailing a little bit of my admissions story. I will tell you that I did not apply to any safety school, because I thought I was going to apply to McGill but right before the deadline it became apparent that my dad could not afford the applciation fee and we decided to wing it.

\*\*\*

As water ran down my arm from the plastic bag of melting ice, I looked up in genuine dismay. What sins had my father and I committed to deserve such evils? The little red bumps would only be cured by time and effort, and another would appear before the first healed. If I itched them even in the slightest, they would flower into bulbous, crimson, disgusting protrusions that reeked of physical destitution. Not only did they itch and force me take time out of my day, they humiliated me. I lived in a motel, a motel infested with bed bugs. What had my life come to? The room to the left of me was home to a deranged man who spoke of religious cabals and other absurdities, until he was taken away by a local mental institution. The room to the right of me was home to a man who was visited four times by the police, each time for violating his restraining order with his wife, with the fourth being the final—he was arrested. In front of the room, on the stairs, would be the same woman shooting up every other week with her little aluminum foil and look of sincere shame. All of this was nothing compared to those little insects from hell, who seemed immune to repellent, prayers, or the bug-killing powder that littered our carpet.

During my year there, the reminder that the bugs had humiliated my body was enough to make any day a bad one. I would pull up my sleeves to hide the bigger bites, I was not going to let anyone know, I was a middle-class, jovial kid to everyone else—not a depressed student who lived in a motel infested with bed bugs. I burnt, froze, dried, and acidified the lumps, but alas, they’d just come back earlier. I would wear t-shirts to sleep, to stop them from getting to my back, but they’d get to my arms, and then when I would wear longer sleeve shirts to stop that, the bites would appear on my neck and my jaw. What were we supposed to do?—we were broke and stuck there, we had no leverage, my father’s anger at management did nothing but anger *them*. His depression had worsened, his attempts to quell the infestation were less and less preventative as each day passed, and he would spend hours on end icing each individual bite.

What is rock bottom? It was senior year of high-school, I was told that I was meant for great things, I mean, my parents had told me from a young age that my “interesting” background was my ticket into the greatest academic institutions in the world; and, I had no reason not to believe them.

“*It is with regret that I write to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission.”*

Nine times, with a waitlist somewhere in the middle. No acceptances. It was the Canadian winter, the air was filled with cold, sadness, a stench of marijuana, and I couldn’t even pay for my bus pass. This appeared to me to be rock bottom—what was I supposed to do with my life? I was without destination, and my relationship with my father had deteriorated to make matters worse. The sound of him eating, the sound of his fork scraping against his bowl, the sound of him peeing in our one bathroom, the sound of his heavy-footed walk, the sound of his snore; it drove me insane. I was in the running for the most irritated person on earth. I sneered at my father, but it was *my choice* to come to Canada on a whim. My only break was the walk down to the pier, but that was not a walk of freedom or joy, it was of sad desperation.

It was a great day, the day I received that phone call, the answer to my prayers, the answer to my father’s prayers. I remember my father’s face lighting in joy and his head resting on my neck while he sobbed of profound pride. I remember my mother truly not believing me, I remember the excitement that was shot in the air of that little motel room, as light suddenly appeared at the end of the tunnel. The audacity of my hope was given validation.

A lot can be said for luck and happenstance but a mix of resilience, hope, and sacrifice goes a long way. I first sent a poem, then a photography portfolio, then an art portfolio, then another letter, and finally a resume. I’m not sure if each one mattered, but I choose to believe they did—they were the answer every time I wanted my chances to be better than the other 540 people on the waiting list, and however few were on the extended waitlist. They were the amalgamation of my hope and my refusal to give in. I could give countless reasons to why I was rejected to nine schools, but most importantly I could give reason to \_\_\_ taking me as the final member of the class off 2021.

\*\*\*

I got into what I'll admit was one of my top choices, a top ten school in the country. I had a 1370 SAT score, and a 3.9 UW GPA. I had what I would describe as a very unique upbringing and I've been lucky to have seen much of the world before attending college. The college I attend now has been absolutely fantastic (why I've decided to give back) and it even gave me money to intern over the summer in New York for an advocacy group. I gave thanks awhile back, but I thought I would reiterate that, along with some advice. Persevere, it is so \*so\* worth it. The day before my acceptance, I was planning on working as a deckhand in Alaska, because I had connections and needed money (I was not authorized to work in Canada). I was accepted to this school 3 days after their supposed extended waitlist deadline (the small waitlist after a class is already full), and I was the final person accepted. After being accepted, to pay for tuition and to illegally pay for rent that my father and I were behind on, I actually contacted my aunt and managed only to figure out I had a massive 529 plan (it had balooned while my dad and I were not paying attention). My Aunt sent me a ten thousand dollar cheque to pay for the plane, a new computer, tuition and dorm supplies, and to my surprise, a week before leaving for school--the bank informed me that it would take 15 business days to clear. So my dad gave me $140 of his $160 net worth and sent me on a ferry to Port Angeles, then I grabbed a bus to Seattle to get to an American bank to cash it (I had to call the bank to stay open, I arrived around five). With ten thousand dollars in my bag, I stayed at a hostel in the city with the bag around my arm. I left the next morning, paid my dad's rent and I'm now where I am. My senior year was filled with bedbugs, my mother in California breaking her arm without insurance (only to be fixed by a rancher on the farm she worked), girlfriend breakups (imagine not telling anyone where you lived, and being dropped off always around the corner), failed physics and calculus tests (I cried the day I aced my final exam in calculus, to go from a C to an A in the class and to have the teacher email my dad saying how proud he was of me), and good friends. This subreddit played a big part in saving me."
8zjchw,4,2018-07-17,Weird Monitor problem,PokeScar,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/8zjchw/weird_monitor_problem/,"I allready posted yesterday, but not many answers. I've bought a new Monitor for my newly built PC. While setting everything up I used a HDMI-Cable plugged into the Graphics Card, and it would run fine. Then I realised that my Monitor will only run 144 Hz with a DVI-Dual Link cable.

So i shut everything down, plugged in the DVI Dual Link cable, started booting and as soon as Windows was loading the Monitor would get a black screen. 

I tried the HDMI again and it would run well again. So this time I plugged the DVI Dual Link in to the motherboard to see if it would work with the CPU's intern Graphics Card and it did. So the cable is not malfunctioning. I have no Idea why it is not working.

My rig:

-Intel Core i5-8600K (LGA 1151, 3.60GHz, Unlocked)

-ASUS Cerberus GTX 1070 Ti A8G

-ASUS ROG STRIX Z370-F GAMING (LGA 1151, Intel Z370, ATX)

-ASUS DRW-24D5MT

-Fractal Define R5 Black (Midi Tower)

-Samsung 860 EVO Basic (500GB, 2.5"")

The Monitor I use is: ASUS VG248QE (24"", 1920x1080)

TL;DR:

-Monitor gets black screen when DVI-Dual Link cable is plugged into the graphics Card, but will work if said DVI-Dual Link cable is plugged into the motherboard.

-Monitor works fine with HDMI cable slotted in either The Graphics Card or the Motherboard.

8zkmoq,72,2018-07-17,TIFU by thinking an 'unreachable' error message was actually unreachable and giving my program access to every contact in the firm.,The_Mother_land,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/8zkmoq/tifu_by_thinking_an_unreachable_error_message_was/,"LTL FTP yada yada, onto the meat. 


So, this fuck up was a rare one that actually happened today. Bit of background, I'm undertaking my second internship at a large international engineering firm. Being still at school however this was my last week on the job before heading back to college. The firm is mostly focused on civil engineering however I work within an internal software development team. This gives me more permissions when it comes to internal tech and other systems compared to the average intern... something which will change soon I imagine. 

I am currently designing a chat bot type solution to work with HR and a few other departments to handle common questions. The chat bot needs to therefore accessible through as many channels as possible: Skype for Business, web portal, SharePoint, and worst of all, Email.

A few import details about how the bot works though… it essentially needs a private password to be entered in its settings by a developer, so it can access the company’s billing account and charge us as it uses server time to process questions and spit out answers. This should ALWAYS be entered while employees can access the bot, otherwise we’re being charged by the web service that handles collecting questions (which is always hooked into billing) to just collect these questions and return blank answers since it doesn’t have the service to process them active. 

Being a good code monkey, I still wrote the code to handle if there wasn’t a password entered in the settings, being what I thought was unreachable I set the error to print out as “No AuthKey Entered, how the shit did you even get here dude… screenshot what your question was and send it to The-mother-land”. This however would only be sent to a test console and never the actual chat window the employee using the service on skype or any kind of IM window see.

Now for the last week or so I’ve been busier than a one-armed bricklayer in Baghdad trying to sort out the bot working with email. I finally got it working today by letting it access and use my work email. What I didn’t realise however was that it was only replying to questions that were phrased a particular way, rather than every email I received. This was happening as the question processing that was done using the billing password was letting the bot recognised them as questions. Today for security reasons, since the key allows access to the company’s billing, I had to take this password out and move it into a separate file that would be much harder to maliciously access… you can probably see where this is going.

I took the password out and went on lunch. I came back about 30 mins later to find that the COMPANY WIDE email newsletter had been sent out and my program, being a good little bot, had tried to check if was a question but couldn’t access the billing code. So it spit out the error message which was promptly sent back over email on a reply all. Everyone who didn’t ignore its message to screenshot then screenshotted it and sent it back to me, as the error instructed, resulting in secondary waves of profanity laden emails being shipped out.

I have a meeting with my boss and bosses boss tomorrow to discuss repercussions for what’s happened. Hoping to try and claim the chat bot achieved sentience and framed me, short of that I have no clue what the fuck to do and may have rooted my prospects for a grad job.

EDIT: It actually wen't surprisingly well, my boss had my back and she explained the whole thing the higher up. I apologised and just had to do some e-learning around email etiquette in the office... probably has been one of my more influential learning experiences.


TL;DR – Set a stupidly vulgar error message and hooked my chat bot up to the company wide email. It started auto reply to companywide mailing lists asking them how the shit they got this message and instructions to screen shot the email and send it back, resulting in multiple waves of insults. Probably won't be getting a call up for a grad position

8zll5v,1,2018-07-17,"Company I work part time at offered me full time. Happy with the thought of full time, but disappointed with money. How do I counter offer?",matchoomooconahey,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8zll5v/company_i_work_part_time_at_offered_me_full_time/,"So I have been working part time at this engineering company for about 4 months and they offered me full time employment yesterday. I do this job 3 days ( 8 hour days) a week at $15 an hour. 

However, I have another job I do 2 days a week which gives me $20 an hour. I dislike this job and it has zero chance for any career development unlike the other place. 

The full time offer was the same $15 rate as I had during the first four months, where I was basically an intern, which I was kind of disappointed at. I had a performance review yesterday (where I was offered job) and they said I was doing pretty well, and was right around where I should be. They also gave me some goals to aim for, which seems like they expect more from me, but at the same pay rate.

Obviously if I take this job full time, I’ll be decreasing my overall income as I lose the other job. 

I’ve never had to make a counter offer before so I have no idea how to go about it, and it makes me anxious. I work in a satellite office with my boss (literally just sharing an office room with him) a couple of hours away from the main office (which is where his boss works, the guy who did my performance review, with my boss also in the room), so I’m a little uncomfortable about asking my boss in person next to me. Do I send an email to his boss with a counter offer? They also said if I have any questions that are ‘above their pay grade’ to email the CEO, who I have had a few interactions with. 

How do I go about sending a counter offer, because I have no clue how to word it/do it. I have friends in college who are on paid internships the same rate as me, and it seems as though the average for my job is about $18 an hour. 

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. "

At first, I was tasked with adding some small features to an existing web app, but it quickly became clear that my coworkers (full-time employees!) couldn't keep up with me, and soon I was the only person contributing code to the project at all. Soon after, I began working on the backend too, and now most of the code added to this project over the last month is mine. 

I've started delegating minor tasks -- mostly css things, but sometimes minor code changes -- to the full-time workers (and they let me take charge?) and what should take an hour or two ends up taking them days.

They do things like bool == true, they don't space their code properly, they don't understand tree searches (something absolutely imperative to our project), and they have CS degrees!

I'm not making this post JUST to rant, I also want some advice going forward. I think the silver lining of this job is that since I'm doing everything, I'll have a lot to put on my resume and talk about at interviews. 

My current strategy is to stick with this internship through to the end, but can I get any advice on how to make my current situation more comfortable? Would it be possible for me to ask for a raise, even as an intern? Any advice on how to talk about this in an interview/on a resume without sounding as arrogant as I do now?

It all started out last year when she joined, she had nothing to do all day as she was new and was constantly disturbing me while I was working. So I talked to her (I'm a naturally aggressive, type A person) and she didn't appreciate it. On top of that, my managers (who fully support me cause I'm a star performer) talked to her and told her to back off!
From that period, she started to hate me. I, on the other hand, didn't care and just focused on doing my job properly. 
We recently had 2 female interns joining us, Girl A and Girl B.
Last week, I gave Girl A some work but she left the office before 5 pm. So, the next day, I asked her why she didn't complete the work and left without informing. She was upset and went to cry in the toilets. But that's it, she wouldn't do anything more. Then, the bitch who hates me and her acolyte add fuel to the fire and brainwash her into thinking that she should report me to one manager cause I'm a bad person etc. She was already talking shit about me to Girl A - how I'm gonna show my true colours soon. 
So then, she calls a manager and explains the situation (in her own version) and tells the manager to have a talk with me cause I need to change my ways, etc.
The manager sits down with me, explains to me what happened and totally sides with me! She warns about how that bitch wants to ruin my reputation. I tell her I'm understand and I will be careful. Today, Girl A apologizes to me and tells me she stopped talking to the bitch who hates me cause she's fake and stuff.
To my knowledge, only the manager who talked to me is aware of the situation.

So, I was thinking of talking about it during our annual appraisal meeting (indirectly, just stating that some people are spreading gossip and causing instability in our team and we don't need the drama). 

I've been thinking about what happened a lot and I don't know what the bitch might do in the future to ruin my reputation.

What do you think, what is the best course of action for me?"

I'm entering my third year of school and this summer I've worked for a research lab at my school developing a mobile app with 5 other interns/PhD's. I see a lot of people that tend to get these amazing lolbig4 jobs with high gpas. I don't wanna just end up working at a medium sized humble tech company, (well not for a long time). I wanna intern or eventually make it at the big 4. My question is, is it worth it to take an extra year of school to try and increase my gpa and apply for more internships? 

The reason I'm making this post is I saw some kid from a good school who worked at Nasa as an intern in this fb group, I went to Nasa's website to sign up on their intern portal and it said you must have a gpa of 3.0 to even sign up.. Yes I know this isn't the case at most companies I just feel a high gpa makes everything a lot easier."

Well I definitely have one of those.

When I was a kid my dad was working for a major I.T. company, big firm... government contracts, state contracts... The real deal, so I was always working on computers with him and kinda picked up the skills naturally around the house.  I guess my parents were surprised I got into computers, they never realized I was that interested in it until I was in my early teens.

When I was 14 I was selected for one of the 1st ever Cisco Networking Academy, with was a new program Cisco was rolling out in schools.  Our program was perhaps the 1st on the East Coast, maybe in the world.

I had gotten an internship in high school, but after 6 months of feeling I was getting a bit under appreciated (look man I'm 16 why arent I getting $100k a year like that other guy ... haha)

I said ""hey I can do this"" mentality and decided I wanted my own business.  My grandfather was very successful in running his own companies in Bermuda, so I said why not ...

Fresh out of high school I started a I.T. consulting business and just from word of mouth it grew organically.  It was slow for sure, but I didnt have a ton of expenses so I survived.  Then into my mid 20's things started rocking.

I was all over the place, running full store upgrades, traveling up and down the East Coast, major contracts for an international manufacture, landed a few major deals for various Fortune 500 companies... 

But I was a smaller company.  Only a few employees, never had a huge staff and those smaller companies, law firms, real estate agents .... well they were great and I loved them, but they were taking up a lot of time and not paying *as well* as these bigger contracts.

So I had slowly been pawning them off to other companies, friends in the industry and focused on the bigger players.  I mean who doesnt want to work these huge Wall Street companies right?

Well I think it was mid 2009 and I had just finished signing a monster contract, literately the biggest of my life, to do a 20 warehouse full I.T. re-fresh.  This was the works.  Wireless, computers, servers, full fiber end to end, cat6 drops.  It was for me an enormous project.

But this was the same year as, you may have guessed, the economic crisis.  I had just spent half a million and done the 1st store, basically every penny I had saved up, on this project to get equipment prepped, pay people and contractors etc.

Well, the company called me and dropped a bomb... They were cancelling the project because of the crisis, it wasnt just my project, they killed a ton of other projects as well, not that I cared... I just poured my life savings into this project that if it was completed would have rocketed my company upwards.

I was devastated.  Worst yet, I had given away all my smaller business.  All the larger customers were all in the same boat.  We're not spending any money for this year at minimum.

I had made a huge mistake.  I had traded my safe and reliable (and loyal) customers for the bigger, shiner ones... and in doing so I not only almost went out of business, but I felt like I betrayed my principles by doing so.

In any case it was a great lesson.  I went back to doing smaller I.T. projects, but I also took my time to go back to school and got both my Paramedic and my Bachelors in Emergency Management.  I was still / always will be in I.T. but now wiser.  

I'm back in the business world again now full force, 10 years later I'm starting a telecommunications company in the Caribbean and also working on a Air Medical startup.

Lessons learned, a little wiser now... Just remember to never forget where you came from."

This is my second post for help, and I appreciate all the insight I receive from this sub. In case the background is boring feel free to go to the bottom for the direct question. I am a solo IT person for a relatively small city in the Midwest. They span across nine buildings, don't usually like to outsource any management, except printers (thank goodness), and have been working to expand their IT department since 2004. I have been there almost two years now as their first official full time IT person.  


We have actually made progress, approved this year for an IT specific budget, a remodel for an updated server room, and we even budgeted for another full time person (and a summer intern.) Then the committee came into play. It was time to begin the hiring process, when they had to reclassify and create positions. One committee member spoke up (not IT), ""We don't have a bunch of IT people where I work, we contract with other companies for that. Why can't we just do that instead of create a position that won't ever go away?"" I was not at this meeting, and did not get forward thinking representation so, it is now my turn to do a study of both cost and work to say which is better.  


I am leaning towards the full time person that I had budgeted because of my work load and the number of projects that they have added to my plate, Migration to Office 365 Email, implementation of two new ERP systems, rewire/configuration of the city network and networking infrastructure, while maintaining the 100+ PCs, servers, or the 10 fully outfitted police cars running on a daily basis. Thank you all in advance for your advice, someday I might grow up and be a true sysadmin myself.  


TL;DR: What are the pros and cons of hiring an IT employee vs contracting with a company for IT? What service(s) would you contract out vs an employee?"
8zo9m7,0,2018-07-17,The guy that I'm Interning causing problems,vipul115,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8zo9m7/the_guy_that_im_interning_causing_problems/,"So I'm a ML Intern at this small but very oromising startup. Basically, they hired 2 ML Interns to do some jobs but we have no supervision/mentorship. They just tell us what they want and we build it. It's been 2 weeks and I feel like I'm learning at an average speed. But the problem is with the guy I'm supposed to Intern with.

This guys has little to no knowledge about ML. Basically, all of his DS projects were copy pasted from multiple tutorials or github's of other people which is why I believe he got selected. In an environment where we're supposed to work on and learn completely new things, he is just isn't able to. He doesn't complete his work on time and constantly bugs me about even the simplest of errors, which is his job of solving. Half the time, I'm the one doing his job for him which is really hindering my focus and efficiency. The co-founders are, I believe, very impressed by our work, but the truth is that most of it is done by me. At the end of the day, he insists me to teach him whatever we've done which was fine initially, but now it's irritating because I'm the one busting my ass trying to learn things and he almost catches up everyday withiut even doing anything. I realize I'm coming out be a bit competitive but that's just how everyone is in the environment I've been brought up. Also, the co-founders don't notice it because they take reports directly from me. He is hardly involved in discussions and mums whenever we have a meeting. I do all the talking. 

I'm thinking of trying to talk to the co-founders whom I feel I have bonded well with to tell that what actually is happening behind the scenes. I could just forget about all this, I've tried. But it gets more and more annoying everyday. I really feel I and the company could do much much better with a better guy. Since, I'm still studying I'm a novice when it comes to handling such situations. What do you guys think I should do?"

Today we upgraded our old juniper firewall with new watchguards which supposedly went without a hitch until I arrived this morning and logged in to check backups; only to find my new ickle vmware cluster offline and critical. 

After clicking reconnect a few times, a few restarts later I then go to proceed to blame my work pals.

The cluster is hosted in suite2 which is across the corridor. With offices in London, it was confusing to understand why one of the nodes was communicating just fine and the other wasn't with the London vCenter cluster.

After yanking the uplink fibre from brocade1 and connecting it brocade2 and vice versa this made mrknox come online but downed cyrilsneer. 

(I work for an animation studio, so to keep staff happy we name servers based on 80's cartoons, workstations as musical composers and printers as Pokémon -.- to keep interns happy)

Still in confusion from replacing cables it wasn't until my colleague decided to check the network settings within vmware; and of course, the gateway for management was configured for a different vlan. 

Changed this and hey they both came back online. 

Ultimately I'm not sure or why it was set to .11.254 instead of .12.254 nor why it worked perfectly fine before the firewall change but hopefully the backup job will now pass. And ill come in tomorrow without any warnings... 

Oopsie my bad. If it wasn't for this hardware change I doubt I would of noticed and most likely encountered issues further down the line. Looks like I'm buying pints this week.

Also, anyone else using WatchGuard and how do you feel about them? We've got two more studios to kit out and prior it was all Brocade and Juniper.

We are now looking at extreme networks so we are looking into a 40Gbit backbone for starters with 10Gbit cards for most of the workstations. 

A workstation consists of 2x or 4x 1080Ti dependent on project and 64/128GB of ram. 
We are experimenting with AMD Threadrippers and 2017 &amp; older are using Intel i7

We are using around 600TB for output data which is nothing when compared to rendering in 4/8k which produces a near 80-100TB output data. A CGI waterfall can produce around 10-20tb+ of data rendered at 1080 for all the particles and calculated physics data."

Will a print server still benefit us?,mixolydiA97,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8zoqot/only_four_printers_in_an_office_with_minimal/,"I'm trying to preface all of my posts here by saying that I'm just an IT intern and I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing.

We have only four printers in the office. We don't have any need for printer pooling, at least at this office, since the printers are all over the place and people generally print to whatever is closest. Currently Mac users just use Bonjour and Windows users get the printer's IP from a wiki page. Printer usage seems minimal except for the legal and HR teams, which have their own team printer. 

I'm trying to find projects that would be helpful and one of my mentors suggested a print server a month ago. Since then, I don't recall any printer-related tickets coming in at all. It sort of feels like what I'm trying to do is over-engineering. The most printers that any of our offices have is about nine and the rest of the offices have much fewer. 

I put the print management role on one of the AD servers and print from my Mac via LPD. That wasn't too bad but it wasn't any easier from a user's perspective. I'd probably have to find a convenient way to set up the printers. In addition, people frequently move between offices so I want people to have printers available based on location. In order to get the legal and HR teams on board, we'd probably have to have release printing or something. 

Is going through this process worth it or is our setup currently fine?"

I’m a rising second year college student at a large university in the Bay.

I’m trying to decide whether I should graduate with my degree in CS in 3 years or stay for the extra fourth year and complete the Data Science major as well. 

I’m currently leaning towards just running with the CS major as I’m more interested in swe roles after graduation, but I’m wondering if the extra degree would make me more marketable to industry or if I should just graduate and get a job as fast as possible.

Also, does an earlier graduation date make me eligible for internships meant for juniors, or am I still considered a sophomore?

I’d appreciate it if anyone could give me some insight or pointers to help me make an educated decision."

So I'm kinda stuck on a decision. I have two offers for a year internship. My two biggest factors are position and location (big city is better). I'm currently offered a position in my hometown (not as big), but it's a developer position mostly working in C++ as I'm told and it's with a small company (both big pluses, no pun intended). The other is in Toronto Ontario (Canadian here) which is a big plus for me, but the position isn't as great (mostly simulink development apparently). It's with a large well known automotive company which is a minus and a plus.

So my question is, which one do you see as being more intriguing? Would Simulink really be an asset to me, as I've heard it's basically Matlab which doesn't sound too useful in terms of skillsets. I should probably also mention that I am a Computer Engineering student specializing in software that just completed fourth year (met all my requirements) but doing internship for experience then exchange. I should also note that this will be my first eng/cs position. What do you all think? Thanks!"

8zqm51,0,2018-07-17,Advice Suing A School For Aftermath of A Sexual Assault,[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8zqm51/advice_suing_a_school_for_aftermath_of_a_sexual/,"Throwaway account, all advice is greatly appreciated, due to the sensitive subject manner I would appreciate not having larger debates on the politics around this issue as I am a single individual seeking help in the aftermath of trauma. 

I started a graduate program at a large state school in August 2018 and was sexually assaulted in September. I reported this assault to the proper resources, however the aftermath of the school's response left me so emotionally burned that I was forced to leave the program and enter a partial hospitalization program (4 weeks) to deal with the effects of PTSD and suicidal ideation. I am currently doing better and continuing treatment/rebuilding my life, however I still have a hefty sum of loans to pay to this institution. I would like to try to send a demand letter in hoping they will settle with me, failing that I want to sue them to help have closure both financially and emotionally.

My main questions are is this a viable case, how to go about a demand letter/suing (are there pro-bono services I can access as money is a current issue), and do I need to return to the state to do so (I have moved home which is several states away)

Background:

\-I was unable to continue with school counseling due to a session limit and my therapist not being equipped to deal with trauma (I didn't have health insurance in this state so I waited over 8 weeks to see someone at a local women's shelter)

\-When contacted by a school advocate meant to help with sexual assault none of my professors responded to requests I had regarding accommodations

\-In my seeking an emotional support animal, my roommates were informed of my need without my knowledge (this caused me to have a panic attack) and when I reached out to housing to understand this situation mid panic attack I was hung up on by the secretary and not contacted back (I currently was working for Housing as an RA as well)

\-When Housing was informed that my animal needed to be hypoallergenic to meet a roommate's needs they never informed me, it wasn't until after I got my approval and animal that my roommate told me that they had told housing

\-Housing then continued to prioritize my roommate's need over mine. They didn't want to move so I was given an air filteration system, which was and invasively installed by maintenance causing me to have another panic attack 

\-After this I filed a complaint with the diversity equity and inclusion office who essentially told me that I needed to be more sensitive to my roommate's issues

\- During this time I had security called on me multiple times as well as Care Reports written about me. I had a mandatory internship at a department in the school that was able to access these reports and they greatly affected my perception as an employee of this department. Housing did not apologize for any of the distress they caused except a meeting the next semester after which they submitted another report on me.

This all happened the 1st semester I was there. At the beginning of the 2nd semester I was starting to burn out and decided to be able to finish I would need to scale back, I dropped a class and decided to ask my  internship supervisor about lessening my time with clients and instead doing project based work during my time there. They said they would reach out the my internship director and we would meet that Thursday. On Wednesday my internship director called me in and basically said I was no longer allowed to be in my internship and persuaded me to withdraw from the university. 

\-I would not be able to stay at full-time status without my internship/or stay on program track (internship 3x a week)

\-They did not offer me the option of medical leave, despite my decision to pursue hospitalization and I was instead forced to completely drop out of the program

\-I was then called by the dean of students to be informed I had missed the tuition refund date and would need to pay 1/2 tuition for this semester

\-I fought this through the Omnibuds office and was finally able to win something and did not have to pay for this 1/2 of the semester

(Through all of this I had managed to maintain a 3.9 GPA)

 I've been obsessed with statistics, machine learning, and programming (to an extent) throughout my undergrad career. I've always wanted to use these skills in a research setting, possibly building AI to contribute to cancer research. My science background is minimal so I was hoping to pick up on that in graduate school or in free time. But anyways, for only 3 years, I've been taking an overwhelming majority of stats, math, and CS courses (haven't had more than 1 non-math related course in a semester since my first semester of college. I've done an REU in genomics, worked in a ecology lab, and now I'm gearing up to work in a lab that does amazing stuff with AI and ML in cancer research. My goal has always been to attend a PhD program right after I graduate, so I threw in GRE prep as well. I should also mention that I kind of used my free time watching tutorials on machine learning, algorithms, data structures, statistics, and even some of the biology stuff on YouTube. But recently, more specifically midway during this summer after starting my internship (while still trying to handle the stuff mentioned above), something just snapped. 

I'm about two months away from needing to take the GRE and haven't studied in months or even registered. I feel excitement about my upcoming lab work, so much that I asked the PI to send me papers about the background material so I could read up on it over the summer. But every time I go to do anything related to my research, or learning more about stats and CS, I find myself just getting bored, or thinking of something else I want to read up on and abandon my task with little to no resistance. I've always had a sort of short attention span, but recently I feel like I can't stay super excited about anything related to my work at all for longer than 10-15 minutes. 

Should I be worried about this? I'm kind of panicking that I wasted the last four years of my life thinking I loved something that I really didn't? Like I still can't imagine myself being happy doing anything else, but recently not having the super strong work ethic and motivation I've always had has kind of scared me into thinking the passion I had won't ever return. Some of my close friends have suggested that I take a gap year before grad school, or at the minimum, just don't do any extra stuff for the rest of summer.

If any of you guys have been in a similar situation, I'd love to hear any advice or feedback! I'm actually super confused right now and don't know if I should keep pushing myself until I snap out of this funk.

Thanks!

**TLDR**: I feel like I've lost my passion for my research interests right before applying to graduate school. Some of my close friends don't think the passion is gone, but rather I'm burnt out and just need to take a break. Should I be worried about this happening so close to when I intended to apply to PhD programs? Is it normal to go through this kind of thing?"

Basically I've been working here for 2 months now and I love the company but I absolutely hate the retail environment. I originally applied to try to help me get an internship with the company later down the road but it  looks like the only people who advance within the company are either through the IT department, or the business side. Of course anything can happen, like a general manager sneaking in and asking why I work at the company and offer me an internship, but I don't know if there is enough likeliness for that to happen to make me to stick with it.

I thought this ""foot-in-the-door"" would work but I feel like it might not work with larger companies, especially if I'm trying to land an internship with them. I'm just worried I'm going to be wasting a lot of time trying to especially when the semester starts. Going into my junior year I feel like I should be focusing on other projects and tasks that'll put my programming skills to work and boost my resume that way.

Any thoughts? Does this seem to be a good method with an extremely large company? I'm worried I'm wasting my time but I'm hoping during my school's next career fair the company's recruiter will see this as something that sets me apart from other candidates. 

Again, I really love this company I'm just worried I'm wasting my time.

8zrtq3,3,2018-07-17,Having trouble with everything right now and I dont known what the problem is exactly.,DEADLYHIPPO4,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/8zrtq3/having_trouble_with_everything_right_now_and_i/,"Ok. So since fall of last year every single semester has been shit and I feel like I have not learned absolutely anything. I had to deal with a shit ton of stress during the spring semester involving guilt from religious deconversion(and no, im not an athiest) which I really dont want to get in to which really fucked me up during college up until the middle of this summer semester. I barely passed physics 2 with a C- and stats for computer science with another C-. I absolutely BOMBED the first 2/3 exams for stats and the last 3 exams for Physics. In the homeworks for these classes, I did well, but I felt like I constantly needed help and that I had A LOT of trouble concentrating in these classes. Plus, I had another class which required weekly homework on top of the physics class which did the same and I felt kind of lost. I kagged a C- in physics because I did AMAZING on the first exam and I kagged a C- in stats because I did well in the final.

After that I was burned out, but the stress didnt all go away. This summer semester I am taking only 2 courses(typical in my college for a summer semester, most students even take the entire summer off). One of them was an online course in computer organization which requires a lot of reading and the other, a course on logic for computer science on campus. The 2nd course didnt begin until the 2nd half of the summer semester(it is a 6 week course). Of course, the extra-academic stress got to me, but it was not nearly as bad as it was before, and later just diminished almost completely, but by that time, I was already fucked. I realized that just about anything can distract me. Even when I did not feel stressed, my mind randomly wandered off when trying to do the readings and it would take me hours to process the information that I read. Most of the time, it didnt click in brain.  I am already a slow learner, it takes me hours to learn even the simplest basics of anything in computing. And the frustrating part is that no matter how much I read the material(for the online course), I could never for the life of me answer a question without having to look up the answer and try to understand what to do. Sometimes I didnt even understand the answers and would take more hours trying to do that. Couple that with the fact that I can easily get distracted \*\*without even using youtube, facebook, or anything of that sort\*\*, and you could see why it can take me an entire day to just answer a few questions. The worst part is that I am not even working, but yet I just feel tired after all the stress I have had to deal with.

I am even starting to question as to whether I really want to study CS or not. I am supposed to graduate in about a year and a half, but I dont even have an internship under my belt and the only language that I know is Java. I dont feel very excited about the subject as much as I used to and all my classes these past semester have all felt like uninteresting chores. But other than CS, I dont really see how I could have any other job opportunity in anything else that I am interested in. Being Peruvian, I love cooking dishes from my country, and the peruvian cuisine has been considered to be the best out of all latin american cuisines, some of the best chefs in the world are peruvian so there are lots of job opportunities. But am I very afraid, generally speaking, of taking something that I like doing to a professional level. I fear that the stress will make me hate it.

Yet, at the same time, I still feel like I like somethings from CS. I feel like I should not have even taken summer courses. That instead, I should used that time to learn a new language, work, travel, and rebuild my social life. I am traveling to Peru to visit my relatives for the last 3 weeks of vacation that I have for summer, and I have been hanging it with two friends, but I could of done more.

If you really read all of this, thank you, it means a lot. The finals for my two courses are next friday and though I am doing way better in my second course(I also have attention problems when listening to him in class, but the coursework is much easier so I just read the powerpoints and later ask questions, its not like the other one where I need to look up the answers to most questions), I have no idea how the fuck I am going to study for both of these finals at the same time since there is way to many things to that I either forgot or didnt learn in my online course.

tldr: I dealt with a lot of stress these past two semesters due to a religious deconversion(No, I am not an athiest now) that really fucked me up these past few months, though it doesnt as much now. Keep getting distracted trying to concentrate on my two summer courses(I dont even work). I am starting to not like CS anymore and I question whether I should even continue in it. I feel like I shouldnt have taken any college course during the summer. If you want to know more details, you have to read the whole thing."

So far I've had two great internships in project engineering and manufacturing engineering, but am thinking I want to go into product development when I search for a full time job.  The only PD experience I have is with an automotive design team.

I got the opportunity to co-op with a company in product development/testing and validation engineering this fall.  This company is a good company, but I'm not super passionate about their product (which could change once I'm exposed to it) and I wouldn't immediately accept a full time offer with them if they gave one to me.  My graduation would be delayed by a semester into December  2019 instead of being in May 2019 if I took the co-op.

I'm really excited to take some of my Fall engineering elective courses, and be with all my best friends this last year before we all graduate, but sometimes I fear if my experience so far isn't enough to get me into a PD position right out of college.

What do you guys think?  Does taking the co-op to get that PD experience worth it in the long run to increase my likelihood of getting the job I want during college or am I still competitive in getting hired into product development without internship experience?"

8zuouy,5,2018-07-18,Need advice on asking for minimum wage,Buerrr,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/8zuouy/need_advice_on_asking_for_minimum_wage/,"I’m currently undertaking a voluntary internship in a small company, I moved over to Germany a few months back with a degree but no experience and saw this position as a good source of valuable experience. However, I’ve come to realise that this particular company doesn’t always exactly follow the law. Normally they provide accommodation for interns but I live with my GF so I get slightly more money.

For instance, I’m now over three months here and my understanding is that I am legally entitled to minimum wage (€8.84 right?). I’m currently earning less than 600 euro a month and since we are soon going to have start paying rent again, I need to earn more money. I’m actively looking for other jobs but for the moment I’m stuck here. I was informed by another intern that the company will often get you to sign two three-month contracts, one of which is for a subsidiary with a different name, this, therefore, nullifies your right to claim for minimum wage. However, in my case, they must have slipped up as they got me to sign two six-month contracts, both under the same name, the actual company I am working for.  

As far as I know, I have the full legal right to ask for more money but I’m afraid to do so. They are hiring another intern for my department and I believe they often do this close to the three-month mark of another intern, so in case they ask for more money, they simply let them go. My GF and I really need the money but she is afraid that they will let me go or at the very least not give me a good reference which will hurt me later on when applying to actual jobs.  Can anybody shed some light on my situation? What would you do? Thanks.

8zvl5v,7,2018-07-18,"How can I, a new employee, show initiative without stepping over boundaries?",lamercie,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8zvl5v/how_can_i_a_new_employee_show_initiative_without/,"I was an intern at the last organization I worked for, so I was given a lot of freedom to ask questions, contribute ideas, and oversee my own projects. My former boss and coworkers actually took my ideas into consideration (shooting them down when necessary), and had they offered a permanent position, I would have accepted in a heartbeat. 

But, alas! So I just started a new job a few weeks ago, and, among other issues I’m having, I don’t understand how to contribute in a productive way without upsetting the hierarchy and getting in the way of things. My last boss told me that one of my best qualities was that I took ownership on projects—which was extremely validating to hear, because from a different perspective “initiative” can look like “megalomania”—but at this new job, it seems like they only want me to stay in my lane. 

So unlike in my last job, there are no clear avenues to contribute ideas, expand my skill set, or even obtain immediate feedback on work I’ve done.

I’ve been working alongside another person who SEEMS to oversee me, but she isn’t technically my manager, and I don’t understand what level of authority she has over me. There have been a few occasions where I present ideas to her that she shoots down, but when I work on my own thing and present the project to the manager, she likes them. So like, there’s a weird power thing here, and while I want to do a good job, I DON’T want to undermine my coworker or hurt her feelings. (Maybe I trust my own ideas too much?)

I also haven’t been let in on various meetings that pertain to my project and I don’t understand why. Is it because I’m a new hire? I was always kept in the loop at my last job (which I think allowed me to do my job better), so this is very jarring for me. I have to ask my coworker to fill me in, and I can’t tell if that’s part of her role or if she’s just doing me a favor. 

Basically, I’m used to taking initiative on things, but I don’t know how to do that in this different company culture, and I’m feeling stifled/limited. It almost feels like I was demoted in terms of what I’m allowed to contribute to. (Except I have more money now ayyy)

8zw9v5,7,2018-07-18,Unprofessional to ask co-workers to be references?,2ndjobthrowaway951,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8zw9v5/unprofessional_to_ask_coworkers_to_be_references/,"Hey everybody,

I just received an offer from a mid-sized tech company that I'm really excited about and definitely going to accept! Only issue is they require 3 professional references which puts me in a bit of a bind. I'm currently in my first job and didn't have any internships in college, so I don't really have any references from places I've worked previously.

So to my question - Is it unprofessional to ask coworkers at my current company to serve as references? I have great relationships with everyone I've worked with and I'm confident that they would be very positive references, but it feels weird to ask for that from people at a company I'm leaving.

To provide a bit more background - I work at a consulting firm and have been on a number of different projects there (worked here for a little over 2 years). I was planning on asking a manager, tech architect, and developer I worked with on a previous project. Since I'm no longer working with them, I think they would be more willing to be a reference as my leaving wouldn't directly impact them and their work. Hopefully that make it a little less unprofessional/more palatable.

Anyways, I'd appreciate any advice about how to handle this/if anyone has been in a similar situation.

Thanks!"

I've been working in IT for going on 5 years now. I started college in 2014 and got a job right away with a help desk position in AV stuff. I did that for 4 years working full time during summer and breaks. I have been doing a lot of development in my classes and did some work for a couple companies with prototype projects. I got a job a few months ago as an Intern at my current company.

Things are going great, I'm doing good work for the company. I do everything from Development, Help Desk Technician, and some Networking. They even bring me in on meetings with the CIO to get my input on Cloud Migration and File Structure. Like I said, I've been doing good work for this company.

School starts back up this fall soon. They have me working for $15.00 and hour which is pretty good around here. My position is Information Systems Intern, and I work full time. They said that they are willing to work around my schedule for the fall. I plan on starting my masters in the spring and I think they will work around that too.

Should I asked to be moved from an intern to another position name? What will help me land future job offers? Is it too early to ask for a raise in the company? Perhaps I should be asking for a review of the work that I have done this summer? Maybe I am missing something. What do you think I should do? "

I'm in Ohio. 

I was hired by a small company (Two owners and I'm the only employee) in February of this year. Shortly after I was hired, I was informed of illegal activity happening to fund the business. I shrugged it off because I needed the job, and I loved working there. I've always been kept separated from the illegal stuff (happy ending massages).

I've been told weekly how well I am at my job, and how I'm extremely hard to replace. At the end of May, I asked for my 90 day pay raise. I was informed that my 90 days was not up until the end of June because she wasn't counting weekends and time I took off for vacation (this conversation happened over text messages that I still have). I was a little skeptical about this. At the end of June I was informed that id be getting my pay raise starting on July 2nd.

For the past week, I've felt as if the illegal business has been getting a little risky. We have had ""walk in"" appointments with them being verbal about what they wanted. I have an intern that has no idea what happens behind closed doors. Yesterday (7/16) was a little pushing it with one of my bosses. I felt very uncomfortable the whole day. I slacked (messaging platform) my other boss about the issues while she was out of the office. I was told that the issues would have been kept confidential. I arrived at work today and was brought into the office to have a conversation about what happened. The whole issue was not kept confidential and everything was out. When I tried to explain why I felt the way I did, I was told I was being to touchy about the subject. Long story short, I was told if I couldn't clarify why I felt the way I did, I needed to leave for the day and I wouldn't be welcomed back until I could clarify it. I was also informed that I would no longer be receiving my pay raise due to not working as hard as I use to.

I'm a little confused on what to do. Any advice? Thanks in advance.

Is there anything I can do to protect myself from backlash when I leave? Could I get in trouble for knowing about the illegal aspect of the business and not reporting it?

I still have all of my messages from slack and text messages to back myself up on. I just don't  want bad references or anything.

In the fall I plan to start my first internship, most likely long term (at least 1 year). In terms of CS experience, I’m pretty new. I’ve only taken 3 CS classes so far: introduction, data and structures, and assembly. I’m pretty confident with C++, HTML, and CSS and have a little experience with JS. 

I applied for both internships at the same time, and was called back for interviews within a couple weeks of each other. 

The first internship is a government job, working for my city’s airport. From what I’ve heard, the job tasks are pretty broad - write reports for projects, help manage the website and app, and manage visual displays around the airport. I think the main language I’ll be using is jQuery. The salary there is $15/hr, 20 hours a week.  From what I know, all of the workers there are men, and that makes me slightly uncomfortable. Overall, this job is very professional, more than I expected for my first internship. I also have never communicated with my supervisor, only other higherups during a panel interview. I am most of the way through with the hiring process, but I am having doubts about whether I should keep this internship. 

The second internship is more relaxed. It’s an office job for a company that just opened up a branch in Vegas. My friend currently interns there, and they write scripts to test their website in JS. I’m sure there’s more to this job, but it seems less broad than the government job. The environment there is pretty casual and a big plus is that there’s multiple girls working there as interns and developers. This is really important to me, as I’ve always been uncomfortable with the lack of girls in CS. The salary here is $17/hr, 20 hours per week. I’ve already communicated with their boss multiple times and will be meeting with him this Friday.

I don’t know which internship to pick and if there is a right choice. The first internship seems like a good choice because I’ll have benefits and because it seems to be more varied in terms of what I’ll be learning at that internship. Honestly, I’m really attracted to the second internship because I know I’ll be in a comfortable environment with other girls, and the pay is higher. However, I don’t know if I’ll be learning more at the second internship compared to the first. I feel like it defeats the point too, because I feel like internships are meant for you to get experience and learn. 

I’m not sure if I’m even looking for a right answer here, but I’d appreciate any guidance or thoughts anyone would have to give. 

TLDR; two internships: 1) government work where I’ll be learning a lot, but I’m in an environment that makes me uncomfortable, and pays slightly less and 2) office job where the environment is very relaxed, it seems like the work will be easy to learn/get used to but not a lot to learn, and the pay is slightly higher"

My interview with Revature is the first thing that's gone right, but now that the offer is being prepped I'm rather conflicted.

On the one hand I've heard good things about the experience you get and how helpful it is in finding jobs.

On the other....I have three big problems with the idea

1. I'm not sure(due to the fact that I'm waiting for an answer from the recruiter) but it seems like the only option is currently Virginia, on the complete other side of the country from where I live

2. The two year contract, which I've constantly seen brought up in reviews

3.  I've heard amazing stories about Revature and horror stories as well.


So I guess the questions I'd like to put out is...to those who've done it, what is it like and is it worth it? What exactly is the structure like? What'll be expected of me?

Would some other Entry Level company be better? Any recommendations?"

That's right everybody, I've always been the guy who talks to everyone in the group, the one who likes a good chat (and have learned how to actually learn useful stuff from these chats).

So I thought to myself, why am I in this new stage of my life not sharing daily problems related to CS, Unique University experiences that only happen on universities, something I found online that could be helpful someway or another...

If you like CS you probably already know that we learn a lot with each other every single day (stack overflow is the proof of that right) so, if you already know and also like that, I know your gonna love this idea as much as I do.

A little education background: I recently completed my Associates in Information Systems at a community college and am now transferring to my state's major university to complete my Bachelors in IT. 

Ideally, I would like to graduate from university and take on a System Administrator role. Recently, I just started working as a tech. assistant at a public school district under the IT Coordinator/SysAdmin along with one other coworker, ultimately making the IT Department composed of just us 3. So far it has been a great experience and I am able to learn a lot whether it be responding to tickets, server/network maintenance, or learning new admin. software &amp; techniques. I feel as if my responsibilities over time will surpass that of a traditional help desk position and my boss has encouraged me to pursue some certifications as he mentioned he had once started in our ""shoes"" and that may be the next best step.

My question for everyone is, what are the next best step(s) to take to ensure I am prepared to obtain a position as a Junior SysAdmin or SysAdmin upon graduation in two years? 

Questions that have come to mind are:

\-Will futures employers be looking for a more versatile resume with more than one tech. position listed (e.g. multiple internships) or would they rather see time &amp; growth within one company (or in this case, school)?

\-Is Educational IT a good career route in comparison to private sector work (in terms of pay, benefits, etc.)?

\-Should I be applying to new opportunities for next summer, or stay around until I am ready to apply for a full-time SysAdmin position as graduation nears?

\-What certifications would be most ideal? Is A+ even valuable at this point?

Any advice or guidance would be very much appreciated, thanks!"

Hello Reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

For the sake of this post you can call me Icarus as this is a throwaway account.  I am a 27 year old white male and former Military Police Office (Honorable Discharge).  I am also a graduate from The University of California, Davis with a B.S. in Economics.  I graduated from UC Davis in June of last year and currently live in Silicon Valley.  While going to Davis I interned with Morgan Stanley in Global Wealth Management and was a top performer.  While interning with Morgan Stanley the Senior VP running the program held a stock trading competition which I won with an ROI of 30% over 3 months.  Unfortunately, the Morgan Stanley branch I interned with was unable to give me or anyone else for that matter a job because they had no openings.  I have been through several final round interviews with other branches, but never offered a job.  Since my graduation I have been on a constant pursuit to obtain a job as a Financial Analyst or something close to it somewhere in the Bay Area, and as reason suggests, I am still looking.  I have had my resume professionally done as well as repeated help with my cover letter and have been in contact with every employment agency in the area…I I have applied to over 800 positions in this last year and despite dozens of in person interviews, I have never been offered a job.  

&amp;nbsp;

To give you a little context, I am a first generation college student.  My dad did 26 years in the military and currently is a mechanic.   This all means I have ZERO connections to the white collar world.  I was okay with this though, I consider myself to be pretty head strong and always put my strong foot forward.  However,  2 months ago my quest for employment finally broke me and my well being has taken a turn for the worse.  2 months ago, after a final round interview, I was rejected again.  Receiving that rejection call broke me, I had and have no more will power.  The job hunt is ruining my relationship with my girlfriend and my mental state is out the window.  Hours feel like days and days feel like weeks.  I wake up at 7:30am every morning and am at my computer working by 8:30am.  I don’t stop doing applications until 10pm at which point I get into bed and stare at the ceiling until I fall asleep sometime around 3am or 4 am usually.  

&amp;nbsp;

Despite having military experience, an AA in Business Administration, a B.S. in Economics from a UC,  2 Morgan Stanley Internships, and several jobs in security, I rarely get an email with interest.  I realize it sounds super dramatic, but this year long pursuit of struggling has resulted in me losing interest in doing anything.   I don’t go out anymore because the few friends I have here are all half a decade into their careers at least and I can’t face.  Even if I *do* want to go out, I can’t because I can’t afford it.  I feel my girlfriend emotionally separating because of all this and I can’t really blame her.  A void has encompassed me and have no more willpower to fight it.  I am numb and past the point of desperation long ago. I don’t know what to do anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not ignorant to the fact that I am not special in this situation.  I realize that lots of people have dealt with this, and that is why I am writing this post.  To ask how did you survive and if you can give me advice.  Lastly, I want to apologize for any spelling and or grammatical errors, I am extremely sleep deprived and can barely keep my eyes open.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for taking the time to read my post.

I'm an international student in the US who changed my major to IT in my Master's. This year is my second year. I would like to land a career in Software Development, and I'm currently looking for an SDE intern.

But now I'm unsure what to learn next. Should I dig deeper into algorithms (LeetCode, CtCI...) or should I learn more about Java (Java Web, Apache...), or should I learn more about Struts/Spring/Hibernate? Front-end, back-end, or full stack? 

I know the universal answer: It depends on your interest. But now my only objective is to find some internship, so anything that helps me to achieve that works.

Ever since my first role working for a bank and in fairly frequent contact with FAs, I've been interested in finance. I'll keep things short and sweet from here, but I was hoping to get some input from professionals in the field to see the feasibility of my goals.

--

**Current Situation:**

- BS with double concentration in CS and Networking, Math minor

- 10 years enterprise SysAdmin/Networking/Dev experience

- 29 years old (not sure how relevant, but from what I see starting in finance is a younger game)

**Goal:**

- Returning to school for a Masters

- Finance career in:

  - Commercial Banking

  - Investment Banking

  - Financial Analyst

  - Any other roles along those lines

**Questions:**

- The first step for me is figuring out grad school. I'm mainly wondering whether it would be better for me to pursue a MS in Finance, or go for an MBA - either continuing along my degree path or making a full pivot - is an MSF looked at less favorably when applying for finance careers?

- Are these careers viable for someone of my age? An internship wouldn't be out of the question for me if required - funds aren't an issue and I'm used to strenuous hours from my current position.

- Any general advice or suggestions for things you wish you'd known early on?

I'm not worried about GRE scores, but would be aiming for specific target schools and would reconsider my plan based on whether or not I got accepted to them. I'm an extremely driven person and wouldn't be worried about my ability to catch up or keep up with the workload and material, and I'm fairly math-oriented.

Now I'm next of kin?",legalnextofkin,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/905l5l/sacramento_ca_biological_father_died_never_knew/,"Thank you for taking the time to read this. The long and short of it is that my biological father, who I never knew and who was never married to my mother, passed away suddenly yesterday in Sacramento. He lived with his mother, who I also never knew. My bio dad and his family have never expressed any interest in knowing me or being involved in my life. The family, bio dad included, struggled with substance abuse their entire lives. I was contacted by my cousin, who has been the only person to continually talk to me from that family. After a few calls around and some struggles emotionally, I received a call from the coroner regarding bio dad's passing. I am legally next of kin, but I don't know anything about the man or his family. I want to do what's right by them (they are grieving heavily, as his passing was sudden), but I don't want to compromise myself legally.

For more detailed context, I do not know much about his family or himself, have only been in a room with him when I was a newborn, and I only reached out online a year or so ago and never got contact back from him or his mother, only my cousin and my half-sister. Half-sister lives in Texas. I have a much older half-brother who has been incarcerated several times and currently cannot be located, according to the coroner. The coroner explained I would receive a packet soon (by mail? Hand delivery? no idea). I immediately told my cousin I would not do anything without consulting the family first.

However my concern lies with the family's history of substance abuse, a substantial amount of back child support owed to me and half-sister, and a fear of manipulation or other type of guilt. I absolutely want to do what is right for the family and I am grateful this awful situation has brought me closer to my cousin and half-sister, but I am very worried about being taken advantage of somehow, signing things I don't understand, or making a mistake. 

Can I turn over my place as legal next of kin to someone else, who is better equipped to handle this? Or do I have an obligation to see this through? I am the youngest child in my mother's family and the middle in bio dad's, so I never prepared for this kind of situation.

I do not have money (unpaid student intern) but I have been told by my cousin and half-sister that bio dad's family is 'intimidated' by my college education and that they believe I am somehow well-off. How can I protect myself from being financially manipulated into providing for a funeral or other costs? I feel I am justly concerned as bio dad's family has a history of issues with money and drugs, and I don't want to put myself in a compromising situation. Thank you for reading."

I'm studying CS in UK. Just finished my second year and will probably graduate next year.

I haven't had an internship yet. Because I didn't apply early, I only got offers for summer internships now (in Germany).

# Comparison

|**SAP**|**Web Dev Agency**|
|:-|:-|
|Large Enterprise|Small team \~ 25 people|
|I could only start in 4 weeks (because of HR)|I could start next week|
|Work until the end of September -&gt; so only 6 weeks|Work until the end of September -&gt; 9 weeks|
||I could possibly work for them **remotely** when the next school year starts|
|Pay: both seem to be really low, but SAP pays 25% less than the agency||
|Smaller projects aimed at interns|I would actually be part of the team and work on real projects. Modern company|
||Visited their office and really liked the atmosphere and the people|
|Well known name|No one would know|

# My thoughts

I would like to work in the UK or US after I graduate.

I don't know which one to choose. If I could start working for SAP next week I would probably take that offer (Is there a way I could start ASAP?). Because it's a big name and probably would open more doors in the future (is this true?). And also SAP has offices in the USA, so I would have better chances to get a job there (true?). 

With the agency, I feel like I would have a better experience and would learn more. But I don't know if it would look better on my resume.

I think the two main decision factors are: big name and duration of internship.

I'm looking for new jobs now, is there anything else i should be doing? My wife is pregnant and we are expecting in the next month. If I'm let go before then, can i claim unemployment?

This is pretty long, sorry.

I finished 3.5 years of a physics degree and most of a computer science degree, but decided to take a break instead of finishing (for financial reasons) and take a job programming. I got hired based on my experience doing machine learning research and machine learning at previous internships.

The company i got hired at is a local consulting company and i got hired to work on an in house project and to do any machine learning or back end stuff that came my way. I had experience with python, C++, Fortran, Matlab, Mathematica, and some light SQL experience.

I told my boss, who started the company, that i really wanted mentorship as my previous work experiences had been really poor in these areas (my internship was a mess where i was the only programmer). 

I was put on a project writing unit tests in java the first day with no sort of introduction to the programming environment, but with an overview of what the app was doing from a high level. 

The 2nd week i was there i was given an off site assignment where i was the solo developer building an app for a company that involved some pretty intense math (which was fun) and had to integrate inside of a java app using a developer exposed jython console (which was terrible). This project didn't go well at all, i had no access to the data inside the app except for communicating with one of the developers of the app and getting him to expose some functions to pull data from their encrypted database. I missed the project deadline by a decent margin and really struggled with handling the data in a good way because 

1. i was inexperienced with integrating with customer data, and 
2. writing code to work in someone else's app through a console shouldn't have ever been allowed imo.

After this project missed the deadline I was pretty much removed from any back end work and was throw into a react app. I had never done react or any type of front end work so i was very slow to get up and working. After a while i managed to start making some solid contributions and i felt the project went well.

After that project i was immediately tasked with taking over another react app, but i would be the only developer and the app was about 60% developed. I had to manage the react front end, and the node and postgres back end. I really struggled with my jira tasks and quickly fell behind.

My boss pulled me into the his office last week and told me that if i wasn't capable of learning new things, that i wasn't a good fit for the company. He told me that i need to love programming and be wanting to learn outside of work as much as possible. I did point out to my boss that i never claimed to be a front end or full stack developer, and that we had a python project I'd be a great fit for, but my boss told me that because i didn't make deadlines on the past project i wasn't trustworthy enough to work on the python project. He asked me if i would like help finding another job.

I've been working extra at nights and even came into the office last weekend (by his request), but it feels like as soon as the project is over i'll be let go. I have some good leads on new jobs so im trying to balance pursuing them while not dropping too far behind on my work projects.

Is any of this normal? My internship, and now this job have both been very unfortunate experiences for me, but I'm starting to wonder if the problem is just me?

I'd love some insight on what I should be working on to make sure i don't get in another situation like this again.

The worst part is my wife and i are expecting and will have the baby some time next month. If i get let go before i can secure another job can i get unemployment or something to help us out? I've been told that if i get fired for poor performance, which would be the most likely reason, then i can't receive it."

I've spent three semesters at the school (I transferred there from a CC) and I feel like I've wasted my time taking a lot of dumb general education classes when I should have been starting my upper level Computer Science classes. 

At this point I'm 22 years old and it looks like I'll need to go to school for another 3 semesters in order to graduate. I kind of hate school at this point though. I'm thinking of just dropping out of school entirely to try and get a software engineering job. Would it be significantly more difficult to get a software development job without a degree?

I've had two internships, one in QA testing and the other as a research assistant, but I haven't had a software engineering internship. I also have a Github account with a few small projects, nothing amazing. 

My worst fear is dropping out of school and then not being able to find a job."

The thing is, due to my relatively recent revelation, I haven't really been focussing much on the requirements that I'd need to get into a good grad school. 

I'm currently studying computational mathematics / financial engineering at a pretty reputable university. My school does 16 months co-op after third year which can be split any way you want. I'm doing a 12 month swe internship in SF, and I had initially planned to do another 4 month internship, but I think I'll try to do summer research instead. 

Some other things - I have a 3.9 gpa, summer after first year I did r&amp;d at a startup, summer after second year I got a governmental research grant for computer vision (was fairly applied and didn't publish though). I'll do GREs this year sometime, and I should have good recs. I have a few personal projects, some are just fullstack webdev, some are more stats related

My dream school would be like Stanford ICME which would be a huge reach. I'm just worried since I have no published papers and everyone else (from what I read here + gradcafe) seems to be first author on at least one paper. 

What are some ways I can improve my chances for grad school? I don't have a lot of time but I am willing to put in effort.

909ymr,2,2018-07-19,"It might be too late, but I need advice on student loans and animation school",NecroCannon,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/909ymr/it_might_be_too_late_but_i_need_advice_on_student/,"So I plan on becoming an animator and hopefully making my own animated series. However the paths I should take are... a little confusing.

To start explaining, I’m currently about to start my 12th grade year, and every since the 2nd-3rd grade I’ve had extreme aspirations to be a great artist growing up. Art is something that’s basically become... Me, there’s no me without drawing, I’ve always found it fun to learn new techniques and new styles and now, I’m committed to wanting to be a professional artist. I just don’t know what to do in that regard.

One thing I was thinking of doing was taking part of this internship program for an engineering company near me, the high school sends the students out to it first period and after high school you pretty much have a job there and with having a job there I could pay for an online college for art and go to the community college for the college courses I need and get my degree that way and then when it’s absolutely certain I can live off of being an artist I’ll leave the company.

As straight-lined as that is... there’s one problem however

When starting out as an artist I believe it’s best to go to an art school simply for the fact that there’s people there. Future directors, song writers, and other animators would more than likely be there too. Just think about it, if you needed art or an animation, wouldn’t you call that pretty good art guy you knew in college over someone  random online? That alone makes up for the higher cost, but cost is the problem.

My dad wants me to go into the Navy, I know that the conversation that I have to tell him I don’t want to do it is gonna come soon, but that means that I’m probably not really going to have financial support from him. And if I really choose to go to an art school, I more than likely will still have to get student loans. And the cost of living here is pretty low so the $20 an hour I’d earn from the engineering job is more than enough for rent and other necessities if I move out.

I just don’t know what to do in this part, I know the goals, I see the paths, I just don’t know how to walk down one yet... please help"

Anyway, I took a position that was sold to me as being very technical and loads of opportunity for programming but it ended up not being that way. Since I was only there for less than six months, my job basically consisted of very specialized trouble shooting and essentially changing variables in config files from True to False and vice versa and then running the programs and marking the output and results in a wiki. Now that it's ended, I'm having a really tough time finding a new position because I don't have practical professional experience in certain things and the company didn't use a lot of mainstream things like AWS. I've done a lot of personal projects, research, and learning outside of my internship so not get stale but a lot of recruiters I speak to give me the impression that unless I got paid to do it my experience is not valid. I'm really at a loss and feel like I'm on a hamster wheel because I'm pretty much just grinding leetcode and sending resumes into the black hole.

I’m a rising junior at a top CS school and I’m looking to get an internship for the fall semester or sometime soon. This would be my first real internship (first one didn’t actually finish) so I guess I’d be relying on personal projects. But I don’t have very many and I’m not sure how good they are. 

I have:

-An implementation of a stack, which I wrote, that checks for balanced braces if you input a program. Written with a header file, implementation file, and then the simple program. 
- A one file Java program that stores information in a file and allows users to search through the information. 
- FizzBuzz and anagram detector written in python. 

Is that good enough to get some sort of an internship? I have good grades too.
Thanks.

It feels miserable, but I don't know how to get out of this loop and stop feeling sorry for myself. 

I just want to have my own life and live on my own again, have friends, and go to a good school again. But, I do not have the money for rent if I want to keep going to school and I can't transfer back because my credits won't transfer. I feel like I ruined my life and there is no way back from this.

My only hope is to suck up these 2 years + 1 gap year and get into med school as my major is unemployable.

90bb04,1,2018-07-19,Should I keep supporting my mother?,peparooni79,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/90bb04/should_i_keep_supporting_my_mother/,"TL;DR : My mom is mentally ill. She gets little medical support and struggles to cope. I financially support her, but I'm a student moving away in a month and I can only keep this up for so long. Am I enabling her, or should I keep helping?

Tldr above because this might get long. Questions are at the bottom.

So, I live with my mother and grandfather. Grandpa gets Social Security checks and while money is tight, he gets by. I've paid him rent in advance to last until I leave next month, $500/month. I just didn't want to have to think about it anymore so 4 months ago I wrote him a check for $2500, and of course I was paying him monthly beforehand.

Dad died 6 years ago and my mother has spent every last dime he left her. If not for my Grandpa, we'd be homeless.

My story is, I'm a 20 year old student transferring to a college 500 miles away from home. I chose to do so instead of staying here because I was afraid of getting stuck here (I very nearly dropped out and took a low-wage full time landscaping job, friend of mine smacked some sense into me). Even going to University here, that pull from financial and familial desperation would always exist. Had to get away. My plan right now is to graduate in 2 years with a BS in Ecology, with the intention of going to grad school, internships, working my way up, the whole shebang. Well, not just intention, it's what I'm going to do, come Hell or High Water. I'm the usual story of being from a working-class family and 1st to go to college, so this is a huge dream for me.

Enter my mother. She's 45 years old. She has congestive heart failure (which doctors blame on the fact that she was a meth addict before she got pregnant and married my dad), is currently a pain pill addict, has had at least 2 strokes and possibly more, and has just terrible mental health. History of being abused in every way, trauma, and the general depression/anxiety that's common in both sides of the family and I myself inherited. Her MediCal gives her 1 psychiatrist visit a month to get her prescription refilled and only 1 therapist visit a month aswell. Doesn't seem to have been effective, nor like she really wants the help. She also hasn't worked for ~9 years that I can remember, possibly longer. She has no degrees or certifications, although she was a Certified Nurse's Assistant for a time. My dad did put her through LVN school, but even though she graduated she failed every attempt at the NCLEX (big nursing exam you gotta pass) and gave up. That was back when he was still alive, so at least 6 years ago. She's been job searching, but she's been struggling. To be honest, she's botched every interview she's gotten. She has horrible soft skills, can be quite condescending, and has one Hell of a victim complex. She also had that antiquated mentality of go down, shake hands, demand a job and you're in. And if not, you shouldn't have to send out more than 20 applications to get in somewhere. 50 tops. So yeah, she didn't go into her search knowing what the market is really like either. She gets ~$130/month in food assistance, and was denied gov't Disability benefits which she's appealing but I don't really see her getting.

Now, money. As I type this, I have about $33,500 in the bank. That money has come from working over the years, a little luck with Bitcoin, and a legal settlement related to my father's death. ($25k up front, $11260/year until I turn 26. Started when I was 19). I've always tried to be somewhat careful, but admittedly splurged here and there and spent some on travel. Silly me thought Mom would have her crap together and not run herself broke. I give her $1k/month (about the same as my paycheck) for the cell phones, car insurance, groceries, gas in the car, and her medicine that our shitty MediCal refuses to pay for despite her cardiologist demanding that she needs it to survive/rant. I did apply for financial aid, got a good amount in grants with a gap of ~$10500 for this year, which the annuity payment covers perfectly. Awesome. Now, I might not get as much next year because I made about $34K compared to last year's $13k (Thx to Bitcoin). I know I can pay for my last 2 years of college out of pocket, and I've read all about how to get Grad School paid for. And lucky for Grandpa, they won't have to worry about feeding me or paying for the utilities I use up once I'm gone. I just don't know what to do about the drain on my finances that is my mother. I guess I'm gonna stop right here and get to the point because I know I'm awfully long winded.

Do I cut her off completely? Reduce the amount after I leave and let her slowly go into more and more debt? F$%^ what if she kills herself (she's tried before and often talks about how low she gets)? Or keep giving her money until I have nothing left and I lose the entire head start that not only I've worked so hard for but that my father died for?"

I'm a third year Automation Engineering Student at a school in Ontario, Canada that requires internships in order to graduate. 

Due to the nature of the city I live in, the automation / industrial industry isn't too big here and I would have to move to cities a little furthur away for an opportunity interning in a ""degree-specific field"". 

However, due to the broader nature of the degree, the school is fine with us finding internships outside the degree in different fields. I have always had an interest in computers and things of the sort, and I would be studying IT instead of automation if a school near me would have offered it,  but anyway, I thought this would be a good opportunity to try and find an IT internship. 

What would be the best way to try and get myself noticed out of the many student applicants out there? I know simply knowing about computers isn't enough, everyone and their parents knows how to configure hardware /operating systems, etc. these days. 

I've been looking into certifications, like the A+ and CCNA, would it be worth spending the time and money doing the certifications for student internship positions? Are these recognized worldwide? Are there companies / institutions that are especially recognized in the field?

I am still continuing it throughout the rest of summer. What I did there was do meetings with a professor and a PHD student who gave me assignments and I added code to a robot and added some improvements to its functionality. CMU is a school I would really like to attend because of how good it is for computer science and I was wondering if this internship opportunity would help me much with getting into it, or possibly other nice schools. Especially since my current 1300 SAT score isn't exactly on par with other students who go to this school, but I'll have a chance to increase that since I took it without studying. However, I have a 3.9 unweighted and 4.0 weighted. Also, If you could help me out here I was wondering if I should do subject tests as well to get into this school. I know they recommend it but I want to know if there's enough time to study and take an SAT subject test as well as retake my SAT for a better score. (edit: should I take the sat physics subject test if I got a 4 on the AP physics exam?) Also I'm nervous about applying to this school because I have little extracurricular work during school because I typically do my coding projects at home and we don't really have a programming club at our school. And I've only recently taken an interest in robotics and I haven't been in the robotics club at our school for any years but I want to join it senior year."

Need something to do throughout summer vacation? Well, Assemblywoman Ari Espinal is campaigning for re-election of the 39th Assembly District! You can join this internship throughout summer vacation, and the program is very flexible when it comes to making your schedule.

This internship is a great opportunity to meet lots of people, improve your communications and leadership skills, and gives you great insight as to how grassroots campaigns work outside of media coverage (maybe something to write for your college essay.) If you're a person who is ready to fight or support people fighting for underrepresented communities and help them gain the representation they deserve, come join the Ari Squad!

This internship is a minimum of 10 hours per week commitment, but working for more hours is very much appreciated!

You will definitely receive a letter of recommendation from the Assemblywoman, should you ever request for one. This letter can be added to your college application, job applications, etc.

Since this is an unpaid internship, you can use the hours of working in this internship for National Honor Society credits.

Just an FYI: she is, and is running for, Assemblywoman of New York's 39th Assembly District. The district consists of Jackson Heights, Corona, and Elmhurst. If you're living outside New York, you can still participate in this internship program!

There are generally 4 main and simple things that you will be doing in this internship: Canvassing, Petitioning, Visualizing, and Social Media Output. These are very simple tasks to do that are generally done for all campaign internships, and most of the time, you won't be doing all of them on the same day.

I personally am interning on Mondays and Wednesdays, from 12:00 am to 6:00 pm. Should your schedule fall with mine, I can help y'all out in what y'all need to do.

Also, do me a huge favor and say ""Ocean referred me to this internship program"" in the email when you're applying, thanks! 🙏🙏🙏

90c0u8,6,2018-07-19,Help! Job Hunting College Grad with Years of Professional Experience and Can't Get Seem to Get Anything More Than Retail/ Service Positions? Considering Changing Careers,throwawayaccnt789123,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/90c0u8/help_job_hunting_college_grad_with_years_of/,"I'm in need of some advice.

I'm a 30 year old college graduate with a degree in city planning and public policy from a big ten school and have worked for 6 years within the digital marketing industry. Mostly on the social media marketing side with a bit of paid advertising (Google Adwords) experience. I also interned with an investment firm in college but that was mostly filing documents, making copies, proofreading Power Point presentations and filling in for the receptionist when needed... task assigned to interns to keep them busy. But I did like interning there at least and everyone was nice. I graduated right during the 2008 recession so trying to get a position within the planning field either with a government or in the private sector lead to silence or having them inform me in an email they aren't currently hiring/ experiencing a hiring freeze. So I went into digital marketing which I'm self taught in, forged a modest career in NYC after moving there right after graduating field and unfortunately moved back home to Chicago due the high COL of living in NY in Jan 2016.

Fast forward to now and I'm still hunting for a full time salaried positions in the digital marketing field. I'm getting a fair amount of interviews but not offers which is very frustrating. I was even able to get an interview with a well paying email marketing manager position with Salesforce recently but it quickly became apparent to the interview panel of 8 people that I was under qualified- especially during the notorious whiteboard coding questions since the position required knowledge of various coding languages which I just know the basics since I learned web design years ago in HS.

In the meantime to bring money in I took whatever I could get which was: one short lived office assistant position at a real estate firm, a seasonal stock position with Restoration Hardware, a bit of independent client work and now I'm at a Lowe's as a sales person which I can tell isn't a good fit for my personality and is giving me a bit of anxiety since it's the first customer facing retail position I've held and is all about customer service in an industry I don't know enough about to effectively answer questions (what's the difference between this grout and that grout?) There's also the usual impatient/ rude customers; many of whom have never worked a retail job in their lives and think you're an uneducated moron since you work in retail. Those who worked retail positions know how bad it can be for workers and also it's a dying industry leading to further pressure.

(As an aside, I noticed there was a marked difference between the executive management team who are mostly training us and store managers &amp; long term staff in terms of professionalism and helping us out with training on the various tasks. It seemed like the store manager and most of his staff were disengaged and could care less about their jobs much less communication and teamwork. They didn't even introduce themselves to new hires until prompted by the executive members introduced us to them. It's a small thing but coming from a professional background it kind of set off red flags for a potential toxic environment, moral problems, etc...)

Due to how long it's been taking me to get another marketing position I'm thinking I'm either not qualified enough, letting nerves get the best of me on the many interviews I've been on or both. I'm actually thinking about switching careers from marketing since maybe it's not the right career path for me to continue going down and finally using my degree as plan B to go into GIS, working for a development company, interning with a small architecture firm, civic tourism or something *at least* somewhat related to planning. I'm basically naturally very good with anything that requires creativity/an artistic sense, spatial or 3D visualization and am deeply interested in the built environment but will probably face confusion from hiring managers when they see my resume; which now looks like it's all over the place due to the positions I've had to take in the past 2 years. The planning field though requires a masters degree and years of related experience for good positions. I'll probably need to come up with a plan C with an easier path to a salaried position (trade school? Certification program? Moving to another city? Starting a business?) in my current position.

I know I'll find a decent full time job right for me but right now I'm feeling a bit like a failure compared to my peers and am bit discouraged in my job hunt looking at where I was just 5 years ago (working at a salaried digital marketing position in the Big Apple to now working retail living with my parent's until I can get another salaried position here- that's quite a drastic change in the wrong direction). Though, I need to make a drastic change since I don't like the direction I seem to be heading which is low lever or retail positions. For the time being I'm continuing to hunt everyday and need to at least find at least a professional entry level position since I know I can do better. I can do better with my degree and experience.

Apologies for such a long post but I'm sure other's have gone through similar situations or made career changes. How'd you go about doing it? How long did it take? How'd you answer questions and concerns hiring managers had if you didn't have enough or the type of experience they were seeking?"

90cnss,10,2018-07-19,Hi I am new here. Here's my story.,TimothyChee,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/90cnss/hi_i_am_new_here_heres_my_story/,"When i was a younger boy, I would use to be really outspoken. Talk a lot,share my interests and knowledge of space that i found cool(boasting i guess you could say) and extremely outgoing. But people did not like that as they thought i was being egotistical and cocky. Eventually in secondary school from the age of 15-16(I live in Asia), i started to realize that i was being ostracized and straight up an outcast. I was the target of bullies and physically abused. I didn't know how to fight back. I was under the strict control of my wrathful mother. I was told to just completely ignore it and just score straight As. How typical... My dad was often busy and while he was the opposite of my mother, never got to influence or talk with me much.  


And now I am in polytechnic(17-19) to get a diploma in chemical engineering, I changed my ways and became quieter..sometimes way too quiet. It didn't matter. I was socially awkward, talked funny to people,and once again deemed as a generic egotistical, all-high-and-mighty person. The final straw was when someone spread a rumor about me saying and I quote 'I am better than everyone else'. The class leader confronted me aggressively and wanted to fight and I obviously said no and I didn't say it. But he did not believe me and the rumor spread to the entire class and once again i was ostracized and cast out into the cold. I felt really depressed afterwards for 6 months, seek no help and after classes i would always rush back. I eventually broke down and cried and told my parents about this. I had a change of class and things got a lot better....or so I thought.  


My friends(i guess you could call them) spotted nitty gritty problems with me and my character. It was again due to my inability to interact or communicate effectively. But i can feel them distant himself away from me. I was deemed as being oversensitive and over-explanative. Whatever wrong doing i did, I would go to great extents apologizing to them. I guess they saw that as a sign of weakness and the way i typed was and i quote  'funny and unusual'. I am so distraught and confused. I am socially inept. When i talk too much, I end up being hated. When i talk too little, people see it as a sign of status and power over them, pissing them off even more. And me not being social, not knowing how too and my strange ways of talking doesn't help.  


I am now in an internship for 6 months and in the final year of my diploma. I am so afraid when i go back, all my friends will have abandoned me.

I don't know why i am ranting so much, I just want a place to let my feelings out.  
If this is too cringy or not allowed, just let me know and I'll take it down. No worries.

I am currently doing a paid summer internship at a large aerospace company and I’m loving it. My commute is 2 hours there and 2 hours back each day so a total of 4 hours commuting. During his time I read because its something I love to do and I’m totally sucked into this one book called 11/22/63 by Stephen King (totally recommend btw). Anyway, I wake up at 6:30, leave at 7:00 and return home around 6:00 everyday. Since it’s the summer I’ll sometimes go somewhere with my girlfriend or any number of friends after work but otherwise I’ll just return home. At home I’ll either play guitar or do laundry, walk my dog and help my parents in any other way possible and towards the evening, I’ll sit down at my computer to play video games with friends for one to a couple hours. I turn in at 11:30 to 12 and the cycle continues. Now, tonight my mother decided that she’d had enough of my so called apathy for everything else because according to her all I do is go in my computer as soon as I get back. She disregards the fact that I help my parents with anything every single day and she says that nothing else interests me even though reading guitar and my friends would be those other things. She yells how I’m bound to be psychologically damaged because I yearn to get home and kill people on my computer. Apparently I have an addiction although I control myself perfectly and just blowing off steam with video games everyday is addictive and harmful to me. She threatened to smash my computer which I payed for and built in full on my own. This is coming from a woman who literally watches videos on her computer the entire day and she’s doing this right now as I type this at 12:33 in the morning. I don’t know what she wants and I want to know what you guys think. Is she being fair?

TL;DR : Mother says I spend too much time playing games on my “addictive” computer even though I only do it to unwind after working and in addition to my other hobbies."

Any advice will be greatly appreciated!,suteru18,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/90ep6r/planning_to_apply_to_r1_university_phd_programs/,"TL;DR Applying to CS PhD program. No prior research experience. 159/168/4 (V/Q/AW) on GRE. Retake? How do you decide which PhD program is the best for you? Is retaking a class bad for grad school application?

Hello everyone,

I have a 3.6 GPA in an Electrical Engineering undergraduate program and am looking into applying to a PhD program for a field more related to computer science this fall. I have very little research experience with my only experience having been working as a research intern in the summer of my freshman year with a professor that was researching a completely different field (albeit still a STEM field). As I was only working as an intern, my name is not in any publications. I worked as an intern in both the summer of my sophomore and junior year with the internship in my junior year being in a country outside of the U.S. I have gotten a 159/168/4 (V/Q/AW) on the GRE.

1. Is finding the professor you want to work and learn under more important than applying to R1 Universities that are famous for that field? Obviously if an R1 University is historically famous for a particular field then it is likely that the university has good professors but I wanted to know how much weight I should put on a university's history when it comes to applications. Simply, how do you decide which PhD program is the best for you?
2. Related to question 1, how do you find ""good"" professors? Also, once you find them how should you contact them to ask questions about their research? I would assume professors would be happy to answer questions about their research but I have also heard some professors do not take too kindly to constantly receiving emails from students they believe are just trying to join their program.
3. Is there a site you can use to find research papers online to read from? I don't want to do this illegally if possible especially if this ends up hurting the researchers. I want to read as many research papers as I can before I begin contacting professors.
4. I am planning to retake one of the two classes in which I got a C this upcoming year but was advised not to. Taking this class will not severely affect my workload or my ability to graduate. Is retaking a class to improve my grade severely detrimental to my application?
5. Do I need to retake the GRE? My complete lack of research experience worries me.

If you've read this far, thank you so much for reading and thank you in advance for any advice, criticisms, etc."

Seriously intending to change career to IT.  An undergrad degree would get me an internship and a foot in the door into the industry. I love the US and working in the USA would be a dream so I've only considered US universities. What's the best option for me?

- GeorgiaTech OMSCS Masters degree part-time while working. 
- Self-study through Coursera+Books (Python, Machine Learning, Algorithms &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; Data Structures, SQL) + Leetcode practice + work on open source projects + Hackathons + Kaggle contests.

Is it realistic to expect to get admitted into Carnegie / Georgia Tech without having schooled in the US (no GPA score) ?  

Georgia Tech masters is an alluring option due to the cost ($7000) and online medium but I'm not sure how useful this would be without an undergrad CS degree and without any CS experience. That is assuming I could get admitted to the masters program. 

Is it much more difficult getting hired without a CS degree? 

Masters after undergrad? 

What are expected salaries after graduation, and 2-3 years down the line ?

90g62i,1,2018-07-20,What move should I do to progress?,rojolele1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/90g62i/what_move_should_i_do_to_progress/,"Hi,

I am in my late twenties and I come from a developing country. I am hoping to get some advice regarding my career.

My background is below:

I studied geological engineering as a bachelor in a local university and was able to land my first job as a data modeling geologist. I worked for 4 years since then before quitting. Several reasons that made me quit is that the work itself is very dull and repetitive. It is a typical established company which have too many employees, so a workload of 1 person is worked upon by 5 people. The deciding factor, however, is that an early pension program is announced due to the need to cut operational costs. After leaving, I was considering to get some scholarship and continue my study in a geological master degree.

I am very interested in artificial intelligence at the time and has already started learning about it before going out of the company, however, at that point, it was just a hobby. I randomly found an opening opportunity for a junior data scientist in a small startup company and thought, it may be a good experience to just try. I do it without much expectation and was accepted. I was very surprised that I got it with such a limited skill set.

I then come to the company to see the offer. The salary is small but they present a chance for me to be trained in their headquarter in Japan. The downside is that it is accompanied by a huge amount of penalty if I quit before two years, I hesitated. I tried to get some information from the employees there. Some of the guys I talked to said that it really worth the penalty to get the training. That along with my high expectation of Japanese quality. I also asked some friends that work in the data industry and they also suggested me that is a better idea to dive into the industry as most of the data science master program is not really as up to date as the industry. This could be a fun adventure, I thought, and so I decided to go with it.

Things got a little bit sour after that. I was quite baffled when I started the training program and found that there is no training at all. I was given some datasets which are actually a real project and was immediately assign to do it, alone. I am aware of my lack of competence on this, but I faced the challenge and do it anyway. It was very frustrating because the language barrier here is very big. I was having a hard time doing any discussions and no appropriate review was given to my project. I finished it but I felt it was of a very poor quality and am disappointed with it. Until the end of the training (around 1.5 months), I never get any kind of training or mentoring and then I returned to my country to start working. My skill set is still almost the same as when I first come.

I wanted to leave the company, however, I tried to be positive and think that this is just a start, it might not be perfect but if I keep doing projects I will learn even only by myself. That, and also the binding penalty. To be honest I was paid 700 USD each month without any other benefit such as health insurance as a data scientist here. It is much lower compared to my salary as a geologist but I just think of it as having a paid ""master course"".

After returning to my country there actually is no project that can be done, instead, we tried to make a data science course to teach people. Keeping a positive attitude, I tried to think it will be just for a while, so it'll be a good time filler between projects. So with what little I know, I tried to make the curriculum, do marketing, and also teach people. Six months passed and no project is in sight. I feel frustrated as I am beginning to lose hope, the courses that we make is also lukewarm as our team does not have experienced data scientist that can help us. I want to develop myself so I spent a huge portion of my salary to get online courses (Udacity's nano degrees, Coursera's deeplearning.ai, and several others) by myself as the company doesn't provide that. I need to also to pay for my house mortgages so I am slowly eating my pension money.

I asked to go back to Japan to do projects because I don't really learn anything in my country branch. They respect my wish and send me back to Japan. The same story repeats itself. I was given a project to do by myself and it resulted in some weak result. Real life cases are much difficult compared to toy cases in tutorials and courses. I finished this trip and came back with no meaningful growth.

My confidence is wavering, People are already leaving my country's branch, most don't get sent for training so they don't have a penalty holding them back. People are coming and going, a lot don't even finish the probation period. There are several fresh graduate interns here, they all decided to leave after getting better offer and certainty (they easily got ranges of 1000-1200 USD a month plus benefits even without much experience).

I felt I wasted a lot of time and opportunities here. They recently offered me to work in Japan permanently with a minimum Japanese salary (around 2000 USD monthly). I am thinking whether to take it since I still got a 1-year contract before I can be free.

I still try to be positive, but I am really thinking, is this too much? Should I just go back to my country and search for another opportunity? I still want to pursue the data science career path. It might be good to search opportunity here in Japan but I don't actually have a working visa since I was ""training"" here.

Sorry, it got quite long. If anyone can give a piece of advice I would really appreciate it.

Thanks!"

The website contains a series of tickets that users created with their description, ticket number, etc..

What I want to do is to send emails to these users, regarding their open tickets, whenever a change has been made, but I don't want to send emails automatically when a change happens. I want it so that when an admin logs in the website, he can change something about a ticket, for example, he can change the status to ""pending"", and then he can select said ticket or tickets, and press ""Send Notification"" button, to send an email to the person who opened the ticket. 

Here is an example of what the website looks like and what i'm trying to do:

[Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/i7mxSbL)

I am using Nodejs, React, axios and mongodb. For sending the emails, I'm using Nodemailer.

Here is my code for the email:

`var express = require(""express"");`  
`var router = express.Router();`  
`var Users = require(""../../models/user"");`  
`var bcrypt = require(""bcrypt"");`  
`var nodemailer= require('nodemailer') ;`  
`router.get(""/"", function(reg, res) {`  
 `res.render(""index"");`  
`});`

`class NodemailerHelper {`  
 `constructor() {`  
 `var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({`  
 `service: 'gmail',`  
 `auth: {`  
 `user: 'n@gmail.com',`  
 `pass: ''`  
`}`  
`});`  
`}`  
 `sendMail(from, to, subject, html, text) {`  
 `this.mailOptions = {`  
 `from: '""name"" @gmail.com', // sender address`  
 `to: '@yahoo.com', // list of receivers`  
 `subject: 'hey there', // Subject line`  
 `text: 'Email notification sending', // plain text body`  
 `html: '&lt;b&gt;Notification!&lt;/b&gt;' // html body`  
`};`  
 `this.transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, (error, info) =&gt; {`  
 `console.log('Message sent: %s', info.messageId);`  
 `console.log('Preview URL: %s', nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info))`  
 `if (error) {`  
 `return console.log(error);`  
`} else {`  
 `return true;`  
`}`  
`});`  
  `}`  
`}`

And here is my button code that I'd like the emailing code to be attached to:

`import React, { Component } from ""react"";`  
`import { Button } from ""reactstrap"";`  
`import axios from ""axios"";`  
`class Submit extends Component {`  
 `constructor(props){`  
 `super(props);`  
 `this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);`  
  `}`  
 `handleClick() {`  
 `console.log(""Notification sent!"");`  
  `}`  
 `render() {`  
 `return (`  
 `&lt;Button onClick={this.handleClick} color=""danger"" style={{ position: ""absolute"", bottom: ""1px"" }}&gt;`  
`Send Notification`  
 `&lt;/Button&gt;`  
`);`  
  `}`  
`}`  
`export default Submit;`

I'm new here as I'm new into SysOps/DevOps, but I hope you guys will help me.

I'm on my internship now as Sys/DevOps. I'm learning, doing new stuff and my supervisior asked me for help so I want to do my best.

We are looking for a tool, software whatever which help us to manage our servers. We're already using stuff like OCS, GLPI and they are doing their best, but... But we have so many instances, mostly virtual machines, but there's no Azure, AWS or that kind of stuff. Our own datacenters.

We have to make some reports so sometimes we have to draw our infrastructure by ourself. Maybe it seems nice, but it is not at all when you have about 400 instances and you must find out which one communicates with second, third, fourth one. I haven't finished yet. Which one uses port 3306 to communicate with db-server, which one uses 15\*\* to communicate with Oracle instance, etc. So there has to be a tool makes you able to do it or just group it and finish it by yourself. Any recommendations? Any ideas?

Picture below related. It looks pretty nice, as we imagine it. But it's MS OMS, working only in Azure.

Cannot upload it so x)

I believe You'd help me!

Thanks guys, have a good one."

It has been close to four years.",Bum_In_The_Park,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/90if75/pennsylvania_chester_county_any_possible/,"I'm expecting the answer to the title to be strict NO, however I'm curious if there is any possibility there may be an exception.

4 (and) 5 years ago, I had accumulated a number of summary offenses on my record. I had a drinking problem, and thus racked up in that period 5 charges, including public intoxication, disorderly conduct, and underage drinking. These all took place within Chester County in Pennsylvania in the beginning years of my college career. The last offense was a public intoxication citation in the last week of September 2014. Not wanting to burden my relatives with fees and lawyer costs any more than I already have, I plead guilty to this last charge and paid the fines myself.

I understand this rule may not be flexible, but I have not acquired any charges since then, am now a non-drinker for a considerable period of time (AA), and have excelled in my current major which I will finally graduate from in December. The worry is, this major is accounting, and it tends to be a conservative field as far as criminal history goes. I did manage to get a tax season internship which I worked from January to April of this year. I plead my case to this particular firm and they decided to take me on despite the egregious number of summary offenses on my record. I used the same argument I am presenting now - these crimes were non-violent and all a result of my drinking problem, and I have adjusted my life to divert away from the path I was going on then. However, now that graduation is coming up, I am deeply concerned about both job prospects going into recruiting this Fall as well as an application to sit for the CPA exam.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Again, all of these crimes were very foolish on my part and I take full responsibility, but it would be an enormous relief to know I could mitigate the self-sabotage I've done in regards to my career. "

We work weekends, holidays, and have to work 11p-7a so no one wants the job (there has been an open position for a year and a half, while the longest I’ve seen a tech position open was 2 months.)

When I took the job they said they would eventually promote me to a tech, I know now that it was a lie (even someone who has been an OP for 15 years did not get a tech position as well when they applied.)

I did get in to some schools and ended up deciding to go to a large out of state public university. After attending admitted students day and orientation, I'm having pretty serious doubts. It just doesn't feel like the right school for me. This school is on the complete opposite side of the country from where I currently live (a 6 hour direct flight). I have no family in the area (or even in the state, or surrounding states) and don't know anyone else that is attending this school from my hometown. On top of that, it's $50,000 a year, which is about double what my family can actually afford. It seems ridiculous to go to a school all the way across the country that I don't like where I have no support system, especially when it would put my family in financial hardship.  


I've talked to my parents about these worries and they agree. It's a big cost for our family and doesn't quite seem worth it. They want me to take a year off, stay home, and apply to more schools. One of my mistakes this past year was only applying to safeties and reaches. I did get in to all of my safeties, but those were the only schools I got in to. If I applied again, I would apply to new schools that are not only closer to home but also a little more realistic for me. I would definitely spend the year working--I have some local internship opportunities that I would follow through with.  


If you read all of that, I'm impressed with your patience. Here's my question: if I were to take a year off, work, and restart the admissions process, would I be worse off in comparison to those applying while still in high school? I understand it's unlikely I'll be admitted to schools I was already rejected from. But if I'm applying to new schools, will a gap year negatively affect my chances? We've discussed the idea of me attending this university and transferring somewhere that's a better fit. I think I would prefer the gap year, especially because I feel that adjusting to this new environment would be more difficult with all my negative feelings towards the school and the distance from any kind of support system.  


TLDR; I picked a school and have realized it's the wrong school for me. My parents and I are considering the possibility of me taking a gap year so I can apply to a new batch of schools. If I were to do so, would it hurt my chances when applying to new schools?"

I've coded a few sites, some from no design at all and others from a design I wanted to recreate. One problem I'm often running into is once I've made the desktop and tablet version of a site I find it harder to scale down those elements to mobile (mostly things like footers). Or maybe there was a part in the desktop version that I manipulated the width of an element to fit it correctly and when it's time to scale that element and others around it down to mobile I've got a mess of code I have to re-arrange and it's generally a mess. I believe I'm doing something wrong in this regard and wonder if not coding for mobile first is a part of  probably why this is happening?

I often hear you should code for mobile first but I'm stuck at where to begin (hear me out) it's hard for me to visualize coding a site from mobile and scaling that code up to the desktop version of the design.

90kt6t,2,2018-07-20,Where are you going?,inlevelse,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/90kt6t/where_are_you_going/,"It’s pouring outside, at the moment – like quick and sleek drops hitting the foil roof of the house and every once in a while, a lightning strucks dangerously near the building, unprovided of a proper lighting rod. 
I remember the forecast saying thunderstorms were surely coming by sunset, but I just wasn’t caring much about it as I was kinda busy texting my sister, who was nice enough to insist on getting me out of the house for the night.

It’s been an awful period for me since I started my bachelor internship – four months of pure scientific research confined at 2700 meters a.s.l. on one of the highest mountain passes of the nation. And let’s just say that I chose the wrong field to work in, since science in situ seems to be reserved to men and the poor me, being a – 1,53 meters and 47 kilos – little girl does not help one bit. 
I’ve been mobbed and bullied heavily and it is draining all my energies; just last week, as one of my colleagues played a really bad move on me I fell in a deep panic attack in my hostel room and decided to pack my stuff and go back home even just for a week.

So, back to tonight, when my sister and her friend dragged me to the FireFest, the annual countryside festival that takes places in the biggest of the mountain villages around the one I live in. It was nice, we sat among the apple trees and drank a few beers, chatting a laughing. I felt like I could finally relax a bit, but as the night was getting darker I could hear more and more thunders and in just a few hours I decided to head back home. 
My sister begged me to text her as soon as I parked the car again, since she knows me well and I'm neither a good driver, nor a good drinker (sadly). 

I drove extra carefully, paying extreme attention to my brights, the road and the wild foxes that always cross the road at night. As I was getting close to home though, I started getting these weird, unusual chills. I remember finding them very out of place, since in the middle of July after a couple of beers I still was positive of feeling kinda hot. I tried shaking them off by raising the volume of the music and the car windows to just a split of night void. 

I finally saw the sign of the village entrance and the parking lot just a couple meters away, so I down-shifted gear and I prepared to park. From the tiny opened window I heard a female voice just around the corner behind a huge beech tree. I let the music go on for a bit, imagining it could have been some of the cool kids from the youngest generation, but I heard no response. 
As soon as I step out of the car the voice stopped. 

I looked around, somewhat confused, peeking through the tree branches. Where the kids should have been sitting there was no one, not even a stray cat meowing. Frowning, I tried to shake off the goose bumps that had started to cover my arms and neck and I headed home by foot. 
The thunders were getting closer and louder, but above those, this feeling of uneasiness was growing as well. While I was walking, I continuously turned my head to the sides extremely slowly, trying to catch details in the dimly lit streets with my poor vision. 

To the west, the mountain stood covered in dark clouds above the black silhouettes of the forest trees and just under those, the children’s playground appeared as an eerie labyrinth to desperately avoid at night. I felt like I should not have taken my eyes away from it, but I was yet unable to look at it for too long, since I was still getting these waves of what had now become pure fright. 

Suddenly a tiny shadow crossed my field of vision, bolting towards me. I started frantically turning my head like a sunflower since I couldn’t make out where exactly it was coming from. I let out this tiny squeal and jumped a bit on the spot, squeezing my eyes shut. 
But as I carefully opened them up again I found myself face to face with a grey cat on the other side of the road. I sighed and took a deep breath, the little animal was just staring at me with its huge black eyes. 

At that point my nerves were on edge and my legs were a bit frozen. The atmosphere felt so off that my ears felt like they were about to pop. 
I decided to call my sister – maybe to let her know I drove safely home and maybe to have some company in case anything happened from now on. I dialed her number quickly by heart but clearly quite not quick enough – in the fraction of the second between the number and the enter button the voice started again. 
It was like a soft conversation, a tranquil dialogue. Except the voice was single, which made it a monologue – which made it scary as hell. It seemed like she was telling a story, or more precisely, someone’s story; in my state of terrified trance I could not make out all of her words, but I overheard what seemed like the report of a homicide by accident. 
Her tone was deep, mellifluous, she seemed somewhat proud, somewhat pleased. 
Most disturbing, she seemed conscious I was listening?

I tried to start walking again, I could see my house just a few steps away and I could feel my keys in my pocket – I was squeezing them so hard that I felt they could cut through my palm. 
My breath became hysterically quick as a scared paralysis was conquering my body. 
The voice kept going with her slow and unctuous monologue and my ears kept on with the loud buzz that usually precedes the effective pop. Step after step I was finally in front of my house, where I climbed the stairs cowardly shrinking between my own shoulders. 

As I reached for the door though, my ears popped. 
All the noises of the night stopped – no breeze, no leaves, no crickets. The voice echoed with a question that chilled me deeply.

""Where are you going?""

She knew I was there. 

Frantically I took out the keys and inserted them in the keyhole. In the dark and hysteria I couldn’t make out how to turn them, they slipped from my fingers and cracked a bit, but I opened the damn door in the end. 
I jump right in and slammed it closed behind me, turning the keys more and more times to be entirely sure the building would be inaccessible. 
Without even stopping in the kitchen I went upstairs to my room, washing my face several times and trying to calm down.

Now it has started to rain – it’s pouring, as I said. 
Every once in a while, I peek down in the streets through my bedroom window. I cannot see anything except the forest trees black silhouettes and the thick rain. 
I think I will keep watch, since I foresee a sleepless night."

TL;DR Applying to CS PhD program. No prior research experience. 159/168/4 (V/Q/AW) on GRE. Retake? How do you decide which PhD program is the best for you? Is retaking a class bad for grad school application?  
  
Hello everyone,  
  
I have a 3.6 GPA in an Electrical Engineering undergraduate program and am looking into applying to a PhD program for a field more related to computer science this fall. I have very little research experience with my only experience having been working as a research intern in the summer of my freshman year with a professor that was researching a completely different field (albeit still a STEM field). As I was only working as an intern, my name is not in any publications. I worked as an intern in both the summer of my sophomore and junior year with the internship in my junior year being in a country outside of the U.S. I have gotten a 159/168/4 (V/Q/AW) on the GRE.  
  
1. Is finding the professor you want to work and learn under more important than applying to R1 Universities that are famous for that field? Obviously if an R1 University is historically famous for a particular field then it is likely that the university has good professors but I wanted to know how much weight I should put on a university's history when it comes to applications. Simply, how do you decide which PhD program is the best for you?  
2. Related to question 1, how do you find ""good"" professors? Also, once you find them how should you contact them to ask questions about their research? I would assume professors would be happy to answer questions about their research but I have also heard some professors do not take too kindly to constantly receiving emails from students they believe are just trying to join their program.  
3. Is there a site you can use to find research papers online to read from? I don't want to do this illegally if possible especially if this ends up hurting the researchers. I want to read as many research papers as I can before I begin contacting professors.  
4. I am planning to retake one of the two classes in which I got a C this upcoming year but was advised not to. Taking this class will not severely affect my workload or my ability to graduate. Is retaking a class to improve my grade severely detrimental to my application?  
5. Do I need to retake the GRE? My complete lack of research experience worries me.  
If you've read this far, thank you so much for reading and thank you in advance for any advice, criticisms, etc."

[Kansas][Intellectual Property],Ismo72s,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/90lr6o/created_program_to_help_me_do_my_job_more/,"Last August through April of this year, I worked at an insurance broker for small businesses. I started as an intern and was hired on as a full-time employee after a few months. Part of my job was to run quotes using census data in excel spreadsheets which I entered into insurance carrier websites to retrieve accurate insurance quotes for each specific company. 

I realized that all of these insurance carrier's websites have an option to upload a spreadsheet of the census in order to run a quote more quickly. The thing is, each carrier had a different format of spreadsheet, so I made an excel spreadsheet that would take census data which I input on the first sheet, and populate 9 other spreadsheets in the correct format for each carrier so that they were ready to upload. This cut the time it took me to run quotes from several hours, to less than an hour. Everyone was stoked to have this program that would allow them to run quotes easier, and more efficiently. 

This was something they did not assign. It was something I did because I like programming and I wanted to make my life and those of the account executives easier and to show my worth to the company.

Once I had it feature-complete, including a few hundred lines of VBA code, I did a presentation to all the people who could benefit from using it. Everyone was impressed, and I heard from multiple people that they were impressed with my presentation. I still have a copy of the program on my home computer.

About a week after that, I had my performance review, which went well I think, and they specifically said that my job was not at stake. Then exactly one week after that, I was let go because ""they didn't have enough work for me to do"". 

I may have created my own undoing by creating this program, but if they are still using it in their business practice, am I entitled to compensation? I really feel like they took advantage of me here. Do I have an intellectual property case?"

I have just finished my Junior year of high school. I have taken three years of programming courses, participate on the robotics team, have my own side projects, and am interning as a software engineer. I have lots of knowledge in Java, quite a bit in python, enough to get me around in various other languages, and virtually none in C/C++. I'm not going into these languages as my first experience, so I feel ready, and have decided that these languages will be the next beasts I tackle for a few reasons.

First of all, I want to get into embedded systems, which from what I understand makes C attractive. However, at my internship, which I might have over the school year and next summer, has a lot more interesting projects in C++ compared to Java (C is still used though, especially in the lower level projects). I also want to get ahead for college where I will inevitably have to learn C and C++.

My robotics mentor, who is also my co-worker, swears by C. He hates C++ for being more restrictive and he likes the lower level nature of C. However, I kind of disregard that because he is a freak over having control over his own systems (for example he drives a manual car and uses linux for the same reasons as liking C over C++).

Either way I will have to learn both languages eventually, and I want to know what the best would be to learn first.

Copied and pasted from my email to my mentor asking the same question:

&gt;Would you recommend learning C or C++ first? I want to learn both because I have different uses for both. However, after looking it up, I see people arguing both sides and I understand both arguments.  
&gt;  
&gt;The main ""C first"" argument is that it will give you a better understanding of how computers work since it is such a low level language. It also gives you an understanding for why some things in C++ are the way they are. People also said that it is more restrictive so if you learn C++ first and then have to deal with the restrictions of C, you will get frustrated.  
&gt;  
&gt;The main ""C++ first"" argument (which is less common but imo just as effective) is that learning C first will cause poor C++ practices because they are very different languages, and a problem would be solved in much different ways. However, if you learn C++ first, you physically can't transfer C++ practices into C because it just won't compile.

Understanding how computers work at a lower level is very appealing to me (I binged watched Ben Eater's series on building an 8 bit computer while recovering from a surgery two years ago). I think I want to learn C first, since I want to get into programming an arduino more, but I am worried about making bad habits since I won't learn C++ in a class for a couple of years. Any suggestions?"

The position was a software engineer and the interview lasted 4 hours with each person having some allocated time to interview me. All the engineers I spoke with were so fuckin amazing and they gave me a great impression for the company, I wasn't asked anything crazy technical questions, it was more of getting to know me better and asking about my school projects and internship, however all that changed when I was interviewed by the last person, the hiring manager.

First of all he was so grumpy and trying to be extremely serious, which I could understand to be fair, not a big issue. He asked to me list all the class that I have taken in school and started asking thorough questions about them, I studied computer engineering so I had a lot of electrical engineering classes, math classes and digital signal processing. The problem is he caught me off guard, I was not expecting him to ask about unrelated classes. He was also a computer engineer and he said he took almost the same classes, he started asking me questions about Fourier transform, electrical concepts and many other things, and I couldn't answer very well because either those were classes that I sucked at or I took them a long time ago. I felt like a dumbass to be honest. 

I think overall he didn't have a good impression of me (even though I had a very good and related experience internship for this position). After the interview ended he told me that I'm the first person he was interviewing for this position and he will let me know once he finishes with the other candidates, I asked him how long and he said a month... He told me he was going on a 2 week vacation and continue the interviews after coming back. Do you think he was telling me that just to basically say ""forget about getting this job""?  Also, is it common practice to start asking questions about all school classes even the unrelated ones?"

I'm facing this issue in my internship where in, when I try to insert Chinese characters into an oracle DB, it gets inserted as upside down question marks. 

I realize that it's an encoding issue, but even when I use nchar strings where the encoding is set as UTF8, the issue persists.

I thought that it might be an issue with cx_Oracle, but even in Java with a jdbc connection it's the same story.
Stack overflow says that to fix the issue, the table's schema needs to be changed, but that it's problematic because my boss does not want to risk it in a production environment.

The one thing which does not make sense/gives me hope is that, pycharm is able to successfully insert Chinese characters into the DB. It does not make sense. If it's a DB / schema issue, how does pycharm which also uses a jdbc connection manage to do the impossible. 

Does anyone know how to view the connection details in pycharm so that I can replicate it in normal Java or python ?

EDIT: Solved ! The problem was outdated an JDBC / Oracle client. The reason that pycharm works is because it uses the newest JDBC drivers."

What to do?",RestlessYetLazy21,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/90tmoy/21_years_world_currently_devops_engineer_worked/,"Hey there!  


I graduate in one year from WGU - Western Governor's University. I am 21 years old, to not identify myself, I won't name companies. I'm on my fifth job in IT. Went like this -   


Support &gt; More Support &gt; Sysadmin &gt; Sr Systems Engineer &gt; DevOps Engineer.   


That timeline starts about a year into college. The first two were at FAANGs, third and fourth are massive corps and the place I'm currently a DevOps engineer at is small - $200M revenue.  


Already decent at writing python but not building complex full stack applications, there was no way I was going to convince a company to hire me to program for them at 18 years old. So I did the track above while going to school and it's paid off. I get to spend 60%&lt; of my day in DevOps programming, that's awesome! I can't believe I get to write code for a living.   


Here's the thing - I make $84k, a downgrade from the $94k role I had previously. I consider myself to be a terrible programmer and so no way could I actually get a development role at the FAANGs. Rather I could reasonably get a software development internship. Problem with that is I have a year left before I graduate and consequently become ineligible for development internships. I like my current role but I just a few months ago and due to my short stints above, I don't want to leave without putting in one year at least.   


If I apply, it looks like I'm Mr. Job Hopper 2000, if I don't apply I may not get the chance to work in one of those engineering depts later in life.  


My question to you experienced software engineers and managers: Do you acknowledge the difference in difficulty I'm perceiving between applying as an intern before I graduate vs a year or two after graduation? Or am I wrong?  


My interest in developing at the FAANGs is about two things, scale and culture of engineering. My other question is about salary - my assumption is these internships/new grad roles typically pay $130k-$175k total compensation and thus a big step up from where I am, is that right?   


Thank you for reading. 

Note - Rereading my post sounds like I'm a child and vastly inexperienced. I am inexperienced but I have put in work. One company I automated the crap out of their public cloud and trained their sr ops engineers in AWS basics. I interview candidates 1-1 quite a bit, am right below the director and have had productive meetings with VPs at the last two companies. So I promise, I am not a child. "

I’m in the process of interviewing with multiple companies right now, and am unsure on the best way to navigate it considering some interviews are moving faster than others.

Here’s a breakdown of the situation. Company A is where I did my internship, and I did genuinely enjoy working there. They recently reached out to me after receiving an internal reference and are interested in bringing me in for a contract position. I’m not big on the idea of contract work and I’m also not thrilled about the location. They’re moving very fast, and I’m pretty sure I’ll get an offer within the week, although they are lowest on my list right now.

Company B is my top choice. It’s direct hire, in an awesome location and in line with where I wanna take my career. The company also seems to be well regarded on Glassdoor. They are flying me out of state for an on-site interview this Friday. However, I’m worried that company A will be making an offer and pushing for a decision before I fly out. All in all though, company B is my top choice.

Then there is company C. This company is also direct hire and in an awesome location, although the position is a bit different from the other 2. I have a second phone interview with them on Monday, and if that were to go well I know the next step would be flying me out for an on-site. I would love to work here as well, but they are moving a bit slower than the other 2 companies.

Additionally, company B told me that there are a couple other roles they’re considering me for, in addition to the one I applied for (the roles are relevant to my degree). Not sure if this is a good sign that they want to find a position for me, or a bad sign that they aren’t sure I’m well suited to the role I applied for. All in all, I would appreciate any advice I could get on this situation. Is there any way I could stall company A when they’re looking to hire ASAP? I don’t wanna burn that bridge just to get rejected from the other 2 positions. Can I use company A as leverage to get companies B and C to move faster?

I am a 24 year old female, and I have a BA in Spanish and I'm not interested in doing anything in the field of my degree. I feel like my passion is helping others to heal. I am very interested in medicine, holistic healing, integrative medicine, health, wellness and especially nutrition. I really want to pursue more education to do something I'm more passionate about. I've been doing a ton of research on the careers I'm interested in, but I'm still conflicted about it. Does anyone have any good ideas for what careers I could pursue, or what would be the best fit for me since I'm really interested in nutrition, holistic &amp; traditional medicine, and working in the healthcare field? 

So because I am really interested in nutrition, I am interested in becoming a dietician but since my undergrad degree was not in dietetics it's a little complicated to pursue that, since I have to take the pre-requisite courses first, then apply to a program that allows me to complete the DPD coursework only, and then apply to a dietetic internship. So I am hesitant to pursue this, because it's really difficult and competitive to get an internship, and I don't want to go through all of the schooling and not be able to get one. It's going to take at least 2 years or more to complete all of the perquisites and coursework to be able to apply to a dietetic internship. I have also heard some negative things about how there isn't many good job opportunities for dietitians. But I find the coursework really interesting, I'm really interested in nutrition and using nutrition to help people heal, so I feel like it would be a good career for me. 

I am also considering becoming a nurse. I like the idea of being a nurse practitioner. I always was interested in being a doctor, but didn't want to go to med school, and nurse practitioners basically do the same thing as doctors. But I have some apprehensions with pursuing this as well. I would have to work as a standard RN for a while, and I'm not sure if I will end up liking the tasks that RN's have to do, so I'm afraid I will not end up liking being a typical RN. But I do like how it's a stable job and pays well. I was also planning to do an ADN program first, which I would be able to get into easily, and I don't need to take as many pre-req courses, as I would to pursue dietetics, so overall it would be an easier and faster process, and there is more job stability with pursuing nursing. And although I may am worried I may not like being an RN, I am interested in working in the medical/health care field in general, so I may end up liking it, and eventually I will be able to become a NP, so it may be worth it working as an RN for a few years, to be able to do something I'm really interested in.

I have also considered working as a medical assistant in the meantime while I pursue another degree, and I have also considered pursuing being a Physician's Assistant as well.

Also, the last option I've considered is becoming a therapist/counselor. This would be the easiest and fastest option for me to pursue, since it doesn't require any pre-req courses to get a master's degree in counseling, just a bachelor's degree. So I could start the master's program immediately. It would also be less stressful, since I wouldn't have to take intensive science/medical courses. I was interested in becoming a therapist since I am also passionate about mental health, and helping people overcome mental health issues, like I have myself. I feel like I would find it fulfilling, but I don't feel extremely called to do it. I feel more called to do something related to medicine or working in the healthcare field. I also considered becoming a psychiatric nurse practitioner, because then I could work with people with mental health issues as well. 

And lastly, another option I've been considering lately is teaching English in Spain, since I love Europe and I've been dying to go back. It's been on my bucket list for a while, but I have felt more inclined to start pursuing more education, and going to Spain to teach for a year would delay that further, but it would probably be better to pursue this before dedicating myself to pursuing another degree."

I've generally enjoyed my time here. I don't always enjoy the work, but work is work. The pay is also pretty great. It's been an adjustment getting used to working full time and getting up early, on top of a commute that can get long some days. I feel like I don't have a lot of time to relax. I'm starting to think this is just how life is though, and I will have to deal with this once I graduate. I've been really looking forward to having some extended time off to relax, as the end of my internship is coming up. Fortunately, over the last several days it seems I'm finally getting more used to this, my new routine.

I can extend my internship into the fall semester (part time, paid), and I've been really conflicted on whether I should or not. Every day my answer seems to change. I don't want to make a decision I regret either way. 

I know I can still learn and grow at this company. At the same time, I've already learned so much, so I *think* I'd be okay with leaving it off here. I'm sure the stress will be much lower as part time vs. full time, but I'm also taking a few difficult classes next semester, so I'm concerned that I'll be in over my head. I have another side commitment that I plan on continuing into the fall, so I'm worried that between my classes, this internship, and my side thing, I'll be regretting my choice. The previous semester I had a similar setup with another job and it seemed like a lot for me. It was manageable, but I was happy when my commitments dropped down halfway through the semester. As mentioned, I'm also expecting my classes this upcoming semester will be tougher.

I've saved this summer so I don't need the extra money, but it would be really nice to have. I've done multiple internships so I'm not too worried about how my job prospects would be affected. But I know it would look a lot better to employers if I worked for this company longer and had more to show for experience and company loyalty. All my previous jobs only lasted a few months. I'm concerned this will be viewed negatively, and companies will wonder if no one wanted me to continue working for them, or if I have a commitment problem.

On one hand I feel like I should do it, and learn to make the best of it along the way. I definitely think it will be a great growing experience for me. I know many don't have the luxury of deciding if they want to work or not and we all get through it. On the other hand, I'm selfish. I feel like I should enjoy the time I have left in college to relax as much as I can, and that I should put my classes first in not overloading my schedule, since graduating is my priority.

I've generally enjoyed my time here. I don't always enjoy the work, but work is work. The pay is also pretty great. It's been an adjustment getting used to working full time and getting up early, on top of a commute that can get long some days. I feel like I don't have a lot of time to relax. I'm starting to think this is just how life is though, and I will have to deal with this once I graduate in a year. I've been really looking forward to having some extended time off to relax, as the end of my internship is coming up. Fortunately, over the last several days it seems I'm finally getting more used to this, my new routine.

I can extend my internship into the fall semester (part time, paid), and I've been really conflicted on whether I should or not. Every day my answer seems to change. I don't want to make a decision I regret either way. 

I know I can still learn and grow at this company. At the same time, I've already learned so much, so I *think* I'd be okay with leaving it off here. I'm sure the stress will be much lower as part time vs. full time, but I'm also taking a few difficult classes next semester, so I'm concerned that I'll be in over my head. I have another side commitment that I plan on continuing into the fall, so I'm worried that between my classes, this internship, and my side thing, I'll be regretting my choice. The previous semester I had a similar setup with another job and it seemed like a lot for me. It was manageable, but I was happy when my commitments dropped down halfway through the semester. As mentioned, I'm also expecting my classes this upcoming semester will be tougher.

I've saved this summer so I don't need the extra money, but it would be really nice to have. I've done multiple internships so I'm not too worried about how my job prospects would be affected. But I know it would look a lot better to employers if I worked for this company longer and had more to show for experience and company loyalty. All my previous jobs only lasted a few months. I'm concerned this will be viewed negatively, and companies will wonder if no one wanted me to continue working for them, or if I have a commitment problem.

On one hand I feel like I should do it, and learn to make the best of it along the way. I definitely think it will be a great growing experience for me. I know many don't have the luxury of deciding if they want to work or not and we all get through it. On the other hand, I'm selfish. I feel like I should enjoy the time I have left in college to relax as much as I can, and that I should put my classes first in not overloading my schedule, since graduating is my priority. 

I really need some help with my decision. Has anyone gone through something similar? If so, what did you do?

90vm7d,245,2018-07-22,Whoever keeps mailing me their body parts--Please stop,JayGetsHazy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/90vm7d/whoever_keeps_mailing_me_their_body_partsplease/,"The pen was heavy.

One of those expensive Monte Blanc's with a fine gold tip.  The kind you might get from a grandparent for a graduation or something.

The lawyer was real nice about the whole thing.  Paternal even.  Smiling and making soothing noises as he guided me slowly through all the convoluted legalese laid out in the documents in front of me.

*WHEREAS* and *WHEREFORE* 

*PETITIONER* and *RESPONDENT* 

Blah blah blah.

I nodded when appropriate--smiled dumbly in all the right places--and signed and initialed where indicated by rows of cheerful yellow sticky tabs.

A few quick strokes and it was done.  A seamless transition.  Eight years of marriage--eight years of love and laughs and hate and hurt--dissolved with just a little paperwork.

I was Mary Seymour no longer.

""Feels good doesn't it?"" the lawyer asked absently, shuffling the pages into a neat stack on his desk.  ""You walk in here one person and get to leave as some else.  Someone completely new.""

I sobbed quietly in the elevator the whole way down.

Whoever I was now--new or old it didn't matter.  Whoever I was, I'd already decided--before those doors even opened into that smooth empty lobby two floors down--to kill myself when I got home.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

The first gift was waiting on the front stoop when I pulled up to the house that day.  I could see it from the driveway--that unmistakable baby-blue box topped over with a creamy white ribbon.

That too familiar logo

*Tiffany &amp; Co.*

stamped out in delicate dark letting across the lid.

*For Mary, with Love* read the small envelope propped up beside the box.

My first thought was my ex husband.  A late birthday gift or forgotten valentine, maybe.  But Brian wasn't that guy; not the sentimental type.  And besides, he was too busy off being happy with whats-her-name, anyway.

Unlocking the door with one hand, I scooped up the box in the other and shuffled inside.  My plans to kill myself--the wine and pills waiting in the passenger seat of the car--temporarily forgotten.

The box was heavier than it looked--at least a full pound or two.  Slightly bigger than a softball, its contents shifted awkwardly with muffled *thunks* when shaken.

Setting the box down on the kitchen counter, I tore open the envelopes heavy back flap.

The note inside was small.  The stationary expensive.  Rich.  Like a wedding invitation with gilt around the edges.

*Dearest Mary,* it began in a spidery blue slant.

*This living hand, now warm and capable*

*Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold*

*And in the icy silence of the tomb,*

*So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights*

*That then would wish thine own heart dry of blood*

*So in my veins red life might stream again,*

*And thou be conscience-calm'd--see here it is--*

*I hold it towards you.*

*--Your Secret Admirer XOXO*

I frowned and read the note again, incredulously; turned it over in my hand.

No postmark or return address--no hint to the senders identity.

Probably, it was a mistake.  Something left on the wrong doorstep.  Or maybe a prank of some kind--like one of those little joke boxes you bought as a kid.  The ones filled with spring loaded papier-mâché
snakes, or something.

Still, it never really occurred to me *not* to open the box.

The ribbon felt soft and luxurious between my fingers and pulled free with a crisp and pleasing *whisk*.

Grasping the lid I yanked it up, set it on the counter and eagerly peered inside the box.  

Maybe I was expecting a diamond tennis bracelet.  Or maybe a sterling silver cup--something shiny and expensive and beautiful.

But the blood.

Oh, God, there was so much blood.

Rust colored and coppery--a sticky pool soaking through the layers of medical gauze that padded the bottom of the box.

Blood and yellowish-white pus that oozed in sickly scabbing rivulets from the jagged end of…of *something*.  Some bloated mass of pulpy pink flesh all veiny and wrinkled--like a crab or some other strange sea creature--only with five long spindly legs covered across the top in coarse black hair.

It was familiar yet foreign.  Almost like a…like a…

Like a hand.

A fucking human hand.

I started to scream.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

I called the police, of course.

Four wailing cop cars descended on my lawn--red and blue lights strobing--within ten minutes and swarmed the house with ant-like efficiency.

The lead officers name was Judkins.  Or Jenkins, maybe.  He was pleasant enough, I suppose, with a tired face and a doughnut gut.  He met me in the living room, after securing the scene, to take my statement and pepper me with questions.

*Any idea whose Lefty we got out there?*

No.

*Any enemies you know of?  Somebody with a grudge against you or your husband?*

Ex.  And no, none that I know of.

*You haven't seen any suspicious types hanging around the neighborhood or anything?*

No.

*Where was your husband during all this?*

Ex.  You'd have to ask him.

On and on page after page of questions until he finally flipped his notebook closed and leaned back into the sofa with a deep sigh.

""Well, one thing we know.  Someone's a Keats fan.""

""Huh?""

""Our perp.  Your, uh, your secret admirer, there.  Looks like he's a poetry fan.  John Keats, apparently,"" he said with a grunt.

""What does that mean?"" I asked.

He shrugged.  ""Fuck if I know.  'Scuse my French just--never seen anything quite like this, to be honest.  Hands in boxes with love notes.  Jesus.  We're gonna pass it over to the boys in forensics; see if we can lift prints or DNA off the stuff.  The whole nine.""

I nodded vaguely, and wrapped myself further into the couch.

""And what should I do?  You know, in the meantime.""

""Not a thing, Mrs. Seymour,"" said Officer Judkins or Jenkins.  ""Maybe stay with a relative or close friend for a few days?  Give us a chance to look into this thing.""

""I'd rather stay here,"" I told him.

""10-4, ma'am.  I'll pull one or two of the boys for watchdog duty.  Keep a marked unit parked out front for a couple days; keep the news vans back at least.  Here's my card.  You gimmie a call if you can think of anything I might need to know.  We'll follow up.""

And then there were none.

Just me alone with the ghost of the sound of one hand clapping.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

In the morning I went to work.

My boss had called--told me to take the day.  But I was too keyed up to sit home alone.

By 8:30 I was out the door with a wave to the cops parked by the curb.

The office was weirdly subdued for a Wednesday morning.  Everyone spoke with a quiet, forced cheeriness.  Fragile.  Like the way you talk to sick people in a hospital.

""Mary!  Oh my gosh are you okay?  Gil in Accounts Payable told me about what happened.  How awful.""

""I'm fine, really,"" I assured Stephanie--the twenty something blonde intern with tits that had no right to be so perky.  ""Just a bit shaken up.""

She sipped her coffee through a straw.  ""You don't think it was Brian, do you?  Divorce can bring out the worst in people.""

I sidestepped her politely.  ""Hey, can you bring me the contract on the Llewelyn-Davis account?  I wanted to go over the pricing matrix before lunch.  Thanks.""

""Sure,"" said Stephanie.  ""Okay.  Oh, uh, by the way your 10:30 is waiting in your office.""

I froze.  ""Huh?""

""Your 10:30 appointment.""  She spoke politely as if to a slow child.  ""He was a little early but said he didn't mind waiting.  So I let him in.  He said--""

But I was already hurrying off in the opposite direction looking for security.

I didn't have any appointments scheduled for the day.

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

We called Henry--the former college linebacker who patrolled the halls and monitored the security cameras.  He swaggered up to the closed door to my office; hand on his gun belt like he'd seen in the movies.

""Security!""  He rapped his knuckles against the door jamb.  ""Open up, sir.  We have reason to suspect you're trespassing.""

*Silence*

""Sir, we know you're in there!""

*Silence*

""You sure he's in there?""

Stephanie nodded wide eyed.  ""I showed him in maybe fifteen minutes ago.""

The door swung open with a bang and Henry rushed in.

Ugly beige carpet.  A desk and a chair.  Books and papers and my emergency umbrella.

And a cream colored note

*Dearest Mary,*

*How eloquent are eyes!*

*Not the rapt poets frenzied lay*

*When the souls wildest feelings stray*

*Can speak so well as they*

*--Your Secret Admirer XOXO*

taped to the top of a little [blue box](https://imgur.com/a/2EAybNU).

&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

Officer Judkins just left--a small bloody blue eye in a clear plastic sandwich bag.

He wants me to come down to the station.

Whoever keeps mailing me their body parts--please stop.

90ybhf,1,2018-07-22,Service Industry - A boon or a bane?,monkinfarm,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/90ybhf/service_industry_a_boon_or_a_bane/,"India had 26 lakh (2.6 mils.) STEM graduates in the year 2016. This does not make it easy for either the employers or the student to find the perfect fit for a job. Also, I do acknowledge that out of those 26 lakh (2.6 mils.) graduates only a fraction of them are industry ready or employable. Leaving the Comp. Sci. and IT related graduates aside, the jobs in elder (in terms of their commercial existence measured in the number of years) fields such as civil, mechanical, chemical, electrical etc. demands you to have a good amount of hands-on experience right off the bat. However, it is tough to gain any meaningful experience without working full-time (most of the internships are not properly structured to nurture the candidate).

Enter the IT Service Industry (the likes of TCS), the most lucrative (in terms of ROI, which can be negligible at times) of all industries in India as of now. They are doing good for themselves, by mostly exploiting the young graduates. When graduates in elder fields do not get a decent job they mostly end up in one of these companies. Leave aside the very few people who write an actual piece of software from scratch in these places, most of the new graduates end up updating the documents or monkey patch the already existing code to customize an OEM software such as Teamcenter, SAP etc. The companies pay less and expect you to work overtime without wages. But the perks of going on-site and appraisal deter a majority of these graduates to pursue something else. Hence, a vicious circle.

My issue is that these companies are making a lot of money for themselves but they are not making India a sustainable place to do business. Because these companies are dependent on the product of companies from other nations. Also, the graduates are getting into bottomless pits of mediocrity, thus affecting the economy in long run. I just want to open a dialogue about the machinations of the Indian IT service industry and the ways to sustainably improve our economy."
90yoph,0,2018-07-22,What am I doing wrong?,nemo24_7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/90yoph/what_am_i_doing_wrong/,"Hello guys. So I recently ended a contract position as a Software Engineer I had landed back in October 2017. It wasn't a contract to hire, just a contract. My last day was July 6, 2018.

A little background. I graduated in December 2017 with a Bachelors in Computer Science. I had 4 internships as a student. My first one was as a security engineer and the other 3 were either as a software engineer or web developer. I've also freelanced in between jobs. I'm no expert or anything like. I just tried really to get as much experience as possible so I could have the basics down at least. I even started an LLC that I currently freelance under hoping to make things look a bit more official with the clients I deal with.

Starting July 2 I started applying for software engineering positions. I'd say about 80% of the positions I applied to so far have been  Jr. level positions. Every companies out there says things like, ""We don't care what you know or how much you know. Just as long you show some excitement about our company and also express a desire to learn"". Honestly I'm starting to feel like it's a just a bunch of bullshit. But I am definitely bias in my opinion and that's what I am coming to you guys. 

So far I've had 8 interviews. All those interviews were for Jr. positions I applied for. Interviews all went well except for one. During the coding challenge, I got stuck on the logic at some point and it took me forever to figure it out. The feedback I got was that you need more programming experience because you don't know how to use the Math library from Java. I thought it was a bit harsh, but I'll take that L. Although I knew I had I had to use the Math library and which functions exactly, but I wasn't sure how to use to solve the problem at hand. But that's neither here nor there.

So that's 7 left. Of those so far 4 more have gotten back saying more or less the same thing. They've told me, ""We'd like to thank you for you time. We're truly enjoyed getting to know you and thought you were great but we're decided to go with someone who had JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPERIENCE. We definitely want to stay in touch and will reach out another position we think you may be a good fit for opens up.""

The captioned part is what I have a problem with. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? And when I ask for clarification I never get any. If they're as excited as I think they are about me, then why not give me an offer? I am still waiting to hear back from 2 more companies, but I have honestly come to terms with the fact that I won't get an offer and will most likely be given the same feedback.

My next interview is on July 30 and I don't have any motivation to go through their process. I want to do better, but I don't know what I am doing wrong. The most important part of those interviews is the coding challenge. The times where I did everything right and smooth, the company decided to go with someone else and wanted to stay in touch. The one time I had some trouble with a coding challenge, I had that held up against me.

So I guess my question is not so much what am I doing wrong? But how can I potentially do better?"

 * [For everyone else, read wiki.](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/wiki/index/nontargetrecruiting)
 * The most common entry points into major consulting firms (especially MBB) are through undergrad and MBA recruiting.  Entering one of these channels will provide the greatest chance of success for the large majority of career switchers and consultants planning to 'upgrade'.  Experienced hires do happen, but often require a combination of in-demand experience and a meaningful referral.

coming to rutgers, i was undecided and i had no work experience at all bc i never got the chance to work during high school, i just had more important things going on at the time that i had to worry about 

fortunately, i finally declared my major in human resource management during sophomore year so now that i had a major, i knew what kind of internships to look for, my plan was to find an internship in between the summer of my sophomore and junior year but as far as my education goes (since i recently declared the major) i had little to no relevant courses and projects to put under my resume (which could ve been a reason i didnt get accepted to the internships), all i had were intro courses which were too useless to put on there since they were basic so during junior year, i took more diverse and advanced courses in the major since i obv needed to complete the major and so i can add more varied courses that actually looked good and were not just your avg intro courses

after declaring my hr major, i even went as far as triple minoring in labor relations, psychology, and organizational leadership to increase my chances and include that i was also part of douglass residential college for women as a way to promote some kind of networking opportunity with douglass women alum in my field and promote some kind of minority status to perhaps grant me some kind of affirmative action

meanwhile, i decided not to pursue work experience just bc i was worried about the work/college/life balance being extremely difficult considering it wouldnt be like high school so it would be ALOT harder and difficult since it was college however, in order to make up not having work experience, i decided to work a job during the summer and find something to substitute for it that was still useful and advantageous to put on my resume as leadership experience but not as difficult of a commitment to burden on my shoulders either by becoming an executive board member for a rutgers club but under a lower position that did not have as many responsibilities

but still when i applied to summer internships in between the summer of my sophomore and junior year, i still wasnt accepted for any position so i was under the assumption that the reason i did not get accepted was bc my leadership experience perhaps wasnt enough to substitute work experience so i decided to use that summer to find a part time job instead in order to build up my work experience so i could increase the likelihood of getting an internship for the next summer

looking for an entry level part time job was EXTREMELY difficult in itself also bc i never had work experience, i didnt get a job until april 2017, in between the summer of sophomore and junior year, from that time until then, i was getting help from my parents and countless career service appointments to improve my jobless resume in order to increase my chances of getting a part time job thankfully, as i said before, i got one as of april 2017 over at sears who were just as desperate as me to find employees working since its basically a dead company so i had an advantage that helped me build a foundation for it to be easier to find part time work later on, in between april 2017 until now, i have worked 4 part time jobs of all different fields (babysitting, retail, food, customer service) to show that i have been working recently and working alot and that i am a self rounded person

another reason i thought i wasnt accepted to summer internships was bc i applied late considering that i was applying during may instead of the beginning of the year so i made sure to apply for summer internships (between my junior and senior year) during january of this year

i thought it could ve been bc i had limited skills, i only added technical and language skills but now i added more to those skills AND added industry and interpersonal skills too

i thought it could ve been bc i put in my full address on my resume which could be bad bc sometimes employers can make prejudiced or biased judgements about your social class based on where you live (classism) so instead of putting in my full address, i just put in the city i live in

i thought it could ve been bc i used the scarletmail email which did not look as professional as the rutgers alias email so i used my rutgers alias email

i thought it could ve been bc i did not have a linked in or i did but it barely had much on my profile to look at, so i made sure to make it a more thoroughly developed profile by putting basically everything i had in my resume there and any of the additional information linked in asked me put in from the steps i had left until my profile was 100% complete, in addition, i added companies in my interests that are good work opportunities for human resources including the ones that visit the school of management and labor relations career fair AND i have added ALMOST EVERY rutgers student (currently or alum) that has majored in human resources as a way to increase my networking opportunities to land me an internship, lastly, i put my linked in url on my resume

when junior year came around, i was determined to do EVERYTHING i could to get a summer internship between my junior and senior year no matter what, i was so confident to the point that i didnt even think to plan any vacations bc i knew i was gonna be busy on that grind 24/7

i participated in some of the rutgers society of human resource management club meetings last year in my sophomore spring semester but it wasnt until my junior year that i regularly went to the meetings and events and became a member, i also became a member for society of human resource management, and recently, i became a member for worldatwork, an organization dedicated to certifying compensation and benefits professionals in human resources; lastly, i participated in 2 human resource case competitions so all of those organizations and case competitions were included in my resume

rn, i am pursuing a certification in associate professional of human resources and trying to find any other affordable certification programs to pursue in order to improve my chances

btw, i have been looking for internships on career shift, linked in, handshake, the school of management and labor relations mailing list, ihirehr.com, and from asking my friends majoring in human resources too, etc

this whole conquest of trying to get an internship by improving my resume has been an ongoing battle for me that i ve sought help by career services multiple times for too and still in the process of regularly visiting; i honestly dont know what to do anymore bc i felt like i ve basically tried and done EVERYTHING, im literally on the verge of giving up, i feel like no matter how much i do, apparently im not good enough to get one considering my applications get rejected due to there being “better” candidates and mind you, i already have some sort of mild depression of not being good enough so for this to keep occuring just worsens it,i just feel like an insecure worthless piece of shit that will never amount to anything in the real world, the feeling discourages me from wanting to apply for ANY internships to the point that i dont care about internships anymore bc all i see them doing is negatively crushing me and my self-esteem for the worst when every single one of my application gets rejected

let me tell you something, i know ppl who havent even worked TWICE as hard as me that have been able to get internships (who never got involved in extracurriculars associated to their major or have any certifications or participated in case competitions or double majored or double minored or not members of any professional organizations or have a linked in) all bc they either know the right ppl or just got fucking lucky somehow, meanwhile, here i am still working a shitty minimum wage part time job scrubbing fucking toilets while those ppl are out there getting internships from NOTHING effortlessly, its almost as if im not privileged enough to have the same opportunities as them even tho i worked alot more and worked harder for those opportunities, as if all this effort i ve put into ever since going to college has gone to shit and doesnt even make a difference anymore, im only wasting my time like i might as well give away my fucking blood and organs away to get an internship at this point if i still even care anymore…."

Sorry for the cliche post, but i have been really worried about getting an internship next year. I go to a well ranked state school for CS. So my question is what should I be doing? I keep hearing about doing personal projects, but whenever I try to start something, it feels like I have no idea what I'm doing. Nothing I've learned in school really helps with making meaningful projects.

On my resume I have put the projects that I did for my classes and tried explaining them, but I feel this is inadequate.

I just feel like I dont know where I should be going with anything. I've been recently trying to learn to make basic alexa skills, but even this is overwhelming to me to an extent. All ive learned at school is programming in Java, C, Data structures and Discrete math. It just feels like my skills wont land me an internship for Summer 2019, when Ill be a rising senior.

Please critique my resume this would be very helpful.

912snr,9,2018-07-22,Getting a disapointed feeling about my current hourly development job... Wondering if my Resume shows I am ready for more,Death_AllHisFriends,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/912snr/getting_a_disapointed_feeling_about_my_current/,"https://i.imgur.com/FqyVY3m.png

Looking at my resume, would you think I am qualified to be working a salaried web developer position now rather than an hourly wage? I am in the process of developing my portfolio... I didn't know if I was going into webdev so it was never created before I got my current position....

I graduated college this May and took a Web Developer Internship, however, it's only $15/hr. After the offer came, they mentioned the rate of pay and I was very shocked, but I took it because that's what I wanted to do, rather that SQL/Data Analytics/Excel SpreadSheeting/Etc due to my degree, which offered many avenues...

Got out of College in three years, and graduating with some friends in the same degree (not same webdev path) and they also got internships, but was disappointed when I was getting Walmart pay and they weren't.

---

I guess a SMALL part is jealousy because both did the same degree, and I worked really hard and got a decent GPA while they struggled through getting Cs... not to mention the senior year long app development project that I did 90% and now I'm the butt of the joke for having a $15/hr internship, and they are $25.

**Not to mention that apparently my internship is completely different than theirs....**

Foremost, the big thing I do is I'm working on developing a web framework for their developers to use, and its their next big things they want....

- **I work the full 8hr day, there isn't any time where I can just ""relax and not do anything because I'm an intern which is what I expected and WANTED. But without benefits and no holiday pay, the ""day off"" for 4th sucked because of it**"" ..... *on the flip side apparently they aren't doing anything, they do small little tasks here and there but sometimes they have half the day to literally sit around, or leave early and get paid*

- **I don't have interaction with anyone. My boss knows what I'm working on but not really at all. I have a mentor that tells me ideas for what he thinks would be nice for the framework, but that's it. Its completely independent from anyone else. I don't feel a part of the company at all.** .... *on the flip side, their interaction seems like a whole family, they have other interns, but even their coworkers/boss go out for lunches, ball games and have a community and most importantly... know who they re*

- **the Internship isn't really even that because it is stated that I will be working ""for at least 6 months and then looked to role into FT job""** .... *on the flip side, they have the traditional 3 months + offer, which they received.*

- **Lastly, idk how I'm doing since I have no interaction with my bosses, so no status updates or meetings to gauge progress as a typical intern. I know everything I'm doing because I'm learning it on my own. No one is saying ""okay we need to do x y z, do you need to do a b c"" it is all me on my own figuring things out. I had to do a lot of research because i am on this project myself really, which helps me learn more stuff**


---

TLDR: Long story short, I don't want to continue to wait for the half-year mark to get the FT offer, so I am going to start applying elsewhere and then talk 1v1 with my boss and tell them that I'm ready... if they say no then I will go elsewhere (if i have another offer)

From what I have heard as long as you don’t go to the top 10 CS schools then it really doesn’t matter where you go. I feel like FIU has better companies around to intern such as Ultimate Software and Citrix, UCF has Lockheed Martin and defense contractors of course.  Also, I have crashed 2 FIU career fairs and noticed some big names such as google, facebook, MS, and amazon having info sessions and actively recruiting(never been to UCF).

913r1h,5,2018-07-22,Voice in the water,emilysparkling,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/913r1h/voice_in_the_water/,"I was so excited for this summer to start. I’d just gotten my bachelors of science diploma in electronics engineering, my parents were leaving for they vacation to our summer house for full three weeks and I was about to start an amazing internship that could even change into an amazing first job. 

To be completely honest, the last few years weren’t the very best for me. Sure, I had my academic results, a few friends, loving parents, but I couldn’t help but feel like I didn’t belong, was out of my depth. The idea of writing my thesis was looming over my heads for months.

But after getting it all done, I’ve finally felt myself get back to who I used to be before this depressive slump.

And so, soon after my summer holiday had started, my parents packed their suitcases, threw them into the car trunk and rode off, waving me and our cat goodbye. A few days later I woke up at 5am, ate a good hearty, slow breakfast in bed and got ready for my first day of the internship. I’m the only girl programmer there, but everyone was so so nice! I was quite worried I might not fit in, or just not be good enough, the worry that follows me everywhere really, but the atmosphere was relaxed and the fact that the whole place is basically placed in the middle of a forest definitely helped me calm my nerves. It’s crazy how this internship just fell into my hands. It’s a military research institute too, so just imagine how cool it will look on my CV! I just wish I could share more about my time there with my friends, because it’s really something, but you know. It’s military. It’s classified. Completely understandable.

All I want to say by that is, I’ve been having a time of my life. Finally feeling like might not be that useless and my future might be pretty awesome! Waking up so early and working in summer heat was quite tiring though. I wasn’t used to starting my day so early as I lived my student days (or should I say nights) as a night owl. That’s why when it first started I just chalked it up to being sleep deprived.

I was just back home from work and preparing my dinner. The flush in my toilet is kinda broken and if I push it in the wrong spot it just stays stuck there and the water just keeps on running. My parents usually are always there if I don’t notice it to tell me off about wasting water, but now they are on vacation and sometimes I just forget about it, like I did that time. 

I was walking past the bathroom, from my room to the kitchen, carrying a stack of dishes in a dire need of washing, as I heard the water trickling down the toilet. I’d forgotten again. Damn. My ears caught a quiet murmur too, but I didn’t pay it much attention and just pressed the flush again and it unblocked itself, stopping the water and went on with the food preparations. 

That night I got in my bed unrealistically early for me. I’ve been trying to get my body used to a different rhythm and it required dedication. I was dead tired, so I actually had fallen asleep with no problem, almost as soon as I turned off the lights. When I woke up it was still completely dark outside. I grabbed my phone to check the hour and it was just about 4am. Feeling terribly groggy, I lay on my bed with eyes closed, trying to figure out what wake me up. And so I slowly realised the water was flowing again. Did I left this like that for the whole night? I groaned, getting up, thinking about the water bill and my parents future reaction. Trying to avoid stepping on my cat, who realised might just get a chance for early breakfast was running around me with her tail straight up, I walked to the bathroom. And, of course, the flush button was stuck. This time, however, the murmur I heard along the water running, started to form into works. Whispered, rushed words, like someone was trying to tell you some big secret without anyone else hearing it. I couldn’t make much sense of it though. All the words blended together with each other and the water. At first, I couldn’t zero in on where those whispers were coming from, so I push the flush button, hoping that would help me hear them better. All the sounds stopped all together though. I stood there, in my bathroom, in erie 4am silence and a shiver run down my spine. No reason to get spooked, I told myself and soon my cat’s desperate meows brought me back to reality. I live in a flat. Obviously, neighbours voices can carry through the pipes. Later that day I joked with my coworkers about my incident with a “haunted toilet”.

This time, before going to sleep I made sure the flush button wasn’t stuck. Still, middle of the night, I woke up covered in sweat to the familiar sound. My head was pounding from the hot weather and lack of sleep and I really didn’t feel like dealing with a stupid faulty toilet. I got up quickly, stomped to the bathroom, pushed the flush button, grabbed a glass of water and painkillers on my way back to my bed. I really hoped I could get a few more hours of sleep in, but I just layed there watching the sun rise and feeling my anxiety skyrocket. Situations like this always made me so anxious. The fear that I broke something, messed up, surely disappointed my parents somehow. All of those thoughts kept on just building up inside my head, not letting me go back to sleep, till it was time to get up and I knew I just couldn’t deal with work today. I called my boss, apologizing profusely for not being able to come to work today.  I said I thought I caught some bad stomach bug. He seemed very understanding and told me not to worry and get better. I felt some of the weight lift off my chest. I waited another hour and called my parents to tell them about the stupid flush. My mom, as well, told me not to worry, knowing how anxious I can get, and said she’ll call someone to come by today and fix the thing. She laughed saying it should’ve been done a long time ago and I wished I could be as relaxed as she is. 

The repair man came in before noon and was done with the repairs in what seems like minutes. He didn’t even try small talk me, so I just sat in the kitchen with a big mug of black coffee and as he left I felt my life getting back on the right tracks again. As usual, I was also starting to feel embarrassed for how big of a deal I made it. I made a promise to myself to not let this little accident ruin my day completely. My head was still hurting a bit, but definitely not as much as when I woke up at night. 

I cleaned up the house a bit, took out the trash, went grocery shopping. I was thinking about maybe calling a friend to hangout or something, but by the time afternoon rolled around I was beyond tired. It was too early to go to sleep, even if I had to wake up at 5am the next day, but my eyelids were so heavy and sandy I just couldn’t help myself and decided to get a nap. A short one. An hour max. I set up an alarm and collapsed onto my bed.

When I woke up my room was completely dark. And water was running somewhere louder than ever. At first I thought I was just caught up in some kind of a nightmare, but soon I realised it was just rain, pouring outside my window, which I left wide open during the day. For a second my room lit up with blinding light from a lightning. Soon the thunder came. I love storms in the summer so much it actually put a smile on my face. There’s something so relaxing about the pure force of nature and the rain washing away anything and everything. I sat in my bed for a while, enjoying the moment and decided to go for a precaution pee trip before going back to sleep. The very moment I opened my bedroom door to the corridor the atmosphere shifted. Instead of the fresh scent of rain, my nostrils were filled with a terrible stench I couldn’t exactly pinpoint, reminding me vaguely of rotten meat mixed with medicinal alcohol. Sounds of the storm outside drowned in the frantic whispers I heard before, much louder now than ever. I think my heart skipped a beat. My stomach tensed and my whole body froze. Even if I could make out any words out of what I was hearing, I don’t think I would, as reality seemed to be speeding away from me. I forced few deep breaths. Those whispers were not the only sounds coming from my bathroom. Those whispers were echoing in a loud stream of water. 

I ran into the bathroom and, still in shock,  turned off the tap. And then the shower. 

Collapsed on the bathroom floor, the only sound I was left with was just the storm outside again. I breathed in the disgusting smell one more time and threw up. I think I must’ve passed out, because the next thing I remember is waking up on the cold tiles, my back hurting, with an acidic taste in my mouth. 

I’m not sure what to do. I’m pretty sure I’m not crazy, but I’m also pretty sure I must be, because what else would be the explanation? I have to go to work tomorrow, but the only thing I want to do is stay in bed and cry a bit. I want to stay in bed, but I don’t want to stay in my flat at all.

I was so excited for this summer to start."

At this point exposure would be worth quite a bit.,cieapink,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/916ij7/im_tired_of_doing_art_for_free_cause_we_are/,"So I do art. I’m currently going to a college specializing in art. For freshman year they teach us the basics so I have an understanding of most arts to a degree. So I can technically make logos from graphic design and illustration. Personally I do illustrations for fun as a me thing I’m not going to major in it . My major is industrial design. But that doesn’t stop my family ! Especially my aunt she’s in the director business! She comes to me to make logos and now decks. I did my first logo for her in high school because my dad said I should , because we are family, even tho I told both of them “hey I never was really taught how to do this well “ that was the start of it . I really wish I didn’t do it , because years later on my summer vacation I get an email from my aunt “asking me “ to re fucking design there logo basically to mimic some one else’s that is more successful and already has trailers for the documentary.  I have to do it cause it’s family and the request already went through my dad so I had to do it. During that week my mother wanted to travel so we did , however I couldn’t take a break I had to work on redesigning the logo . So I had to stay in the hotel working on it editing it multiple times I think I went through 5 +renditions and had to create two diff versions so one could fit in the icon spot while the other in the banner. She couldn’t even tell me the right detail, like I asked what font should be used first thing . No answer then after the 3rd rendition she made a big fucking deal about the font but gave me the wrong font name . So I some how managed to find the right one . I thought I was done. I was for a while . Till recently. I got an email wanting me to make her a deck for selling a movie concept . The examples she gave me were basically collages and photos , which seemed okay . My dad kinda already accepted the task so I had to work on it . But I really don’t want to , she decided to call and talk to me about the whole concept of it all and basically I hated it . I didn’t say that because I would be punished for being rude . Her movie concept is basically just making the “millennial generation “ villains . No motivation no reason for it just cause they are millennial they are bad . The main character is middle aged . She got upset at me for my tone saying I should be happy to work on the project !  I got a bit upset and said my emotions don’t effect my work okay . And then berated me about not having a job.  Like really, I’m doing all this fucking work for you but you have the nerve to fucking berate me about this every single time . Alright so I’m a college student this is my first summer in college , I’m fully aware I’m going to need a job and I will get one however this is my last year to be free in any sense of the word so give me a fucking break for not wanting to be paid min wage for a job in an area I don’t want . I have the rest of my fucking life to work I’m already starting a job at uni so calm the fuck down .  Anyway I say to her I’ll have something for her by the next day or so . And she has the nerve to respond with well quality comes first so maybe take longer .And ugh , sure just  because you work on something longer totally means it will be better . I have learned from my college one thing is that time necessarily doesn’t translate to quality so , I’m telling you with the time provided I’ll have something that will be of quality so fucking calm your tits . I put it off a bit because I really don’t want to work on the idea at all , she sent me another email with vague descriptions of what she wants in each fucking image . And if I was making a collage fine she provided me the photos but no . She wants me to hand draw it. In the emails she said to animate . Animate at least for me is way harder than drawing . I’m still trying to learn the basics of animating I haven’t got much farther than the bouncing ball w/ tail. To put it simple I currently can’t really animate at all . But her email say she wants animated parts on a still image and object . Which is also kinda a tacky from my perspective to have one moving on a object that should be moving but is stationary . I tell my parents about the stupid workload I’ve been assigned and my mom even tho she doesn’t know much about art and animating say hold up animating ?! She has a fare grasp on how it’s not really easy . My dad then covers for my aunt saying oh no not really animating , still drawings will work just you have to draw them . Okay but I’m both email and on call she said animate . She as an adult in the director field who has probs seen tons of animated films should know the difference between animate and draw . But okay a mistake . I just draw what she says and It took me about 6-7 hrs overall  to do 3 of them I emailed it back to her at a odd hrs so I wouldn’t have to hear back from her and could sleep and do stuff I want to do.  For some reason she decides to respond bright and early the next day . I put off on reading the emails cause nothing good ever comes from them when they are from her. After having a okay day I finally check them at night. So apparently my drawings are fine but they need alterations. I didn’t make the drawing of a character look enough like the actress she want but probs won’t get for the role.  I need to make them “prettier “ . And change the position that you previously said could be any position. Also I fucking got a reference pick of the actress desired and stared and fucking digitally painted her face  , since the pose you wanted was fucking panicked I luckily came across a role where the actress was playing a panicked character and drew directly from it . So it fucking looks like her , but the expression isn’t pretty. Well panicked doesn’t look good on anyone’s face but you said that’s the fucking expression you wanted. Anyway I have to go redo it all at some point not right now tho I’m done for a bit , no motivation for it . The thing is if I got paid for anything this would be different worth my time . But I’m not . Apparently, I’m not good enough to be paid but not quite bad enough to not be asked to do it . Instead of payment between projects I been having to do she will send me all these fucking scholarship. I fill some of them out cause I have to , being a student and all and college being the price it is . But realistically I’m honestly not going to win the lottery system with a written component, sorry I meant scholarship. And I’m just tired of all this I have skill sets that I rather be learning. Like programming, just got into that recently and I enjoy it it takes time tho so I spend a lot of work into it , but I can’t put as much as I want because of all the projects and essay my aunt has been bothering with. I honestly can’t stand her anymore she does this with no regard , even my dad and brother deal with it to a degree . She decides to do a family event , my dad is a hobby photographer has all the equipment and studied a bit for fun . Guess what he has to do at ever event she plans take photos touch them up and send them out. No money in it . She even got my brother who had a small hobby of video editing and mixing to create a long ass video for events, and my cousin who talented and enough to get into his dream school for music , to play his instrument at the event just cause,  and me well at first I thought I was free . But nope the morning of the event she tells me to make a fucking logo design for a shirt in less than an hr . Like what the hell.  I do all this shit for her cause I have to we are family , my dad makes sure of that much. But honestly each day I do shit for her the more I can’t stand her I started to ignore text messages from her avoiding to call her etc. Cause every time I do it just gets worst . And she wants me to do an internship for her . Honestly I don’t think I can do it , I don’t really want to do it. If I end up having to I’m not living with her I can’t deal with this constantly. And the thing is she has never talked to me or communicated with me to this extent till now . Before college she only talked to me occasionally, and never called I only talked to her when my dad  put her on speaker . I feel like I’m being used , but can’t do anything about it . I’m just really fucking done , I’ve been holding it in for a while but I’m just sick of it."

One semester was enough for me to be like ""I'm so done with this."" Coming out of my first year of college, I kept my CompTIA a+ Guide to Hardware textbook and decided to go on with my journey with becoming a PC Technician. However, college dropout never sounds good. Will this affect my job search?  


2) I live in North Carolina, where 99% of the job market is factories and business owning (and Chick-Fil-A). Finding an internship is nigh impossible for me. What online opportunities do I have for gaining experience in my field.

3) I am broke. I'm currently working part time for 8.50 an hour. These exams cost more than my phone did. Any way to cheapen the blow?  


4)  Once I pass (and I will), what should I look for as a job? Help Desk? Technician? IT? What would get me to a point where I can grow in my field and become a senior tech or something of the sort?"

Rising college junior here with a major in Statistics and Quantitative Modeling at a business school in NYC. The reason I chose this major was primarily due to the fact the courses offered are the closest I can get to a computer science curriculum. 

Aside from that, as far as experience goes. I have worked in food retail for the past 2.5 years to fully pay off tuition while attending school. A couple months ago, I quit to focus more on my studies in school and work on some extracurricular stuff such as attending hackathons, tech focused networking events, and work on one or two projects. Throughout this summer, I have been trying to complete one or two problems a day on Hackerrank, which is kind of fun. 

**Some of my side projects (prepared to be unimpressed):**

*ScheduleSnap App-* a user takes a photo of any work schedule, event flyer, or banner and its contents would automatically be inputted into a user's Google calendar. (Built using Android Studio, Google Cloud Vision API + Calendar API)

*Stroop Effect App-* Psychology experiment into an app form where a user clicks on the color of the word and not the name of the word. (Built using Android Studio) 

**Questions:**

1. With only experience in food retail, is it necessary to input into resume to apply for software development internships? 
2. From an employer's standpoint, would they care if I list relevant course work such as business statistics, C++ intro class, and, et cetera? 
3. Regarding interviews. I mostly code in Python because I feel comfortable with its syntax. In white board interviews, do most employers strictly advise using other high level languages such as C++ or Java? 
4. As far as inputting hard skills. To what level of competence do you have to demonstrate to list a particular language, framework, or tool on your resume? 
5. Personal question. Those who have experience in working in tech industry, despite of how many years you have. How often do you encounter imposter syndrome? (I certainly feel it all the time, but I just kick it to the side and remain confident.)

All criticisms, encouragements, advice, flaming and/or roasting are welcome. 

Thank you. "

I frequent this sub quite a bit and have picked up some great advice on here. I've been a college student pursuing a Bachelors in Information Technology. For the past two years I've been working at a company as an intern in the IT department. There was a good amount of free-time and flexibility on my projects as long as I got them done. With that free-time I specialized in AWS Solutions Architecture. I'm scheduled to get the associates certificate in a week. My company has officially sent me an offer for a Cloud Engineer role which I'll be accepting. Some projects/skills that I think helped me get this job which might be valuable insight for others:

First thing first, I'm a programmer. Since it is a small company I do have the flexibility to use a wide variety of languages for any projects I encounter. What I think I'm able to do well is find projects, pitch them and then go through the entirety of the SDLC guaranteeing their success. 

My favorite language is C# and have done some high level functionalities in a few of the applications I've created like making it asynchronous so it could retrieve hundreds of thousands of data-points in less than 30 seconds. 

In regards to AWS projects:

Reduced our S3 storage costs: our S3 storage cost was going up by an insane rate every month. I ended up fine tuning the lifecycle policies for proper glacier transfers and then created a linux crontab script that could delete objects of certain filetype by a specified date range. It slashed our budget by 67%.

Learned cloudformation and recreated our production architectures in CFN templates. 

Automated our AMI &amp; Snapshotting of production instances through Lambda.

Created a replicable high availability double stack environment that was multi-regioned and had a cluster service built in.

All in all, I'm quite happy with this news and will gladly answer any questions you guys have. Best of luck!"

I've been in and out of community college since 2016 attempting to earn my associates in CS. Finances became an issue so have been involved in 2 short term (6 month) paid internships, one as a Help Desk technician, and currently one as a Regression Tester at a network consulting company. The testing internship is coming to an end soon and due to company restructuring (maybe?) I am not getting converted to an employee. My plan was to go back to school full time after this and finish up my associates, maybe with a little part time job hunting on the side, but focusing on the degree. Recently I've been interviewing for a Backup Admin position. It was a position that I felt was a ilttle bit above what my resume would portray me as but I was confident that I could do it. The staff seemed a lot more interested in me than I ever expected. It is a great position, the pay is nice, and while challenging I feel like I can handle the responsability. My only concern is I feel like I will continue getting these positions and even possibly move up in these positions without any sort of degree. The way it feels like in my head is that I am climbing a ladder, but I am getting too high without the saftey net of a degree. I also feel like there are fundamentals that I am loosing out on trying to pick up everything on the job as opposed to a structured classroom environment. During those intermships I attempted to continue schooling through my school's online credit awarding courses, but while I did earn the credits, I really feel like I did not absorb what I needed to as well as if it were in a classroom. I am confident in my skills and my resume looks pretty good for someone without an associates but I am still unsure. 

TLDR: Would like to attend school full time to finish degree, interesting job opportunity comming up in its place. Unsure which is better career move."

Im currently a rising sophomore and am interning at a start up in my home city. I had a tough time finding any oppertunities during the spring and probably sent 50+ apps and got few interviews in total. I did get some offers but only one of them was full time and in person, the rest were more sketchy remote internships.

I found my current position really late in June. It turns out my current position is one of the best oppertunities i could have got but I think I simply got it cause I applied everywhere I could and got an easy technical question. 

I don't want the recruiting season for next summer to turn out the same. I would like to go for some Big Ns and I think I have a decent resume but I am still afraid of not getting any interviews due to the fact that I go to school with a very small CS program, despite it being a well renowned generally. 

What are some important steps one can take other than just practicing leetcode or CTCI to make sure interviews come in. Should I reach out to recruiters on linkedin? We dont have that many alum in CS due to it being a such a small program. 

Any advice would help. Thank you!

Edit: Also for those of you that went to schools like mine, what steps did you take to compete with students from schools like Stanford and CMU with top CS programs?

Me: 24 years old, working as a full-time software developer since January 2017. I had two internships before that, and I have a B.S. in Computer Science. I have experience in what seem to be recruiter-friendly technologies, based the searching I've done so far (Javascript and its various flavors, AWS, etc)

Currently working in New England but my girlfriend and I are moving to Portland, OR in September (she's attending grad school there). I'm actively applying to new jobs in that area and I'm currently in the interview process with two companies. However, here's my question: suppose I get passed on by these companies, and September rolls around and I still haven't found a job yet. Is it crazy to quit my current job anyway and move out there before I've locked something down? Has anyone here tried this before and lived to tell the tale? 

Here's what I can see as the Pros and Cons of doing this: 

Pros: 

- More readily available to interview onsite
- Won't be denied interviews just on the basis of having to relocate 
- I can use a technical recruiting firm to find temp/contract jobs while looking for a full time position
- My girlfriend and I can move at the same time, which saves time/money and is more enjoyable 
- I have a few months of runway in terms of cash before I get really desperate. If I got *really* desperate I could sell my car, which itself is worth about $7,000, and in the city I could live without it. 

Cons: 

- I don't have career contacts on the West Coast yet, so applying may be more difficult than expected
- If I somehow can't find a job before my cash dries up, I'll have to give up and go live in my parents' basement back on the East Coast. 


I've been going back and forth about this in my head so I'd like to hear some outside opinions. Thanks!"

I believe this might be unhealthy for me but I really want to get an internship by at least my sophomore summer and every year there after (preferably starting post-freshman summer) and since I'm not going to a top school (University of Kentucky) it makes me think that what I learn my first year just won't be enough to get me a job

I am taking to programming classes this year but I think they'll mostly be covering stuff I already know (AP Computer Science Principles and Into to Programming in Java which is a dual-credit course, hoping to make some apps with that class actually!) And I've also completed the first 3rd of CS50x to see what a college class is like but I don't really have the time to finish it right now with work and school

I know many, many students want to attend UW Seattle for it's very well regarded CSE program. In fact, it is the most popular major. And of course due to the limited number of seats available, it is highly selective weeding out many potentially great computer scientists. The school is also aware of this problem and hopes to address it at least in part with the new building.  That being said, let's talk a bit about the tangible and intangible ***differences*** between these schools for students and recent grads.

First of all there are the obvious differences:

* UW Seattle's reputation and prestige
* With that reputation only certain things are available to these grads such as:
   * Special career fairs where sateltite campus students are not invited
   * PNW company recognition/perception that these grads are the best and brightest
   * Recognition by other universities for grad school admission
* Undergraduate research opportinities
* Breadth of courses offered
* Smaller campus and class sizes at Bothell
* The degrees have different names

Now to the more interesting questions. How about the actual differences in the programs themselves?

* Are the courses themselves ***night and day*** different? By different I mean in terms of breadth, depth, quality (hardest to quantify)?
* How about rigor? Is one inherently less difficult overall?
* Does the more competitive nature of UW Seattle require more of the student? Maybe curves affect performance/GPA?
* Research available even if more limited at Bothell?
* Internships. I've heard UWB has some good internship opportunties with local companies even though a smaller campus.

Lastly, and possibly most importantly, how will any of these differences matter once a graduate enters the workforce? In other words, once on the job and given an opportunity to perform, how much of any of the above will really matter in the end? Will the UWB graduate be any less prepared or handicapped in anyway beyond initial perceived prestige of the larger campus? That is assuming he/she does the same things while in college such as relevant industry work/internships in addition to classes.

I'll cavaeat this here with my own 'bias' as a senior tech lead for a Fortune 500 tech company. In our case we look much more at the individual and what they have accomplished professionally including internships than anything else including prestige of a school. In addition to that my son is considering both programs.

Thank you for your thoughts on this.

For some reason, Python works fine.... so here I am sitting with Python Anaconda not really knowing what to do.

So here are my very general noob questions/issues I have run into on Day 1 as a total newcomer forced to used Python!

So as an example my data is like

[This... hope the image is OK](https://imgur.com/a/t9MOyS9)

My problems

1. The Unnamed columns go on for a long time.... any idea how to truncate past project 3?
2. I want to do a regression, which means I need to assign 1s or 0s to every qualitative variable. The problem is I don't really get how to do this for something like Color? So for example if I assign Red = 1 and Blue = 0 how will I get a variable that shows a coestimate of Blue? Or Green for that matter? Do I just add more rows?
3. All the videos I watch about linear regression are incredibly simple. I don't want to just do the regression, but know the significance of each variable, see how the coestimate and significance of each variable changes as I regress one, two three different variables on y, see if various statistical assumptions are satisfied(see if x is correlated with the error term for example). Does anyone know of a comprehensive guide for a regression in Python that goes over this? 

Hope this isn't too much.. .would appreciate an answer to one or any of my questions! and thank you."

I'm fine with working for free, actually scratch that, I would pay someone to let me intern at their company, that's desperate I am for work experience. I don't mind getting assigned with grunt work and the such, as long as I'm able to taste a bit of that network security, haha. 

On a side note, if any of you have any advice for me, I'll be really grateful! I feel like the classes that I'm taking right now in college aren't teaching me the things I need to know in the field (like, I had to teach myself security+ from scratch). I'm trying to teach myself through certificates and hopefully work experience! Thank you for reading, cheers!"

91cau4,29,2018-07-23,"Mark, The Intern",sunpalm,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/91cau4/mark_the_intern/,"Hello everyone, 

I’m writing to you because I’ve tried my best to push certain memories out of my mind – and since you’re reading this, it goes without saying that all attempts have been unsuccessful. I thought maybe focusing these thoughts into prose could do the trick. And the reason I’m writing to an audience of internet strangers is because… well, I don’t really have anyone else. On the web, I’m probably considered geriatric but still I’ve somehow managed to find this forum through a series of Google searches. The progression of which will unfold as my story does. Although able to navigate this site, I’m still not entirely sure I’m understanding this place – it seems like an e-campfire where contributors tell stories that are terrifying and sometimes hard to believe. Most frightening of all, the policies set in place on only reporting the truth here seem strict. So, I’ve taken everything at face value &amp; am reaching out in case anyone has advice for me. I have a feeling even the… hopefully uniqueness of my situation will be received better here than any other sites I frequent.  

A little about me, probably not altogether important, but it’s been a long time since I’ve had anyone to share myself with:  I’m 62 years old, single, female, mostly happy. Sometimes unbearably so, yet sometimes life’s weight becomes too heavy and I sleep until I’m ready to face the world again. I think it’s a 3rd act of life type of sadness, and if I had close friends I’m sure they would relate with similar feelings. I tend not to dwell on it. I enjoy travel, HGTV, and a full-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon. Lucky for me, I happen to have a career that aligns with those interests - business trips take me all across the US, and every hotel I stay at has cable &amp; room service. There’s nothing better after a long day of client meetings than going back to a freshly made King bed and the soft flicker of House Hunters illuminating the room as I dizzy myself with a few glasses of red. 

At this point it feels like I’m writing a depressing (yet the most honest rendition I’ve ever typed) online dating profile… and that ship has definitely sailed… so I’ll get into the real reason I’m here. The story. Here goes. 

[A sidenote: I’ve noticed that many of the submissions here are written beautifully. I’m trying my best to spice it up for readers’ sake, but generally I write emails – not novels. Please suspend judgement, and I’ll try not to put you to sleep.]

...

It was the beginning of June when our company realized we forgot to hire a summer intern. We’re not a large company, just 25 people working out of our New York office, so this particular responsibility of managing an intern doesn’t fall on any one-person. I seemed to be the least frantic person in the office, so I stepped up and said I would reach out to the local Universities. At this point, any go-getter already had their summer internship lined up. So I figured we’d get someone from the B, maybe C-Squad. But instead, we got Mark. 

Mark was a handsome looking junior from The New School, just turned 21 years old, and had a few years of administrative experience from summer jobs back in Connecticut. Perfect. We weren’t really looking for someone specialized, but rather for someone competent enough to make sure our proposal decks were printed before meetings, someone reliable enough to show up first and leave last while also having the youthful energy to do a 3rd coffee run when the conference room was beginning to look like a heap of exhausted, overgrown toddlers. Pathetic, I know. But we all do work really hard - we just get cranky when our caffeine levels dip. Mark was going to be the Energizer Bunny to our aging Duracells. 

June and most of July went by uneventfully. In mid-July, work brought me to Palm Springs, which was a roasting 115 degrees some days. But the wine was good &amp; I have a nice expense account. California, as you know, is 3 hours behind New York. And this is where Mark started slipping up a bit. He just couldn’t get the hang of time zones. I’d receive panicky emails from him, wondering why I haven’t joined our daily 9:00AM. Except he’d send it at 3:00AM. As if he was 3 hours behind me instead of the other way around. I explained this to him two days in a row, but on the 3rd day he called my hotel phone at 2:55AM to warn me the call was starting soon.

I shouldn’t have been so harsh, but the sulfates in red wine really do start affecting you more the older you get. With an aching head, I explained again what time it was in California &amp; what time it was in New York. He took it in stride, again. He even apologized after my not-so-calm explanation. I guess what he lacked in Time Zone Knowledge, he made up for in manners.  

On day 4 – I got a text at 3:05AM:

“I know it’s not time for our Daily, but I just wanted to say ‘good sleeping’ !”

I didn’t respond. What was that supposed to mean, “good sleeping”? I took to the internet, but found it wasn’t slang (I’ve become proficient in searching Urban Dictionary after I found out “dab” has several meanings now).

When I signed in online that morning, I had a forwarded email from Mark. 2 tickets to “Sleep No More” for when I arrived back in New York. If you’re unfamiliar with the show, it’s an experiential theater that’s kind of scary/kind of thrilling… and way too expensive for a college student to just off-handedly buy for their superior. But, I dryly laughed the tickets off. Mark thought we had some sort of inside joke now about sleep. Great, my first inside joke in years and it was with the intern.  

The emails didn’t stop there though. I received a few more odd calendar invites from Mark – just strange enough to make me audibly say “huh” and decline. It wasn’t until I returned home on Friday that I started to receive correspondence at all hours of the day &amp; night. I was proud at his commitment to our crazy hours, but nervous he was in for a major burn-out. What was he doing in the office over the weekend? Nothing work related, that’s for sure - Mark shared New Yorker articles about caffeine addiction, sent YouTube links to lullabies, even texted me little videos. Most clips were taken from shows like Flip or Flop &amp; Fixer Upper – all scenes highlighting bedroom renovations. I know my love of HGTV is well-known around the office, but this was really toeing the line of inappropriate behavior. 

Turns out, Mark went further than just toeing the line. He fully blew past it on Sunday. I had hundreds of emails. Hundreds! Here’s a small sample of the subject lines:

Timezone in Californ ia

Timezone now = Never st op never sleep

The “Help” emails go on for several pages in my inbox, thankfully stopping when he must’ve maxed out my capacity... I didn’t read them all, but the ones that I did just had garbled nonsense in the body, if anything at all. 

It was well beyond weird. This poor kid was having a serious mental breakdown via email. But, selfishly – all I was thinking was that I’d had enough. He needed to go - for both his and my own sanity. Not wanting to risk an HR violation, I ignored his messages instead of telling him off. It could wait until Monday. 

I wish I hadn’t waited. 

Our office was locked when I arrived on Monday. The sign on the door told me all I needed to know. I’m sorry to disappoint, but there’s no big mystery in this story like most I’ve read here. I know what happened to Mark. I guess the real reason I’m sharing this with you, reaching out to anyone who wants to listen…  because now it’s me who can’t sleep. 

Instead, every time I close my eyes all I can see is that bright yellow sign.

“BUILDING CLOSED – CARBON MONOXIDE – AREA REQURIES PROPER VENTILATION”.

We’re not a large company, just 25 people working out of our New York office, so this particular responsibility of managing an intern doesn’t fall on any one-person… right?

I am currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Engineering. I am trying to make some edits on my resume to prepare for the upcoming summer 2019 internship positions (just getting started early). I transferred from a community college with a ~3.6 and I currently have a 3.2 GPA at a current top 10 engineering school.

Question 1: Is it okay to leave out about my transfer history entirely on my resume? I honestly don't mind it but obviously prefer to just leave it out for the sake of simplicity. I never got the 2yr associates degree and having a graduation year / ending enroll date may cause confusion about which degree I actually earned.

Question 3: By the time I apply for summer, I will have knowledge in SQL, C/C++, Matlab, Java, and technical research. Should I leave out other non-major related things such as Photoshop, AutoCAD, Inventor, MS Office, etc?

91i462,3,2018-07-24,Answers to common questions about therapy.,Bluesailfish,mentalhealth,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/91i462/answers_to_common_questions_about_therapy/,"Hello all!  As a mental health professional, I thought I should post answers to some common questions regarding therapy.  This post is not intended to promote my services, and is only intended to provide information.  If I haven't address your question, please feel free to ask me!    

Note: This is meant to be a general overview, as some things can vary depending on your state or your specific circumstance.

**Q: What can a therapist disclose? Is everything I tell my therapist confidential?**

**A**: In most states (likely all of them), everything you tell your therapist is confidential and is protected by HIPAA (Health Information Portability and Accountability Act). There are a few exceptions: 1. If you have knowledge of abuse to a minor child or vulnerable adult/admit to partaking in abuse to a child or vulnerable adult, a therapist is required by law to report it. Therapists are one of many state mandated mandatory reporters. 2. If you express with serious intent that you want to harm yourself or someone else, your therapist will perform a risk assessment to assess the risk/likelihood that you are going to follow through with said intent. If the therapist deems that you are at a high risk for following through with your intent, your therapist will recommend a psychiatric hold (in Florida it is called Baker Act and is a 2-day involuntary hold in which you will be evaluated, but the terms of the hold vary from state to state).  3. Lastly, if your therapist identifies you are severely struggling with your activities of daily living(ADLs) to the extent they are concerned you are not/cannot care for yourself, they will recommend a psychiatric hold. Some examples of this are rapid weight loss due to not feeding yourself (due to mental illness and not inability to buy food), deterioration of good hygiene practices (again due to mental illness and not choice) to name a few.  Again, this also can vary from state to state. 

**Q**: **What if I don’t like my therapist, how can I get a different one?**

**A**: The foundation to successful therapy is a good therapist-client relationship. If you are not connecting well with your therapist, you can ask them for a referral to a different therapist. They will not be offended and it won’t hurt their feelings. But they will ask why you want the referral and what you think you need different compared to what they are currently providing. This is so they can refer you to someone that better fits what you need. Often times, a therapist will notice that you are not meshing well and will recommend that they refer you to someone else. 

**Q**: **What if I don’t have insurance?**

**A**:  This one is tricky in that it will depend on the resources in your area. A lot of therapists have what is called a “self-pay” price, which is generally a discounted price if you are not using or don’t have insurance. Many providers are moving to this model anyways, as it is less hassle than dealing with insurance companies. You might try a community behavioral health clinic in your area. They often work on a sliding scale fee based on your income. The best way to know for sure is to call your potential provider’s office and ask if they have a self-pay rate because you do not have insurance. 

**Q**: **Will my therapist prescribe me medication?**

**A**: Therapists do not prescribe medication. However, they will want to know which medications you are on, as some medications have rebound effects of the symptoms they are meant to prevent. EX: Ativan, which is often used to prevent panic attacks, can cause rebound panic attacks. If you are wanting medication, you will need to see a Psychiatrist or your primary care physician. 

**Q: What is the difference between a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW but can depend on which state you are in) a Licensed Mental Health Counselor (LMHC), and a Psychologist?** 

**A**: So each of these do very similar jobs, however they differ in their training and their treatment philosophies. An LCSW or clinical social worker will look at all the elements in your life and take a big picture approach to your treatment in relation to your mental health. I am a registered clinical social worker intern which means I have completed the education requirements to practice, I am completing the required clinical hours to become fully licensed. It is very similar to the residency a doctor does. A Licensed Mental Health Counselor and a Psychologist both work under the medical model in which they diagnose you and then treat the diagnosis. Although, a psychologist can perform certain assessments and testing that all the other mental health professions cannot. One example is the IQ test. Another difference between these is the training they have. So Clinical social workers have a master’s degree in Social work, Licensed Mental Health counselors have a master’s degree in mental health counseling. Psychologists will have a master’s degree or doctoral degree in psychology and can specialize in counseling, clinical psychology or school. Because licensure requirements for all of these professions differ from state to state, I will tell you to research the licensure requirements for the above professions for your specific state. As I am a clinical social worker, I can only 100% speak to the requirements for my specific profession. So this is just a general overview of each. 

**Q: How does my therapist know if therapy is working for me?** **How do I know if therapy is working for me?**

**A**: So most therapists will do assessments throughout your treatment to determine if the interventions they have in place are working. So they might have you fill out a questionnaire at the beginning of treatment which asks specific questions about the symptoms you are experiencing, and then a few weeks after beginning therapy they may give you the same assessment, and then compare the two. If it is working, your scores are likely to improve and the therapist will continue the treatment plan. If your scores stay the same or your scores decrease, they might try the current therapy for a few more weeks or they may try different interventions. They will also take into account your thoughts on if you feel you are improving or not. As far as you knowing if therapy is working or not, think about how you currently feel in relation to how you felt when beginning therapy. Then have an open conversation with your therapist. Your therapist might notice some improvements that you did not. But being open and honest with your therapist is KEY to successful therapy. If you aren’t seeing improvement, ask yourself, “have I been completely honest with my therapist, have I withheld certain information?” “Am I working on my treatment goals outside of therapy?” “Am I clicking well with my therapist? Do I feel like I can be open with my therapist?” “If so, why or why not?” This is also a great conversation to have with your therapist. 

**Q:** **How important is my diagnosis to my therapy?** **Do I have to have a diagnosis?**

**A:** So if you are using insurance to see a therapist, unfortunately we have to provide insurance with a diagnosis and a treatment plan. However even then, the diagnosis is for insurance purposes only and really have little to do with your treatment, except in some circumstances. Because most interventions can be used to treat many different things, the diagnosis is really just a starting point. So for instance, if you are having issues with emotional dysregulation, sure that is a symptom of ADHD/ADD, but there are still certain things we can do in therapy to help you become better with emotional dysregulation. Emotional dysregulation is a symptom of many mood disorders, as well as a few other disorders. So really, the diagnosis isn’t as important as the “symptoms.” However, if a provider is not billing insurance, they may be slower to attach a diagnosis as it isn’t needed for reimbursement. It really depends on the type of provider you see, though. There are times when the diagnosis is important, say for instance, you have a certain disorder and you need to have the diagnosis documented for school so you can get the resources/accommodations you need to succeed.

I graduated from a school several years ago and have been working as a developer for the past three years and I was thinking about returning to school for an M.S. in Data Science. I had several questions. 

Lastly, during the first couple years of my undergraduate career, I kinda coasted. I got mostly B's and a few A's , however during my senior year in I got mostly A's in my major and several graduate level courses. I got a C in my first data structures class in my freshman year but later got a B in my advanced data structures class. I also didn't do well in my Calculus but I retook them and got A's and B's. I also withdrew from 1-2 classes because of life events getting in the way (one was a Mexican history class that was giving me more work than my calc class so I dropped it). 95% of these stellar things occurred in my freshman and sophomore year. I ultimately got two good internships as a developer, have had a successful career and have a great resume, and great referrals. Also I did well in my linear algebra class and my statistics class. I'm worried about those less than stellar things significantly affecting my chances but I think I am losing the forest through the trees here because I have many other positive things going for me.

What is your opinions on what I just said?

Please keep in mind I am not applying to Georgia Tech or stuff like that, maybe a nice private school. Something like Marquette University or SLU.

I'm on the job hunt now, but the many junior dev interview rejections usually end up with the same ""not enough experience"". This is understandable with the career switch and I'm just trying to build experience with my own projects, building up my portfolio etc. I'm also currently learning how to create small projects using arduino and hooking up soil moisture sensors to a web app I've already built. 

**A bit of my background:**

\-did a BSc in forestry, worked in urban forestry for a few years  
\-made a decision to switch into something more cs related  
\-did a web developer bootcamp (had sponsorship and was more to kickstart how to be a programmer rather than becoming a web developer)  
\-more interested in internet of things, programming hardware and connecting it to software apps

**Some examples of applications in forestry/agriculture I can think of are:** 

\-programming drones/UAV to detect wildfires  
\-crop sensors to detect insect pest density in an area and release pesticides/pheromones as needed  
\-crop sensors to determine plant health (e.g. oxygen outputs)  
\-monitor for damage in solar panels based on their energy outputs 

**My questions:**

1. What kind of resources (preferably free) can I look into to improve this area of hardware programming?  
2. Do you know any names of companies that do this type of work? (So I can visit their website)  
3. Any internships in the greater Vancouver area? Or somewhere else in BC?   
4. am I in way over my head??? Is this going to require more schooling or years of side projects? Hope not!

Thanks!"

91ip19,3,2018-07-24,Probably not graduating early like I hoped because of my internship. What should I do?,agonistfriend,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/91ip19/probably_not_graduating_early_like_i_hoped/,"I was on track to graduate a semester early this December with a degree in the human services field. All I have left to complete is my internship which is worth 9 credit hours (equals to 30 hours a week working for my internship). Up until last spring, my major only allowed internships within 60 miles of my college town. The area is pretty rural and 100 miles away from where I'm from in a another state. I'm from the nearest big city to my college town and from my perspective, it would be more beneficial for me to do the internship in my city. I believe this because I see internships as possible future employers and getting your foot in the door. I have a lot more opportunities in my city. I didn't want to do my internship in my college town because it's rural, doesn't have the population I want to work with, and I don't plan on staying down there. Additionally, the internship sites in my college town aren't paid. 

I was told in March by my internship coordinator that they would start allowing internships outside of my college town. However, there would be extra paperwork that would have to be filled out between the site and the school. The internship sites near my college already have the paperwork done. This was great news because I could live at home and save money instead of renting an apartment at my college. Even if I wasn't getting paid for an internship in my city, I would still save more money by living at home.

The process of finding the internship includes my coordinator (who is a phd student) and I contacting sites. I also provided him with a list of sites I was interested in. This was in March. In May when I moved back home, I found out from a friend who recently graduated that the paperwork needed to intern outside of our college town can take up to 8 months to complete. I started freaking out and contacted my coordinator immediately. I even drove down to my college town in June and was told by him he's been in contact with a site I've been interested in my city. He said it shouldn't take that long, but things were a little behind because our department's director retired in May. I regretfully trusted him and quit looking at internship sites myself. 

Now it's almost August and the semester starts August 20th. My current job which I love is trying to figure out the schedules for the next 2 months. I'm currently the lead and working 40 hours a week. I was hoping to still work at least 2 days at my job while doing my internship, but told my boss not to schedule me after August 20th until I find out my internship hours. 

I emailed my coordinator 4 times last week asking the status of the paperwork, if he knows if the internship is paid, what my hours may be, or if he can give me the contact information for the site so I can find out myself. No answer until I sent a 5th email yesterday. 

His response:

""Thank you for the email. I’m still trying to get a hold of the coordinator at (site name). I'll let you know when he gets back to me.""

No response to my questions at all. I replied asking the questions again and told him I need to know by Wednesday if he can get the internship set up because my job will be hiring a new full time person and I'll be out of a job. 

At this point I'm pretty much looking at not graduating until May since I have less than a month to get things figured out. My backup plan is to postpone my internship and graduation until Spring. Then I will have to take 4 online classes to stay a full time student and keep my scholarships. I'd also possibly have to take out extra loans because I originally planned to graduate this December. With this option I'd be able to keep my full time job which pays decent and save up money while living at home and taking online classes.

My other backup plan is to try to get an internship in my college town. However, it would be unpaid, I'd have to find an apartment last minute with hopefully a 6 month lease, buy furniture for the apartment since I have nothing, and still graduate early. I would be saving money by not taking an extra semester of school, but it would not be at a site that I want and I'd be out of a lot of money. I'd also be losing my job at home and would hopefully have to find a job to help me get my while doing my unpaid internship. 

I'm frustrated and pissed at this point. I know I'm to blame too, but by my coordinator's whole job is to coordinate my internship. He's graduating in the December which I understand is stressful in him, but I wanted to graduate in December also."

Quite unsure if IT is what I really want to do in the long run. I kinda fell into doing IT and then decided to pursue it at degree level.

I also loved and want to take up spanish again and get a proper certificate in it (as a hobby and possibility for a job or even travel for a job maybe?). I love the gym and fitness, like to travel and I also feel like I'd like to teach however there aren't many jobs available for teaching at the moment. Just really unsure what career path I'd be suited for. I think I'm more of a people person and would be better working face to face with others than just at a computer a lot of the time.

Any pointers or help would be greatly appreciated!"

I have 4 years of help desk experience at the college I am going to. Working 20 hours a week during the school year and 40 hours a week during summers and breaks. This past summer I got a different internship at a SMB where I make 15 bucks an hour, which isn't bad in my area for my age. The company said in the beginning that it was a summer internship that may continue into the year if the fit was right. 

  Well the fit was right and they are really enjoying the work that I am doing. I am helping a lot with the cloud migration that we are doing right now, and im even in meetings with the CFO and tech lead (that said there is only the tech lead and myself). My current title is Information Systems Intern, however I would like a change to Junior Systems administrator. As I manage the network, users, other random IT things - just as the job description says. 

I figured with a name change I should also ask for a raise right? I'm making far below average (like half) of what the average junior systems administrator makes. Granted it is a small business.

TL:DR I want a raise for the job I am doing and a name change from intern to systems admin but I've only been at the company three months. The like me here and asked me to stay longer then assigned."

My biggest project for the summer was to look into use cases and plan implementation for two separate pieces of hardware that they purchased for $1,500 and $5,000 dollars each.

They would like to be using these devices on the factory floor by the end of their budget year. The company doesn't do any of their own development. They look at third party apps and outsource development when needed, so I did not get the opportunity to work on any development for the devices. After spending the summer considering it in my free time, the experience I do have with the device from the internship, and my knowledge of their use case I believe I could develop an app that would satisfy a few of their requirements and provide an actual use for the expensive equipment.

Does this sound like a worthwhile idea? Would it be weird to pursue this? How would I go about this from the business side? Should I mention it to them before I begin or after I have a finished product?"

I'm a career switcher. I am getting a masters in CS at a respected school and have a very high GPA. (Summa) I am finishing up a summer internship at a defense company. The plan was to graduate in May 2019.

I am sitting on an offer for a Fall internship from Amazon that expires soon and am in host matching at Google, but no luck on that front. 

My question is, will adding a Big 4 be \*that\* big of a value add? I want to apply to APM/PM grad positions as I am very interested in those. I can still gradaute in May if I bust my ass next semester (and most grad APM roles start for May grads it seems). The timeline is such that I'm not even sure I'd be able to start in time to have anything substantive from an internship to include on full time position application (they go up in August).

I'm worried the hours required (that I hear is typical) for Amazon will make interview prep/on-sites very hard to accommodate? How understanding would they be if I needed to fly out somewhere to talk to someone *else* about a job? (This is probably my *biggest* concern)

Also, although I can still graduate in May, ML/DL and AI courses are only offered in Fall, so I'd miss out on those.

On the flip side compressing the remainder of courses into one semester = less expense on school + income.

Thanks for the time guys ... this has been devouring my attention for some time now."

I have been working on the degree full time for about a year and have started the process of applying to internships. 


I currently have an offer that I am not too excited about. The role would be a software engineer intern primarily working with embedded software. Embedded does not seem like something I would want to do long term in my career and I honestly don't think I would enjoy the position. The recruiter told me that things are kind of disorganized and unstructured there and everyone is overworked. I suspect that mentoring interns will not be a priority for their small overworked team.  


I currently do not pay any rent and am able to focus on school and learning as much as possible. I also am able to relocate anywhere at any time as I don't have a lease to worry about. This would change as I would have to move cities for this job and sign a lease.  However, the job is in a city that I like and used to live in. So I have a lot of friends there and it is a good city for tech. 


I am kind of leaning towards declining this offer and just keep working on side projects/interview prep to hopefully land another internship offer in the future. At the same time, I feel like I am not in a position to be declining offers since I obviously need the experience. Can anyone offer some advice on what they would do in this situation?

91ogkr,8,2018-07-24,Advice on changing companies,Gopher10,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/91ogkr/advice_on_changing_companies/,"Hi guys,

I am 25 years old currently working at a company as a full stack developer. I started my career with a paid internship and ended up signing on with them full time after my 16 month internship finished. I ended up finishing my degree with night classes so I did not have any downtime between my internship and full time employment. I have been at this company for about 3.5 years now.

Recently a company that I had applied to when looking for an internship posted a full time position which I believe would be a great learning experience. The job posting exactly matches my experience and interests and seems to have a great work environment.

I love my current job. The benefits are fantastic, co-workers are great, and management is incredibly supportive. However, it is a corporate giant which means a lot of things get stuck in approval loops. We do not use some of the best of breed technologies as our old systems cannot support it and quite honestly we are behind the times. It is getting better but there is still a very long way to go. Another concern is that there seems to be very little advancement opportunities at the current time. Management has talked very openly about expanding the teams and creating new jobs but there has been little progress towards that as the board has not been approving more jobs. Currently we only have JR and SR roles, where SR roles require 8 years experience and are not based on performance at all. The only other upward move is into a manager position.

I have read a few times that most people in the tech industry move ever 3-5 years as that is the best way to advance in your career. I am opening to move if it means it will help me later in my career but quite frankly I don't know what will help me advance  at this point. My current salary is above average for my city from what I can tell(\~$80,000 CAD). 

Can anyone offer any advice on when switching roles is good, expected wages, and at what point it is worth switching jobs when you have a stable and well paying job? Any advice appreciated."

I'm currently in my 4th year of a Computer Science bachelor's degree at a decent university.
I've already taken the HCI and UI courses that are offered at my university, but they weren't great and I don't feel like I got much out of them. I understand that UX and UI are different, and I know UI is what I would preferably like to get into.

I dropped out of my Coop program at my university when I got the job I'm currently at. Honestly, the job search was really stressful while trying to keep up with school work, and I wasn't interested in the job offers I was given.

Right now I work in tech support to pay for school and I don't have any internships or coops under my belt.

What should I be looking for? What can I do to better ready myself?

I am deciding whether to go to Syracuse or George Mason in the fall.

Syracuse:
I was admitted to the iSchool and plan to major in Information Management and Tech.

-75k a year 
- upstate ny ( middle of nowhere basically)
- some areas are dangerous
- if I do attend, I might want to transfer out to schools like UMD, GW, BU and etc.
- less internships/ experience 

George mason:

Did not get into the school of business directly, I would have to transfer there whereas in Syracuse, I got directly into my program.


 -hopefully gonna major in information systems.
- close to DC and many internships
- there are chances to transfer out to other schools in the area such as UVA ( hard), GW, UMD and etc.....
- 66k a year
- can qualify for instate in VA in a year or two?!?? 
- not a big name outside the DMV area
- no social scene/ commuter school 


I put a deposit into for both but I still have until the end of the month to decide so if y’all could help me out with your own experiences let me know !??!!"

The problem is that I cheated through the system for most of my major courses by tweaking previous code base on Github posted by another student, and when they were not available, I put in minimum effort to understand the material. I never got caught doing so by changing the whole structure of previously written code without understanding how it worked. I was able to land an internship opportunity from a somewhat well known tech company that's not as prestige, but haven't really produced anything at all except for minor debugging that any non cs majors could do.

My resume doesn't look as bad since I participated in a couple of hackathons and did research work in school. But if I had to talk about my embellished projects in depth, I probably would stumble a bit. Recently, I started studying the core materials with CTCI and EPI to get a full time job, but I am suffering a lot from depression and anxiety that I probably deserve. Luckily, I don't have financial problems and have as much time as I want but I keep questioning myself since I know I didn't earn this degree. I am a very superficial person who strive for superficial greatness, and took a wrong path doing so.

Throughout those four years, I learned that I am lazy, and that I really lack in sense of ethics. I don't have much passion in programming but I want to pursue a career as a software engineer for the money.

The question is, could I become a successful software engineer with this background? And what should I do to become one? I apologize in advance to anyone who are offended by this post, but I really need some guidance on my life."

I point them to the Messer videos as the primary source of learning since they've worked for me (and majority of people/r/CompTIA) plus we have two books for the A+, Messer's notes and questions, and other free sources online. 

However all the interns I had(8 so far) have complained about Messer being to boring, or in case of one intern, too hard. Are any one the other video series ""more interesting""(I personally found Messer to be just fine)?

None of the interns have obtained a certification unfortunately, but I think it might have to do more with our approach to hiring and the expectations we set for them. Since we're located in a small town, most of the interns we hire don't have a background in IT or a interest in it. Some times we've hired people due to their race or sex rather than their qualifications, we've passed over people with BS in ComSci or associate degree for people with just high school and a resume that was plain text formatting with only 1/4 of a page filled. 

In their first week I tell interns it usally takes 30-90 hours in average(1-2 months of work since they have a lot of free time at work) to get the exams but later on at some point my manager(who has no never taken a IT certification or has any experience in the field) will tell interns they need at least 500 hours work experience to pass the exam. 

Sorry I went off topic, I know mostly this is fault of the management(which includes me), but I'm frustrated as our interns  spend around 6 months with us but they don't obtain much experience as their job consists mostly of just refurbishing computers.

I'm graduating this December with a degree in ECE in Oregon. For the last three years I've worked at my school managing our drone program and doing projects with researchers. I received reduced tuition so I kept working there instead of pursuing internships. 

Now that I'm graduating I'm worried about not having an engineering internship on my resume. I'm moving across the country to Boston so I won't have any of the contacts I've built up here in Oregon to tap. I do have lots projects, many of them autonomous drones, robotics projects, etc. 

I've spent a lot of time outside of class building practical skills like 3d modeling, PCB design, and lots of coding in C, python, and assembly. So I guess my question is, how much weigh do projects hold vs real industry knowledge from an internship? And for anyone on the East coast; do you think companies value different things over there vs here on the West coast?

I only have 5 classes left to get my bachelor’s degree in Software Development and Security, which my job pays 100% of my tuition for. I went to an interview at my company today and I completely bombed it. It was for an entry level rotational program in IT(not an internship) where they let you participate in 4 different jobs for 6 months each. They asked a lot of behavioral questions and wanted responsess in a STAR format. I did horrible as I had a hard time relating with my work experience. I build airplanes for a living and they were asking about times I’ve led projects and then they began asking about my schoolwork. I can barely remember any of my older assignments and I know I would fail a technical interview. I could do basic programs FizzBuzz and such but its hard to work 8-12 hours a day, study, and then do homework. I’ve already cut back to just one class at a time. At this rate I have forgotten many concepts. I am not eligible to do internships but I am already a full time employee. I’m not in a position where I can just stop working for hours and go participate in a hackathon. I dont get to network with IT people because 99% of my day I’m running around like a chicken with my head cut off trying to finish my work on time. I’m not bad at my job but it is manufacturing and very rushed. Managers are constantly pushing for more more more. I’ve applied tonmany entry level IT positions within my company of &gt;150,000 employees and get rejected every time. How do I gain meaningful experience given my hectic schedule? How do I get what I learn to actually stick? I can’t help but feel so far behind the curve with all of these college seniors coming out of school with 2 internships, project experience, and more free time to study. I need my job and they are paying for school. I sometimes wish I would have gone to school for business management because I wouldn’t have had to study so many concepts. I feel that by not using what I have learned, I have forgetten quite a bit. Any recommendations?"

One agency contacted me and want me to go for an interview. I know that this is the tip of the process, but I'm wondering if I should proceed as a person in my circumstance.

Early freshman year I experimented with Cannabis 1-2 times, but have never touched drugs before or after that. Most of these agencies don't want any drug usage whatsoever prior to 12 months of an application. (For my case it would be \~ 9 months).

Do I still have a chance if I successfully mitigated the issue? I have no intent on lying on the SF-86 if they consider me a initial hire (again, long ways from there) or do I cut my losses as it would be a waste of time for nothing?

I know generally for minor drug usage it isn't a big deal, but since this is an internship, and the drug usage is fairly recent (\~9 months), and the position requires TS I'm not sure if I should go through with this.

I really don't wish to lose this opportunity, mainly since I don't think I'll get it ever again. I'm not sure how the interview process works, but if they ask me directly should I just wave it away and be honest on my SF-86 (again if I get there) or be upfront and possibility disqualified from the start?"

91x0ts,1,2018-07-25,Reputable Recruiting Companies/Recruiters?,AromaticRiver,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/91x0ts/reputable_recruiting_companiesrecruiters/,"I'm actively looking for a new job in a technical/science field. I have not seen many job postings and the few I've seen, I haven't had luck when applying. I recently tried to increase my activity on LinkedIn to start popping up on feeds and change my status to looking for employment. It worked and I was contacted by a recruiter for some job openings he had. Unfortunately, the three jobs he sent me were way outside of my field and I was not an ideal candidate for any of them. We had a phone conversation and I explained to him I wasn't interested in those jobs then explained my experience and what I was looking for. We scheduled a in-person meeting to go over my education, work experience, what kind of job I was looking for, and what companies I'd like to work for so he could better match me with jobs. He had another job in an adjacent field I had not previously considered but was willing to branch out so I agreed to interview with that company. I have not worked with a recruiting company before so I wasn't sure what to expect but I was trying to be open to new opportunities.   


Prior to the interview, he sent me the ""job description"" and a couple documents about how to prepare for interviews along with an explanation for interview attire. After searching the company and job title, I found the indeed post for the position I was interviewing for and it provided much more information than the recruiter ever gave me. I also found it very odd that he told me how to dress (like I wasn't aware even though I was in business attire when I met with him) and included very basic interview prep material (you're here to sell yourself, explain how your previous experience applies, tell them what you can bring to the job, etc) but decided maybe it was company policy or whatever. His email also gave me an address to meet at and told me to meet him 15 mins early so I could make sure I was on time (I was little irritated because I don't like being underestimated). Well on the day of, it turned out the address was not correct and he was running behind so after it was all sorted out I ended up being 20 mins late to the interview. Everything seemed to work out and I had a very good interview and I believe I left a good impression with the company. 

The recruiter called me following the interview to get my impression and see how things went. A couple days later, I followed up with him to see if he got any feedback from the company. The recruiter said they liked me and wanted a second interview but many people would be on vacation for the holiday (July 4th) and following week(s). I kept checking in and eventually it felt like I was being jerked around so I told the recruiter that if a second interview wasn't going to happen this week (last week), then I would like to start looking into other opportunities and to let me know if he had anything else that would suited for me. A couple hours after I sent that email, the recruiter told me the company wanted to have a second interview for this Tuesday (yesterday). He called me on Monday to see how I was feeling again and to let me know that this position was a six month contract to hire position. I was very disappointed by this news. I made the poor assumption that he would have informed me if the position was contract to hire (instead of a direct hire) from the beginning. 

I had the interview yesterday and I felt like it went well again but it was odd that I didn't meet with the HR manager this time. A couple hours after the interview, the recruiter called me again to see how I was feeling about the position. I told him that I was definitely interested in the job but had concerns about the six month contract to hire situation. I stated the benefits package of the recruiting company did not impress me (basic health care plan with a high premium and a $5,000 deductible for anything outside of standard office visits) and I was concerned I wouldn't have an opportunity to negotiate my salary and contract. The recruiter didn't seem to understand why I would want to negotiate the contract and said the six month period was standard. 

At this point, I'm pretty disappointed because I was excited about the position but I don't feel like it will work out. I don't think this recruiter knew what he was doing and I think he mislead or misguided me at various points. I also don't think he understands the type of position I am looking for or even the position I interviewed for. It seems like he usually staffs lower skilled jobs and maybe not positions for someone with my education and job experience (BA in science, notable internship, masters in same science, 3 years work experience in technical/science field). I think the recruiting company had this position sitting around and they were having trouble staffing it so when he met me, he found some similarities with my experience but it was outside of his wheelhouse.   


I'm getting desperate to find a new job because my current position is making me unhappy (my company has a lot of infighting, high turnover rate, I felt harassed by a former supervisor and I reported it a couple months later and now I'm facing mild retaliation, along with other undesirable aspects). The job market seems pretty dry in my area so I think my best chance to find a new job is with a recruiter. I'm hoping to find a new recruiter or recruiting company to work with that is better suited for my field. Or maybe just learn more about how recruiting companies operate so I don't make the same mistake twice. Or maybe I need a reality check and this is pretty standard and my expectations are too high? 

Sorry this was an essay but thank you for reading!   


TL;DR, I was working with a recruiter who doesn't seem to understand my career field and I'm interested in learning more about recruiting companies, how they operate, and how I might find a recruiter better suited for my field. "

So, my tax return got messed up and it turns out my university never got my tax info. My parents got our family accountant to re-submit my tax return a few days ago, but it will take the IRS a few weeks to process it and then it will take my university a few more weeks to process and a few more to put together my financial aid package. All of that needs to be done by August 20th, when my tuition is due. I definitely can't afford to pay the amount it would cost, and basically I won't be able to go to class this semester (or potentially the entire school year) if this stuff doesn't get done in time.

I have contacted the financial aid office, but they said that getting an extension on the deadline is unlikely and to contact them closer to August 20th to see if I can get one.

If I can't go to class, I'd like to be able to get an internship instead. I had been contacting a company about an internship for this past summer, which fell through, but they had asked if I was available for the fall. I said I wasn't because of classes, but I could contact them and see if they have any positions available.

Should I start contacting companies and applying for internships/jobs now? I'd hate to wait and not be able to get an internship if it turns out I won't get financial aid, but I also don't want to suddenly turn down a company if I do get financial aid. I especially don't want to have a poor relationship with the company I had contacted before, since they are in a convenient location and a professor had recommended that I contact them. Also, should I explain to them why I won't be taking classes this year?

If it helps, I was an engineering major this past year but I had switched to industrial design and computer graphics technology (3D modeling, basically) for this year.

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you so much!"

920eaw,1,2018-07-26,"How to combine work, household chores, social life,... ?",Oedipurrr,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/920eaw/how_to_combine_work_household_chores_social_life/,"Sorry if this post is long and incoherent. 

A little background information: 
I started doing a PhD 5 years ago. At that time I was in a (very toxic) relationship with someone without a job (and not actively looking for a job). I supported him, so I felt it was okay that I would focus on the PhD and he would do the household chores. We broke up. I met someone else (with ADD) and we are in -what I thought was- a healthy relationship. Due to my supervisors errors, my PhD wasn't finished on time meaning my funding ran out (a year ago) and I had to find a regular job to support me, while still wanting to finish my PhD (in my free time). Me and my BF also bought a house a year ago which we've been renovating since October. During peak periods in my PhD or at work, I seem unable to do anything else (take care of myself, do household chores,...). I always thought this would be a temporary thing (until the PhD is finished). Last week my BF told me that he had doubts about our relationship and is considering breaking up since he feels that I get so consumed by my work and PhD that he has to take care of me. To be blunt, the fact that my PhD work environment has been very toxic has played a large role in this. It dawned on me that even if this is temporary (which I'm not so sure about anymore since I'm now finishing my PhD in my limited free time which can take for ages),  it's not fair on my BF to live like this (or even myself for that matter). I desperately want to change and am already making elaborate plans on how to do this. However, I'm also scared shitless that it might not just be my temporary situation, but also the kind of person that I am preventing me to do my job, (finish a PhD) and take care of myself and our house. How do you guys combine everything?

I've thought about it and have also made a list of aspects/ traits possibly contributing to the problem, but feel free to stop reading here.

*All or nothing / hyperfocus*
I always feel like I have to go all-in to do a somewhat proper job at something. The times that I feel I made progress with my PhD were moments where I pulled an all-nighter for example. Things just don't seem to click in my mind in the same way when I work several regular days as opposed to one all-nighter. Same with my private life. I've been making elaborate plans about how to change since I talked to my BF (e.g. start meal prepping, work in the house two nights a week, go to therapy weekly, go to the gym 3 times a week,...). I know this just isn't feasible, but I go completely overboard and can't seem to stop before I have it all figured out.

*Planning*
Kind of related to the previous one, since I ""have to"" make elaborate plans that will never be feasible... But also an inability to accurately conceive how much time something will take. On a work level this seems to lead to taking on every tasks that's offered to me not knowing whether it is feasible but thinking that I'll do whatever it takes to get it done. To be fair, since I have no job security I also feel like saying no wouldn't really be an option. When doing household chores, this leads to the idea that any task will take days. I also feel like I have an inability to see the bigger picture when planning. For example, after finishing my internship for my masters degree I felt like I had a ton of time to chill and slowly work on my thesis. I knew which date the deadline was, but it took me some time to suddenly realise that that date was two weeks after my internship. 

*Organizational skills /inefficiency in certain tasks*
I feel like I do quite well with tasks that I can dig into and just do the same for a certain amount of time. When renovating our house, I did fairly well when we were breaking down things for example, and I could just swing my hammer at walls for days on end. I do much worse when having to organise things. I'll get sidetracked, have trouble seeing the work and thinking of suitable places for stuff, and just get physically tired easily. 

*Energy levels*
I feel like I've just been feeling continuously physically exhausted the last few years, especially since my work environment (at my PhD) started getting extremely toxic. This drives me mad since I have a restless mind and want to do tons of stuff.

*Being naive*
This is kind of contradictory. On one side I can't believe good things will happen to me anymore (since the last few years have been quite bad). On the other side I'm often mind-blown when bad things happen, while there have been signs. For example, I thought I had a good relationship with my BF. I was completely mind-blown that he's considering breaking up, although he has stated in the past that certain things bother him. A similar thing happened at my job. I work in research so we're depended on getting projects (external funding). They were saying for quite some time that there weren't enough projects to keep everyone next year, yet I was completely baffled when they said they probably wouldn't keep me. (they did keep me in the end btw).

*Emotional intensity and not letting go*
I can be quite sensitive (which I often think is a good thing, but I'm not going to get sidetracked in that discussion).  It does however have its downsides. For example, I had to ask my (new) teamleader whether my costs for a certain project would be refunded. She wasn't doing her job that well so I had to ask several times. In the end she answered ""please don't act this difficult about extra costs"". This was for an impossibly underbudgetted project that I had been working crazy amounts of hours on. I felt so bad about being seen as ""difficult"" relating to a project I worked that hard on that I cried about it in front of a colleague. Same happens to positive things too. It's quite clear that my new job isn't the best job for me, but at the same time I have difficulty letting it go because of small things that don't matter in the bigger picture, like some colleagues I like to work with while most of them are looking for another job themselves.

*Impulsivity / honesty (?) and political games*
I feel like a lot of political games are being played at work. For example, one of my projects ""belongs"" to one group I work with, but the other group wants to claim it. I've figured this out quite late and feel like I've been used as a pawn. I'm way to impulsive and transparent for this shit.

*Communication*
I have difficulty taking up ""space"" in group. I have difficulty following conversation, especially when they start to use vague intellectual words. I hate people who use a lot of words, while not saying a lot but what I hate more is that this is a strategy that works. I feel like the way I communicate (or not communicate) is heavily influencing the way I get seen at work. I have to be 10000% sure before I'll claim anything and this doesn't really get rewarded in a work context. It also takes me quit some time to collect and structure my thoughts and not get sidetracked (as is probably evident from this post). 

*How I present myself, how people see me and self-esteem*
I'm always willing to put in the extra hours and I make this quite clear. Strangely, the way I present this seems to lead to my superiors questioning both my engagement and competence. This has happened at both my PhD and my current job. For some reason, they don't seem to question others who strictly work 9 to 5 and make this very clear. This just baffles me. At the same time, this has led to me feeling like no matter what I do, I'm never enough (especially since now I'm not only getting this message at work, but also from my BF).

Again sorry for the long post. Thanks for hanging in there and reading on. Any advice or just thoughts about this are very welcome!

TL;DR: a collection of traits / aspects relating to difficulties in my work and personal life (and balancing the two). Thoughts and advice are appreciated. "

I've been applying for CS jobs for a year now, hovering around 1 interview every few months, only two have made it to the in-person stage after phone interviews. I'm really into this and have been super aggressive, but really low yield.

My background:

Majored in a specialized biology track focused on quantitative/classical research, analytics, stats, physics, and all around science. I took additional courses in comp sci, stats programming, and lots of self study over the 4 years. I have 50 projects on GitHub, medium to small complexity, but covering a huge range of tools and uses. I did pretty extensive undergrad research internships (biomed related) for a couple of years, where my primary duty was writing scripts, analytics, and programs for data manipulation or whatever could be automated. I started a blog, and continue to write a lot of small tutorials and fun stuff like that on data tools and topics. 

The interview feedback I keep getting is 'technically shallow', or 'need more experience' despite no technical questions, and what I think is more experience than the average new grad. Is it just the biology stigma or what?

People keep telling me to go to a bootcamp when I ask for advice, but...man, that seems dumb. 

Any secrets to getting further in the process or how to really sell my skills? I'm struggling to get potential employers to even look at my GitHub or blog, and the research software doesn't really impress them or pique their interests."
9216ai,4,2018-07-26,Help! Roommate triggering anxiety,jangalmangal,socialanxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/9216ai/help_roommate_triggering_anxiety/,"Hi,

TLDR;
Roommate causing anxiety, need ways to handle it

I am a graduate student and recently been working hard to get rid of my social anxiety. I have been sharing apartment with another person from my school. He seems to be the kind of person who is self-centred, needs to get things done his way. He also seems to criticize my personality, even my taste in music, make fun of me which I passively ignore almost all the time. 

He wants to know what I do, where I go and who I meet and uses different ways to get that, disregarding my personal space. I tend to become uncomfortable answering them and eventually in pressure/awkwardness give out answers which I don’t want to. 

He has been out for a couple of weeks and this has been one of the happiest periods of my life, I am for sure confident he triggers my anxiety and I feel helpless, I tend to pretend sleeping when he is around (note: he barges into my room if he needs something) and doesn’t care if I am working on something.  We had a busy internship search period and he became extremely bitter of the fact that I got interview calls from a couple of companies while he got none. Once we were drinking and he accidentally said “I am happy I got something that you didn’t get through in” for a hackathon which I still remember as a bitter experience. I felt I was a terrible person and made him feel that way, I did all it took to help him, even kept updating of places I applied to and reminding him of deadlines. 

I cannot move out since I recently signed my lease and will have to put up for another year. I was thinking about his return a couple of minutes back and that thought itself triggered an anxiety attack. 

I don’t want to spend time outside in libraries, coffee shops to avoid this but want to put this situation right in order. I am working out ways and situations and how I should handle them. Does anyone has had a similar situation or advice on how to deal with it?"

3 months after graduation, I cannot even get myself to look at a coding problem, I absolutely hate working with code, especially at the beginning because I have no idea what I am doing. I was just looking at some algorithm problems at Geeksforgeeks and I am utterly depressed , I feel like I know nothing and even looking at the solutions is making me more depressed. I can't even get myself to start coding. I don't know what to do really. I have a job interview tomorrow and they said they will ask an algorithm problem, I started looking at algorithm problems online and i just feel so idiotic because i have no clue how to do either one of them. 

What are some fields that I can get into with my degree with minimum programming? My friend is a network engineer and he told me he could help provide with a good material to study and knows what certificates to get me a good job, is this a good idea?

so I’m currently interning at a super awesome company that has an office here in Canada (where I live) and an office in SF (HQ). I’ve had an amazing experience interning in the Canadian office and am considering returning to the SF office for my next internship on a different team and possibly a different role (PM instead of SWE).

I’m currently torn on what to do since if I want to go to the SF office I need to let HR know by the end of august, and since not a lot of companies (if any) are recruiting for the Winter right now I will have to let them know before considering other options — or I could come back to the Canadian office and interview elsewhere (I can let them know before October/November). Reason the cali office has a shorter deadline is cause it fills up pretty quick and is probably full by September.

So I have 3ish options.

* Don’t interview and return to cali office as a SWE intern
* Don’t interview and return to cali office as a PM intern
* Interview and have the option to return to Canadian office

The pay difference between the offices is around $2k net (with the US office paying more)

Graduated with a Computer Science degree (3.5 GPA) from a decent UC 2 years ago. I was able to complete all my programming assignments and pass all my classes so I'd like to think that I'm not too terrible at programming. Unfortunately, I've forgotten everything I've learned in school by now. Thought things would get easier after graduating... 

  
Hi everyone, I apologize for the giant wall of text in advance. I am falling into depression and it is affecting the way I feel and act towards my SO, family, friends, and coworkers and I don't know what to do anymore. I currently work as a ""developer"" in an IT department of a large health care company in the Bay Area. The reason I put ""developer"" in quotes is because I am not doing any software development. What I really want to do is application development or web development professionally.

I've been with this company for around 2 years rotating around different IT departments and have recently joined the current team I'm in now a couple of months ago. Being with different groups and working on various projects, I was able to gain a bunch of different skills but none of them offered me professional, production-level software development experience. Most of the work I had involved working with vendor software or creating small POCs.

The team I'm in now is great. The pay is below market for a high COL area but the benefits and work-life balance are great. The people are great and they are doing cool things -- things that I want to do. They are building microservices and web apps on the cloud with the latest web stack (Node, React, etc) and this is exactly what I wanted to do -- and what I thought I would be doing. While most of the people on my team are working on that side of things, myself along side with a couple of other senior developers are working on setting up and developing policies for an API management gateway. We, as a company, are trying to move away from our legacy stack and into a more modern service and API economy. Now, I know this is very important work as this will impact the whole company but I am not enjoying this AT ALL. I'm afraid this will pigeonhole me into API management roles when what I really want to be doing is web development or application development. Since my team is relatively small and most of my team were already working on web dev stuff, their budget is maxed for those projects so I had to be put on this project. To make things worse, I'm sort of the main developer on this platform so I'm stuck doing this even if new cloud projects come in. I don't have time for anything else. I can see this effort continuing for the next couple of years as we have a ton of services to migrate and accommodate.

I am getting to the point where I absolutely HATE going into work and HATE interacting with anyone in meetings related to my work. I'm not motivated to do anything at work. This is affecting every aspect of my life and is making me irritable towards everyone in my life. I don't know what to do anymore. I want to quit but I know that that's not a smart decision. I want to look for a new job but I cannot pass any coding interviews to save my life. I've recently made a firecode account but couldn't even doing the first few challenges without a hint. I've never been good at data structures and algorithms, even fresh out of school. I feel too tired and exhausted after work to doing any studying or work on side projects...which leads to another problem. Since I haven't had any profession experience developing software, I think I absolutely need to work on some side projects.

How do I find the time to work on side projects AND study whiteboarding questions?

Even though it isn't a smart move, a part of me still want to quit my current job and focus on my future job prospect. I'd have 3 options if I go with this route, I will have all the time in the world to:

1. Get a master's in computer science/software engineering. This will allow me to ""start fresh"" by getting a software engineering internship.
2. Do a coding bootcamp.
3. Self study and work on side projects.

Please help me evaluate my options and what I should do to have the best future career prospects.

TLDR: I hate my current job (no coding) but I have 0 profession software development experience and I suck at interviews and data structures and algorithms. Don't know what to do with life anymore."
924xjr,32,2018-07-26,Got THE job offer and now I am entitled to one holier-than-thou advice thread.,ertgbnm,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/924xjr/got_the_job_offer_and_now_i_am_entitled_to_one/,"Background: Major-Civil Engineering, graduating in December.

This week I received 2 full time job offers both from companies I would want to work for. One blew the other out of the water and I will be accepting it. This Summer I’ve applied to about ~30 companies (not that many really) and have had 5 interviews and 3 offers. The other offer was early in the Summer and from my current internship, they way lowballed me and I’ve felt for a while that I wouldn’t want to do my EIT at my current company. I started the Summer looking for big companies and applying through the online portals only. This went poorly, I received no response from my first round of applications, maybe due to the off season may be due to me. I have had a few HR emails back in the last week stating that they aren’t interested, however. But I applied at the beginning of June and am only now hearing back. Second round I went more targeted by applying through company’s portal and contacting HR recruiters or members of the company through LinkedIn. I received five straight up NO’s, but I got them within a week and a half which is better than being ghosted. I earned 3 interviews, one on phone, from the process and while it was good practice they didn’t go anywhere. And I had one company not contact me back at all. Comparing the two attempts the latter went MUCH MUCH better clearly. Pinging a few people on LinkedIn took basically no time on my part and had a much better return. Last week I applied to 3 more locations, this time I sought after local and small companies following the same method as my second-round attempt. I had been wanting to do this for some time because I have grown a little tired of the mega-corp environment and have received some advice that starting small would give me an opportunity to more rapidly develop due to the lessened red-tape and the leaner company structure. I heard back from two of them within a day asking for an interview. I interviewed with one on Friday and the other Monday. I received offers from BOTH yesterday. The company that I favored gave me an above average offer and beat out the second. I accepted today and I am very happy. I honestly wasn't expected an offer this early or that I would accept one but the interview went so great and I loved what I saw of the company, so i jumped on it anyway.

The moral of the story is that the advice that a direct contact will do wonders is very true. It’s true even if you don’t have an existing connection with that person.  It worked at big and small companies. And when it didn’t, it still significantly accelerated the response time for a no which is good too. Each of the people I was in contact with expressed appreciation for reaching out and complimented the directness of the approach. 

Now I can breath easy for the next six months, knowing I have the next year or so figured out. Additional background: I am a way try hard student, 3.90 gpa, tons of clubs, 3 internships, leadership positions, and continuous part time work in the school year. So mileage may vary. Also I wanted a little brag sesh. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR: Contact someone directly if you want interviews. Do it early if you want job security.

Also, while my undergrad degree was fulfilling in its own way (Korean/int'l studies), it didn't \_quite\_ help me develop many transferable skills.

Since I quit my job about 6 months ago, I've been learning how to program (mostly JS and React, and getting exposure to Python and C now), and I've also finished a semester of a MS Cybersecurity program (networking and pen testing coursework so far, with cloud security, forensics, and more pen testing next semester). I have a web development position that I'll be starting in October, and I will also have an internship through my school as a Security Analyst (pen testing, log management, incident response) through my university starting in January. 

So, with that sparse bit of information about my situation, might I qualify for entry-level security positions in the next year?

WWYD,LucidBananna,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/9267zt/advice_on_which_career_path_to_follow_wwyd/,"Hi I am currently a 22 year old apprentice electrician in Florida starting my second year. However, I have been quite interested in software development for sometime now and have begun to self-teach and want to pursue this as a career and ultimately end up working at a big n in silicon valley. However, im not sure the best way to do this i see two options so far.

Option 1. I continue working through my apprenticeship (about 3 1/2) years left and self learn on the side and make projects to build a portfolio. The advantage to this option is I would be making decent money through it all have a back up career and would not have to go into debt for school. My fear with this is I am not sure I would be able to get a job in silicon valley with a college degree.

Option 2. I self teach myself for the rest of this year and the following year going to university. ( I went for a semester before and have college credits from high school so probably have about a year of preqs done.) I would be going to a school in Florida and I don't think the schools near me are the most well know for computer science and worry that a degree from one of these schools will not be worth as much to silicon valley companies as well as worry there will not be many internship opportunities. I also worry that it will be hard to finance my college degree as I'm 22 and well out of high school and probably ineligible for the grants I had out of high school.

If you were in my position how would you start your career? Thank you for any advice."

926h8r,1,2018-07-26,New developer in crossroads,Rivao,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/926h8r/new_developer_in_crossroads/,"Hello, reddit!

So, I have been working as a Full Stack developer for almost 6 months now in large enterprise. I started off as an intern for first 3 and then got offered a real contract for shit pay. As the pay is ridiculous, I've been looking around and right now, can't decide, what path to take to advance my career further. Currently I am mostly working with .NET C# on the back and AngularJs on the front. The problem is - I love coding. Yeah, that's the problem. Because I kinda like everything, I have no problem with Full Stack, but I also don't want to be Jack of all trades, but master of none, so right now, I wish to concentrate on either Back End or Front End, but with which technologies? 

I come from a small country, where job opportunities are kind of limited. Mostly there are PHP, JavaScript and some .Net jobs available.  I, guess, the biggest problem is that I absolutely love C#, but I am not sure, if enterprise solutions are the way to go for me at the moment. I need something more fresh and with a lot smaller scale, so I can understand the whole architecture of systems better and how everything works together. And, as I understand from reading various sources, .Net is mostly used by enterprises. I would like to get my hands on smaller projects, maybe even from ground up. I have a place in mind, where I could apply, but there it's either Front End JavaScript or Back End PHP. And I'm not too keen to go with the PHP, because of all the chaotic things, I know about it. But I don't know it very deeply, so maybe and probably it's not that bad. JavaScript seems interesting option to me, as it has a lot possibilities to what to do with it. And last option is staying where I am, telling them that I am leaving and probable I would get a raise, because I've been told that I was the best intern they had this year and have great potential. But money is not the most important thing at this moment.

Hmm.. I blabbered quite a lot in the end, hope this makes sense to you, but to summarize, **what I would like to hear from community:**

***How did you find your technology stack that you love and which is it?***

***What is your experience with different programming languages/frameworks, what did you like about it, what not. (This is not about what is the best, I would appreciate stories from personal experience)***

***I have seen that C# developers earn more, but I guess, it all depends on how good you are and you can earn the same amount with any technology stack, right?***

***What is the potential of NodeJs? Is it good?*** 

***Is it good idea to go from C# to JavaScript? Because I believe that C# has massive potential now because of .Net Core. I like programming in Front End as long as there is some good framework/library present. Don't fancy the HTML, CSS stuff so much, but it's not like I hate it, just enjoy doing that a bit less. And Full Stack JS sounds interesting as well.***

***How far have you gone with PHP? Is it good, if you have good knowledge and team of experts that use good practices? And why all the hate? Because of the low entry barrier (felt like PHP was a lot easier than C# with .Net) and people who write bad code, just because PHP allows it?***

Sooooo.. yeah. I am hoping to hear some stories/advice from your personal experience and not the usual 'It's worth learning every language/PHP is a language, .Net is... /and other common knowledge'. I know all this and I agree, I have read quite a lot of posts about it, but would like to hear answers, based on what I wrote. If you read through the whole thing - thanks, congratulations and have a cookie. And, because I probably could have structured this post better, I would be veeeery thankful if you could share your thoughts on this and maybe answer at least one of my questions. I'll stop now.. for real.

Have a good day and thank you for your time!"

So a bit of a background. I applied to a few schools last year and ultimately did not get in. So here I am, throwing my hat into the ring for a second time. 

My Stats:
GMAT - 700
Undergrad GPA: 3.6 (Top 30)
Experience: 3 Years IBD (middle market), 4 years in ops / expansion at a startup (joined pre-series A at #25 and we just raised a seies C)

For school A (top 5), I applied R1 with a goal of consulting and ultimately was denied after my interview. 

For school B (top 5), I applied R1 with a goal of entrepreneurship and was ultimately denied off the waitlist during R2. 

I'll be applying to both schools again this year but with an entirely new goal - Venture Capital. 

I never thought I would go back to finance, but this past May I started an internship in Venture Capital company and have really enjoyed the work I've been doing. I do about 15 hours of work on top of my day-to-day responsibilities at my full-time job. I've also been extended a verbal offer to join a new startup as the first non-founding member as soon as a seed round is raised - so I could start in that role anytime between mid-August and late-September. 

I have a few questions that I'd love to get the community's advice on. 

1. Should I apply Round 1 vs. Round 2? - The benefits of R1 is that it's the earlier round and shows that I am more dedicated to going back to school. My concern is that I'll only have been at my internship for ~3 months at time of application and I will not have been promoted from my previous role. The pros of R2 are that I'll be in my internship for longer than 3 months and have more to talk about that would genuinely add to my story and I will likely be in a higher role at a new company working closely with the founders to grow the business and raise money (which I would assume reaffirms my position of wanting to work in VC). 

2. Should the internship go on my resume? If so, would it go above or below my full time job? Additionally, should I include this internship as a part of my work experience or as an extra curricular activity?
3. If I'm not including the internship on my resume / work experience, can I still have the managing partner write me one of my two recommendations? I believe most schools want this second recommendation to be from a previous employer.

Thanks for all of your help and advice!

928kb0,0,2018-07-26,Internship turning out to be disappointing,yourtmate,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/928kb0/internship_turning_out_to_be_disappointing/,"Hi all!

This summer I was lucky enough to receive my first interview for an internship from an aerospace company in California. I, like many of you engineering students, was so eager just to hear back from any company for an internship. They called me half way through summer, and I thought it was a miracle that I got an interview this late. Long story short, I got the the internship right after the interview, and they asked me to start the week after. 

Here's my dilemma. I've been so excited to get an internship and  see what it's like to work in the engineering field, but as time went on I realized all I was basically doing the majority of the time was slave work. I've gotten my boss coffee, worked on excel documents, made flow charts, and did all the dirty &amp; tedious work people dont want to do. Its boring. I understand that its typical of an intern to do some of those things, but I feel like the majority of my time is going toward those tasks. I'm not learning as much as I could be or want to be. I've asked my manager if I could help out with anything after I've completed all the simple tasks, but no work worth mentioning is given to me. So basically, I'm forced to spend majority of my time in the lab, measuring the same parts using the same lab equipment they have lying around. Some of the concepts I learned in the lab did apply to my major (computer engineering). To be fair, I did learn a lot the first two weeks in the lab and also from just reading about products my company produces. But after those two weeks, the amount I was learning started decreasing significantly.  I just feel like I'm barely making an impact and not learning a lot. 

Does anyone else experience this at their internship, or is it just me? Any advice or questions?

TLDR; I was excited to be an intern to gain experience, but now I'm barely learning anything anymore."

Also on a burner account. I’m currently working for small MSP and have been for around 2 years. Before that I worked a short stint as an intern for a local government office in the nearest major city. I have a bachelors in CIT and a “specialty” in networking and security, paired with a minor in computer forensics. Currently my office has a great environment (mostly because we all enjoy each other’s company), but I am at a real dead end. Because of our size and next to zero going for us in the R&amp;D department, there is almost zero growth happening for myself and my career. Also because of our team size, we don’t have the capacity to really specialize or hammer down on 1 particular strength because we all our becoming a jack of all trades. The downside is we can’t really be ultra proficient at one thing in this environment which most recruiters want to see when applying new places. A lot of what I had learned and was comfortable doing at “intermediate” or higher level in school has really gone to the wayside as most of what I do now does not apply. I let myself get comfortable in this position because it became familiar and like I said before, the people are great. But I had my first real wake up call recently when a random recruiter called me after finding my resume, and soon into the call tells me my skill set is too broad and he does not have a position that I could fill for his company. Now this is only one company but I feel that it may be a common theme. I have applied on and off for these past 2 years to positions that interest me and I for the most part am qualified to do. They have returned almost no response. May be a resume issue, or maybe something worse. Out of probably 60-75 apps, I’ve probably had 4 phone interviews and 2 in person which all led no where. I am applied and awaiting a response on the status of my application to begin back to graduate school for Cyber Security this fall. Security in general is the direction I would really like to head. Does anybody have any ideas to help me take the next step in my career? All advice is welcome and I would be happy to provide you with a copy of my resume to see if you think it could be edited or changed. 

Thanks in advance.

I saw [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/924olj/depressed_about_current_role_and_career_prospect/) today and it really struck a chord with me.

I'd been considering posting to this sub for a while about my concerns if for no other reason than to vent, but I need some level-headed advice and my situation is just distinct enough (though, I wouldn't pretend like I'm anywhere near special) where I feel I should elaborate. Worst case scenario, I've vented to an audience, so thanks in advance.

I graduated in 2014 and spent nearly two years looking for a job. I'd squandered my time in college. Went to class, went home, didn't really do any outside learning or projects. I didn't know what I wanted to do, what type of programming I enjoyed, or what types of fields I may be interested in. My girlfriend did. So she gained experience, and she loved what she was doing.

# Unemployment

I had an internship immediately post-graduation working in an SDET role, and even then I was afraid it would pigeonhole me. The internship didn't last very long, and it wasn't renewed citing ""cultural"" reasons.

This was a bit of a blow to me. It's one thing to say that you don't want to work somewhere (which is what I was intending to do if the internship was offered to renew, because the company simply did not interest me and I figured I shouldn't have too much trouble getting a job), and another thing entirely to have the company say that they don't want you.

I spent the next year and a half applying to positions all over the country with no luck. I kept a record of every application in a spreadsheet and used it to measure stats. This really didn't help. At the same time, my then-girlfriend-now-fiancee was also looking (we graduated together from the same CS program from a college known more for business and law than CS...in fact, I think the CS program was pretty shit, if I may be honest) for positions everywhere.

She got a job first, but I kind of expected that.

# Depression

The job was in middle America, and so we packed our lives up and moved into the middle of nowhere.

And while we lived there, I grew more and more depressed. Over 300 applications while unemployed and approximately 50% of them were simply ignored. I kept stats, remember? I got to speak to a human being 10 times out of ~300 applications. 2 ghosted me, 2 rejected me after the initial phone screen, 6 rejected me after the interview (and I was flown out 2 of those 6 times prior to getting my current job).

This is super common, but the commonality of it doesn't help, it just makes me even more depressed because it feels like an industrial-level behemoth that's insurmountable.

My resume went through a million exploratory iterations. I spent a lot of this time reading things, trying to figure out what I wanted to do so I could focus on that. I began work on a project, and I had no idea where I was going. And I was learning a lot, and it was nice, but it didn't help me feel like I was going anywhere. In this time, the idea for what type of programming I was interested in took shape. I love programming, but only recently have I actually developed _opinions_ about it.

This doesn't help while interviewing (not that I did a lot of that).

At some point, you stop being angry at the industry. At some point, you just start hating yourself. I had trouble getting out of bed every morning, and I knew that I wasn't helping myself. And I hated myself more. And I knew that hating myself would just make the interviewing process more difficult, because nobody wants to hire someone depressed.

I blew at least one interview by just being too honest. I told them that I was struggling to find a job.

# Victory?

When there was no end in sight, I got an interview with a well-known company and was thrilled, but was tempering my expectations. Then I got an onsite. Then I got the job. And in the span of two weeks, my whole world was turned upside-down. I moved with my girlfriend once more from the middle of nowhere to civilization.

The job, though, was for an SDET position. I convinced myself that it wouldn't matter. My internship was with an enterprise development company, whereas this was something completely different. This was a company taking off. They were at the ""grow at all costs"" stage in startup-world, and I was being pulled into that, and that was exciting.

And at first, it was. It was my first real job out of college, and I was nervous and learning new things. The environment was very chaotic, and so I didn't have much interaction with my manager, and I was expecting a manager to mostly delegate. I was one of four full-time employees (two contractors) on the team, and the least senior of the FTE's began serving as my boss, and that was basically okay.

I was enjoying myself learning and my coworkers were all incredibly nice people who were more than willing to listen and help with anything in or out of work.

I made friends and it made me feel good about myself for the first time in years.

Then I started looking through the codebase I would be working on. And I started talking to my coworkers and learning their background. And then my manager started interacting with me more and more.

And I realized why I'd been hired.

# Realization

It was because everyone around me were manual QA people with approximately no development experience to speak of who had risen through the testing ranks. And to them, my basic CS knowledge and mild programming experience was already more than they knew.

And when I realized this, basically everything that had built up for me came crashing down. I continued to learn about the language I was coding in and the more I learned, the more the people around me stayed the same and the more I realized that they had no idea what they were doing and weren't really interested in learning how to program.

Programming was just a means to an end to them. One they were very bad at. I wanted to be surrounded by people I could learn from, because that's what you're supposed to do as an entry-level employee! But I didn't get that. I was constantly teaching the people around me.

It's very easy to read this as me being just kind of an arrogant asshole, and I'm not sure how to convince you otherwise but please read this charitably. I'm just a junior developer. The one thing I'm sure of is how little I know.

I need to be learning, and at some point, I stopped learning at work. I try to be aware of developments in the language that I work with and I try to keep in mind other languages and fields outside of work. But there's nothing at work that will help me grow except what I can teach myself.

There's no freedom to experiment. There are no clear requirements. There is no time management. Everything is the most important thing, and everything must be done yesterday. We never have time for improvements. A month after I started, I brought up the technical debt in the system and said that we needed to reevaluate things and it was met simultaneously with ""we don't have any technical debt"" and ""even if we do have technical debt, we don't have time to fix it right now, because we need more features."" And there is no delegation, because my manager believes he's far more technically capable than he actually is.

My manager thinks questions like ""what's the difference between `.Equals()` and `==`?"" are tricky interview questions.

It gets worse and worse over time, and there's no solid foundation upon which to build new features. Everything is hacked in. Bugs abound and the number of bugs only grows over time. When I was finally allowed to do some cleanup work at one point, it was under a constant time crunch with no freedom to evaluate different ideas or experiment, and with three people put on the job that one person could do in a day. Everything is waterfall under the guise of agile development.

# Pressure

And over time, my manager began putting more and more pressure on me. I have sat him down on two separate occasions and told him that I feel I have too much pressure put on me to design and architect the entire system and all new features. I have been given way more responsibility than I feel comfortable with, and that persists no matter how I try to address it with my manager. And it's simply because there's no one else in a position to take that responsibility. I'm the most technically competent of the full-time employees, and my manager simply cannot delegate a lead role to any of the senior contractors or our senior SDET (who is a full-time employee).

The pressure and the frustration with my coworkers grew over time, and I'm ashamed to say that I have grown to hate my coworkers. I love them all as people, but I hate them all as coworkers. Our developers cannot develop. Our manager cannot manage. Our lab manager cannot do basic troubleshooting. And I do not want to feel this way anymore. I'm emotionally, mentally, and physically exhausted.

I have come home and broken down in my fiancee's arms.

I used to help each new contractor become acquainted with our environment. I used to help them set things up/installing what they would need. I would teach them what they needed to know about git to start working. I would respond to the repetitious questions with the joy of teaching and helping my team get better.

And now I'm universally avoided. I have always worn my emotions on my sleeve, and now I can barely answer a question without snapping. I'm impatient and rude, and I'm hating myself more and more because of it. Over the past few months, I have begun to feel more and more as I did when I was unemployed. The same types of self-hatred.

I feel like what we're doing is pointless and won't go anywhere. In two years, my team which should be providing support to the entire company for the testing efforts that the company may have is barely used except through enforcement by upper management. My team is woefully understaffed and mostly through a basic misunderstanding of the role that my team is supposed to play and what it requires. My manager has squandered the full-time positions he's had open, and has lost them to time. He's struggling to hire new contractors, and those that he does are barely capable.

Two full-time employees have left my team to transfer to a different team citing my manager as the number one reason. And yet, my manager fought as hard as he could to block both of their transfers. And I'm 100% positive that if I tried to transfer (which is itself a difficulty as none of the on-paper skills that my team should have are relevant to basically any other team in the company), my manager would block it.

# Everything Again

In these last two years, I've solidified what type of programming I want to do and it is as far away from testing as I could possibly get. And it's as far from web development as I could possibly get as well. So when I began applying for positions, I began applying for jobs that I wanted. 

I began applying some months ago, and I've had some more luck than I did previously, but it's a very similar feeling to when I was unemployed. The silence is deafening. And I'm working full-time, so I can't even be as productive as I was when I was unemployed on the application front. I've been ghosted, I've been ignored, the vast majority of the time I'm just rejected without a phone screen, the same as I was when I was unemployed.

I got called by Google, and was thrilled, and then I realized that their interview process is so ridiculous that I would basically need to study everything I learned when I was in college all over again, and then some more. And I simply don't have the time unless I decide that I want to be even more miserable than I already am. The only thing that's keeping me sane is the fact that I have my fiancee and my cats to come home to.

I know I should work on side projects at home, continue to build up my resume, develop it into something that contains more work directed towards the field that I want to get into. But it's so hard when you're so beaten up from work. I just want to lay on my couch and veg out.

# Coda

I'm at the point where I feel I need to leave. If for no other reason than my own emotional health. But it's hard, because my fiancee has already supported me once before, and while we have a lot more money saved up now, it just feels irresponsible. So I'm slogging away. Every morning I struggle to get out of bed. Every night, I dread going to sleep. I often lie awake struggling to keep myself from crying because of just how utterly and completely trapped and helpless I feel.

This brings me to today, and me posting this seeking advice. I honestly don't know, and I honestly feel trapped. There's so much more I could talk about and rant. So much I could say about what I love about programming and how I feel so little of it is being tested, tried, or tempered working where I currently am. So much I could say about how I feel about the industry's hiring practices. But there's not enough time.

If you've read all of this, you have all of my thanks. If you didn't, then I understand.

What do you think I should do (besides get professional help, since yes...obviously :-P)?"

I am also working on side projects of my own accord to get more comfortable with python, R, and some SQL. I honestly am not totally sure what to expect from here. Should I expect getting an internship to be somewhat easy or at all? If I have a degree, personal projects, and a good internship is it likely that I can turn that into a good job right when I get my diploma? Also with only a BS should I expect to just be a data analyst/engineer instead of a data scientist? Will I have to go back for a MS in Stats or similar field to move up in DS?

I'm aware these questions are very much based on how well I can write code and problem-solve as well as my pure knowledge but I am just trying to get a feel of the general climate of how things move.

If it helps at all, I go to UCI so I know Irvine has lots of job and internship opportunities that many other universities don't have due to the many corporate and big business headquarters located here."

I'm getting my Bachelor's in CompSci and will be starting my Junior year in September. I spent the better half of this summer building and learning more about web applications, but I want my career after uni to be in Network Administration and eventually Engineering. 

So, I've been getting my resume shaped up to apply for internships in the Fall with no work experience, and was wondering if it would be worth spending the next two months studying to get an entry-level cert like the CCENT or AWS Cloud Practitioner.

I know that there's a bit of stigma towards viewing a cert as a replacement for experience, but I think my resume looks a little barren without either. What's your guys' opinion on this? Do company's expect (or prefer) applying students to have low level certs like these? How helpful would you generally say they are for getting past screening and into an interview?

* I graduated with CS degree in May 

* I have internship experience 

* Hired at a company that deals a lot with money, pays fairly well, I would say average

* Position is a Product Manager, been here for almost 2 months


**Company Problems:**

* The organization is terrible/non existent

* Communication is through mail chains that I end up not reading or delete

* My mentor is vague and gone for most of the days. I’ve reached out for information many times but still get nothing back

* The agile process is unstructured and inconsistent through the org

* The team I joined is far behind leaving me with stories that I don’t know and not enough information

**My Thoughts:**

* I’m not enjoying this role (idk if it’s the team, or what)

* Debating switching to a dev role, I’m very young is this industry

* It’s too early so I might suck it up, but why do that if I want to change roles

* I don’t see myself investing time with this company

Before I dive into my question I want to tell a little background of myself.

I am currently 24 years old and graduated college last year in May 2017 with a degree in chemical engineering.  I had a few jobs including an internship at a lab for a company in a non-related field to my major.

After graduation, I did not have a job lined up and I had a tough time finding a job in my field due to my sub par GPA and lack of relevant experience. I decided to apply to lab positions since I have experience from my internship, and just like that I was receive several interview. As I was interviewing, one company stood out to me since what they do is directly related to a project I worked on for nearly a year so I thought it would be a good fit for me, and thus I accepted the offer for the Lab Technician position as a contractor. My thought process at the time of accepting the offer was I would be interested in this stuff and I can gain knowledge and skills and be exposed to other O&amp;G companies. 

At first everything was going smoothly at my job; I was learning a lot very fast and was able to work on my own within a month. I started to notice that my direct manager was a bit controlling and was nitpicking at me and and pretty much everyone else within the company. I soon learned that my department was the most hated and a lot of blame was placed on us and I believe it is in retaliation to my manager. My manager was recently promoted leaving me with some of his old task, which I don't mind since it is a way for me to learn and work with more senior people, but now it feels like my department has an even bigger target on our back. I am normally a very calm and relax person, but since I started working here I find myself to be more anxious and angry

I have a few coworkers that I have a good relationship with, one of them is in a pretty high position at the company, and they recently told me they were planning on leaving the company within a year. It got me thinking about whether or not I really want to be here. I have been contemplating leaving even though I do not have anything else lined up. The work environment has gotten more hostile lately and I feel that it is not going to let down. I don't want to work where I am constantly unhappy, and I do not mind being unemployed for a little while, but my question is would it look bad if I leave only after about 8 month into my first real job after college?

92f4lk,1,2018-07-27,"Part 3 of my adventures with my program, or: How I Spent This Week Depressed and Confused.",newbud,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/92f4lk/part_3_of_my_adventures_with_my_program_or_how_i/,"Warning: LONG post ahead.

So, I posted previous [part one here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/80nkoc/can_i_get_some_perspective/) and [part two here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/8g2svq/can_i_get_some_perspective_part_2/). The TL;DR of it is that I have been considering leaving grad school for about 9 months now, and went to my advisor in early March to express my concerns. One of my major concerns was that I was falling behind in the program due to some really severe burnout after my master's was completed in December 2017. She convinced me to stay saying that I was so close to finishing and agreeing to help with some of the lab stress I was under. But I was still miserable, my self esteem was shot, etc.

Back up to January 2018. We receive progress letters every semester detailing what we did well, what standing we're in, etc. My letter said that unless I made significant progress on my prelims (lolwhut I had JUST defended my Master's the month before this letter) I would not be eligible for good standing. Ok, so I busted my ass during Spring 2018 to get a proposal ready despite being scooped several times and having to start over. I propose with an idea that my advisor fully approved, and fail - with her being one of my biggest critics. During this time, I also bought + moved into a new house, am planning a wedding, and my father was involved in a serious car accident. But that's neither here nor there. 

So, I receive my semesterly letter from Spring 2018. I don't expect it to be particularly good, but I was astounded at how bad it was. I am a student on probation, and the condition for getting off of probation is that I: propose and defend my prelim, propose my dissertation, and apply for internship by October 1. WAT.

My director of training contacts me and suggests we set up a conference call between myself, him, and my advisor to discuss this. This is also the DCT that openly commented on my weight when I was underweight due to stress - so I'm not his biggest fan. He also tried to push my labmate out of grad school due to her disability, but ya know.

Awesome, so we have this call. Most of it was him talking and my advisor not coming to my aid in the slightest, which isn't a surprise at this point but still stung. The message was that it is probably nearly impossible to complete these things by October 1st, and that I should consider whether I should simply exit the program as a master's level student. The reasoning behind this is that I did not come to my advisor with a dissertation idea within the week after our early March conversation, and that I have made very little progress on my prelims. (Side note: I have been editing the proposal since the failed one, but advisor refuses to look at the manuscript and didn't give me any direction other than telling me to think about whether it ""contributes anything of value to the scientific community"", and asking me to consider starting over from scratch) I was honestly floored by this, and astounded by the audacity that he could suggest this so soon after I was vehemently assured I was not falling behind. I expressed this to him as calmly as I could, and was responded to by saying that that early March meeting was meant to ""light a fire"" under me to get me back to work. Which it did (sort of - I was still burned out and miserable bc, ya know, burnout doesn't work like that).

I also expressed that my master's data collection was delayed by 2 semesters even though I proved to my advisor that the data I had had enough power for the analyses I wanted to run (it was a unilateral decision on her part). No real response to this, so we ended the conversation basically saying that I had a lot of thinking to do. My advisor and DCT ended saying that they would discuss options with the faculty and give me a more reasonable timeline.

The thing is...it was very pointedly expressed to me that after 2 semesters on probation, I would no longer be in good standing, and at that point I am eligible for dismissal from the program. They also said that there are really no solutions this summer that would result in me being taken off of probation. I questioned whether this was simply a catch-22 to get me out of the program no matter what I did, which was responded to vehemently by saying that it was not the case. Given how previous vehement responses have gone, I don't particularly trust that.

So, here is where I am left...try to continue and be potentially miserable for the next 2-3 years doing something I hate with people I dislike, but get a PhD out of it. Or...leave now and live my best life, whatever that is. That means that I admit to all of my family and friends what happened, and deal with the potential lifelong regret. I also have no idea what I could do...I can't get licensed to practice (my field is psychology) with a master's, and there are very few university- or research-related positions that require a master's and not a PhD.

Listen, I get that I haven't been the best student for the past few months. I haven't been working as hard as I need to, and I've let family/life stuff get in the way. I get that. But I can't be THAT bad...right? Like I submitted a manuscript + R&amp;R, defended my master's and proposed my prelims all within the last 8 or so months. I've been burned out and depressed, but I can't help thinking that I just can't be THAT bad. My advisor said that I should think about the fact I don't have a dissertation idea nailed down yet, and that might be an indication of my commitment. She also hasn't mentioned dissertation at all to me, has not initiated any emails on any topic whatsoever (radio silence basically), and I was never told either orally, implicity, or in written form that this was expected of me before I had even successfully proposed my prelims.

Can someone bring me down to earth? I'm rambling I know, but that's kind of the state my mind is in right now."

As of now, I am the only intern software dev but that might soon change. 

A higher up, whom we’ll call Bill, from a different department is good friends with our lead dev, whom we’ll call Jeff, and was able to convince Jeff to look for a position for his 17 year old son who has gotten into programming. Jeff sent Bill’s son a simple task and Bill’s son completed it. Jeff then brought in Bill’s son for an interview and is likely going to offer Bill’s son a spot and create new intern position out of thin air.

I have no problem with a new member of the team but the thing is our workspace has absolutely no room for another desk. My desk barely fits and the room is truly at maximum capacity. I’m starting to believe that I’m going to be forced to share my desk and be forced to pair program and work on other tasks than then the ones I’ve spent a lot of time on. 

This is really discouraging because I was trying to bring my best effort everyday and maybe get a job offer at the end of my internship but the adding of another intern and then being forced to pair program feels like slap in the face or a demotion.

I’m not the best programmer, but not the worst. I get my tasks done. I got the internship because I wanted to learn and get better but now I feel like my boss Jeff and other teammates don’t think I’m good enough to work on my own. Should I tough it out for the last month of my internship or should I just walk away because it’s something that was never mentioned when I took the job? 

TL;DR: A 2nd intern position was created due to nepotism in my department that might end up forcing me to pair program after working on my own for the majority of my internship. Should I quit because I only have a month left or should I stay because I only have a month left?

I've learned that the business team wants interactivity and real-time data connections but IT doesn't want a business person doing any of those things. Can't blame either side. I would agree with them both but sadly I'm stuck in the middle. If I do throw together an app with real-time data connections I can't share it because no one else has the credentials or software to run it. So I'm just wondering if anyone else out there ended up in a job somewhere between business and developer, misunderstood by both, but somehow managing to get the job done. How do you do it and what tools do you use? 

I ask because I'm debating on investing time in learning the .Net framework to build web applications since it seems to be a nice compromise. The company I work for now has Microsoft deeply embedded in everything from the database to the company intranet with support for all of it. It's an internship though so I don't want to assume it's this way everywhere. Thought I'd ask here before I sink time into something that might turn out to be pointless."

How will it affect career prospects?,csthrowaway23445,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/92k1au/should_i_graduate_early_with_computer_science/,"I've got a difficult decision to make here of whether I should continue my Software Engineering degree or graduate early with a Computer Science degree and I'm trying to find out how this decision will impact career options.

As some backstory I was in my final year of a Software Engineering degree but in the previous semester I failed a unit which has led to a fork in the road. The unit that I failed was a core unit that is only offered in semester 1 and was the prerequisite to the last core unit that I need to complete to finish the degree alongside 2 electives so that I would be finished at the end of this semester. Because I failed that unit it means that to finish the degree I have to wait around and complete those two units 1 per semester next year so it will extend the length of my degree by a year. 

However after talking to my course adviser it turns out I have  another option if I want to finish this semester, I can graduate with a Bachelor of Computer Science as there is only 2 units left that I would need to do to complete that degree and they are bother offered this semester.

Other details that are worth mentioning are that to complete the Software Engineering degree I also need to find and complete a 12 week internship as that is a part of the engineering accreditation requirement. Also the units that I will need to complete are an EE networking unit and a CS distributed computing unit whereas the units I need to complete for the CS degree are an advanced programming and data structures unit and a computing theory unit. It may also be worth mentioning that if I choose to graduate with the CS degree it will make 4 of the units that I've already completed redundant as they are not required for completing the CS degree.

So what I'm wondering is if it would be more advantageous to find a job with a software engineering degree + engineers accreditation by sticking around at college for another year or if I'm better off graduating with a computer science degree at the end of this semester and looking for jobs now? How will the difference in the degrees affect graduate positions now and career pathways in the future?

TL;DR

Should I stay at college for 1 extra year to repeat the unit I failed in semester one again and complete the final unit I need  in semester two to graduate with a software engineering degree or should I complete the final two units of the CS degree and graduate at the end of this semester with a CS degree instead and how will either choice affect my career immediately and in the future?"

I really don't enjoy coding though I will struggle through it, it's just not something I actively want to do. I am taking my main EE course called Digital Systems II that involves learning Verilog/VHDL but I think since that's more heavily focused on actually doing stuff EE wise rather than just getting a project for C and coding a game or something.

I'm just trying to figure out what I want to do as an EE, but I feel I'll get a better idea once I do co ops and internships. 

Any suggestions besides if you don't like coding get out would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Also, instead of coursework what about jobs? "

I'm just wondering what the interview process is like for those that did an internship as part of a CS course in 3rd year. Are the interviews the same as how it works in regards to whiteboarding and/or take-home problems? If so, what is the difficulty level like; are they on the same level as Junior position interview problems? What is the best way to prepare right now for them?

Also, what is the pay like for these internships assuming it isn't something like Amazon?

92kmak,1,2018-07-28,Video game industry advice?,mavcon75,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/92kmak/video_game_industry_advice/,"So here’s the (hopefully short) backstory. I went to college to get a degree for game design and this was from 2007-10. I got a bachelors degree in 3 years while still doing two jobs. At the time I graduated I had just missed honors for graduation by a letter grade and my school had my resume and portfolio to help place me.

After graduation, though, I felt almost as though I didn’t learn enough from my time there so I looked at Academy of Art (keeping in mind that Game Design as a major was still not all that common) and was told that since I have a bachelors I can only take Master level classes.

I had to keep checking with my original school and kept applying everywhere....for years.....even for QA jobs because, again, I felt I needed to learn more and wanted to be with an actual company so I know I’m learning what I need to. The school didn’t send me potential openings, I had to contact them repeatedly just for basic info, and the school now no longer exists :-/

I want to be a level designer primarily, but since the “education” I got from my school literally only seemed to get me huge debt (by the way, the school since I left had over 1/2 million complaints about various things including getting accreditation removed a year after I left) I just need to find a way in to QA to do....something

The school courses never did any real internships and never had classes on QA or the programs that are being used and since every “entry-level” post needs 1-2 experience, how can I get experience to get these jobs when I can’t get the jobs to get the experience? Even if I download JIRA or Bugzilla, it’s not like I’ll have anything to test it with....at least not that I know and I still don’t have the actual job experience with it....


Short version is....help? Anyone? Suggestions?"

So when it comes the time to select projects to showcase in my resume, I get very confused. But this is crucial for making my resume fit in one page, so that's why I was looking for some guidance.

Maybe you can go through my online resume pages here and then tell me which projects should be included?

- https://sumit-ghosh.com/resume-academic

I have done an additional project which isn't mentioned there in the resumes (as I did it in the summers, and the resumes are made before that), and that is —  A Python program which goes through a string containing math expressions as well as normal text—think a math textbook—and separates them, by tagging chunks as  math or text, whichever appropriate.

You can also go through my Github [here](https://github.com/SkullTech) and recommend if any project there is worth adding to the resume.

Also, to clarify, I am in my 3rd year right now and I'm preparing for summer 2019 internships. I'm planning to make a decent resume and then start applying as soon as possible.

92q2ud,1,2018-07-28,Is it possible to get good letters of recommendation without research?,IcyViolin,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/92q2ud/is_it_possible_to_get_good_letters_of/,"Questions begin at the second to last paragraph.  


I am an undergraduate pursuing computer science and engineering and business management dual degree and would like to eventually apply to CS masters programs. My main concern for my application is letters of recommendation. I will have to write an honors thesis, so I can ask my thesis adviser for one letter. I will also be taking at least one graduate class during my senior year, so I can ask the professor of that class for my second letter, but I don't know who I should ask for the third. Additionally, I think it will be risky to assume that the first two professors will even write me a favorable letter.  


The obvious answer would be to join a lab or research group, but I will already be taking a very high course load almost every semester and need my summers for internships and additional courses. My current plan is to graduate with a dual degree, take classes full-time the first summer (15+ credits), get internships after both sophomore and junior year, and work in the industry for a year or two before applying to graduate programs.

I will probably be targeting masters programs that are not research based, as I don't think I'll need to apply to PhD programs. I do not intend on trying to become a professor or pursuing academia as a career.  


What are some ways to get LoR without doing research with a professor? Is it even possible to get a good letter without doing research? By good, I mean capable of helping a student get into a top 10 program.  I have a great GPA and intend to keep it that way, but I would assume that graduate programs wouldn't care about LoR from professors whom simply know me as a good student. Is this always true?  


Alternatively, should I just suck it up and do research with a professor? I'm already worried about burning out and I would probably only be doing it for the letter of recommendation. Honestly, I do think I would be interested in the research, but there's no real benefit other than the LoR and connecting with people in the lab. I was not awarded work-study, so I would not get paid. I would have to dedicate a lot of time, which would take away from school, the clubs I'm interested in, and side projects. Lastly, the experience itself will likely not significantly further my career, as I plan to work in the industry, where internships are more important."

I've been hesitant to post on here. I usually hate sharing my problems with others and asking for help but this is too much imo.

I'm sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors in this post, I wrote this in a Stream of consciousness kinda format.

I'm 21m in college out of state and i returned home for the summer after 3yrs of school. I study mechanical engineering and have a very difficult curriculum. I came back home because I couldn't get an internship at the company I applied due to me dropping a failing class that i needed. I returned home because I have had bad experiences taking any class over the summer at this university. My mother and I don't get along very well because we are very different people, she grew up in a Hispanic culture and then moved to the US and I grew up in the US culture, she is very religious while I am not (you can say I'm atheist) we disagree on a plethora of other topics. My parents are divorced and my father moved out they both had issues and both made mistakes 

Our issue is that my mother wants to be included in everything i do in my life, no privacy, no personal anything, none of that. She wants to know everything that is going in my life every minute every day and try to give me advice on anything im studying or working on. I do not like including many people in my life, i like to be alone and be able to work on things on my own ( I read Deep Work by Cal Newport over a year ago and and have been implementing the lessons taught in my workflow since I was constantly working distracted you can also say I'm introverted too) and by myself (If the job permits). I tried explaining that I do not like it when she tries to include herself in every single aspect of my life, I am willing to let her be part of my life but it has become so overbearing that I can't take it anymore. Every time i try to explain things I always get told that everyone on the planet does this and don't have a problem with it, or I'm weird and i should just accept it, or \*insert religious reason here\* or in most cases, she thinks that I think that she is at fault for the divorce and i hate her (which is not true, the divorce was both of their faults imo) and i am like my father or i just hate her. I showed her that most of my friends don't have their parents as involved in their lives as she wants (idk about a majority of the population) and i explained to her that i think they were both at fault for the divorce. I also try on multiple occasions to explain that i'm out here trying to be self-reliant and get my own education and build my own career and make my own income. I would like to have her as part of my life but she just steps way over the line, every time I'm studying something here or doing some physical activity she tries to appoint her own agenda it seems. Its always ""no do it this way."" 

What can i do or say to stop this overbearing-ness? I get that she wants to make sure I'm okay but I'm extremely responsible and capable. Have I done anything wrong?

title is self-explanatory. i've met some of the most amazing people &amp; professors at my current college, and have gotten to explore a number of fields i'm interested in through getting involved in a professional frat, cultural orgs, an internship with a lab, and theatrical productions. i've established which of my interests i want to pursue more seriously and which are hobbies for my off time, and i've done fairly well - though definitely not 4.0 status - academically while staying involved socially. i also received a sizable scholarship from my current school, the main reason i chose it over some of my other, more ""well-recognized"" options.

honestly, i feel crazy for even considering leaving, rendering everything i've worked for kind of (?) a moot point. i know, i know, i know there is grad school. i know college is what you make of it. but i can't help but wonder the possibilities at other schools that more coherently combine my two primary interests, computer science &amp; english. there are no joint majors at my school and i don't want to develop a lopsided understanding of both, i'd like to delve equally into each subject without worrying about whether one receives more time/attention than the other. consequently, i've been looking into programs with a strong stem &amp; liberal arts curriculum that support joint majors between stem + humanities subjects. i'm also yearning for smaller class environments, given that my current school is a large public school, to enable me to meet more people in my classes/major + minor instead of solely through extracurriculars.

i know this is a pretty bare-bones overview, and i might not even stand a fair chance at such programs given my not-spotless gpa, but i'd really appreciate advice: if you were in my position, would transferring even be in your mind? or would you still want to make the best of all the blessings you've made/were given at your current school?

92r6o2,6,2018-07-28,I hate my co-worker. Any advice?,TrlrPrrkSupervisor,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/92r6o2/i_hate_my_coworker_any_advice/,"So the company has a practice where they hire their interns in pairs and so I was hired at the same time as this girl, lets call her ""X."" She is very annoying, some of it is subtle and underhanded but in other ways its a bit more overt so I figure I'll give you a list of some of the things she does and maybe you guys can give me some advice? I'm just going into 4th year at school so this internship is great experience but its really my first real job so learning how to deal with people I don't particularly like is important.

1. Courtesies I extend to her are not reciprocated. I live closer to work then her, she has a tougher commute than me so when we have early morning meetings with our manager and I get there first, I make a point to not engage in serious work talk until she arrives. The few times I show up to work 15 minutes late for whatever reason, she starts the meeting without me and needs to ""catch me up."" Just a small annoyance because she makes it a big deal when I'm late and makes sure the boss notices, but I don't do the same thing to her when I could a lot more often.
2. Doesn't discuss things with me before going to the manager. Sometimes we will be given vague instructions like ""make this process easier for me..."" So we will divide up the work and get our portions of it done. While we're in the middle of working, the manager may come by and check on us and she immediately starts criticizing my methods before even discussing things with me. Clearly I have a reason for doing things the way I wanted to and now I'm on the defensive because the first thing the boss hears about my work is how much X hates it. This gets on my nerves. Talk to me before going to the boss.
3. She tries to boss me around when we are in fact equals. We will be assigned some work and she will immediately get into ""ok... so you're going to do this, and I'm going to do that..."" I don't like this because I believe these things should be a discussion so I've made it a point that at every point she does this, it doesn't matter what she says, it could be a perfectly reasonable way of approaching the work but I will say no. Just because of the way she goes about it, I will refuse and come up with a reason why later ahahahahaha. It leads to hostile arguments from time to time but you are not my boss, you are not smarter than me, and you will not take charge and just make decisions like that. How would you guys handle this ahahaha? Is my way a little too petty?
4. She makes no effort to form relationships with other members of the company and so when there are situations where we are not working and are supposed to be socializing with other employees, she clings to me. I don't mind helping out someone who is a little socially awkward, I am by no means a socially adept person so I can empathize with that but she very clearly doesn't like me and takes every opportunity to make some comment against me. An example of this was there was another employee at the company and it turned out we went to the same program at the same school so we got to talking about this prof and that prof and we both dropped a few ""fucks"" and ""shits"" and she is on the side not saying anything for the whole convo and then in the middle decides to interject to tell me to watch my language. So now I make a point to ditch her in these situations and she ends up sitting around alone or standing in a group silently.
5. SHE STINKS! She does not care about her appearance or her hygiene and if you are within a 5 meter radius of her you will know. Unfortunately for me, my desk is close enough.
6. I am of Indian decent but I am Canadian born. X was born in India and there was this other employee, one who is really high up in the organization who is Indian born too, and the other employee and I developed a banter where she makes ""coconut"" jokes to me and I make FOB jokes back at her. X finds the coconut jokes hilarious but when I fire off FOB jokes she actually gets triggered and pissed off. The older employee laughs just fine, she can take a joke and she dishes it out too but X actually gets angry which is just so annoying. 

There are cool people at this office that I like a lot but X just ruins every social interaction for me that she is involved in. We were hired in a pair together so its tough enough as it is to ditch her but I do when I can. She is also a very small, very unattractive person physically and I worry that people who don't see our dynamic in context will think I am bullying her if I continue to ditch her or tell her I have a problem with her so I don't really know how to approach this. I can't go aggressive on her because of the optics, even if it would scare her into the correct behaviour and I can't let things continue either.

What are your thoughts? How would you deal with this person?"

I always liked webdev, and getting to graduation I realized ""I have no unique skills"" and turns out no one does from just going to college. Turns out college is just about learning ideas/concepts/learning to learn, etc. 

So I said **""web dev is it, i have some experience and I will have this be my first path""**

I started learning different technologies and tools to make my **""generic college resume""** into a **""job ready resume""** [and got an entry low paying internship for now]


Turns out there is so many things to learn and I'm learning everyday...

---

Meanwhile, a bunch of peers that have the same degree didn't do that and banked on getting jobs/internships from their generic college resume. 

They have positions as ""business analysts"" which is super vague and generic. They do some sql code, write some reports, maybe write some C#, but that's all. They already have job offers for these vague postitions too 

So I'm looking back seeing that I chose webdev, and wondering **did I make the wrong decision?** I'm having to learn new things everyday at work, constantly trying to improve and I know I am **FAR AWAY from being a ""professional"" in webdev**

A lot of my free time is dedicated to improving in webdev, while my peers are the opposite, and never had unique skills/projects to show for. (yeah, kind of jealous)

---

In addition, hearing older IT guys in management say ""yeah I was just some small nobody that was a developer and I made petty money, so your developers are on the bottom of the totem pole"" or saying things like ""web development is a nice start but you don't want to stay there, unless you are okay with low pay""

**this made me think: ""should I have stayed away from webdev and just tried to get into these vague IT roles that my peers are? Is webdev at the bottom of the totem pole? Maybe I should have done whatever they did to get those types of jobs**

I spoke with my manager(great guy, I'm confident he's being honest), and he's interested in hiring me. 

There's a catch though -- because the way the hiring process at said company works, I would have to be able to say yes by this September, meaning I won't have time to interview/get offers from anywhere else, before I would have to decide on the offer. If I can't do that by September, then it becomes an issue of whether or not he loses his hiring ""chits"". He said it's less than 50/50 that he'll still be able to hire.

He told me that I could expect to be paid ~85k a year, with a sign on bonus as well (that varies depending on the whims of upper management -- anywhere from 5k to 20k).

My initial plan was to apply to places through the academic year, get an idea of what they're offering, and try to accept an offer by the Spring semester. Obviously, I have some time, but not a ton to decide.  Any advice?"

I'm in kind of a tricky situation right now. I'm not a US Citizen/GC holder, but it looks like I'm about to be after the immigration department finalizes my case (they essentially said I'll have my GC as long as my health exam comes through).

I'm graduating in Dec. 2018 with a degree in CS and Statistics, but I won't be eligible for work (i.e. have my GC) until September - October, and from past experiences with internship applying, companies generally don't care about your ""expected GC date"" if you don't have it currently. Looks like my worst-case timeline is to start applying for jobs mid October to November.

How big of a disadvantage would I be at if I do end up applying for jobs in October-ish? I lack any formal work experience due to my legal status here (no work authorization), but I do have freelance work experience building a database/sales forecasting system for a medium-large store, and a few projects tailored around ML stuff using raspberry pi/TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, etc. My GPA is sub 3.0.

My plan is to start grinding the hell out of LeetCode/CTCI starting this week, while continuing to work on a few side projects.

Would it be far-fetched to expect to find a job by the end of December/mid January if I do end up start applying in October?

Also, if anyone here has some legal expertise, do you think I should just ""lie"" and say that I'm eligible for work, and just start applying now?

Thank you.

tl;dr - might not be able to start applying to jobs until October due to immigration. I lack internships, but do have freelance work/projects, sub 3.0 GPA. Is it unlikely I'll be employed by the end of Dec./mid January?

I am a 28 year old located in the US with a previous bachelor's degree in psychology. For the last 4 years I  have been working in education, but I have started to make a transition away from that and towards CS. I have done 3 semesters of undergrad CS and Math courses, and have found that I really enjoy the world of Computer Science. I have been learning on C++, and have completed Data Structures as well as the intermediate programming class.

However after doing the math I calculated that even after these 3 semesters of work, and my previous undergraduate degree, that graduating with an undergraduate BS degree in CS was still 2.5 - 3 years off. On a whim, I  applied to my public state college's masters in CS program and got in.

I have a lot of trepidation and fears about this path, and I'm wondering if anyone can provide their own experience or knowledge on if this is going to a viable path. If I go into this Master's program it will take me about 3 years to finish, due to the fact that I still have 3 undergrad classes to take as well as the graduate courses. That means that I will be 31 when I graduate with this degree. To supplement the fact that I have not worked in the tech industry before, I will be seeking out internships while I work on this degree.

Another consideration is that I'm already shouldering a large amount of undergrad debt (\~30k) from the previous CS/math semesters and a previous unrelated summer semester as well. The massive amount of debt from college makes me feel very uncomfortable.

I know that self-teaching is an option, but that my pay will be lower and that my opportunities will be fewer.

I have also considered the boot camp option, and understand that it is viable, but that the long term benefits won't be as good as having a degree.

Will this masters degree actually be useful and pay itself off? Or is self teaching the better option due to the high cost of higher education in the US? If anyone has any thoughts for me to consider it would be greatly appreciated, as at this point in time I don't feel confident.

Thanks"

My university is amazing at setting students up with internships, but I am wondering what I should learn outside of school to better prepare myself for the internship/industry.

I hear certificates help with getting a job, should I pursue any of these along with my bachelors? A+? CCNA? Security+? OSCP? I know that I am not ready to take any of these at the moment, but hope someone can steer me in the right direction so eventually I can if needed.

I do not know what I want to do in the IT field, but maybe I’ll try to get a help desk job to get a feel. I’ve been looking into jobs that have growth and won’t get automated. Cloud Systems Admin, Security Analyst, and DevOps seem like good candidates. What do you think?

I plan on learning more programming languages so I have a marketable skill. I know a little bit of C; and I want to learn Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I hear I should learn about Powershell and Bash as well. Good to learn or no?

I have been employed full time for 3 months now since graduating at a job I'm not liking very much. I've been applying for other positions and had a call with one position that I was looking forward to. It's closer to where I live and the pay is better and more of what I'm interested in. I got a message last week asking about my current position and why I'm leaving, and I gave my explanation. The problem is that I didn't hear back from them yet (I left the message Thursday night, was expecting a follow up Friday). 


Should I take my current position off my resume so I don't look like I'm job hopping? My only other experience is an internship and a couple of projects (I'm in engineering) so I feel I wouldn't be as competitive. I'm going to follow up with an email to the person I had a call with to see what's up, and I'm hoping it pans out."

I went back to school and graduated with a CS degree so i’m in my late 20’s. 

The Job search was kinda hard because i waited until March and didn't really do any studying of CTCI or Leetcode plus i had no internships. Out of like a hundred applications only a couple interviews and only two offers. 

I got an offer from a large telecom company for their new grad 18 month rotational program. Good pay and good benefits. 

I was told my first 6 months would be a data engineer position where i would learn big data frameworks and technologies; and my next 6 months would be with a dev ops team(in my preferred location at their HQ), then the last 6 months i would get to choose the team i want to work on. 

I'm about 2 months into the ""data engineer"" position and all i'm doing is SQL and power bi dashboards. With some light perl and python scripting to automate some things the engineers request. This is all the position is. The team i’m with is all radio/network engineers so i’m not getting good mentorship in software engineering like they promised. 

And now they're telling me for my second rotation i won’t be going to the dev ops team. Instead i’ll go to another team and will do the same stuff i’m doing now. They say my 3rd rotation i can still go to the dev ops team if i want. 

What should i do? I’m starting to hate going to work and feel lied to. 

Stay for a year and if i don’t get to go to the dev ops team at least it looks good on my resume then i can switch jobs? Plus it gives me time to really study leetcode type questions. And maybe add one more interesting project on my resume.

or just start looking now? "

The position I have is $17/hr to work 32-40 hours a week from home. There are no health benefits and no paid sick days. I am the only full-time employee of this non-profit. I have many different responsibilities, and I am constantly behind schedule due to picking up more and more roles. In my contract, it states that they expect 3 months warning before my departure. I really feel like no one would be able to take on my role in that time. I have given a year's notice to leave July 2019. We are looking for an unpaid intern for three month term to hopefully hire when I will leave. It seems unlikely that this will happen.

On this trip I slept in the same room as my boss. And when we swiched to an AirBnB situation, she asked me to sleep in the same bed. I refused and slept on the couch for a week. My boss is in her 70s and cannot drive, so I drove her to our meetings, at times being on the road for 5 hours to get back and forth from meetings. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were with her because she had no way of finding and getting to restaurants.

In submiting my invoice for my past month of work, it comes up that I cannot bill for networking socials which were on our itenerary. This amounts to two days of work between travel and time worked. We represented the company at these events. They were work to me. On top of this I am not allowed to bill for travel time, though a full travel day from airport to hotel was over 13 hours of my time. Times that by two; that is another two days that I could not work. 

I invoiced 40 hours a week, and my Boss has been calling me all weekend to adjust it to less. 

When I got home I was sick for two days and still worked half days because I don't have sick-day benefits.

What do I do? I'm worried that if I don't press the matter, I will lose money when I have bills due. I'm worried that if I have a backbone on this my reference will vanish. I feel like I deserve more but I don't know how to represent myself."

My brother currently is running his own startup so he's not making any money, just enough to pay his rent and bills but no savings. 

I finish school in April 2019 so I'm trying to plan ahead. At that time, my options would be: rent a room in a shared apartment/house, OR buy a condo with my brother in Toronto/North York (near a subway station). I would NOT rent a whole apartment to myself because I don't want to spend that money for a place that won't be mine and not go up in equity. 

Our parents have said they would pay the downpayment for a condo if me and my brother buy together. And then us 2 would split the mortgage (I guess my parents would also cover my brother's part until he starts making profit). In this case, would that be a good choice? I don't know how much mortgage would be for let's say a 500k condo in North York, GTA, but I assume at least 2k per month, so 1k for me 1k for brother. 

Or would it be better to just rent a room for myself in the long run? What if I end up moving jobs to Ottawa for example, will renting out my room in the condo we buy make up for my portion of the mortgage?"

I’m Canadian, I have a Bachelor of Music and am in my final year of my MD. My current plan is to pursue a residency in Psychiatry after I graduate, which is 5 year paid internship essentially, required to practice.

Over the last year I’ve developed a strong interest in building my skills in machine learning. From a personal perspective I’ve always loved math, technology and computing but never ended up on a path where I’ve been able to study them seriously yet. Professionally, I recognize that machine learning is having huge impacts in all areas of healthcare, and while I could certainly still have a very lucrative clinical career without any knowledge in it, I would like to capitalize on the potential of healthcare + machine throughout my career.

My question is what the best way for me to do this? It wouldn’t make sense for me to get yet another undergrad. I currently have a lot of debt and would like to get into and out of residency without too much delay. A couple options I’ve considered:

1. A one year residency/internship after completing my MD in 2019. I’ve looked through a number of the big tech companies pages for these, and while they seem to require a heavy technical background, it looks like they do want applicants from a diverse range of backgrounds. Would that be a reasonable shot for me? Are there other less competitive internships around that I’m not aware of?

2. Completing a masters degree during residency. Most residency programs allow this, usually with you taking up to 2 years away from your program to complete it. Sometimes you continue to receive your residency salary while away. I’m also not sure what sorts of masters degrees would take me without a computer science undergrad. My understanding from a lot of colleagues is that almost any masters program will take you with an MD if you have a clear project and supervisor in mind, but I imagine I would need to take some intro comp sci/math courses at some point. Any recommended programs either in Canada or the States? 

Thanks, appreciate any advice."

Is business development a good career option to get started and gain vital experience?",resumeadvice1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/9305p0/is_business_development_in_a_tech_company_good/,"Hi all,

Have some opportunities in business development. However, there really isn't much content on the internet about it. Thus, I cannot really come to a decision on whether it'll be good experience, or result in a dead-end. It is critical to know that business development is not something I plan to do long-time, rather get in, get my experience, and then head to where I wish to go from there. 

I am wishing to get into business, largely in technology, with plans to go onto tech-strategy consulting and to study an MBA in 4-5 years time. I currently have very little experience, and have not been able to get hold of a summer internship. This is largely due to coming from a different background, making the move into tech/business. 

The pay is good, and I believe it is something I can excel at. However, I am worried that it'll be a dead-end, or only provide useful experience in sales/B.D Roles. I've seen the memes and jokes about business development managers. I feel I won't really have skills that I could transfer to something such as consulting or management. 

Has anyone had experience with business development roles, is it an opportunity I should take, or will it lead to stagnation? Will it really help me to understand the fundamentals of business, and provide me with skills and knowledge that I'll be able to apply to a wide range of roles? 

I have the possibility of studying a management masters at a top ten business school, but I feel a masters is a waste of time and money if I do not have the work experience. However, as a leading school, it has great links to industry, and I'd be able to take advantage of graduate roles. 

Many thanks,"

But, everyone is rejecting me and I am lost.",snaredrum_,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/930faj/i_am_unemployed_and_ready_for_something_new_but/,"Hi, I am a 25 F in Milwaukee, WI. I have had a vast array of job experience: radio internship, line therapy, serving/bartending, leasing consultant for apartments, and most recently was a substitute teacher.

I am applying now to positions labeled as: content writer, copy editor, any sort of public speaking position (tea educator for example), communications assistant, public relations, etc.

I want to begin looking for a career that doesn't burn me out, but I get to use my writing, interpersonal, creative, and possibly public speaking skills. No one wants to hire me. I have been rejected multiple times since my teaching job ended the middle of June. I don't want to go back to that school district, but I am still hired and my unemployment will stop in just a few weeks because of it.

I am kind of bugging out. I am also reaching out to local newspapers and magazines to try and do freelance work, but that hasn't been going anywhere. Not even one response. 

I feel like I am doing everything wrong. It really is starting to become daunting. I re-tailored my objective in great detail on my resume for the past two positions I applied to and they called me back actually- right away. But, these positions don't seem to be fruitful.

Does anyone have any sort of insight? I am going to speak to a past recruiter I have worked with. I am just so lost. I applied to an internship too, but I graduated from college about 3 years ago now. All these ""entry level"" positions still want you to have like 2 - 5 years experience. And I do have experience, but I don't think these companies are seeing my potential if it's not a history on paper. I am incredibly annoyed, as I am just ready to commit to a company and be loyal and give it my all.

I was thinking of going back to school, but I hate to think of taking out a massive loan just for another degree. So, maybe taking online classes? I don't know what advice I am looking for, and I know everything comes in due time, but I just wish there was an easy answer for this.

Also: I haven't been following up with my applications at all. I have been sending out quite a few and I figure they probably receive so many apps that they would just reach out to me. 

Any help would be appreciated. xx.

I'm currently a rising junior at a small university in Chicago. I'm majoring in accounting, and mostly I've stuck with it for the past 2 years because I was getting a $6,000 per year scholarship for sticking with it. Welp, I figured out pretty quickly I'm not really interested in accounting through the classes and my audit internship. I started looking into other majors, and I realized that I really enjoy working with computers. I've taken a few programming classes and really enjoyed them, but I haven't declared a double major or minor in CS yet.

I also applied and was accepted as a transfer student (for this fall) to a larger university within my state. They're reputable for having a great CS program, but it's really hard to get into, so I only got into the economics program. 

I'm wondering if it would be a good move to transfer into the state university for economics and perhaps minor in CS. I am interested in econ, but I'd rather find a job in CS. Also, I'm pretty introverted and don't usually take risks, so I'm hoping that moving away from Chicago will help me become more outgoing. 

If anyone experienced a similar situation in choosing majors/transferring schools, I would love to hear about it. "

I'm 21 years old and just moved back in with my parents temporarily after college and have come to realize that the way my parents ""care"" for their pets is lacking. My parents have four dogs (shih tzus) and three cats. 

My mom doesn't have a job or any means of income and refuses to work any job because of her bad back and lack of job skills. My dad is an independent mechanic. I work part-time until my paid internship starts next month, but the stipend isn't large. Our household uses food stamps to get by. The financial situation here isn't great. 

My dad is the one who buys cat/dog food and cat litter, but he doesn't buy them much else unless my mom repeatedly tells him to. This means the dogs often have shaggy hair, long nails, and a weird smell before they're groomed. The cats sometimes subsist on food crumbs before they get more food.

Right now, it turns out the dogs have fleas. Two of them have chewed the bases of their tails raw, so they are now scabbed. I have leftover student loan money I was hoping not to touch until I had to start paying it back, but it appears I'll need to dip into it to pitch in.

I can't foresee myself paying for their pets forever, and it makes me feel awful knowing they're not living their best lives. I'm trying my best to help with what I have. I already know they won't want to give any of the pets up.

What can I do?

Or I will be school starts up pretty soon. My girlfriend is also 18 but because she took many advanced classes and summer school she was able to graduate early. She is already in her 3rd year of college.  Just for clarification I’m older and will be 19 in about a month. 

I met her my freshman year of high school and we shared most of our classes together. She introduced me to her friends and we became close. I didn’t start dating her till a little before her 18th birthday. So I’ve known her for about 4 years and we have dates for around 4 months. Long story short I proposed and she said yes. 

My parents turned justno and allowed my pervert estranged older brother to move in. A while later we moved out into a house of our own. It’s a long complicated and messed up story. 

But now I’m heading back to my last year of high school. She wears her engagement ring all the time. I wear mine as well and I’m a little nervous. I know I’m going to be the only guy in high school engaged. As well as the only one who lives in a rented home with his girlfriend. What I’m not prepared for are all the questions. I know many will say I’m too young but I disagree. I have an internship at a law firm,a football scholarship, and a good head on my shoulders. My fiancé has a really great paying job as a secretary, is excellent at budgeting and handling money and any other talents. Financially we are able to live on our own rather comfortably. 

But I know everyone is going to ask a million questions and try to see if there is something wrong with us. I’m not going to break the engagement. We work well together and have a very strong and trusting relationship. 

I just need advice as to handle all these questions that are going to come my way. 

TLDR: I am engaged to my girlfriend not sure how to handle all the questions I will be asked this school year. Any advice is appreciated. "

My life is like some Chris Chan parody. There have been so so so many destructive moments and I want to end it on a semi-high note. 
There's a certain loneliness and overwhelmingness that derives from knowing that I can't explain it all, but I'll try to glaze over some of the noteworthy calamities.
I suppose everything started to derail when I was around five, and my parents got divorced. Oddly enough, unlike most children in similar situations, it wasn't knowing that my parents hated one another that bothered me, but rather being isolated from the man who had sculpted the person I was just beginning to grow into. I hardly got to see my dad, only during summers, and I missed him a lot. I remember at one point we were visiting my stepdad's parents, probably a couple years after the divorce, whom lived near where my dad lived. My dad showed up and I can't remember what happened, but I remember how I felt when he left. He started walking away and I was so small, and I tried running after him but one of the adults grabbed me, and he wouldn't look back at me as I think I yelled for him. I think he might have been trying not to cry, and he got into his car and drove off quickly. Neither of us were ones to cry often, even though I was small, and I don't know if he did cry, but I cried my eyes out, while watching the car drive off. I saw him the next summer, and continued to as the years went on. 
Things were okay enough for awhile, until fourth grade. It's silly, but I met a girl, a grade above me. I shared a lot of memories with that girl, and in the process suddenly matured far faster than my peers, augmenting the loneliness that was I was about to endure. The reason it's silly is because I loved her very much. We were of course small and our friendship was of course platonic, and people always presume that someone so young could not know what love is like, but I loved her so much, more than I've loved anyone. A lot happened, and then one day she moved away. She wouldn't respond to me across any means of communication, not in any way shape or form, after building such a close friendship for over two years. It took me about 3 or so years to get over her, and I know that today she is not a special person, but I refuse to try to delegitimize what I felt, even if it's hard to remember. In that time I had a few friends, none of which I cared for, and every day I missed her and felt pathetic. I could never garner the courage, or ability, to hate her, which I would soon learn to be a reoccurring theme. Finally though, I got over her, and I met another girl. I really don't know drew me to her, but she was good. She was caring and always wanted to do what was right, a standard she held herself to which I did not, but that I admired. A lot more happened. Eventually, because of her, because of knowing that I had someone to reliably communicate with, I decided to put myself into homeschooling. I had a plethora of reasons I did not enjoy nor appreciate school, and school was certainly no solution to my loneliness. Being around people did not make me feel less lonely. Previously, I simply knew that it would be unhealthy to disconnect myself from all socialization, but I had her now. But just as my luck goes, she died. In hindsight I'm not sure she ever loved me, I'm not even sure I loved her. I do hurt though, and it destroyed me. I had two big reasons I didn't kill myself at that time. I was terrified of hell (still am), and for some reason didn't want to die without anybody understanding me. A few months went by and I didn't talk to anyone. That time is like a fog. In all the time since I had left school, she was the only person I talked to. I didn't bother nurturing any of the other relationships that I had, and so then when she died I had no one to turn to. A couple years prior I stopped going to my dad's on the summers. And I felt like he was the only one who could understand how I felt, as if on top of all of the tragedy that had befell me, I had some predisposition for my emotional circumstance as well, one that he knew too. But we had not talked in months, and I don't think he wanted to talk. We still haven't talked. But I went on to meet someone named Finn. I could go on about Finn for hours, for forever really. He fixed me, and comforted me, and amazingly, he understood me as well. A hell of a lot happened, far too much to fit into my already overly-long post. Basically he acted as though he cared about me, and a few times he stopped talking to me, so I eventually came to terms that that's all it was, an act. He was leaving to go to camp in a couple weeks, to intern as a counselor for kids, and in those two weeks we bonded like we never had before. He acted as though he loved me, and flirted like he had so much before, but it had suddenly become so much more. At this camp he did not have service nor wifi, and I waited the two weeks for him to return. Near the end I had an growing concern that what had begun to bud between us would not be there, and I cried. But I brushed off that concern and told myself it was nonsense, as I had every day of those two weeks. When he got back I expected we would reunite with each other magically, and that he would share that sentiment. He seemed detached the entire time we did, and our reunion ended quickly. He then went three days ignoring me. I cried like I had never cried before. I felt dramatic and naïve, and pathetic. I expected him to completely cut me off, similarly to my first love. Just as I began to humiliate myself by confessing everything I was feeling he finally acknowledged me. I was a dick to him that night. I should've known what I knew, that he did not love me. Apparently he wanted us to be ""friends with benefits"". I felt violated, and so, so hurt. I cannot explain how I felt. I was ready to turn our friendship into something ugly that night, something I had seen between my father and mother so many years ago. Something where any shown kindness was merely courtesy, I wanted it to be the ugly thing I believed it was doomed to be. A thing where we saw eachother as objects of the sexual desires me had. I came to my senses the next day, today. I think he does care about me, or believes he does. But I am nothing to him. He convinced me of his fascination of me today, and I wasn't to profit off of that fascination for the next two months, and make as many memories with him as I can. I may have lied in my title about being happy, maybe content is more accurate, but that's quite the feat for me, still. Across the events I've listed to you, and the MANY more I have not listed, I've lived in many places, and hated it. I miss my home, and am returning to it soon. I don't want to die in the foreign land I dwell in now, so when I return soon that's when I'll do it. I'm okay with it, and because of Finn I have one less reason to not kill myself, sometime understands me. I'm still terrified of hell, but I'm content, and I'm ready for it"

I graduate Spring 2019, and I was looking for some advice on my situation.

I began looking for jobs about a week ago, and threw together a resume that I think highlights my skills, but the more I search the more inadequate I feel. I unfortunately was unable to get an internship, and the research project I was promised for this past summer fell through and I was the last to know. I was told two weeks before spring semester ended, and had already signed a sublease so I could not look for other opportunities. Additionally, I feel like I'm missing a lot of the prerequisite skills to apply to most of the jobs I'm seeing. Many of them list languages and frameworks as ""must haves"" that I've never heard of before, and there are so many of them I feel overwhelmed when I begin to think about which one I could invest time into learning.

I'm proficient in C++, Python, and Ocaml, and I have a bit of experience with Java and SQL. I feel that my understanding of many of the CS fundamentals is quite good, even if I do have some problem points. I get A's and B's in almost all of my CS classes, with two exceptions (Discrete and Computer Org). I don't have any side projects mostly due to lack of time and interest.

Am I psyching myself out, or are there things I should be working on this next year to secure a job?"

We live off 1 paycheck and have a great savings balance with no outstanding debt that we couldn't pay off immediately. I hired on at my company in 2015 because it was a great position that enabled me to go to school part time and do homework at work. The pay and benefits were great but in the end it was all to facilitate me finishing my Bachelor's degree. During school I planned to use my VA Disability and GI Bill Housing Stipend to pay for anything I need and my wife would take over the bills.

I made it no secret to my mangers and co workers that I would be quitting at a certain point to attend school full time because my degree requires classes that are only offered mid-day. My degree also requires that I do an summer internship. I've done great here, gotten promotions and raises almost every year for 3 years all while maintain a 4.0 in school. This job has been great to me and my family. For the last six months I pushed hard for a position in the afternoon that allowed me to go to school during the day but I always got the brush off. So I decided to move on with my options.

During a Spring career fair at my school I was offered a co-op position with a local company. Essentially a year round part time internship. I'd go to school MWF and work Tues/Thurs. They stated (in my contract) that I could work around my school schedule and work whatever hours I wanted. The pay was decent for an internship (18/hr). I'm not terribly concerned with the pay because I get VA disability and my GI Bill pays a housing stipend based on the number of hours I take. This was great because it gives me industry experience for the last two years of my degree and doesn't change my income level too terrible much. We coordinated a start date to coincide with the Fall semester that way I could keep making my current salary for as long as possible.

Now that I've put in my two weeks....and burned all my vacation time.....my manager's manager wants to offer me a position that would ""allow me to keep going to school full time"". It will likely come with a pay raise also which complicates matters for me.

I'm concerned that if I renege on this job offer it will hurt my reputation in the prospective industry.

TL:dr

Accepted a year round internship while I attend school full time. After submitting my two weeks my employer wants to open a new position in the afternoon to keep me. Do I stay and make more money while attending school or just move on to my internship and get industry related experience?"

Math 2 and Biology (will be taking in October, estimated score is 780-800)


GPA:
I don’t have a GPA as I’m in IBDP (International Baccalaureate Diploma Program), but based on online calculations it’s around 4.65 to 4.85 W.


Subjects:
higher Level: Math, Biology, Chemistry, standard level: english A L&amp;L, Chinese B, Economics


Current estimated score 40/42 (could be pushed to a 41/42) with either 2 or 3 bonus points out of 3.


ECs:
1. Represented Malaysia for 2015 FPSPI International conference (it’s an internationally-recognised critical thinking international competition)
2. World Scholars Cup — top 3 teams in regionals, top 25 teams in globals and will be attending Tournament of Champions in November
3. 6-week internship at a Neuroscience Research facility in Monash University (pre-uni research internships are incredibly rare, we had a scholar who flew all the way from Turkey)
4. Part time job for 1 year at my previous tuition centre — mostly taught students, made academic notes to be used in classes and other admin work. Part-time jobs aren’t a thing here as well (especially long-term ones), I only got the job because I was an ambassador for the centre after graduating IGCSEs as one of their top students.
5. Pursued handball to state level
6. 1st dan black belt in taekwondo, will be taking 2nd dan grading in 2 months
7. Prefectorial board for 2-3 years in previous school — prefects have a crazy amount of responsibility, our board of 20 runs every single event in our school of about 1.3k students.
8. Student council vice president in current school — my current school is 2 years old, so the council plays a huge role in setting the school up
Initiated a few other minor service projects, nothing else worth mentioning I think.


Recommendation letters:
Since I’ve moved school for my pre-uni course, I’ve only interacted with my teachers for 8 months, so they won’t have the “I’ve known xxx student for 8 years and watched her grow” impact. Will be requesting from my biology and english teachers, they are the teachers I interact with the most and the main takeaway would be independence of learning, grit and passion for my major. I’m pretty close to my biology teacher due to a microbiology thesis I’m doing, but my english teacher is pretty professional and doesn’t really get close to students. The letters probably won’t be bad but probably wouldn’t be absolutely great either. I’d estimate a 7-8 out of 10, can’t say for sure though.


Essays:
Probably the the part where I’ll be banking on the most, and will be devoting a ton of time and effort into. I’ll be talking about my decision of switching my intended major to microbiology from marine biology, which was something I was dead set on since I was 9. In a nutshell, I couldn’t bring myself to pursue my passion at the expense of family welfare, which means a lot to me. It catalysed the discovery of an entire new field of interest, so it isn’t to say I ditched my passion entirely.


I’m not applying for financial aid, though I will pursue merit scholarships if possible.

1. As mentioned briefly before, internships and jobs are extremely hard to find around my area. I know many US students get the chance to do these things during their summer holidays, but here you’ll need connections, luck or an excellent academic profile to get jobs or internships.
2. I also completed my IGCSEs in 3.5 years before moving to a new schools for my last 2 years, which made it hard to pursue long-term extracurriculars. My current school is new as well, so they’re starting any extracurricular activity from scratch. It also means that student-teacher interactions won’t be that strong, which may affect letter of recommendations.
3. I was diagnosed with ADHD 2 months ago —  cultural stigma and being (relatively) high-functioning made it hard to diagnose at young. It wouldn’t quite affect me if I was treated since young, but I realised how much it reflected on my grades (and hence transcript) due to taking late action. I’ve been able to cope throughout middle and high school but was forced to take action recently as my grades were at the risk of taking a nose dive (taking IBDP in itself doesn’t really help either). I believe that the diagnosis allowed me to understand my strength and weaknesses better — I can now improve my strengths, cope with my weaknesses and change my studying habits for the better. I don’t think of this as an excuse for my transcript. Rather I would like to show admission officers that I can improve so much in the future thanks to my newfound understanding of myself. I’ll probably be writing about this in my supplementary essays as well, if it's ""safe"" enough to do so."

Hi! I'm a CS major (going to be a junior this fall) who wants to apply for Security Engineering Internships this fall. I haven't done much work in Security, but I have decent experience with embedded and systems programming (writing drivers, protocols and the like).

I've become really interested in security since the start of this year, but have at best, an informal knowledge of things and no experience in the field. I'll be taking security and cryptography classes this fall, but most recruiting for summer positions seems to happen around Sept-Oct, by which time I will still have very little experience of the field.

I was wondering what kind of questions get asked for such interviews (I've only ever had to answer algorithm leetcode type things for interviews). Is it worth brushing up more on algorithm-y questions or should I be focussing on other things? Any other pointers for getting an internship with no experience in the field?"

I've had 2 internships (the second of which I'm embroiled in now, learning a ton, and thoroughly enjoying). I'm a dual US/UK citizen.

I started uni early, and will be 19 when I graduate next March (hopefully). Everyone I've talked to recommends I head straight in to the workforce, rather than get a Masters. Is a masters degree really worth it in this field, not necessarily looking for an AI related job, I know PHDs in ML are gold. I worry that I'll start too early, struggle to find a job due to my age, perhaps if I'm lucky get a job - work my ass off for a few years, and burn out. I'd love to hear some opinions on that.

Secondly, do you think the prospects for employment would be better in America than in London? I've grown up in a large city, can't really imagine driving everywhere/not being able to hop on a train and be at work in an hour. Thanks."

I have had this job for over a year as an intern and now I am turning full time. I feel like i annoy my coworker. I ask questions, and I feel like he gets tired of repeating himself. My two biggest weaknesses is, I know i have bad listening skills and sometimes I don't think everything through because I'm a bit slow, and since I'm aware I try my best to listen and put things together and think. It's hard though because I can't let my coworkers just have me think in conversation and I'm told to ask questions. But when I get the impression they get annoyed because they said something I don't know what to do. I really try, I take notes, I try to digest as much as I can, but I sense aggregation. Sometimes I just don't know, and sometimes I just want to make a point and even that is turned in aggregation. I get sometimes I do genuinely say stupid stuff because I genuinely don't know or maybe I wasn't clear e no if. And I guess that's my other weakness, I am terrible with wording and again I try my best to explain but I don't want to add too much detail like their dumb, but it's the only way I know how, because when I don't sometimes my coworker gets annoyed I wasn't clear enough, but when I add too much detail, it's also received by annoyance. My coworker is a genuinely nice and helpful guy but I feel like i bothered him enough where he gets annoyed. I don't know what to do. I am at the point where i go into work everyday thinking I hope they are in a good mood and I don't annoy them. I go into work every day hoping they would just smile when we talk and I even try to smile first in hopes they will smile in response. Usually it's a no though. I don't want to be on my coworkers bad side because he taught me and helped me so much. I do my best to reserve my questions for meeting unless I'm genuinely stuck or I know it's good to bring up. And then meetings is where I find some aggregation because I feel like it's too awkward for me to think of the answer to my question because they would much rather me just ask so yeah I never know what to do sometimes...

Its just a hard balance and I guess I'm just lucky I'm with someone so kind... 

But it's been making me feel so incompetent and I don't know what to do... I just don't think I'm as intelligent as I guess they wish I was but I try my best to improve and do better..

Just looking for some thoughts... "

I am in the thick of my PhD program in Analytical Chemistry. Our lab trains students with a certain skill set to a great depth. However, as I am looking at a lot of jobs in the field, jobs in my field wants a specific subset of skills that share similar principles to what I have been trained but not exactly the same. Many people do their PhD in the skills that are desired in the field.  This skill is well-established that there are a lot of applications that I'll be interested.

I want to take an internship next summer that may be able to teach something about the skill sets. 

I am going over the first half of my PhD. I'm realizing that I want to learn additional skill sets in addition to the main skills that I am acquiring from my PhD. 

Has this ever happen to you? What did you have to get to learn the new skills? Did you have to do a post-doc? Also, if you did post-doc for that, how far of a jump can you make (in other words, how different could your experience be from your PhD to post doc)?

How was your transition? Of course, I hope that I can move away from the academia.. I would love to make more $$ and more work and life balance. But I am not quite sure how that transition is supposed to serve those desired qualities in an ideal job. 

What advice do you give?"

I spend a great deal of my free time experimenting with editing and animation. I run a music based Youtube channel that mixes a bit of vector animation along with lyric typography. I also delve into programming, having some experience with Java primarily, but also some knowledge of HTML and CSS. Right now, I am endeavoring within self-teaching myself Swift. I also am self-taught in playing the violin and the guitar, but I do have some experience with playing the piano when I was younger. I am not allowed to play sports.

I was wondering if my college list is ok. I plan to apply to most of the UC's, Cal Poly, Carnegie Mellon, UIUC, USC, Purdue, and Cornell. I know that I'm not an outstanding student, nor do I have exceptional EC's, but I just wanted to know if I should readjust my school list.

It was originally supposed to be an internship but they said I’d be a good fit for a full time job as tech support. However, when they told me that’s what I’ll be doing my heart kind of sank. I’ve already spent several years working part time as tech support and I just don’t think I have it in me to continue.

I guess the main reason I applied was because it was an internship and I was hoping that I’ll get to work with different parts of the IT department and hopefully catch the eye of the sys admin or analysts and be offered a job under them. 

Worse case scenario it’d be a month or two of internship before we parted ways. But now it’s going to be a full time job which means a commitment and I’m not sure what to do. 

I applied for a system analyst job opening a few days ago that doesn’t require experience but still haven’t heard back and I don’t know if I should call them to see if they’re still hiring for that position or not.

Loved the people and the students so much, but got paid hardly anything and knew it would be time to pursue a teaching position.  Sure enough, a position opened in another district and I left Company A for Company B in the middle of the school year.

No hard feelings from Company A and I even remained friends with coworkers.

I worked at Company B until May 2018 and hate every second of it. It causes me so much emotional stress that I resign. Company A happily invites me back and offers me my original position.

I spend the summer months working as an intern with Company C as part of my graduate school requirements. I am pursuing a grad degree in a totally different field than education and find it refreshing to be working even for just a short time at Company C. 

Less than two weeks before my arrival back at Company A, my supervisor at Company C tells me that she might soon have an offer with another company and she recommend that I take her place at Company C. Great pay and I would use my Masters! Problem is, it could be two weeks, a month or three months before said job appears. 

Working at Company C would be an amazing career move, allow me to use my Masters, and transition out of education.

Problem is, Company A has graciously invited me back after things with Company B did not work out. 

Company A is very low paying and is not a very honorable position. I am far too overqualified for the position. However, it would feel horrible to leave Company A (co-workers and beloved students) mid year yet again to pursue a better opportunity.  I feel like a traitor to my friends at Company A, but know I am worth more than $13 an hour.

I kind of want to quit Company A before I even start again just to avoid the pain and awkwardness of leaving mid year again. However, I have to have money and have no other jobs lined up. I thought about taking a menial job (i.e. substitute teaching) just so I don't have to leave Company A midyear again and can be available to a potential opening at Company C.

I have horrible anxiety. Maybe it is getting the best of me. What do I do???? "

I am currently a rising senior at a decent state college, done a couple of internships already (currently in one with a Fortune 100), have good grades (GPA 3.9+), and currently on the search for a job after graduation. My girlfriend and I are looking to move out of state because of personal reasons, mostly because her parents divorced and staying here is a constant reminder of that fact among other bad situations that have happened. As well, she needs to go to grad school and her specific program is only offered in a couple of universities across the US. She would be applying to start on Fall of 2020 to make a stronger application and have time to prepare for the GRE. 

We know we want to be together, but because of that wherever one moves the other one follows. So the plan we came up with is that where I get a job after graduation we would be moving there for a year, and when she gets into grad school we would be moving there next. The ideal situation is she gets into school were I am working, however, that is not realistic since we are not sure if she is going to get in to every school she applies to. From my perspective, I think that its easier to get a job while having one already from what I have been reading in this sub. She could also get into school earlier and then from there I apply for jobs in that city, however, that would be in March of next year which is pretty late into the application process. I am confident I will be able to find a job after graduating and taking the proper steps to do so, been contacted by several companies these last couple of weeks and been studying a little of CTCI and Leetcode. As long as the role / job is kinda interesting, I don't mind the company I do end up with. 

Financially I am not worried about relocating, we have been budgeting and saving for the last couple of years and should have enough to cover the majority of moving and living costs with no issues. The company I am working for is good and has decent pay, however, the work is slow, the tech is a little bit older that what is out there, and I would not be able to relocate until 1 - 2 years into my role - so its not really my top choice right now. 

TLDR; Girlfriend and I want to be together, need to move out of state due to reasons, we go to a state where I work somewhere for a year and then move wherever she gets into school. 

Do you think it is a viable plan to hold a job for a year and then hope to get a another one somewhere else? "

Although I took a few fundamental CS courses before getting into my Master's (discreet math, algorithms, some basic data structures) I definitely feel as though I'm lacking in some of the more ""pure CS"" stuff. Between learning new technologies in the ML field, keeping up with my Master's, and doing some very basic web design stuff (basically just WordPress site maintenance) on the side to pay for said Master's I feel like it would be tough to squeeze in Leetcode and Kaggle projects.

I've been thinking about getting an IT certificate at a local community college but really hate the idea of going to school again, I know if I'll even like IT. Seems pointless to even try since every entry level job I see wants at least 3 years prior experience, so it seems like a waste and more debt to get a certificate or new degree.



In general it just seems like I can't accomplish much career wise, especially in my city because most entry job requirements not only want years of experience but also want someone who speaks Spanish. I couldn't even get internships when I was a student.
I just don't know where to go.



I really want to move out of my parents house and away from this town but don't seem to have a path anywhere out."

He has broken up with me before but I think this time is it.  I begged him to stay, said I would do whatever it took to fix things.  He was absolutely not having it this time (this is not the first time).  He told me there are SO many much better-looking girls out there and he is not happy with me.  He often checks other girls out in front of me, and talks to them behind my back.I have started working out/calorie restricting but I am not at my goal weight yet. I have also been slacking because I am very busy with an internship and have fallen into a depression over the death of my dad, so I have gained some weight back that I had just lost.  I also am being treated for acne and am going to have to do a round of accutane.  I told him it would take time for me to drop all the weight (I am not morbidly obese however I am probably about 50 pounds overweight, mostly concentrated in my belly).  It hurt me SO much when he said that A) I was not the most attractive girl out there and B) He told me to remember I was not as good as I thought I was.  I am so miserable and just want him back, but he is not budging.  I don't even want to wake up/eat anymore. I have SO much I need to work on, and I feel like I'll never reach my goal or be a 10. I guess my point is that all my worst insecurities were confirmed the other day (he doesn't want to be with me because of my weight/looks) and it sucks because i am trying to improve myself but it is an uphill battle.  If I looked better, would this still have happened? We have been together over a year and it has been rocky the entire time. Advice on how I should proceed? If I stick to my training/treatment and my looks improve drastically, will he come back/change his mind? He's everything I want in a person and I can't stand the thought of losing him."
93gq51,37,2018-07-31,I PASSED SY0-501 WITH ABSOLUTELY NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE.,rutocool,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/93gq51/i_passed_sy0501_with_absolutely_no_prior/,"770/750. I am a rising junior in college and have had some coding classes but no Security/Network experience. No A+ or Network+. I set up some WiFi in my sorority house once. I needed this certification as part of my internship. 


How I studied: 

Materials used:
Professor Messer videos and study guide 
Mike Myers Udemy Course 
Daryl Gibson book and audio files 
CertBlaster practice exams 
CertMaster 
Flash cards for all terms, ports, and acronyms (I made physical ones I didn’t use quizlet) 
Pocket Prep app 


I studied for 8 weeks, 8 hours a day. 2-3 on weekends. 

I started by watching all of the Prof Messer videos and taking notes to establish a baseline of knowledge. Then I started with the Mike Meyers courses and additional security questions. I used the app when I would go to the bathroom or transportation, and listened to the Mike Meyers audio when I was driving and read the book by the pool on weekends. On the third week I started using the CertBlaster and did the specific “drills” on each chapter. These didn’t match the exams really, but they helped me picture what would be on the PBQ’s. I took the concepts I didn’t know and studied them. The final week I created a OneNote and wrote an outline of the objectives and filled it out with information and made sure I knew everything on the list.  I also used all my flash cards to make mental maps of the chapter and worked through the objectives with the cards to ensure I had covered all the bases. I didn’t really use the CertMaster but it came with my voucher, I only went through the first chapter. 

Throughout the 8 weeks I had a word document I would type all of my questions into, and then I would go through and answer them and research my answers and I would read it from beginning to end every time I updated it. 

I also kept things color coded so I could physically see my weak areas. 1.0 was red, 2.0 was orange, 3.0 was green, 4.0 was blue, 5.0 was purple, and 6.0 was brown.  The color coding was consistent in my notes, flash cards, and highlights in the book. 

The things that helped me the most were the more hands-on things. Answering practice questions, research, and writing things in my own words. 

The actual exam: 
I took it at a community college at 11am. 83 questions. PBQ’s mirrored the ones on the CertBlaster save for one that was a little confusing. No POODLE attack. 

This goes without saying but know your ports and acronyms. Spend time just studying those, don’t rely on getting to know all of them by going over material. 

I went through and answered all the questions I knew automatically, and skipped the PBQ’s. I flagged the ones I was unsure of but thought I knew and left the ones I didn’t know entirely blank. I had 20 flagged and 6 unanswered. Then I went through and critically thought through each question and what I knew about each option. After I had gone through all the flags and unanswered questions, I started from the top and went through again, I changed my answers to 7 questions on my last pass through. 

I also prayed a LOT over the exam. Prayed the rosary on my way there and before I went into the testing center, and I prayed before I started the timer and before I turned it in. If you aren’t religious obviously you may think it wouldn’t help, however, the benefits of quiet meditation and emptying your mind and thinking positively before taking the test are not to be understated. 

Anyway, I feel like spongebob in that episode where he forgets everything but fine dining and breathing. I’m excited to have the afternoon off and I couldn’t be happier with my results. "

This year a lot of companies have been coming to our college and one such company (Let's call it ""X"") has offered me a 6-month internship and a full-time job offer based on my performance in my internship.

The problem here is that during my period of internship and an additional year after my internship ends, the company can claim the rights to any projects/products/ideas/inventions which I develop even off-working hours and on holidays.

At the moment I am working on 3 projects and a startup(which won a hackathon and got funding of 7300 dollars) and if I join the company I'll have to drop out of these. 

I really want to take this decision carefully as X has a turnover of 2.6 billion US dollars and the salary package is 670000 INR (which is 9783 US dollars) per annum.

**UPDATE:** I dropped the offer, got an offer at Amazon with little more than double the salary package minus the IP bs that X was giving

I have no certifications and to my understanding, they're pretty important. 

So I have an AAS in Computer Information Systems and a BA in Information Technology and Informatics. Basically they're both IT. I'm in an internship right now that is basically help desk although it's a role for a pharmaceutical company that doesn't have many responsibilities. Needless to say, I want to find something where it feels like I matter a bit more. I also have years of job experience in the restaurant and service industry, my prior job being a waiter. I also have a good understanding of hardware and some software troubleshooting. (Example, I built my PC and I'm a person who researches specs of a product and what they do before purchasing)

With this general information, would you say it's worth shelling out a few hundred dollars for a CompTIA A+ cert or would you advise against it? Since I have only one official experience in IT, I'd be aiming for something like helpdesk when my internship is over. Also should note my current internship employer said they might be willing to hire me after the internship is completed.

93hqsr,1,2018-07-31,dealing with a bad summer research PI,LogicalAbility,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/93hqsr/dealing_with_a_bad_summer_research_pi/,"Hi everyone,

I have a situation in my REU summer internship that I'd appreciate any insight on. So this summer I am doing a program where you research at a different university for 10 weeks with a stipend and free housing, along with some working lunches covered. Overall, it's definitely not a bad deal on the surface, but I have been dealing with some ongoing illness issues (both physical and mental) that have put me in the ER three times since April. When I have a flare-up, I get nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness, chills, headaches, jaw pain, heart palpitations, just an overall weird combination of symptoms. I also have Aspergers and anxiety/depression issues that have worsened with my physical health. Being an out of state student at my home institution as well as at this REU, I've seen so many doctors at this point that I might as well become one.

Now, the PI that I have been working under has been challenging, to say the least. The first few weeks of the REU, he seemed to be easygoing. Basically, my project is to try to make PDMS photo-patternable so that it can be used for microfluidic applications outside of a cleanroom environment, with the eventual goal being to use this material for a glucose sensing device the PI is working on. I am an ECE major with hopes of attending grad school in Europe and focusing on creating a medical device for easier mealtimes for neuromuscular disease patients, so this project at first sounded like a great way of immersing myself in BME related research somewhat. However, this PI has completely destroyed any sense of self-esteem that I had previously possessed. I have run the photoPDMS wafer experiment (which lasts about 3+ hours a single trial) at least 10-20 different times with no meaningful results. I am frustrated about the failure rate, yet determined to keep working until the program ends on Aug 10.

My PI has not been any help at all. When assigning me the project, he admitted he had not read any of the literature that he assig ned me. I have read countless journal articles, a 70 page masters thesis front to back several times,  yet the experimental procedure outlined has not worked at all. Whenever I ask any clarifying questions, the PI just stares blankly at me, or acts like I am stupid by answering my question in a condescending tone of voice. He ordered the supplies for the project three weeks into the REU program, despite knowing that I accepted the program in March. He also has no clue what chemical I am using to make the PDMS photopatternable: he keeps referring to it as phenobenzone when it is benzophenone. He comes into the lab sporadically throughout the day to check up on me but refuses to help at all. I have learned more from the grad student than I have from the PI (btw the grad student was diagnosed with stress-induced shingles at age 30...a red flag about the lab I would think)

To make matters worse, about a week ago he wanted to have a meeting with me in his office concerning my progress on the project. He emailed me the night before and I accepted, then replied okay, what time? He never replied to my email, so I assumed to come into the lab at the normal time. He then showed up about two hours later and yelled at me ""what about the meeting we were supposed to have????"" then stormed off.

The next day, we had a tour of the US Capitol building as a REU cohort since we also deal with science policy as part of the program. The program has a ton of extracurricular workshops built into the schedule, yet my PI gets annoyed every time I attend the sessions despite them being a part of the program. He kept demanding that I show up to his office at 10:30 am even though we were supposed to be back on campus no earlier than 1:30. I informed him of this, and no response again.

When I got back to the lab from the trip, all hell broke loose. He brought me into his office and starting screaming at me, saying that I have a bad attitude towards the project, am missing too much lab time (despite being in the hospital twice during the REU program and having a plethora of doctors notes from other visits), that the high schoolers in the lab ask better questions than me, why did I even come to the program, what my plans were later in life, etc. He also kept asking intrusive questions about my personal life (did you attend X professor's REU cookout last weekend, what do you do outside the lab...) and basically told me that I should consider going home. I just started breaking down crying in front of him, and he tried to act fake sympathetic, telling me to calm down. Well geez, I guess I've never tried that before! a magic button to cure all of my anxiety? sign me up!

This happened last Wednesday, and ever since then I have felt extremely uncomfortable in the lab. I am doubting all of my accomplishments, and I feel that I am not cut out for a STEM career at this rate, or anything for that matter. I have self esteem issues depsite knowing I have good accomplishments, to the point where I just felt like life was not worth living. Last week, I actually wanted to hurt myself. I felt like all of the other REU students had supportive professors and were making more progress, whereas I'm just a fuckup that they accidentally hired but can't get rid of since its a summer NSF program.

Since Sunday, I have had a flareup of my symptoms and have been nauseated and vomiting, so I took both yesterday and today off to recuperate and let my stomach settle as well as get some scholarship applications under my belt. I emailed the PI the night before in both instances stating that I would be absent, and he has yet to reply to either email. I just feel that overall he is a condescending asshole that has no concept of reality outside academia. For example, my last ER visit he asked me why I did not go to the hospital on campus. I told him I went to another one because the aforementioned hospital did not take my insurance. He said, so? And I'm thinking oh yeah let me get thousands of dollars in medical debt for no reason. He literally has no clue how the world functions outside academia.

Overall, between my grandma being hospitalized for over a month, my own health issues, my home insitution giving me some issues with my upcoming December graduation, my laptop breaking, and many other stresses in my life I feel that I am just drained. This experience has kind of scared me off from grad school, or at least the American grad system. I understand it's not supposed to be easy, but I don't think an undergraduate summer researcher should be taking an abusive PI either. If you have any advice or anything to say, please feel free to comment. If you need me to clarify anything, don't hesitate to ask. 

Thank you so much for reading this. I needed to rant somewhere."

There's this professor at my university that I really want to do work for. Their research is in the area of Dynamics and Control (Engineering), which is the field that I would like to get involved with in the future. I would like to do undergraduate research in his lab but I just don't know how to approach him, and a number of things make me doubtful on what I should do:

* I emailed him in March with my resume, and he then asked for my unofficial transcript. My GPA at the time was 3.16 (Now 3.31). He then emailed me back thanking me for my interest and telling me that he would save my files in case an opportunity came up. He has not contacted me since then.
* It seems he has really high GPA expectations (GPA among his students is about a 3.7). I have been improving a lot lately, but I'm afraid if this is a hard cutoff.
* I've considered just showing up to his office and talking to him, however students that work under him claim that he is very busy and that its best to set up an appointment with him via email. 
* I haven't taken a Dynamics or Controls course yet.

I know that I could search for another lab to work in, but this is the only one at my university that I am interested in and passionate about. I've been studying Dynamics in advance, and my current internship is heavily involved in the realm of Guidance, Navigation, and Controls.  I'm not going to get too specific with his projects, but I follow the videos the lab posts and I am completely amazed at that they do there. I believe that I have skills that I can bring to the lab (hardware and software) that could make me an asset for his projects, but I fear if he turns me away for good this time.

If you were in my shoes, how would you approach this situation? How would you go about asking? How would you get your foot in the door to open a dialogue between you and the professor? 

Thank you in advance for helping this newbie. I am currently working on updating my resume to make it relevant to his research and consulting with one of his ex-students on how to do this. 

TL;DR: I don't know how to approach a professor to ask him if I can work in his lab. Does anybody have any advice or stories that they're willing to share to help with securing a position in this lab?"

So, are most entry level jobs easily accessible with just a degree, so that I may study and gain experience? Also, do places usually have an internship for right after you graduate rather than just after your junior year? (I tried applying previously but didn't get any). I'm also slightly worried about my school, cause it's a small one and doesn't have many technical degrees, but is a 4-year accredited state university."
93id3r,3,2018-07-31,Tomorrow I have an interview for my dream internship. Need a ton of advice!,veryinsecure101,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/93id3r/tomorrow_i_have_an_interview_for_my_dream/,"Hello everyone. 

I’m a 25 year old girl. I’m very insecure about myself. In about 6 months I finish my career. And after that i have to do a 1 year internship. 

Now, tomorrow I have an interview with the chief of the Hematology Department. I’m asking for an opportunity to do my internship in the Hematology Department of my local teaching hospital, specially in the research department. 

To get in there you need an amazing curriculum. And excellent grades. I do not have that. I have around an 83/100. BUT I was told that this doctor takes more into consideration people’s desire to be part of the department. And I really really really want to be there. It would be amazing, and would look great in my curriculum. Plus it would make my parents very proud

Right now, I made a shorter internship in the Oncology Department. Right now I’m chief intern, and I run some activities there, like early diagnosis for breast cancer, and prostate cancer. 

I’ve been told he accepts people that have 80/100 in grades. I have 83, and I have my work at the oncology department to back off my intentions. 

I just don’t know how to properly express my desire to be part of the research team. 

Any help and advice will be much appreciated. 

A friend of mine has been helping me. He advised me and gave me some courage. He believes more in me than I do in myself. I would like to gain some confidence for my interview tomorrow. It’s my only shot. "

93imde,256,2018-07-31,I just landed a job as a junior financial analyst with no experience. Here’s my story:,baruchkid169,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/93imde/i_just_landed_a_job_as_a_junior_financial_analyst/,"TL;DR all I have to my name is a BBA in finance from a non target in NYC, a good resume and 6 years of working at Starbucks. I applied everywhere and got 1 call back. Nailed the interviews and landed the job 

First a little about myself: I’m 25 years old, I graduated in may with a BBA in finance, I have NO experience working in the field and my only jobs are a barista at Starbucks and delivering pizzas, both jobs I’ve held since 2010. I graduated with a 2.56 cumulative GPA without any internships. The only experience in finance I could put on my resume were projects I did in college and being proficient in excel with a self starting attitude 

Once I graduated, I didn’t want to take any breaks. I wanted to start work immediately and move out of my parents house as I’m 3 years late to the party and it’s time. First step was to seek the help of a professional resume writer. These people know the buzzwords and phrases computers and/or people look for when looking at all the applications. He was my dads business partner for years so it was free for me but going rates for his service are about $80-200. After that, I setup LinkedIn, indeed and scoured each site for hours and hours, days upon days of sending out applications. Anything that had “financial analyst” in it and entry level, I applied. I sent out over 200 applications. Most of them manually with the questions you see over and over.. are you a vet? Do you have a disability? Are you authorized to work in the US? Oh god was it painful. Even more painful: nobody sent me anything back except the automated “sorry, we wish you well” responses. That’s when I started applying to neighboring cities like Boston and Philadelphia. Luckily, nobody hit me back from those cities. There was about 5 weeks of nothing but rejection emails until I got ONE human to respond back to me. It was for a digital solutions arm of an advertising agency. The role was junior financial analyst. The recruiter liked my resume and wanted to set up a phone screen to talk about the role and myself a little bit.. 

Once I received this invitation, I started the next phase of research, this subreddit and YouTube videos on phone screens. It highlighted having a solid “tell me about yourself” answer and the do’s/don’ts that I’d be happy to talk about if you have any questions. To be honest, I thought I bombed this one. I sounded nervous af, my sister walked in and I had to tell her to leave, I stuttered over my speech but the saving grace was that I made my point that I was inexperienced in finance but a quick learner, a people person and hard working. I still thought I failed though so within 24 hours, i sent my follow up email and hoped for the best. There was no response for 2 weeks before the recruiter sent me an email (on a Friday) asking if I could come in for an interview (on Monday). I was surprised I got the offer so I accepted and moved onto my next phase: more research 

First things first: you need to research your interviewers and find out who they are before you meet them in person. This not only removes the element of surprise when you meet them but you can practice what to say if they bring these things about them up. I played it safe and didn’t mention I stalked their LinkedIn’s and instagrams 😂. Also, you need to wear a suit. Now when it came down to the interview, I showed up 15 mins early and came only with a padfolio which contained copy’s of my resume on nice paper and a notepad with questions I intended on asking the interviewers (VP of finance and AD of finance). I was Superman: incredible confidence, no nerves at all and answered every question perfectly. Standard run of the mill questions: tell me about yourself, what are your greatest strengths, how do you work as a teammate, do you have any questions for me? I asked them what are they looking for in the perfect JFA, what do you love about the company, what are opportunities for advancement amongst some other things. Also, how many other people applied? (VP said over 200) With the VP, we actually had such a good discussion, we went over the time allotted. The next day, the recruiter told me they loved me and would like me to come back for a final interview with the AD of client finance and the manager of client finance. 

That final interview was yesterday. For some reason, I was feeling a lot more pressured. I’m going up against other people who have also beat out over 200 applicants. The prospect of having a real job is getting more real and I was feeling it. There was less on LinkedIn about these interviewers than the first two. Also, there was no air conditioning in this interviewing room and the table was pushed against the wall so we’d be sitting side by side as opposed to face to face. Blahhhh. First interviewer came in and that’s when I started feeling the nerves the most. I was a little hesitant with my answers and not as prepared as these questions were more in depth relating to my experience like “so in that group project, what could you have done differently? And how did he take your suggestion to do XYZ differently?” I think they know everyone bullshits a bit on their resume so they just wanna make sure you’re legit. I felt I did fine with her and the next interviewer was no easier: more in depth with the projects I listed on my resume. He also was driving home the fact that the work might be very difficult at times but the job is so rewarding. He talked a bit about how the moneys really good (which I think was a trap to see if I was eager to talk about compensation before hearing an offer.. I didn’t take the bait). I walked out feeling not as good as the first interview where I felt like god. Oh well. The recruiter said they’ll be making a decision within 2 days  

Today, the day after the final interview, I get a call from the recruiter asking about yesterday. How’d it go? Any HR questions? Then she wanted to talk about compensation, benefits, etc. She then said, is this something you’re interested in? Because idk if you picked up on it but the team loved you and we’d love to offer you the job!” I was speechless and thanked her so much and accepted

I start this Monday and I can’t believe I did it. Over 200 applications sent out, 1 call back, 1 job offer. It just goes to show that with a degree, good interviewing skills and just ONE opportunity, you can do it. I thank you guys so much for answering my questions along the way and I hope this post inspires some of you to keep faith in your job search and you’ll nail it eventually! "
