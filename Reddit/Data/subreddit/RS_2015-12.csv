Hello,

I have recently accepted an offer from a company that I have interned over the summer. The problem is that I have not been doing too well in my classes this semester, and it seems like I won’t be able to graduate as a CS major. I have been pursuing a double major in CS and in another degree in social science, so I will have graduate with major in social science and minor in computer science. 

When I was filling out the intern transition application form, I only wrote down CS as my major because I thought I could pull this through and also because the HR representative told me to write down the major that is relevant. 

I graduate in May, and I would like to inform the company of my current situation, but I am just afraid of the consequences. Could they end the contract over this? I will be working in the Bay Area (CA). "

Should I return next Fall instead?,kaledo0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3uxp2b/returning_from_an_internship_that_was_extended/,"My summer internship at Google was extended for an extra 3 months into the Fall semester. I figured I would be able to apply to full-time jobs at the top companies once I return in Spring, since I have always seen them recruit for FT positions in the Spring as well (e.g. FB, Google, Microsoft, etc.). But now I'm starting to worry I will be at a disadvantage if I return in Spring, and that perhaps I should consider taking a leave during the Spring and just returning the next Fall. Is it better to return the following Fall in this case, or should I return in Spring as planned?"

-Education (College/expected graduation date)

-Past jobs (totally unrelated to CS, one government job at a park and a fast food job)

-Languages I am knowledgeable in (Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript...)

Is it appropriate, at my level, to include projects done in class on my resume?

**Word Cloud**:
Loads in a .txt file, adds the words (except the common ones) to a linked list and counts each word, setting the size of that word according to how many times it appears in the .txt file. 

**Sudoku Solver**:
This was for our recursion section. We created a 6x6 Sudoku Solver.

What other universities do you think that have said courses I might get an admission in? 

Is there any other alternative(via a second semester entry) method of getting into such good programs ? If so, how do I get my first college right?"

I have a non traditional background and am a little bit older (29). This is my first real job minus internships. Anyways, I was pulled into this new role sideways with a team that has been together for about a year. My background and education did not prepare me at all for distributed systems work (I entered devops purely from tinkering but have a background in webapps and very low level electrical/computer engineering) I am constantly depressed and anxious every day because I literally do not know half the jargon being thrown around and have no idea how to contribute to open source/work on an open source code base. On top of that all of the tribal knowledge makes it impossible for me to handle configuration tasks because I don't know what all the company plumbing is. On my old team we had a newer guy but veteran engineer who was just as lost as I was and we figured things out together. This team is going at 100mph and hasn't really taken a new grad ever. Anyways, I feel like I'm floundering and making no progress. There is no net for me or small one off projects I can work on because I literally do not get the code base I'm supposed to work with. On top of that we have 2-team sprints where everyone tries to show off their progress, bullshit or not, in glorified status update meetings. I feel like half of my time is spent wtfing over company specific plumbing, confused to shit with distributed systems stuff, and worrying about the stupid shit I will say during meetings. Everyone on this team is probably an average of 10 years older than me so it is also very lonely. 

I apologize for the rant, but I need some advice. Should I switch teams? Suck it up and try to learn? Quit and find a job with a culture more suited to me? Thanks"

How are you doing?

I got an internship during the summer and one of the tasks that I had was to plot some data in Scatter / Bubble Chart, however, I still struggling with it. 

Just to give a short background about the data: The data were collected in a small-scale fisheries community in American Samoa through a survey. This surveys had two question that I need to turn into only one plot. Those questions are similar, but the first one ask about ""total CATCH"" and the second one ask about ""amount o TIME"". I need to relate both answers in only one plot, for example: 

- Answer 1: 24) Much more / 25) More
- Answer 2: 24) Much more / 25) Less
- Answer 3: 24) Less / 25) More
- Answer 4: 24) Much more / 25) Less

According to these answers, I should have:
- One ball in the intersection between ""Much more catch and More time""
- One ball in the intersection between ""Less catch and More time""
- One ball in the intersection between ""Much more catch and Less time""
- Two balls in the intersection between ""Much more catch and Less time""

The image bellow is an extract of the survey question and the exact plot that I want. See that the catch is in the Y axis and the time in the X axis. 

I forgot to mention that each (5 years ago, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, Started fishing) will be one plot, so I will have one plot for 5 years ago, one plot for 10 years ago, and so on.

Here you can see the ideal plot and also the questions:

Hopefully, you will understand my question! It is extremely difficult to explain it! haha

3uz70n,8,2015-12-01,Great Privilege. Not Appreciating it.,4seriousaccount,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/3uz70n/great_privilege_not_appreciating_it/,"I'm in school. My parents aren't and haven't paid for anything. I can't get around taking out loans even with financial aid. So I'm going into debt, which is giving me more anxiety, and I'm continuing to work while putting myself through school. Also, I'm 28 and still getting my B.S. 


I'm surrounded by so many people younger than me. I've watched the upper-middle class and upper class friends graduate, go on to grad school, medical school. While I'm still putting myself through my B.S. in hopes of getting into Grad or Med school. 


All the while, I'm still paying for my college, working, while trying to maintain a 3.0+ GPA. 

&amp;nbsp;

I know, I've met, and I'm surrounded by a LOT of rich kids while trying to go into med school. Their parents pay for everything, they don't and haven't worked. They're allowed to go take unpaid internships, volunteer at hospitals and put themselves into positions where getting into med school becomes increasingly more easy because they don't have to worry about things like rent, car payments, food, or family obligations.


I've listened to one of my friends complain that she could no longer buy a new car because money her grandparents were going to give her now had to be used for medical expenses for her grandpa. Now she holds it against her grandparents.


They still complain. They whine about not getting in the first try. They whine about their 3.9 GPA. Professors are unfair. They deserve better. Their ""old"" 2004 subaru. I'm sick of the entitlement. No, you're not God's gift to the world. You don't deserve anything. You're not very special. The world owes you nothing. 


You want something? Work hard for it. Persevere, use your cunning to get where you want. Exercise your reasoning skills and further your knowledge base. This is the way the world SHOULD work, right? 

&amp;nbsp;

I feel somewhat cheated. I wasn't given the opportunity to go to college directly out of highschool. My parents had 8 kids and were still in the middle class. That wasn't taken into account. I never got financial aid because my parents still made enough to put me through college (hah!). I got out of HS with a 3.4 GPA. I never got any advice or guidance for getting into college, I couldn't enroll in after-school activities during HS because I was working full time to help support my now single mother and the other 4 kids still living at the house. At 28, colleges don't look kindly to those that don't go to college immediately after highschool, at least as far as finances go. 


When I look at my ""circumstances"" in comparison to my friends now, I can see a stark contrast. College now rewards those who have money. The privileged have an even greater advantage now than I think they did earlier in our country's history. The rich are getting richer and power is becoming increasingly tighter in its circle.


Sometimes, I look at my ""circumstances"" and I'm tempted to bitch about it like I have above. But in the long run, I prefer it. I've seen first hand what happens to people when they're given what they ""want"" without having to work for it. They're unhappy. They're depressed. They have psychiatric disorders. What the hell am I actually bitching about anyway? I live in the United States. It's EXTREMELY hard to fail. You fail in other countries and you DIE. I have no room to bitch. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm still VERY privileged and have nothing to complain about. Bring on the hardship.


In ways, I feel bad for those who complain, the depressed, those with anxiety disorders. In other ways, I see a level of justice in the outcomes of the world. Those who are given, without work, everything they've ""wanted,"" they turn out depressed. They're unsatisfied. 


Those who have nothing, appreciate the world so much more. When given the chance to change the world, they penetrate and change the world around them for the better. Teachers, doctors, friends, professors, researchers, and so on. You've met them. You remember them. You probably still talk to them. These people are given such an extraordinary gift to change the world. 


The stipulation is this: It's hard. It's lonely. It breaks your heart. I don't see any other way around this.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm older than those around me. I don't belong to the richer circles that surround me. Even if I do end up making a lot of money, I don't think I'll ever be able to relate to them. I don't want to. Those who endure hardship and persevere are amazing people. They appreciate the world so much more and they are true friends. I'm grateful for my ""circumstances."" 


I will persevere. I will work harder. Through hardship, I will better myself. 


I'm done listening to the bitching though. Myself included."

Need some advice about how to best prepare for an SDE1 role in AWS at Amazon. I feel like I may have skated through the process and landed this gig. I have never worked as a developer at a large tech company (no prior technical internship experience). I have little sense of what types of skills to have for a base-level programmer (git, basic unit tests, etc.). 

I attend a top-10 school and have only been studying CS for the latter half of my school career after switching into it from another discipline (which is why I do not have prior dev experience). 

Some things I am considering to prepare:

* Set up a few dev projects using AWS services (hosting on an instance, using a data store, etc.)
* Reading books like Clean Code

Beyond that I'm not sure what else to do. I'm worried that I'll be sniffed out as incompetent in the first few weeks/months and potentially end up on a PIP.

Any advice you all may have would be much appreciated."

Apparently there is a lot of software companies here, but I cannot seem to find hardly anyone in the area advertising for jobs let alone someone willing to hire an entry level employee. Especially since I am self learned.
 The only jobs I currently see are for an aviation joint, but the job description seems to require some electrical engineering knowledge and I can barely build an arduino circuit let alone a robust one. 
It seems like most companies are looking for senior developers or asking for 5 plus years. I've read that if they say 1 or 2 years then you can usually get away as a beginner but you don't want to be very far under what they ask for.
I'm not sure what to do to get started. I've asked places for internships as well and provided my github and bitbucket and nobody responds. Yet I have a friend in the industry saying I should be able to land a job with the knowledge I know. 
It kind of seems like I need to relocate, but I can't afford to do so at the moment as I don't have an income. I'd be willing to work remotely or relocate if a company offered but i dont think a company would want to pay for me to relocate as a junior dev.

Basically, I'm looking for any potentially relevant information that could help me land an internship. Most of my experience is in Java, but I'm in a web programming class currently where we are working with HTML, CSS, ASP, AJAX, MySQL, etc.

I consider myself good at coding, I've been coding since High School and even thought I might not be a prodigy, I feel confident in my coding foundations. Establishing that, my question is that how do I make projects? Yes I know how to code, I know the theory and usage of the languages (JAVA mainly) but I honestly have no clue in how to implement it. I feel like I'm too late since I'm already a sophomore and I really have zero personal projects. As an example, I tried to get into Android Development but it felt too advanced.

I don't have any previous internship experience or anything, so no hands-on real experience. I haven't created any apps or anything on the side,but I have a few small ""projects"" (more like problem-solving programs) on my github, but I feel like they're pointless to have. 

On the note of job experience, I've really never had an actual job either (one that gives a paycheck every week or two). On my resume, for 'Relevant Experience', I just have a few projects I had to do for some classes.

None of them have been full blown, robust applications, and most have not been finished. I feel like this makes me sound useless, like I have issues focusing on one project at a time. Most of the time I stopped projects because I started working more for my father in construction, which made it difficult to come home and put my head in code, when I wanted to come home and sleep and binge eat cause my body hurt from work lol.

I know a decent amount(probably just enough) about HTTP requests and how they work and working with JSON data and creating web services to provide data to multi platform applications. I can usually hack my way through most problems I have encountered. I've even tried my hand at game programming quickly realizing I am better off staying with web applications and services and building api's. I have done things like wire up and code an arduino circuit that sent the ambient room temperature via a bluetooth connection to a android app I put together to simply display the temperature, or write a script that downloaded xml files that provided country names states cities populations zipcodes etc and parse the info out into SQL scripts to create a database seed for development purposes to build a craigslist like website a friend of mine was trying to build.

Most recently I worked with the MEAN stack (mongodb express angularjs and nodejs) to attempt to build my sister a website that was going to be a sort of yelp like app that would provide people with a way to find restaurants that cater to food allergies and provide them with menu's to look at. Project turned out to be a little much for me seeing as I lack knowledge and experience of designing scalable applications from the ground up. I also at the time was working a lot with my dad in construction so the project kinda became forgotten about.

I am not a person who enjoys putting themselves out there, it makes me very uncomfortable and I feel like I'm lying when I try to sell someone something and that makes me feel like crap. So selling myself to a company makes me feel like I'm lying because I have no idea if I am going to be able to be a valuable employee, or if I'm in over my head. I am not good at bullshitting people let alone conversing with people in general. I am a very introverted person and really don't talk to anyone. I only know one developer and he lives on the other side of the US. I am willing to relocate or work remotely and even work a paid internship (or heck maybe even free for now if I don't have to relocate) if it means getting experience and gaining knowledge to become a more marketable developer. I am currently feeling incredibly overwhelmed trying to find a job, and feeling like maybe I am just not cut out for the industry. I'm sure once I'm in with the right people I could absorb like crazy and excel at it. Anyways any guidance would be awesome. Maybe there are some books out there that can help me become versed in software development therefore more comfortable, as all I have ever read have been language or framework books basically. Just looking for the golden nuggets of information that will make it all make sense to me and help push me past this point in my life into a lifelong career that's capable of financially supporting myself.

[What is your take on the distinction between the behavior difference related to pack hunting of the introduced wolves versus the native wolves in Yellowstone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjnnz5?context=5)|The Yellowstone region's native wolves were eradicated by a government program in the early 1900s without much scientific documentation of their behavior.  But the reintroduced wolves originated from similar habitats in southern Canada.  Given that wolves are capable of traversing immense distances (wolves from the Northern Rockies have made it to California and Arizona) it seems unlikely that the native Yellowstone population was insulated from other wolf populations.  For that reason, it also seems unlikely there were major behavioral differences between the original native wolves and wolves in the area of Canada from which the reintroduced wolves originated.
[What advice would you give to a student considering entering law? Thanks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjo3a0?context=5)|At the outset, I would suggest that you think hard about what you want to do with your legal career and make sure you really want to be a lawyer, because law school is a lot of hard work and it is expensive!  If you decide you really do want to pursue a career in the law and in particular you want to work in the public interest rather than for a private firm, then I would encourage you to explore public-interest opportunities during your summer internship periods.  That will help you transition into a public-interest job even if you initially have to work in a private law firm to pay off student loans.  Good luck!
[Do you favor the proliferation of wolves because you like seeing rural western people unable to self sustain through harvesting elk and moose as we used to?  Do you hunt elk?  Have you seen firsthand, as I have, the decimation of elk herds at the hands of wolves and people like yourself?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjmqjn?context=5)|Yes I have hunted elk, and I and many others enjoy experiencing elk and other species in a diverse environment that includes native predators such as wolves.  As to impacts on elk hunting, the fact is that the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reported that Wyoming elk hunters killed a near-record number of elk in 2013 -- 25,968 elk with a hunter success rate of about 45 percent. As to sustaining rural communities, the good news is that wolf-related tourism has boosted many local economies in the Northern Rockies region.  A recent study documented that wolf restoration has produced a $35.5 million annual economic benefit to the Greater Yellowstone area. 
[Source? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjo7ke?context=5)|The source for the $35.5 million economic benefit is from a study led by University of Montana economist John Duffield.  It is discussed here:   ([Link to www.ypf.org](http://www.ypf.org/print-news-archives/25.pdf))
[But isn't it true that the elk hunting opportunities in the wolf units such as those around the park have in fact taken a nose dive?  Do you feel that elk management could have more aptly been handled by human hunters?  Do you feel that the wolf program is an affront to the western agrarian lifestyle?  Do you feel that perhaps our fore-fathers knew what they were doing when they removed the wolf from our ecosystems?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjpvlt?context=5)|Actually, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reported in 2012 that only 2 out of 35 elk herds in the state are below the state's own population objective.  The other questions you ask really raise questions about individual values rather than biological facts.  If you are asking about my own values, I would answer that it is short-sighted to remove native species from an ecosystem and that the return of wolves has improved the ecological integrity of the Northern Rockies and sparked the imagination of hundreds of thousands of people who have visited the region in the hope of seeing a wolf in the wild.  
[Are gray wolves living near to and in human populated areas? If gray wolves being shot on site is becoming an issue to their population, isn't the problem that these wolves are living too close to people, not that people are shooting to many wolves?  Also, what is the desired outcome of this legal battle? I know FWS does great work regulating populations of fish and prey animals with tags and daily limits. The only reason they would allow shoot on sight for wolves would be because there are too many in the area, on what grounds do you disagree with them? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlw20?context=5)|In the Northern Rockies region, most wolves do not live near major human population centers.  Although conflicts with humans do occur, they generally involve wolf depredations on livestock.  Although these incidents get a lot of publicity, they are a drop in the bucket of livestock losses sustained by the ranching industry.  For instance, Wyoming cattle and calf losses from all causes totaled 41,000 animals in 2010.  Wolves were responsible for 0.7% of all cattle losses and 1.7% of all calf losses in Wyoming during that year.  As to the desired outcome of the legal battle, it is to ensure that state laws are adequate to ensure a secure wolf population for the long-term before federal protections are removed.
[You are referring to wolves as endangered species in your second sentence.  Isn't the term ""endangered species"" a phrase with a specific legal definition?  Are you arguing that the wolves are still legally an endangered species?  At what population level will the wolves no longer be considered endangered in Wyoming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjjj0i?context=5)|The official government recovery standard calls for 10 breeding pairs and 100 wolves in Wyoming outside of Yellowstone National Park, with genetic connectivity to other wolf populations and adequate state regulations to make sure that neither the population nor connectivity requirements is compromised in the future.  Wolves were returned to the endangered list in Wyoming because a federal court found that Wyoming does not provide adequate state regulations to protect the species.  In addition, Wyoming wolves remain largely isolated from any other wolf populations. 
[Can you explain why it is important to distinguish between inside the park and outside the park?  Isn't the goal to have a sustainable population regardless of whether they are in or out of the park?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjk08v?context=5)|Because Yellowstone National Park is not under the State of Wyoming's authority, the federal wildlife agency established a recovery standard that imposes specific population requirements for the area that the State does control -- i.e., the area outside the Park.  This is because Yellowstone National Park is not big enough to support a sustainable population by itself.  The idea was that the combination of the Park wolf population plus the required population outside the Park would together ensure a sustainable population for the future.
[Why are people shooting the wolves in the first place? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlzm0?context=5)|While some wolves are shot due to conflicts with livestock, others are shot for recreational hunting under state law.  But Wyoming's laws go even farther to allow wolves to be killed without any limit, year-round, throughout 85 percent of the State's territory.  This amounts to a wolf eradication policy for the great bulk of Wyoming, including areas that are important migration corridors to link wolves in Wyoming up with populations in Montana and Idaho.
[Thanks! Can you give an estimate (with a source preferably\) of the percentage of wolves that are shot for recreation-only purposes?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjnh3q?context=5)|According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Northern Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Program 2014 Report (which is the most recent one available), 481 wolves were killed by hunters in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming in 2014.  That represented 68% of all human-caused wolf mortality in 2014.
[Our of curiosity, what is the counter-argument for keeping no-limits hunting around? What is the total wolf population and what would be a sustainable rate of death per year for the population to remain stable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjor9m?context=5)|The unlimited hunting in Wyoming is intended to prevent a wolf population from occupying that area.  In the Northern Rockies, the total wolf population is estimated at 1,657.  The sustainable mortality rate for a wolf population is a subject of significant debate in the scientific literature.
[Why do you guys care about wolf conservation?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjiee5?context=5)|Wolf conservation is important because wolves have beneficial impacts on the environment that cascade through entire ecosystems.  Wolves prey on grazing animals such as elk, which affects the numbers and behaviors of those animals, which in turn impacts all kinds of things including vegetation and even songbird habitat.  Wolves also are important within our culture because they are living symbols of wilderness and wildness for many people.
[Why in the world would someone want to shoot a wolf? They are such majestic creatures.  Have you ever seen the film ""Never Cry Wolf,"" or read the book?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlp5f?context=5)|Thanks for the comment.  Never Cry Wolf provides a compelling account of an inspiring experience with wild wolves.  Another great literary testament to the importance of wolves for a healthy ecosystem is Aldo Leopold's essay ""Thinking Like a Mountain.""  Still, the fact remains that wolves generate passions unlike any other wildlife species in my experience.  Some people love them but others hate them and want to eradicate them.
[Weren't Oregon wolves removed from state endangered species list? What does that mean for the local population? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxji3bs?context=5)|Oregon removed wolves from its state endangered species list on Nov. 9, 2015.  As a result, more lethal measures could be allowed to manage wolves in Oregon in the future. An upcoming wolf plan review could also lead to changes in protections.  Oregon's action has no effect on wolves west of highways 97, 20 and 395, which are still protected under the federal Endangered Species Act. 
[Increased substantially? What exactly would that number be compared to their pre-extirpation population and range? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjposn?context=5)|Wolves once ranged across the entire area now occupied by the United States and their numbers were many orders of magnitude beyond what they are today.  At the same time, immense populations of bison, elk, deer and other prey species also roamed the landscape.  Wolves lived in balance with their prey species over the millennia before modern wildlife management entered the scene.
[In concert with protecting an endangered species, such as the gray wolf, what food chain species are under consideration for protection, to bolster the wolf population? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3v1kep/gray_wolves_in_wyoming_were_being_shot_on_sight/cxjlt84?context=5)|Prey species for wolves are doing quite well without protection.  Right now there are more elk in Wyoming than the state wants, and Montana just proposed extending elk hunting seasons to reduce elk numbers.  The issue for wolves is not bolstering prey species but preventing excessive killing of wolves by humans.

3v2noa,1,2015-12-01,Advice on Reneging and Deciding Between Companies,babygotbackend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v2noa/advice_on_reneging_and_deciding_between_companies/,"**Questions:**

1. What are the repercussions of reneging on a company? I know it’s really bad etiquette, and I’ve heard that you can be blacklisted
2. What is your opinion of IBM vs. Cisco? Feedback from people who have worked at these companies would be very appreciated 

**Background:** 

I started applying for summer internships in September and got a few offers but eventually accepted a summer internship at IBM in October. A couple weeks ago I got an email from Cisco regarding their intent to offer me a summer internship, and I am expecting the official offer letter in the next few days. I am tempted to take the Cisco offer when it is made and reneg on IBM because Cisco seems to be closer to the cutting edge and less set in their ways than IBM. Obviously, this is mostly speculation based on testimonies that I have read on this subreddit and Glassdoor, because I have not worked at either of these companies. Also, Cisco would be willing to relocate me to one of their locations far from my university, which is an opportunity I have always aspired for.

**Details:** 

* Both positions are for software development interns
* IBM gave me 5 business days to respond after I received my offer
* It was roughly 3 weeks between my acceptance and this new offer
* I have not signed anything; I only sent an email telling them I accepted
* I did not think I would get Cisco when I accepted IBM. Cisco only told me they were still reviewing all the applications at the time of my acceptance
* Salaries are roughly the same
* I could potentially work at IBM during the school year, which would help build my experience
* I interacted closely with an IBM employee throughout the application/hiring process, and he could potentially be my supervisor/mentor. I mention this only because I have heard that mentorship is often more valuable than any work done during an internship

I have had a ME internship for the past year and still work there (now a contractor) but my contract is almost up. I have another contract I can do starting the beginning of next year for another company but it's very low pay.

I know I messed up during graduation by sticking around so long (thought I was getting a job) but I have been actively applying to places since early Sept. (30+ applications). I just got my first rejection email from an application I filled out last week. Have not had a single phone/in-person interview yet, except for recruiters calling about jobs 3+ hours away from where I am now. 

Is the market this bad or am I just being overly picky and should take the first job that comes next, no matter the pay or location?"

my boss is really well connected ,so someone from Apple reached out to me about getting an internship at there. I am a Junior in Computer Science. I was asked what areas interest me ,and to be honest, I have so many interest. I love the idea of actually going into marketing ,or doing UI/UX design. I also heard that work culture at Apple can be terrible depending on the group that you work in. I wouldn't mind the long hours just as long as I know that my boss/supervisor would treat me right. Could any former/current Apple employees give me some advice on this?"
3v407y,46,2015-12-02,Data from 3 months of data scientist interviews,origin415,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3v407y/data_from_3_months_of_data_scientist_interviews/,"Hi all,

The past three months I've been interviewing for data scientist positions and I thought I would share my results since posts like this have been popular in the past.

##Background:
I am finishing up a mathematics PhD. Around the time I was finishing my thesis (in algebraic geometry, completely pure math), about a year ago, I decided to focus entirely on a career in industry, and have been taking advantage of my student status taking graduate CS and stats courses at my university in preparation, as well as taking an ML internship this past summer.

Thus, I'm fairly similar to what seems like a large contingent in this sub: technical background trying to break into data science. Fortunately I had some programming experience already to make this an easier transition.

My resume reads something like:  
Education:  
PhD Mathematics, Decent University  
Additional coursework in Statistics and Computer Science  
BS Mathematics, minor Physics, Less Decent University  

Experience:  
Mathematics TA/Instructor, 5 years

Researcher, Government Lab, 3 months (last summer)  
Applying stats/ML to large data sets using Python, R, C++, SQL

Programmer, Government Lab, 8 months (during undergrad)  
Writing GUIs for controlling a large scientific measurement device, in C

Programmer, Government Lab, 6 months (during undergrad)  
Using unsupervised learning to analyze medical data, in C

Languages/tools: Python, R, C++, C, SQL, D3.js, Tableau, CUDA, Matlab

## Process
This past September I began applying, telling companies I could graduate in December as long as I heard back before November 30th and could my defense set up and such. I intended to continue at my university for another quarter if I didn't find anything.

In general the process is thus: first, a phone call with the recruiter talking generally about the position, my background, and gauging my interest.

Next, 1-3 technical screens, half focusing on programming and the other half on data science.

The programming half is on something like collabedit, and generally has a few questions for you to code up in python. These range from ""merge two sorted lists"" and ""compute the fibonacci numbers"" to ""write a routine to preprocess text files, code to train a naive bayes classifier, and predict using that code (not call a library, write the whole thing)"". I recommend checking out a site like HackerRank (for the problems, not the contests), which have a range of problem difficulties. Practice talking through your thought process too.

The data science half has some basic stats questions and generally talking through how you would solve a ML problem from start to finish. For instance, one time I had to talk through how I would set up Zillow's Zestimate from what data I would use, what model, how I would train it over a large set, verify results, keep it updated, diagnose problems, etc.

Then there's the on-site, which is similar to the screens above but more focused on the actual company and role, more difficult, and much longer.

## The Numbers

I ended up applying to 39 companies, all in the Seattle area (part of my motivation for industry was that I could stay in Seattle). Of those, I got interest from 11, but only 7 were willing to get through the process before my deadline. Of those, I withdrew my application after the first screen for 1, was rejected after a screen for a second, withdrew before the scheduled on-site for another, and thus had 4 on-site interviews.

For one, they initially accepted while saying they would provide a 6 week training program since my background wasn't strong enough. Eventually they reneged and said to hold off for a few months. I had concerns for the work/life balance there, so this didn't worry me that much.

For another, I was rejected after the on-site. Oh well.

The last two I got offers from, and decided to take one.

[Here is a google doc for full details](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PpU2P9V8CPujRRdUX9WDjKxGRmn_dib76d2gIMuBHdA/edit#gid=0&amp;vpid=A1). I've anonymized the companies and uniformized the job titles somewhat (there are many equivalent titles to data scientist (quantitative analyst, machine learning scientist, statistical analyst, research engineer...)), but the dates and offers are real. SDE = any software role, DS = data scientist or equivalent, RS = research scientist (large overlap with DS but sometimes focused on a particular topic like NLP or computer vision).

Let me know if you have any questions!"

Ive been offered a gis analyst job in St Louis, Missouri.  I live in New York. I just graduated college this past may with a BS in Geography.  The company the job is with is a pretty well known and very large corporation.  

Does anybody have any experience with relocating for a job?  Ive been putting myself through hell for the past few days trying to make this decision.  I have a girlfriend here (I know thats not a good reason to decline an offer but its not at all the only reason im considering saying no and trying to find something else.)

The only reason I even applied was because I thought it would be cool to see if i even heard back from them.  I wasnt a straight A student.  Not even close.  Im not a GIS genius at all, in fact im pretty mediocre but I have internship experience with Python programming in GIS and I use and know Linux and Unix systems.  They asked me questions about that so I guess thats what attracted them to me. 

Anyway, would I be passing up too much of a good opportunity if I say no?  I just feel like I would be miserable living in the Midwest all alone, probably living in some crappy apartment in st louis by myself.  No family or friends or girlfriend except on the phone.  The thought of it almost brings me to tears.  I dont want to move, but feel like I would be passing up a good opportunity.  I honestly never expected to even get an interview.  And they offered me a job with just a phone interview.  Experiencing a different part of the country would be good.  But I just feel like im leaving so much behind, for not so great pay, but probably decent experience, and the beginnings of a career.  

Sorry, just needed to vent.  

Anybody else have experience with relocating or at least just have any feedback?  I have to make a decision by Thursday, and I suck at making big decisions like this.  Ive just been absolutely miserable the past few days and something tells me if im this upset just trying to make the decision, I should probably just stay home and only apply to local positions. "
3v4dqd,5,2015-12-02,How does a security clearance job (as an intern) affect future (non-clearance) career options?,smashdragon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3v4dqd/how_does_a_security_clearance_job_as_an_intern/,"As the title states, I'm a CS junior in college, I have two job offers for internships on the table, and I'm trying to weigh pros and cons of each. One offer is from one of the major US DoD contractors (You'd recognize the name), this job would require a secret (not top secret) clearance. The pros of this job would be that it would pay $5/hour more, be closer to my house and to school, and be easier work which would allow me to focus more on school. The cons are that I'm not interested in pursuing a career in government or DoD contracting post graduation and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot by taking an internship that's not challenging and not in my projected career path. 

The other job offer is for a firmware position at a local data storage company, which is much closer aligned to what I see myself doing in 5 years, although it would not pay as much, and would be more challenging. Challenging would be good and bad: good in that I would learn a lot more, and the experience would likely be more valuable; bad in that I am also taking a full class load of challenging courses and I want to make sure my grades don't suffer. Both companies plan to hire me on in January and would have me work through the school year and into summer and possibly beyond.

So my questions are these:

* Does obtaining your clearance shoehorn you into future clearance work? 

* I had heard that private companies are sometimes hesitant to hire workers with security clearances, as they could be potential liabilities for the company. Is that true?

* If I were to obtain my clearance, does that come with future obligations and responsibilities if I choose not to use it in the future? I know traveling to certain countries discouraged for clearance holders, is this true even after the clearance is not being used or inactive? I.E. are you put on a ""list""?

* How long does a secret clearance take? I imagine I wouldn't be able to start working until the clearance investigation passed. I have no criminal history or anything so I'm not worried about getting cleared, but I am worried about the time it would take between offer letter to starting work.

I appreciate any advice, and thanks in advance."

In July, I had my second interview after graduating and got hired. The firm deals in Industrial Automation Solutions and I was taken on as an intern (software development) for the starting three months. Kind of like a probation.

[I live in India, so units of legal tender will be in Rupees (₹).]

I was paid a measly ₹5,000 for each of the three months of working as an intern, what they said was a standard intern stipend. I did not really complain because it was the first real job that I had. My offer letter clearly states that:

&gt; ... On the successful completion of your internship, the company shall promote you as a **""Junior Software Developer""** which will be subject to the achievement of mutually agreed performance targets. You will be due for revision in salary after the successful completion of internship, subject to your performance.

The company rules also state that:

* Employees are expected to complete an eight-hour work day.
* Timings are from 9 am to 6 pm.
* Since I have some sleep problems, I end up waking late and reaching work by 10 am.
* Since the last 40-50 days, I have been staying back after work hours, ranging from 7 pm to 8:30 pm.

I joined on the 20th of July, today is the 2nd of December. I haven't heard from them about my permanent employment at all. The CEO is a very intimidating person, and was out of the country for the whole month of November. Now that he's back, I thought there will be some headway in my employment procedure. But whenever he calls me for 'discussions,' he asks me what the status of my work is and then just launches off into twenty to thirty minutes of life advice, and saying how they're still evaluating my performance, even though the three months of my internship (in which they should ideally evaluate me) are over. This has happened thrice now.

I understand I'm not the very best at what I do, and it is my fault also. I do like the job, since **it is** what I graduated in, but I'm not happy with it. I have zero energy left post-work and no drive to do anything creative or social after work hours. All I get is a Sunday, since we have a six-day work week, and I feel like doing nothing except for lazing around.

I am very interested in a writing job, and think that it is my calling. I have applied to certain places where there are good opportunities for a writer, and I would like to leave this place soon. I talked to a friend and she advised me that considering how the work environment is and how rigid the people are, they wouldn't let me leave, I should give them the reason of higher studies abroad and leave at the end of December, citing reasons that there will be too much on my plate from January. I thought it through and seemed plausible.

I then talked to another co-worker who had left the job shortly after I joined, to get a better understanding of the temperament and thought-processes of the CEO. He advised me to stay calm and not fold to whatever tactics he'll apply on me, or whatever curveballs he'll throw if he suspects I'm, in fact, joining another company. He also pointed out the fact that since there isn't any talk of my employment there yet, I'm not obliged to anything, and can leave without much hassle. But they will create problems in payment of salary because that's how they've been to any ex-employee who has decided to resign.

My questions are:

* Should I go ahead with the further studies abroad as an excuse for leaving?
* What should I do if they ask me for proof, since there isn't any?
* How do I convince them to clear my salary upfront and not keep me in the dark?"

I'm a Computer Science major in my last year. After Spring I only have 3 classes left to take, but I'm graduating in Fall for a few reasons. This gives me a chance to get an internship under my belt (and a break from academics, which I desperately need).

I go to school in Florida, but I'm from Los Angeles and would like to land an internship there (Woodland Hills area would be the best).

I'm an USAF veteran - I did an *extremely* technical and demanding job, so I developed a very vast technical skillset from that. I was rather successful in the military and I did also develop great leadership and communication skills there.

On to my question:

I've applied to a number of internships with various companies (mostly in LA). I go on their websites, fill things out to the best of my ability. Church up my resume, and submit. I've applied to a lot of internships with defense contractors, but I haven't been limited to that.

I came across two Facebook internships (to do with Internet.org) which involved literally my exact job in the military, as well as electronics and coding skills. This seems silly to say, but they may as well have listed in their requirements that they specifically need somebody who is 5' 10"" with my exact name and SSN.

I applied to 6 Lockheed-Martin internships which each requested a Computer Science major with exactly the kind of experience I got from the Air Force: on some specific technologies, protocols, and products. In fact I don't know how you would gain this sort of specific experience if you didn't do my exact job.

But I don't hear back from anyone. I submit my application, and it just gets lost in the abyss. How do I touch bases with somebody and get my foot in the door. I feel like I have enough qualifications to be a productive intern and eventually employee, but nobody seems interested. What do I do?

I've tried talking to some reps who come to my campus, and unfortunately that hasn't been fruitful. I've been away from LA for a long time too, so I don't have much of a professional network over there.

I can't tell which one gets into the lower level theorys though. I think they are calling there CS course, computer information systems but I'm not 100. 

Which one will look the best on a resume, or will help me land a internship the fastest?

Been lurking here for a while now and I noticed how common being a skilled programmer is before starting college.

I am in my second year of college and have only taken a few CS courses so far, mostly OOP in Java, receiving all As or Bs. I've also started to introduce myself to new code outside of class as well as Github, but at this point still have only just tapped the surface of CS. 

Now for the question, knowing my experience so far and that I have about 2 and a half years left in college, am I too far behind to pursue a CS degree? It seems many going into school have already learned a language or two while in HS I concentrated mostly on my four year engineering program that I decided to not pursue as a career. Other than being an avid gamer and taking one community college class on OOP I went into college relatively new to CS. 

Another question, should I be self teaching as much as possible outside of class or focusing on my course material? 

One of the main reasons I ask is because many internships which I'm hoping to acquire soon look for those who know several languages already and I am no where near that yet. Any advice is very appreciated! "

Right now I'm a third year student at UCLA studying Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular genetics BS with a minor in Bioinformatics. Going through the bioinformatics pathway has really helped me find a passion in computer science and programming. Right now I'm proficient in C++, fairly competent in R, and am going to learn python this upcoming month.

However, when I attended our career fair, a lot of recruiters seemed a bit off-put by my degree -- they thought it was a little bit strange that a life science major wished to do programming or software engineering work.

I've recently found out that my school offers a BA in Linguistics and Computer Science, which goes a lot more in depth than the bioinformatics minor, and covers different topics. I'd still stick with the bioinformatics minor since there are a lot of important probabilistic modeling computer applications to be learned.

Do you recommend that I switch my major to strengthen my marketability? I'd love to go into the field of data science, any type of programming, or any video game or some sort of development. 

If I were to switch my major, I would need to be at the university for an extra quarter or two though. So I'm not sure if it's worth it entirely to just attempt to get a Master's in computer science after getting the Microbio degree anyway.

As my current major, I don't have as much time as I'd like to be able to do side projects, and I feel that those are a great way to get my shoe in the door.

I guess bottom of the line is, can I be just as competitive as others who have studied computer science as a life science major if I prove my worth with internships and side projects? Or should I try and switch altogether to a degree with Computer Science in the name?

The first paid job I got was through my college's career fair (also where I got my internship) but that's in April, the other job was through a headhunter and the ones I'm working with now haven't been too helpful. 

So where is a good spot to get entry level jobs? My last job paid 65k and I'm wondering if expecting similar pay is holding me back. In any case, I get interviews but they complain about me not having enough experience and it seems that every job posting I see wants more than 2 years experience or wants 6 different languages and I've used maybe 4 of them. I've mostly been going through indeed.

Also after interviewing with Amazon I got to visit Seattle and I liked it. Any advice for applying to there (I live near Los Angeles and I could only fly out there for the interview because it was on Amazon's dime)."

I'm only a freshman at a decently ranked state school, and when the semester ends in a few weeks, I plan to spend most of my break doing applications for different companies and such. Before applying I have a few general questions:

* I'm only a freshman, but I have a decent amount of experience through personal projects and taking CS classes in high school. How important is actual experience? How much should I be expected to know going into an internship/interview?

* Branching off of the previous question, how important is a github profile/portfolio of projects? I have some personal projects, but I don't really wish to publish them because they are not the best demonstration of good programming principles, and I don't necessarily want to open source my work (I understand this isn't generally desirable, and my code isn't anything revolutionary, but I still don't feel comfortable about open-sourcing these particular projects).

* What is the best way to distinguish myself from others? I learn concepts very quickly and am regarded highly among my friends as I am the one they turn to for help with learning new concepts and assignments. Is something like this even relevant?

* How important is knowledge of versioning and usage of it within my personal projects? My extent of versioning right now is working out of the workspace within my dropbox. It syncs up, and it works for me, but I still understand that this isn't the correct method of version control. I plan on learning this, and I am going to set up a git server for myself for future projects (if this is what I should be doing). However, is it bad that I do not have a maintained and visible history of the projects I've worked on?

* Finally, how important is a strong knowledge of Linux? I understand that linux is a staple within the industry, but I've only recently started to use it after attending meetings of my university's cyber security club. I would definitely consider myself a much better user of Windows or OS X, but I'd be much more of a liability than asset when it comes to Linux.

Thanks for reading this, and for any possible feedback you all might have. I just want to best prepare myself for the future, and I do plan on improving upon the skills I lack in order to better integrate into a workforce."

But before I say any more, a bit about myself. I'm a student on a F1 visa.  Both these startups have said they can sponsor H1B's for me if I get a return offer. That is the most important aspect for my internship.

Now, AppDyanmics is in SF and Flatiron health is in NYC. And SF has been hailed as the central for anyone who wants to launch a tech career.
Also, I think AppDyanmics is a more funded and stronger Startup than Flatiron. These two points make me want to intern at AppDyanmics.

However I find the work Flatiron does more engaging. It's also compensating me a lot better than AppDyanmics, but that could just be because of the difference in costs between NYC and SF.

If anyone can shed some light on what kind of startups these both are I'd be indebted. My deadline to accept the offer draws near and I'm very confused on the matter. Thanks.

Just to put it out there:

AppDyanmics is offering $5700 per month with a $500 housing stipend.

Flatiron Health is offering $7300 per month with a $1000 housing stipend.

You sign on for 4 months at a lower pay and have no guarantee of a full-time position, but at least you get get the experience.

I personally have an internship at a local decently successful tech startup  (they're not going to be a unicorn anytime soon though), but I seem to be losing out to candidates that have a second or third internship under their belts (many of which are big tech firms -- though not necessarily big 4). Both because it looks good on their resume, and second because when they get asked questions in their interviews, they have the experience to back up their answers.

3vf6x3,1,2015-12-04,Current sophomore scheduled to graduate early; would like advice/discussions abut my options.,hwtfls,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vf6x3/current_sophomore_scheduled_to_graduate_early/,"Hey all, I'm a current sophomore scheduled to graduate next year (May 2017) with a BS in Computer Science, even if I take the bare minimum credits per semester. However, I'd really strongly like to walk for graduation with my friends who are primarily C/O 2018(personal choice).

Regarding my personal motivations and goals... they're not too specific, which is why I'd like an outsider's POV in weighing the cost/benefit of my options. 

My options as far as I can tell:

1) **Get a minor/dual major.** This is my least favorite options. I'm not particularly sure what other field I'd be interested in enough to get another undergrad degree in. If I go this route, I was thinking either econ (because it's a subject I really liked in high school that I even took more classes on it at a local community college in my spare time, no credit at my uni for it, though) or stats (since I think working with data is mad cool, but I'm not sure how useful this would be because it seems like most data analyst/quant positions require graduate degrees).

2) **Use the last year or two for an MS** My school offers a 3+2 integrated BS/MS degree, which I'll be able to do in 4 years (spoke with my academic adviser on this). However, it will be another MS in CS, but with more specialised tracks like computational biology, computer security, etc that aren't offered at undergrad. I think this is a very viable option for me, but I'm not really sure what the benefits of a graduate degree are if I do not choose to pursue data analyst positions. I feel like I would not feel significantly less satisfied doing SWE work. I'd be happy either way, so I'm not really sure if it's ""worth it"" to attend school for another year that I can be doing something else.

3) **Study abroad for a semester.** Sounds fun, but this would probably only delay graduating by a semester. It's also not something I'm terribly interested in, since I only speak English and my native tongue, and I've attended school in my native country before.

4) **Take semester internships?** Not sure if this is possible, but I was thinking of going to school one semester, then doing an internship for another semester for the next two years. Or like take an internship, and study abroad (thereby postponing graduating by 1 year haha). My school definitely will allow me to take leaves of absences, though. Do companies hire a lot for fall/spring internships? There doesn't seem to be much of a timeline of when to apply for them either. Would people look down on me for only having attended 1 semester of school for my last two years of college?

5) **Just graduate early** Not too sold on this one; my internship for the upcoming summer will not lead to a FT offer since it is designed for younger students, but I took it because I really like the project/company culture. So a bit worried about if I can find a job like this. Also, I don't really feel ready to enter the ""real world"" of working since I'm already young for my year.

Can't really think of any other options, but if you have ideas/input, I'd love to hear them."

3vfrcl,0,2015-12-04,Can't seem to settle on what I want to do.,dncarter,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3vfrcl/cant_seem_to_settle_on_what_i_want_to_do/,"I am a 24 year old student in computer science at the moment. I already have one degree from a different school in history. I decided to go into computer science due to a long and semi-painful 4 years at my previous school due to personal reasons. Let's just say that I was at a very low point mentally and I was in an abusive relationship and when I finally woke myself up enough to get out and move back home, I didn't really feel like myself. I had been away from home for 4 years and I think I was in a depressed haze that whole time. I felt like I had to recreate myself in order to move past what had happened, so I went back to school for computer science because it's a very big field right now and I could make a lot of money doing it.

Well, now I feel back to my old self again and I am wondering if I have made a mistake. I am good at computer science, and I really enjoyed the earlier classes, but now it is getting a lot more in-depth and difficult and I am not sure that it's what I want to do. I have been trying to find an internship and a lot of the companies I have interviewed with have been very corporate-y and I don't like corporate environments. I also am not sure I like the idea of having to think about technology 40 hours a week for the rest of my life. I seem to have lost a lot of the enjoyment I got out of it early on, and now it's just a chore to do my assignments every night.

My love of history has come back to me, and I am thinking I might have made a mistake not pursuing it when I first graduated from my previous school. Now I am trying to think of a way to have a career that utilizes both of my skills/interests: archives or library work. The only thing is, that would require ANOTHER degree (master's of library science) and the pay is a lot less than I could possibly make if I follow the usual computer science career (some type of tech job). I think I would enjoy the work more than the strictly tech corporate job, though the idea of having to get ANOTHER degree and go into MORE debt is not appealing. And while the salary isn't a huge deal to me, I would have more debt that would be eating into a smaller paycheck if I go the archives route. I would also probably have to move to a different city in order to find work because archive/library jobs are much harder to find than CS jobs. CS jobs are pretty much everywhere, but I would be limited to places with a decent library/historical concentration if I go with library/archives. Also something I have noticed is that library/archive related internships are generally unpaid, whereas CS internships pay quite decently (like $10+, even $20+ an hour). So, I am not sure what to do. I can always volunteer at museums/historical sites and have a CS job, but jobs take up 40 hours (or more) out of every week, so I worry about not being happy because I am stuck with a job that doesn't excite me. Another thing I worry about is that my lack of experience in either type of career is not allowing me to make an informed decision in this situation. For all I know there may be a CS job I would LOVE to do, or libraries/archives might not as enjoyable as I think they would be.

So, as a person who is averse to risk-taking and has anxiety problems, this dilemma has been eating away at my sanity for the past few months. I am not sure what to do. I feel like I can't just brush it aside as I am almost done with my CS degree and will need to start a real career soon to be able to afford to pay off my loans. I think if I do go with libraries/archives I will probably have to take some CS job and work a few years before I can afford a master's anyways. Any advice?"

I have heard that I would not be considered from a few (mainly ones that I just threw my hat in for fun and didn't expect anything from), but the majority of them, especially Google, I haven't heard anything outside of an automated response email saying that my application was applied. A Google recruiter even came to our campus and I was told that my resume would be handed directly to a recruiter and that was around the beginning of October I believe. So now it is early December and the semester is almost over and I haven't heard anything. I kept making excuses to convince myself it was normal, but now I'm a little worried. Are companies working to fill Spring internships and full time positions, or should I have heard form them, at least a follow up email with further steps in the process. Anyways, I guess I'll start looking at smaller gigs closer to me."

Any advice or tips to get my head straight?",PSEOL,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/3vhtp9/feeling_quite_a_bit_of_imposter_syndrome_since/,"So I graduated in 2014 with a BS in Criminal Justice with a 3.92 GPA and wanted to continue my education since finding any law enforcement type jobs in my area (NYC area) is limited. For the past year I have taken two Java courses, one intro one and one data structures one, a operating systems course, computer architecture course, database course, and now a networking course. I have done well at have a 3.95 GPA with those classes and have been accepted into the Masters of CS program at the same school which is a fairly good tech school. Although I can do well on tests and do a fair job of googling things I don't understand or code I'm not sure how to format, I feel as though I have no way of applying what I've learned meaningfully or showing an employer or internship that I'm capable. I'm also very nervous about starting graduate school in CS because I feel like yeah I have passed the courses handily but I feel like it's only been a little over a year since I started so it feels almost rushed and I'm very nervous going forward. Anyone else experience this or have any advice of what I could possibly do, book to read, YouTube series to watch, anything? I just want to make sure I'm ready for the obviously much harder graduate courses and can show employees or internships I'm a good fit for them. Any advice is helpful thanks :) 

Edit: Also, my biggest area of fear is my programming skills. I currently only know Java and some Python, but have programmed binary search trees for a class which was challenging but I eventually got to work. I know programming is essential to the degree but how can I advance those skills to be better. I'm very interested in networking as I found that class to be the most fun and rewarding if that makes any difference towards my lack of programming confidence."

Due to this presumption, I often had a hard time convincing people that I spent my entire life being homeschooled and that kindergarten was the only public classroom I had ever even stepped foot in.

&amp;nbsp;


I was not only provided with an excellent education, but was also given the opportunity to develop social skills, interacting with a more broad range of age and personality types than I would have in a classroom, and a freedom to explore and learn so much more about life than I ever could have with my nose in a standard textbook for the majority of my day.

&amp;nbsp;


On the days my mom worked as an administrator at our church, I did my studies in her office and then spent the afternoon helping the interns with their assignments or the old man in the mailroom fold bulletins for the upcoming services. The rest of the school week, I'd rush to complete my work so I could spend the day going on adventures through the woods behind our house or in the park a few blocks away.

&amp;nbsp;


I always had a backpack full of books about the places I could only dream of visiting, cities and countries with cultures to experience and sights to see that were so different from my small little town. I knew so much about the world but had never stepped foot past my state’s border, so when our church organized for select members of the youth group to take a trip to Germany, I accepted the offer immediately.

&amp;nbsp;


We flew out the day after Christmas, spent a six hour layover enjoying the incredible architecture of Amsterdam, and then spent the next ten days in and around Berlin and Hamburg, ministering at a few small churches and visiting all the famous landmarks. The sights and sounds, the food, the people, the entire experience was everything I could have dreamed of and more as a girl desperate to see the world. Of course, the exposure brought both wonderful experiences and odd events…

&amp;nbsp;


I distinctly felt an unnatural presence beside me while taking a private tour of Auschwitz, even when I walked alone, and only lost the feeling when we exited the gates. When a few of us tried to take a shortcut through a dark alley on our way to dinner one night, a drunk man approached us to ask if we were prostitutes, and became aggressive and almost violent when we informed him that we were not (this would’ve been a bigger deal had a group of gentlemen who had seen this encounter from the street not come to escort us the rest of our walk).

&amp;nbsp;


More ominously, a little girl practically drowning in her long, dirty-blonde hair and tattered, oversized sweater who sat silently on the bench across from me, slid me a small slip of paper right before she exited the train, which simply contained the words “bedenke, dass du sterben musst”. These experiences and others like them occurred periodically throughout the trip, but none haunted me more than what happened at the youth camp we visited during the last three days of our trip.

&amp;nbsp;


The camp was once a military base of some sort, the old buildings never upgraded, just converted into dorms and meeting places for summer/winter camps and events. The small property was surrounded by a barbed wire covered fence and endless rows of unkempt trees, and was somewhere outside of Parchim. (I only know that was a nearby town because that was the closest train station; we were taken by cars the rest of the way. I’ve tried on many occasions to pinpoint the location on a map to no avail.)

&amp;nbsp;


The boys and girls stayed in separate buildings respectively, with four youth per room, and four adult mentors to chaperon each floor. Our group was provided with our own wing to stay in since we were considered to be guests and had a bit more leeway when it came to curfews and property access. There were two services held each day in the chapel, separated by three community meals in the mess hall. There were other small group workshops and activities held in between those, but they weren’t mandatory.

&amp;nbsp;


We had arrived at the camp late Thursday evening with just enough time to tour the main facilities, meet the staff, and settle into our rooms. The next morning, a handful of us decided to meet an hour before breakfast call and go for a run- stretching our legs on an open path seemed so refreshing after having spent almost 6 hours on a train and in small back seats just to get there. From the mess hall to the property’s main gate was a road that we estimated to be a bit over a mile in one direction.

&amp;nbsp;


We slowly jogged down the road, lit only by the street lamps as the sun hadn’t even thought of rising yet, and admired the white, sparkling layer that covered the roofs and cars from that night’s snowfall. When we reached the gate we found it wide open, and the road continued through the thick tree line into the darkness.

&amp;nbsp;


We foolishly decided to keep going just a little ways further, saying we’d turn around before the gates got out of site and before anyone noticed we were gone. We were at least two or three miles past the gate when we finally stopped jogging and turned around to make our way back.

&amp;nbsp;

We were taking our time walking back when we saw light approaching from behind us, growing rather quickly. As the sound of a revving engine increased in the otherwise quiet atmosphere, we dove into the tree line in hopes of avoiding being seen (or worse, hit) by the oncoming vehicle. We weren’t sure we were supposed to be outside the fence unchaperoned, and didn’t want to risk being caught by a counselor on their way to the camp or have to try to explain to a stranger why four US teenagers were wandering around in the middle of nowhere Germany.

&amp;nbsp;


With my back to a tree, I peeked around and watched as the car sped past. As I faced my friends again to share a laugh and sigh of relief, I quickly realized one of us was missing. My searching eyes darted between the trees, finally finding her walking with determination into the thickening woods. I caught up with her and grabbed her arm to stop her, but she pulled away, putting a finger to her lips to shush my efforts to stop her.

&amp;nbsp;


She was walking toward a small house that I hadn’t noticed before; frankly I’m not sure how she even noticed. The windows and wood of the abandoned abode had darkened from years of dirt and dust. The roof had caved in on one side, and icey leaves covered every flat surface of the structure. The dark tones of the exterior combined with the blanket of natural camouflage made it almost impossible to see in the dense morning fog.

&amp;nbsp;


We followed her cautiously to the front steps and watched nervously as she tiptoed across the front porch to peak in a window. My heart beat was steadily increasing as I watched her make her way to the door, and then instantly sunk when a light came on inside the house in the same second her hand made contact with the door knob.

&amp;nbsp;


“Run!” escaped my friend’s lips in a sort of whispered-shout, followed by the crunch of damp leaves beneath our feet as we took off. We ran in a scattered line through the trees, not even sure we were heading towards the camp, just desperately trying to put space between our backs and the house. I’m not sure how long we had run before I was tripped by a fallen branch, causing me to hit my head on a  root and black out, but when I awoke I was alone and I could see faint rays of the rising sun breaking through the fog and trees.

&amp;nbsp;


I slowly got back on my feet, checking for injuries or potential damage. Unsure of whether they left me to get help or just left me for dead, I stumbled in a circle, trying to decide which direction to go. These woods were so new and intimidating compared to the ones back home, the ones so familiar I knew them like the back of my hand. I was so focused on my fear and confusion that I barely noticed the looming figure watching me from a distance.

&amp;nbsp;


I froze in my tracks and my breath caught in my lungs as my eyes took in the sight before me. He was hard to see through the fog as the light was at his back, but I could tell he was broad and towered over me in height, was dark in color, and seemed more animal than human. The only thing that made me believe he was even human-like at all was his eyes- even in the dim light I could see them, could feel them as they bore into my own.

&amp;nbsp;


Everything was still and silent in that moment. The fog seemed no longer carried or moved by the cold breeze, but instead held itself steady, and the faint scratch of bare branches rustling together had faded away. Terrified of moving, but even more afraid of staying there, I slowly moved my right foot to take a step back. In my shakiness I lost balance, and the sound of a snapping twig emanated from beneath my foot as it met the ground from my shifting weight. I could feel the heat of his breath against my cold skin as he sighed in frustration, and I began to wonder if my depth perception was somehow impacted from my fall.

&amp;nbsp;


“Please…” was all I could manage to whisper, a sad attempt at a request to spare my life. The more I considered his stature, the easier I realized it would be for him to snap me in half no differently than the twig that lay broken beneath my foot. But instead of charging at me and ripping me limb from limb, instead of eating me whole or dragging me to his home somewhere near the gates of hell, he simply lifted his lumbering arm out from his side and extended a long, crooked, pointed-nailed finger, as if to tell me which direction he wanted me to go.

&amp;nbsp;


Not one to argue with an ominously mysterious figure nearly twice my size, I cautiously turned and walked in the direction of his gesture. I continued at a slow pace, never taking my eyes off of him even when he was almost entirely out of sight, until I almost tripped again. I glanced at my feet for just a brief second to ensure I had them both on safe and solid ground, but when I went to return my sights to him again, he was gone.

&amp;nbsp;


I broke into a sprint as fast as my body would carry me. I didn’t stop when breathing became sharp and I felt like there was blood in my lungs. I didn’t stop when I broke through the treeline and my shoes met the wet pavement of the quiet road. I didn’t stop when I saw the open gates or even when I made it through them. I kept running- through the camp, across the yard, up the stairs, and down the hall to my dorm room, nearly breaking the door trying to get through. I searched the small room, pulling up piled blankets and opening closet doors, hoping to find signs of my morning companions.

&amp;nbsp;


I stumbled into the dimly lit bathroom and finally slowed my speed as my eyes fell on the scribbled note taped to the mirror, addressed to me, explaining that they went down to breakfast and to meet them there. As I went to pull it down from it’s post, I realized that the filthy, bruised, tattered girl who looked like she’d climbed out of an old well looking back at me from behind the note was my reflection, and I wasn’t sure whether I was supposed to laugh or cry.

&amp;nbsp;


Too stunned to do either, I stripped from my damp, dirt covered running clothes, took a shower in the warmest water those old pipes could provide, and put on the first outfit I could pull from my suitcase. I made my way down to the mess hall in a daze and finally found the others, seemingly unharmed, and quite frankly happier than I had ever seen them.

&amp;nbsp;


Understanding that they had no problems finding their way back to camp and had no intentions of sending help for me in my unconscious state, I quickly became offended and demanded an explanation, but the only responses I received were looks of complete confusion and concern. I spent the rest of the trip trying to convince them to give up on the joke and to tell me what happened, but they genuinely had no idea what I had experienced, or where I had even been all morning. Their only knowledge was that I was gone when they woke up that morning and they didn’t see me until met them at breakfast.

&amp;nbsp;


That was the first and last time I saw him, and when our plane landed in the states, I vowed to myself to never speak of that day again, and to never go into the woods, any woods, in fear of a similar encounter. As the years went by, the occasional nightmares of the dark figure in the winter fog became nothing but faint memories, and I had started to believe it really was all in my head. I would’ve kept my promise and would’ve never told this story, would’ve never even consciously reminded myself of it, if it weren’t for today.

&amp;nbsp;


It’s been at least seven years since that trip. In those seven years I took over the house for my parents when they retired and moved to a townhouse in the city, did countless renovations (the most important being an extra tall privacy fence with a locking gate, separating our back yard from the woods), and started our own small family here with my husband.

&amp;nbsp;


I put my son to bed tonight, just like any other night, only he fell asleep much quicker tonight, most likely from exhaustion caused by all the excitement of ‘helping’ his dad hang up the Christmas lights. I kissed him goodnight and tiptoed to his window, cherishing the second-floor view of the fresh fallen snow. As I breathed a peaceful sigh and began to close the curtains, my breath caught in my lungs in a way I hoped it never would again.

&amp;nbsp;


Just there beyond the fence, the trees shielding him from the sight of anyone but me, stood the creature I’d convinced myself had never really existed. I really would have missed him, his darkness blending in with the woods around him, had his unmistakable eyes not been there to pierce mine. I believe he saved my life that day, I’ve just never understood why, but today I think he’s here for something different. That long, crooked, pointed-nailed finger that was once my guide to safety is now pointing straight at me…

3vigkm,1,2015-12-05,18 units plus internship?,NippleMustache,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3vigkm/18_units_plus_internship/,"I'm a CS student at a state school (3.5+ GPA) and I just finished my first 16 unit semester (I use to take 12-14 units) with these courses; 

Computer Organization &amp; Architecture (3u, lab), Programming Languages (3u, lab), Automata (3u), Physics (mechanics) (4u, lab), 3 Unit elective

I was offered an internship at 10 hours a week for 12 weeks during Spring, and I have enrolled in 18 units with the following:

Operating Systems (3+1u, lab), Software Eng (2+1u, lab), Probability (3u), Physics (E&amp;M) (4u, lab), Senior Project Prep (1u), Databases (2+1u)

Of these, OS was said to be challenging, Soft Eng easy, and Prob &amp; Stats gave no homework (I would still do it to pass exams, obviously). I'm concerned about E&amp;M, though, since with my past physics class, it was completely foreign to me and the beginning of the semester had a steep learning curve. However, I believe I passed all of my classes this semester with A/B's.

Anyways, can anyone comment on this course load?

Ps. I'm a transfer student, so all I have left to do is rigorous CS/major courses.

3vii55,3,2015-12-05,Summer jobs &amp; internships?,Tattooedwolf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vii55/summer_jobs_internships/,"So I was trying to shift careers from foodservice into CS, but miraculously I landed an AMAZING job in foodservice (San Francisco Bay Area). I intend to keep this job basically forever, but I'm on an academic schedule. I have 2.5 weeks off for Christmas, a week for spring break, and 9 weeks off for summer.

I'd love to continue working on the CS career during the summers. I was thinking something like this might be a reasonable progression:

1. Self study this year and maybe next.
2. Internships for the following two-three years (probably unpaid).
3. A programming boot-camp with a high job placement rate.
4. Finally, figure out some kind of CS summer jobs, like short-term contract work.

Seeing it written out, I'm not even sure it's possible. Would I even be able to find summer internships and summer CS jobs? I need some honest criticism of my plan and recommendations.

**TL;DR: I want to have a CS career during my 9-week summer vacations. Help me plan how to tackle this!**"

However, of the 34 applications for internships I've sent out, only 9 have responded in any way, including sending a canned rejection (I got 6 of those, and 3 offers to interview).  As an example, I applied to Google on October 11th, but still haven't heard anything from them, Microsoft, or Amazon.  I understand that some places don't have the courtesy to reach out to applicants to let them know that they've been rejected, but I didn't think that was common practice with the more established tech companies.

What's normal?  When is all hope of a response gone?  Should I do something to attempt to contact the companies?"
3viury,19,2015-12-05,Advice to incoming grads from a 20-something that fucked up both her college and graduate school time. (It bears repeating),seapancake321,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3viury/advice_to_incoming_grads_from_a_20something_that/,"I posted this to an individual redditor so it's a bit of a jumble...this is my advice to you seniors and current students, though I am basing this off of shitty decisions and hating my sociology degree by the end of it/not knowing what to do with it. This is a mishmash on how to get through college and make it a worthwhile experience of three things--EMPLOYABLE skills/experience (sad truth is that none of the history courses I took--not a single one--could gt me an entry level job, but that Quickbooks or CRM software course marketing majors take would, even when I'm just applying as an assistant or receptionist); actual work experience at a point in your adulthood where you will have access to your office of career services offices, your professors, faculty,and their own projects and need for labor (they might need assistants, teaching or administrative, right on campus!); and a decent GPA/resume based on academic and extracurricular accomplishments. 

On college: 
1) Learn to manage your time.

2) Try to pick a major or take courses with what I'd call universally transferrable skills. I failed to do that by choosing sociology over say, marketing. In marketing I would have learned Excel, Quickbooks, and certain skills that would have made me a fit for entry level work in financial settings and any office I wanted to be in. This is a horrible truth of college. I knew nobody employed and had never really thought about what temping agency postings, indeed, idealist, or craigslist were telling me--the information was all there. Ask yourself--what is a major employer in (place I want to live someday)? Keep that in mind when you select your major.


College is a grace period, the last one. The horrible thing is there are more jobs that expect you to know 25% of how to do the job--baseline skills--because training budgets have been cut, at least in the city where I live and where the only jobs hiring are finance, marketing/or, healthcare software, and startup related stuff (coding, customer service...specifically FOR a start-up). YMMV. 

3) You still want to take some actual fun courses, right? Ask yourself--can you design your own major, as you can in NYU's Gallatin school? Can you get an accounting degree but still count some fun electives towards your major or the liberal arts core? Learn about the school of your college that teaches what you like. If I could go back in time I would have gotten a marketing degree (bearable, more so than finance) but taken many electives in my actual major/the school of public service I had originally been hoping to attend. (My grades were too low and I was too broke.)

4) This is very hard--you must treat college like a long recruitment process. Hit up your career services or HR early and get established on how you will write an entry level resume or if there are part time positions--paid or unpaid--where you can learn something employers in the real world value (even if it's managing a switchboard or customer service...something a lot of start-ups where I am now want). INTERN. Network with your professors and classmates. In the long run, who you know is who will get you a job. 

5) Be careful to read course evaluations because one professor might teach a course (e.g., Research Methods) for your course reasonably, give you lots of quizzes and exams, teach good lectures, and other might be a slave driver. Ratemyprofessor helped me alot. I recommend all of you review your professors (if you can--fuckers changed the site) as well and tell others how a teacher teaches their class/what they expect. 


6) Know how to write a good paper. I would make outlines as a write and read the syllabus the first week of classes so I could plan in advance and chip away at my goals over the long term. I would save passages I know I would come back to later in MS Word (page number and a little quote or two) so I would know exactly where to return to when it was assignment time.

7_ Treat your professors well because you need these people for recommendations. If they have pet projects (one of my adjuncts ran a not-for-profit and liked having his students volunteer with him--would have been a great work/learning experience), look into it.

8) Realize your (better) profs REALLY, REALLY want to pass you, so you don't need to obsess over writing each paper as a magnum opus, but you must turn them in on time so they have a reasonable time to grade, demonstrate basic understanding of the ideas they want you to, and use the write format.
If you get online homework on a site like APLIA...take a look at the supplemental tests or questions, because the professors might base exams off of those. I think that principle holds true across the board.
Look into clubs (political, based on your department/major, based on skills you want to learn like Adobe, etc.) early and often.

9)  Please do not let drinking, alcoholism, shitty sexual practices likely to get you knocked up, or mental illness decide this. If you need to see a psychiatrist off campus, take a smaller dose of a prescribed drug to try it...do it.

 I blew it. When I got better and could function, it didn't matter. It was too late and I had already fucked up my GPA, failed to seek out even the courses that might have been helpful when I looked for jobs (read job postings, PLEASE--if they advertise for specific software, like Excel for business, or Quickbooks, or Adobe CSS...take a workshop, learn to use them when you have the time) for real, and the things that were feeding my depression....were no longer really things I could solve with meds. 

That's the present, actually. My life is a failure; no Zoloft is going to help me. Taking needed ADHD drugs, a small dose of antidepressant, and getting a hold on a relationship with a narcissistic, abusive mother that forced me into a horrible major she did not understand did. For those of you with domineering parents pushing you into majors--don't let them. Explore for yourself. 

I could have made sociology work for me if I'd had more work experience and taken a few of the same courses those marketing and public relations students got to, but it's much harder. I could have seen the writing on the wall, gone into marketing, and taken many of my desired electives (preferable).

It's all about who will employ you; titles of work positions (associate of blah; office manager of blorp; entry level blip); and demonstrated work experiences/people that will vouch for you. you're collecting all of these things on the journey to a happy adulthood like lucky pennies. 

I know college can be horribly lonely, isolating, and exhausting, but it's such a brief window of life and the loneliness you experience is all-consuming but is secondary to the guidance you're there to receive when you move on. If you need to see a psychiatrist, get treated for depression.

You have a portfolio you need to write to get through a class? Ask to a see a sample. You have a big midterm? Ask the format (essay? Multiple choice? Both?), what it covers, and what will be expected of you and then meet the bare minimum of those expectations, because often that's all you can (or will need to). 


Focus on the good choices you can make with this time and get all the help and advice you can get from career services and also find out about what steps the people holding jobs you want to had to take. (Find that person's Linkedin...that marketing manager for a company you love might have started in art history first, but see what point she started working on an actual career.)

On work: 

1) This is the last time in your life it's okay not to know how the fuck to write a resume or get through an interview--seriously, look at your school's office of career services, their calendar, their events. Do they have resume review days? One-on-one counseling sessions so you can start talking to someone--say, by sophomore year, when it matters more that you start interning than interning in a job that uses your history degree to a T--about these things? 

2) INTERN, INTERN, INTERN. You can volunteer in an office and request it be called an internship (it's still unpaid and you're still there to learn software or a function of work, so why not?) Try to get at least two internships--one might even one into school time, so you really need to learn how to budget your time. You can choose something that asks for 15 hours a week or less, do it on campus, do it in summer--but you must do it.

You will. not. get. a. job. without any office or ""work""/volunteer experience in a setting comparable to where you'd like to work for a living and I have learned the shitty way babysitting doesn't count so much. If you've graduated in the last year and didn't intern, it's okay to go back and ask for help finding some (RELEVANT) ""work experience"" just to put on a resume and so you can speak confidentially when an entry level job requires ""communication and public relations"" skills and 1-2 years of working in an office. 

Use your school's office of career services early and often. If this is a good school, they are a vital resource on how to write an entry level resume, assemble a portfolio of work, interview, skills you will need during/after college and for life. Check their calendar--as I noted to someone else, you might go to a community college that still accesses career fairs of better-supplied schools (like--as an example--NYU). 




In my city, sadly, college is now viewed as prep for a job as much as self-discovery. It doesn't have to be ONLY that, but...have it in mind.

I went into college as a chemistry major under the urging of my parents, but I absolutely hated it and ended up struggling with the classes. I found that I liked computer science more and decided to try to pursue that more instead, so in a span of a bit more than a year, I self-studied multiple languages and programs and brought myself up to a proficient enough level to help design a website, obtain an internship at a software company, and act as a volunteer research assistant for a UCLA professor in the cardiology department (using python to reconstruct cell reproduction, etc.). My GRE scores are solid, I think, with a 165 in quant and 162 in verb, writing to be determined. I should have solid rec letters from the professor I'm volunteering for, and my director at the company, as well as one professor from my university. 

I'm not hoping for too much, but I'm at least hoping that I look appealing to rank 20-50 grad school MS programs for computer science. Do I have a shot, or should I aim lower?

Ok so basically, to make things small as possible, the RPi was going to be powered by a normal USB Phone charger (5V 2A), but now I'm going to have it split and power the RPi and the two USBs.


Ok so a line can just go directly to the Pi but then how do I step the 5v @ 2A down to the correct volts and amps needed to power two USBs (Wifi and GSM modules) and have the data inputs and outputs of the two usbs connect to fit into a single USB that be plugged into the single port of the Pi?

3vkxid,5,2015-12-05,I'm depressed because of how little I know and how much better everyone at work is.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vkxid/im_depressed_because_of_how_little_i_know_and_how/,"I'm interning at a company in California. I've had other internships before and one of those internships even became a full job as a developer until I left to intern in California. 

I'm depressed because at work, other people who started out at the same time as me (not as interns, but as contractors for their first job out of school) are learning faster than me. They're committing more code, they know how to fix bugs faster, they're able to make features from scratch more quickly than me.

I'm very eager to work hard, but I'm starting to think that maybe I just don't have the mind for this. I have nearly a perfect GPA for my CS degree but that's just academics. Doesn't translate into real-world development. I have a good resume, but I interned at a lot of places and piggy-backed on the better engineers to help me get my work done wherever I was. For example, SQL - I can write SQL and even use basic joins when I need to. But after many months of working with it at my previous job, I still had to rely on the senior dev for writing stored procs and understanding more complex joins and if I had to write a join or use a cursor or do something involving complex SQL right here and now, I wouldn't be able to do it. I had an interview question for a different company where they asked me to do some weird but not impossible stuff with some columns, and I wasn't able to do it. :(

I have a hard time building stuff from scratch. Maybe it's because I've been working full-time and also doing school full-time? I have a hard time remembering which libraries are available to me and which language constructs are useful. For example, I know what C# properties are because I've been using C# for the last year...but I don't write enough of them to remember their syntax or to use them at the best time. I've read many professional texts on C# and other things but I only remember high-level details. 

I'm just not prepared for the real world. I don't know, it's not imposter syndrome. It's not that, because I'm not GOOD. If I was given a task, I could probably struggle with it on my own (like I have to do now) but it'll take me longer than anyone else. I don't know what's wrong with me, maybe I'm just burned out from doing both work and school full time? Maybe I just need to finish off my last semester and then I'll have more time to build toy programs and learn libraries for my favorite language?

It just seems like things come easier to other people. Or maybe I'm only seeing the surface and not seeing their own struggle and their own insecurities? What should a good software engineer be able to do? I enjoy my work but I want to be EXCELLENT at it. Please help me with tips. Thanks so much."

I already signed an offer for $92,000/yr starting when I graduate, working in the north bay area.

I interned with this company over the summer and the work was okay. Most of the devs were quite old (in their 40s and 50s) but were very nice people. There were only a couple of devs that were under 30. The work wasn't the most interesting (mostly working in Microsoft C++ and C#) but I was able to do it well and the 8 hour days passed by relatively quickly. The company has a very good retention rate and most people who work there stay a very long time since the benefits are good and the work-life balance is good (they have a strict policy against working over 8 hours per day and not getting paid for it. If they find that you need overtime work then they switch you to hourly so you get paid well for your overtime.)

The only thing that I am concerned about is that this company is very old fashioned. I felt like their development standards were quite old. They used SVN and TFS but not Git. Everything revolved around Microsoft's software. A lot of the time I would be programming in very outdated versions of Visual Studio and working in 10+ year old versions of Microsoft Server.

Are these some red flags? Should I try and find a job at a more modern company? It's not like I hated my internship with them or anything. It was a good internship. I just feel like this company is not using modern software development practices. They keep their employees for a very long time (lots of people here have been here over 30 years) but honestly the work is a little bland and very outdated.

Should I try and find a job elsewhere? I don't consider myself a great software developer but I do well in classes, have a decent GPA (3.3/4.0), and have good social skills. I'm not 100% sure about this but I feel like someone like me would be better suited in a more ""modern"" company, if that makes sense. Plus I live in Palo Alto so I am surrounded by lots of tech companies!"

I'm graduating in a few weeks with an electrical engineering degree, but more and more I feel as though I appear unqualified even for entry level software development roles. I have been trying to learn as much as I can about programming and development to prepare me. For example, I've been learning Java and doing a project and CTCI problems. I know that I still have a lot to learn, but I do think that I have enough of a background for an entry level role (I may be completely wrong about this). However, I am not sure if my resume conveys that at all. I was hoping you guys could help spot what is wrong with it, what I can improve upon, etc, since I am not completely confident in it. Especially with the lack of an internship and a CS degree.

3vmdhf,2,2015-12-05,What's going on with my mom (unstable and volatile) and what should I do?,strawb3rry96,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3vmdhf/whats_going_on_with_my_mom_unstable_and_volatile/,"I was homeschooled for 4 years and am now living at home while taking a gap year (am applying to colleges for next year). My mom has always been quickly angered and emotionally unsupportive, but things are getting worse. 

- Mom's political beliefs are increasingly absurd and militant (gays are the devil and try to recruit loners and shy people to their evil club, the socialists are using Obama as their puppet to destroy America, Christianity is under attack

- Mom draws paranoid conclusions (she freaked out that because I met a black friend for lunch once, white guys would see us around town (in a huge city), think I was dating a black guy, and never go near me again; my reputation would be destroyed. Mom also heard my sister baked cupcakes for a friend's birthday and decided my sister was in a cult because she was baking for people.) 

- She gets extremely angry (yells for 20+ minutes, calls me names and makes me feel terrible about myself) over things like leaving clothes hanging over the bathtub instead of my dresser, or leaving a tissue on my desk. Little things like this happen and I get yelled at very least several times each day. 
This is what gets to me the most. I love my mom and could put up with crazy beliefs and rules, but getting this everyday really tears me down. 

- I'm not allowed to go anywhere without asking her first. The only places I'm allowed to go are school, the park, grocery stores, and occasionally a coffee shop. 
I'm not allowed to see anyone without telling her who first, and since she doesn't approve of anyone who's not white, straight, and fairly wealthy, I often lie about who I'm seeing. 

- I'm not allowed to join any exercise groups or classes, but my mom yells at me everyday for being lazy and not exercising enough. My mom wants me to walk several miles a day in the park for exercise and won't allow anything else. This takes lots of time, is boring, and doesn't work any of my muscles so I don't do it everyday. My mom interprets this as rebellion and punishes me. She's also judgmental about my weight and told me I was fat for years even when the pediatrician said I was underweight. 

- For all that my mom seems over-protective, she's unsupportive in the things that really matter. I struggled with a social phobia for years of eating in public (still do), and all the times I've told my mom she either ridiculed me for it, or promised under duress to take me to a psychiatrist then never did. 
I was severely depressed for years also and my mom, despite always worrying about whether my sister and friends are depressed, entirely blew it off. Despite seeing me struggling with fatigue, brain fog, self-esteem, hope, and just about everything else, all my mom did was call me a lazy brat. I never had the courage to tell her I was suicidal, but one time she said something like ""I have enough on my hands with college classes, college apps, and not killing myself"" and she entirely ignored it. 

- My mom doesn't hit me anymore because I learned to deflect it, but my childhood was full of being cursed at, called names, and hit on the head/thrown on the ground/bitten.

And as much as I want it not to matter, my mom never hugs me or tells me she loves me anymore (since I turned like 14).

OK, enough complaining. Here are the relevant details: 

- I'm 18. I don't want to walk away or move out on my own, because I love my parents anyway and don't want to break their hearts, because I don't think I could emotionally sustain that myself, and because honestly I have great financial privilege. Also, like 20% of the time my mom is totally normal and super nice to me.

- I haven't told anyone. I find it hard to because 1)my family is pretty much rich, my parents buy me plenty of clothes/belongings and even stuff like expensive tutoring. I would look like a jerk for complaining. and 2)my mom is super charismatic and friendly to my friends, and I don't think they could really believe that she's different with me. 

- Talking to her about it isn't possible. After a recent huge argument I was crying and crying and she pushed me to say something, so I confessed I felt like she was always angry at me over stupid things and I just wished she would act like a real mother. This enraged her more, and for weeks afterward she made fun of me for ""wanting her to sugar-coat everything"" or ""not call me out on things"", neither of which I ever suggested wanting. 

So, I have somewhere between 2 and 7 months left at home with my mom (depending if she allows me to go to an internship). Does anyone understand what's going on with my mom? What can I do to make things better or at least not take things to heart?"

Me and your friends can then reference each other.

I graduated from college with a computer science degree but I am still unemployed so I am thinking for creating a ""failed start up"" so that I can write down work experience on my resume.

I don't live in USA so there isn't really much software development internships or entry level software development jobs where I live.

Most entry level software development jobs I have seen require at least 1 year of experience.

A start up is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.

If me and a few friends created some simple programs with complex user interfaces to make the programs seem complex and created a website to ""sell"" the programs then I won't really be lying on my resume since the ""failed start up"" is a temporary organization with an online shopping business model.

What do I need to do to make sure my ""failed start up"" looks like a legitimate start up?"

In the end of my 2nd year, after I finish what we brazilians call ""Common Engineering Subjects"", I'll be looking for an internship at a company or university research lab, to improve my resumé, adding some professional experience.

I've been to the US and Canada a few times and even did a language exchange program, living in the US for two months. After these experiences and some research, I decided that living in one of those countries is something I really want in my life.

Due to the recent oil crisis, I am considering pursuing a post-graduate degree right after I finish my course (I'm already saving money for it).

3vp1t9,2,2015-12-06,Keep getting typecast into IT operations because of my experience,squarecompass,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3vp1t9/keep_getting_typecast_into_it_operations_because/,"Four years ago, I graduated with a two-year degree in computer network (CCNA based curriculum) and my Net+.

I worked for two years in a support role with the network admin. I did everything from ""help desk"" to system administration - it was very much a ""jack of all trades"" environment.

I left there to move with my girlfriend, and eventually found myself working tickets at a data center. Mostly hardware fixes, server builds, and basic troubleshooting. The constant 12 hour days were brutal, so I left after a few months.

After assessing my passions, skills and interests, I realized I wanted to make a transition into software development. I've always been fascinated by how computers work, enjoy digging deeper, and want to build things. I like the idea that as a programmer, my skills from work can be transferable to my hobbies and vice versa.

Now I'm 25 years old, going back to university to get a BS in CS. I just recently interviewed for an internship and my technical interviewer started out by asking if I was aiming to be in DevOps - which I'm not.

This isn't the first time I've been pigeon holed into support/ops position interviews because of my experience. I have personal projects I've built at home to try and shift the focus away.

I have tried as much as possible to word my experience section in a way that demonstrates how the position is relevant to development. Yes, I worked in operations. Yes, I know a thing or two about TCP/IP. Yes, I have experience with linux. No, I'm not looking to work in devops because of that.

I've even added an objective section in my resume that states, ""Seeking Software Engineering internship for Summer 2016."" 

The only thing I can think to do is be even more specific and mention ""seeking transition to Software Engineering"" somewhere in my CV.

What else can I do to make it obvious that I want to transition into a strictly development (not devops) role, whether it's now for internships or later for FTE?

My main question is that because I will be doing this research it will get in the way of getting internship experience, so which is preferred by companies? I'm guessing internships are preferred because they are functional job experience, but having the research experience is a rare opportunity which would help me to stand out. I haven't really though about grad school, but if I am going to be doing this it seems it would make sense to get at least my masters from the school I go to now (state university)

 I was hoping to start working after I got my BS and eventually have whatever company I work for pay for me to get my masters at a better school. As of now I have maintained a high GPA (will most likely remain around a 3.97 after the completion of my third semester), which would likely allow me to go to grad school at a very good university. 

Any input from your experience would be helpful, as I really don't have the perspective to make an informed decision about this. I am obviously going to take the research position now and continue with it during the semester and this upcoming summer, but would it be best to eventually continue with it?

TLDR: which would hiring companies prefer, undergraduate research experience or internship experience?

I have a major school project on my resume and an app I have been working on, however to be honest the app is in the learning stages. "

I'm currently a sophomore at MIT and never thought I'd find myself in this position. 

MY first semester of MIT I pledged a fraternity in which we were required to go on an outdoors ""bonding"" trip. During the trip I did something incredibly stupid. Myself and two other pledges took a canoe out on the lake to one of various islands in the lake. On the island we found several houses that seemed to be only used for the summers. Somehow, I made the biggest fucking mistake that will end up costing me my life, and decided to go into the house because another pledge said ""this looks interesting, let's go inside"". We had no malicious intent, no intent to steal anything, literally just to look at this cottage sort of house on an island in a lake because how often does one stumble upon such a thing. However, before going into the house we used the ladder positioned next to the house to go onto the roof to ""get a better view of the island"". As we descended from the roof we jumped onto the bottomost tier and an old style window crashed and broke. We didn't know what the loud noise was but we shrugged it off, and walked inside the house to see the interior. Stupid as fuck, I know. Well right as we walked inside the woman of the husband who owns the house walked in, saw three people she didn't know, was obviously very intimidated and wrote down our names despite us telling her that we weren't there to do anything malicious. Later that night, we had a cop take our ID's and numbers, etc. 

I couldn't believe that within a week at my dream school I had already fucked over my life. Little did I know that I actually ended up killing myself right there, years later.

Through a gruelling process we went back and forth with the owners of the house, all communication existing between my fraternitys national chapter and the owners themselves- they were too sickened to speak with us directly. They came to the conclusion that they wouldn't press charges as long as all three of us would perform 80 hours of community service that involves helping other human beings in a specific way (e.g. homeless shelter works, but sweeping up the city does not qualify) .

I also happened to realize that I'm not smart enough for this school.  With all of the stress of me not being smart enough for the school, and this incident I fell into a pattern of addiction and lying. Aside from several family issues I have, I started lying to my friends and family about classes. I started drinking and smoking heavily, in addition to playing video games to escape life. I failed all of my classes first semester, went through a difficult conversation with my parents after they found out, and the second semester I pulled C-'s in all of the intro classes. In all of this time I accrued 8 hours of working at a homeless shelter, but only 8 because SURPRISE here's another fucking wrench in my life:

During the second semester I was raped by another male. I had been drinking and smoking heavily and woke up to him on top of me fondling me and sticking his tongue down my throat. He was someone I was very close to, but I made it very apparent and clear to him several times beforehand that I was not gay. Afterwards it made it very difficult to venture out of my dorm, and my escapes continued. 

This past summer I expected to do a majority of the hours. but also wanted to take summer classes because I failed my first semester classes and was behind. I took classes at Boston University, and still failed physics 2, while passing multi-variable calculus. I didn;t do any community service because I couldn't find that many options, although I didn't really try that hard. I fucked myself. I can't cope with the difficulties of school, the addictions and escapes I seem to use on a daily basis, as well as the possibility of going to court and MOST SURELY being convicted of a goddamn Felony. 

Here I find myself at the end of second semester, poised to fail two more classes, get a D in physics 2- the class I took over the summer and failed- and a B in a business psychology class that is a complete fucking joke. I have no new hours despite having reached out to organizations who have said that they will take me in on Saturdays to work for a sizeable chunk. This past week I dislocated my shoulder twice that I had surgery on a year ago, got the stomach flu and spent my time all weekend in misery thinking about how it would be better to just kill myself. 

I'm so ashamed with myself that I've spiraled downwards into a state where I can't do anything. I don't do well in classes because I don't spend time on them, instead looking for any opportunity to use as an excuse to do something else. I lie to everyone about what I'm doing, and no one knows my true story. 

I see everyone around me, top students in their field and the world, landing these huge internships, actually learning material in their classes, succeding in their lives and here I am jerking off playing video games poised to be sued and get a felony because I can't fucking get out of this depression and go serve the greater community of Boston.

In a week I take finals, have christmas break, and then return to MIT in January. A week into January I'll end it with some pills and leave a spot open for a transfer student who will actually contribute to the world. "

The only hinderance with this is that I would have to go to a slighty worse Unviersity, like Aston, and get a less reputed degree title (because it was only released this year) ""BSc (Hons) in Digital &amp; Technology Solutions (Software Engineer"". 

Alternatively, I can go the traditional route of a redbrick Uni (Newcastle) and swim in £70k debt straight outta Uni.


I wanted to know, what would you guys do? What are the pros and cons of each and will an apprenticeship hinder my career progression with top firm.

Pros of Apprenticeship (and free Degree):

    No tuition fees (free Digital &amp; Technology Solutions (Software Engineering) BSc degree from Aston or Exeter/QMUL)
    70K+ upon graduation (5yrs pay)
    5yrs Work Experience as a Full Time Software Engineer
    Jump start into competitive careers eg defence
    Get additional qualifcations on top of the degree they give me
    I could probably afford to do a Masters at Oxbridge/London in CS



Pros of University:

    Stronger degree from well reputed university
    Degree completed in less time
    University experience
    3/4 more years of Formal education
    Can go onto doing MSc at Oxbridge
    Diverse networking
    Lead societies, software side projects, internships
    Flexibility of specialising and knowing what I want to do (so many different routes)
    Chance to get a scholarship anyway
    


Would you rather do a CS degree with a year in industry, with an additional internship, extra work experience part time (eg in a start up), 
or
Go the apprenticeship degree route of a free (but worse) degree, 5 years of experience as a Software Engiuneer, but not experience the Uni social life. I do start on 16.5k a year too (and this goes up to about £20k) by 2nd year and progresses to about 30k in the final 5th year.

Fast-forward to one year later... I still seem to be treated as an intern, being asked (but essentially told) to do tasks such as picking up lunch for higher ranking employees or dropping off business mail of the owner. I have voiced my opinions to my managers that I feel I am capable of more, and was told that I would have the opportunity.

Since that discussion, two additional analysts have been hired and seem to have more responsibility than I do! My situation has not changed, and seems to be getting more toxic. Last week, the CFO was angry at me for not knowing that he was moving his office and volunteering to move his things. I was essentially told that I should be jumping to serve his needs in any way possible.

I have at least 8 months of expenses saved- At one point do I cut my losses and quit my job? I've been applying, and would continue for at least eight hours per day if I left my current position. My biggest worry is that potential employers would be scared off by the employment gamp.

Any help or advice is appreciated.

Here is a little background to help you guys understand my situation. Currently, I am finishing my under grad degree in IT. English is not my native language. I moved to america around 5 years ago. I am in my 20s. I do have an accent but most people do understand me. My accent is not that thick. On the other hand, my writing skill is absolutely horrible. I make a lot of grammar errors when I send out emails to end users and I cannot split out a proper paragraph to describe the situation to a coworker or an end user. In the past, I did not spend time to improve my communication skills because I thought that I will be an IT and I would be working with computers. Up until this point, that is my biggest mistake. I spent most of the time messing with computers which is a good thing because my technical skill is pretty good compare to other people my age. I also have experience in the IT field. Through out the years, I went through 4 IT jobs (x2 desktop support, it consultant, and junior sysadmin). Now I am doing an internship and they have offered me a full-time position but my performance in the past weeks probably will change their minds. I was not able to make good communication with end users. At this point, I'm mentally prepared that my internship will end soon and I won't get that full-time offer. That's is ok. This internship allows me to learn more about IT. I will be leaving this internship with tons of experience. Now, I know that communication is essential for every job.




I have been trying to improve my writing skill. I start reading books for children above 12 mainly because it is an easy start for me. I also spent time reading email conversations between other IT coworkers and end users (we use a distribution list to get in touch with users so I am not doing anything that is trespassing people's privacy, I hope). What else can I do to improve my communication skills? Do you guys know anyone in the same situation? I know we sub reddit for everything so which one is a good start for me?

The full-time salary (if I'm lucky enough to convert) is incredible, the perks are great, and the casual dress-code and hours are exactly what I want. 

However, I was also lucky enough to receive an internship from a very selective quantitative hedge fund firm (one of Two Sigma, DE Shaw, Citadel). Let's call this company QHF. QHF is very much a traditional company. Everyone gets to work by 9am, the dress code is business casual, no massive cafeterias, and no crazy perks.  However, the monthly salary was incredible. I go to a top CS university and no one I know has been offered a salary that high. It was significantly higher than even Palantir and Dropbox. I'm not sure what full-time salary is like, but given the internship salary, I can't help think the full-time is as competitive. 

Now, in terms of culture and work, I definitely prefer B4. However, I can't help but think I've missed out on a very unique, and possibly very lucrative, opportunity. Did I make the right choice?

**Background**

* Senior Computer Science student in College [Canada, Quebec]
* 8 Years Experience w/ Adobe Creative Suite
* Hobbyist Unity game dev

**Description**

My final semester, which is this upcoming January, consists of a 3 day per week internship. I have 2 interested parties: one as an IT for a 500 employee company, and the other as a solo web developer for a University Research Team. 

I have a passion for software development, and I see that as being the path I would like to do for the foreseeable future. My concerns lay with where these 2 internships could leave me.

The cons I'm seeing about the large company is that I may corner my future prospects afterwards to IT positions in a company. I keep telling myself why would a software dev take on an employee who has only professionally done IT work beforehand. However, since I do code on the side, my personal projects could fill in that gap possibly?

On the other hand, I don't know how credible employers would see me from having worked for a university research project and not in the industry. I wouldn't be putting some big company on my resume, and I would be self trained to put together the website that is desired. However I would have items to add to my portfolio.

Any advice?

I'm 22 and have only worked at two places: a diner and an IT department of a construction company, my current job. I started working in the department during the summer two years into college as one of the two interns original interns in the department. I graduated with my B.S. in Computer Science and got promoted to staff after two years of interning. This was a couple months ago.


**Department setup**


Now here's the thing. This is what I would call an unorthodox department, or at least it seems like that to me. Everybody just comes up either their own accurate-enough job title and has general duties. No meetings, just casual drop-ins and a bit of rare department email to communicate bigger plans. There's also some wiggle room for getting into something new if you can prove its worth to the department (which is very nice). The department is fairly small for a group of people running IT for about 2,000 users across the country.


**Career thus far**


Us interns spent a decent amount of time ghosting computers for a while, but when the Ghost server mysteriously died and no one knew how to fix it, we resorted to setting them up with all our programs and configurations manually. Each and every one. And there were a lot. The portion of my and my fellow intern's time spent on setting up new computers skyrocketed to about 70-80%. I got tired of doing that and pieced together what OS imaging was and how to get it done over the next few months, then created my own (and very, very patched together) complete imaging system using nothing but a VM, imagex, external HDDs, and a bit of scripting. It was my nice little accomplishment, and I made it well enough so that it got the job done neatly and never crashed. With a bit of updating every now and again, it was our official imaging solution for almost the next year.

During our phase of serious manpower expansion, the department hired a guy who had been an SCCM administrator at his last job. We were pretty quickly able to get my thick image working over the server, and we spent the next few months working on getting modular imaging and company-wide application management running, which eventually came through. We've been holding it to just maintenance status ever since.

Once time freed up from that, I chose to dig deep into GPO since it had just been messed with a bit over the last decade by several people who may or may not have known what they were doing. After a while of slow but steady progress (during which they offered to hire a consultant for a bit to help things along), management approached me with MDM instead, something other people had been eyeing for the last year but could never find the time to follow through with. They knew I had the time now, and it was important for some upcoming projects, so I've spent the last couple months getting our solution setup with a baseline configuration that I can then hand off to the person handling all our company smartphones, tablets, etc. for day-to-day while I administer some elements in the background (somewhere between administrator and tier 2 support, depending).


**The freaking point**


I feel like I've had quite the unorthodox career progression over the last couple years here, and I have no idea if I can even match it to a common path at all. It just feels like things happened too unorderly and too fast. As for income, I currently make close to $48k, and I'm perfectly content with it. I just want a baseline to compare against, higher or lower, whatever gives me a good answer and some sort of standard to work with. On that note, it's also worth mentioning that I work in one of the more largely populated areas of the southern US (not Texas).

Seriously though guys, absolutely any help on this would be fantastic. No one in my family or friends has even worked in an office like I do or IT at all, so I have no idea where I'm at here. More than not being able to quite articulate where I'm at in my career is *not knowing for myself*. I can't stand it.

Thanks guys!



**TL;DR**


**I work in a fairly densely populated area where I created our imaging system from scratch while still an intern, then built up to creating a PROPER one with the help of a new hire. Now I'm setting up our initial MDM stuff. I'm 22 and essentially fresh out of college. Where am I in my career here?**"

Would the exact same resume, but having Facebook instead of Amazon lead to an interview? Or do these rankings really only exist in the minds of students and recent grads?

While Amazon still seems to be seen as having a high hiring bar (though perhaps not as high as the other aforementioned companies?), there's a lot of other tech giants that aren't talked about as being on the same level.

 I just got home from work and I get an e-mail from the president of this company (I live in Windsor Ontario, so it's probably a small-med company). He says he can't use me now at my skill level but is offering a 2-3 month fulltime internship doing self-training or working on some projects to familiarize myself with a LAMP stack at which point they would consider me for full time. They don't have budget for junior, which is why they're offering me this.

  First off, there is no doubt in my mind that web development and programming is going to be my career choice regardless of the ups and downs. Any opportunity to learn like this is a blessing to me. 

 Is this kind of offer usually paid? should I ask about it? is it a red flag if they don't offer me anything? what should I ask and do to find out that they're not going to just use me to complete a few projects and dump me afterwards with no pay/compensation? I'm really new to this in general, only have had 1 legit job and have only heard/read about people being cheated from internships. What questions or things should I look out for to protect myself?

Long story short, I'm a European Software Engineer and I did my final year internship in the US on J-1. At the end of my internship my employer offered me to stay and sponsor me for an H-1B. I stayed, but after one year I started burning out and having some kind of a break down. The reason was mostly because I didn't like the tasks I was assigned, and because I was tired of putting pieces of tape on problems instead of really fixing them. He listened to me, and took me off the project that was burning me out the next week and gave me a 10% pay-raise. He also promised to give me better tasks, and also promised to give me the ability to fix problems instead of working around them.

This was more than 7 or 8 months ago. But after 5 months, I was still working around bugs and not instead of fixing them because of time constraint. I took 1.5 week of vacation but it didn't recharge my batteries, and I only have half a week of paid time off left now...

So, two months ago, I started looking for another job, in Europe, the salaries are about the same than in the US now, and you get full benefits (6 weeks of paid holidays, budget to go to conferences, ...) I found a job, signed my contract last week, and I bought my plane ticket for next month, I just have to tell my boss that I'm leaving now.

The question is how should I go about it? I have a very good relationship with him. He's a very nice and caring person. He cares about his employees' well being, and he takes a lot on himself. Moreover, the last month, while I was looking for a job, the situation improved, I started having tasks I liked, and really fixing things. But, it's too late...

In addition to this, he gave me a lead position on big project of which we're in the middle.

How do I tell him that I'm leaving without sounding rude? I really feel guilty about leaving in the middle of the project, while the situation is improving. I started writing as much stuff as possible down and documenting. I'm also a single point of failure on a lot of things, so I tried to share as much knowledge as possible with my colleagues the last two months. How can I make sure that I'm not considered like a dick once I'm gone?

Thank you,"

I am a sophomore undergrad at a state college. I was lucky enough to snag myself an internship last summer, though it wasn't with any particularly well-known company. This year, I threw everything I had into getting a more prestigious internship. Companies I applied to included the Big 4, as well as the lesser-known but still popular companies that are Epic, Cisco, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Qualcomm.

I failed every single one of them. Half of them I never heard back from (as to be expected, of course). However, two of the Big 4 companies actually gave me interviews. Of those two, I failed the on-campus interview of one, and got to the final round of the other. I gave up my birthday and the entirety of my Fall Break to study CTCI and Glassdoor for the final-round interview, and was extremely disappointed to learn that I had been rejected there as well. It made me feel like a failure, especially considering all that effort I had put into it, coupled by everyone else showing off their cool Jane Street/Uber/Big 4 internships.

Now, before you roll your eyes, this isn't a whine post. Yes, I feel pretty pathetic right now, but that's not why I made this post. I realized that rather than moping around and feeling sorry for myself, I should channel that energy into studying hard and improving my CS skills, now that I know exactly how difficult it is to land an internship.

So I now have two questions. 

I know hackathons are a great way to improve my skills, when they occur. But I was looking for something that I could work on every day. I've heard good things about Hackerrank, and want to try that. I've also heard that spending my time on free projects was an excellent idea, though I'm not sure what ""projects"" I should be making - a game of some sort? So my first question to you all - what's a good ""daily"" way to improve myself, that I can incorporate into my routine? Keep in mind that while I'd like something that would improve me as a coder, I'd prefer something that *also* helped me to snag a nice internship next year.

And secondly, is there any hope for me to grab an internship at a decently-known company *this* coming summer? Like I said, I've applied to Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and all the smaller companies like IBM, Cisco and Epic. Most of these just flat-out ignored me. I understand that spring recruitment does happen, but my understanding was that most of these companies would have finished their recruitment process during the fall (aka done by now).

Thank you for your time.

I have most of my credits dont and after next semsster ill be taking pure CSE courses specialized in gaming and hopefully graduate in a year or two.

Whats the best path i can take to get a job?

I just took my first two programming course this semester, one used python (easier class) and the other was java and intro. Technically we dont need to know GUIs but my professor taught it because he felt like  cs course isnt complete without it, so i have some understanding of it.

So anyways i wont actually learn GUIs until my next fall semester, the one in spring is gonna be mostly about data structures.

I am trying to learn C++. Over my break i bought a gaming textbook using linear algebra to make 3d graphics which i plan to look at over winter break and study. The book uses C++ so i plan to play around and learn C++ over the winter too.

Additionally i plan to make a game if i get good enough at everything, in 2d though.

I eventually would like to make a 3d game or simulation after making a few 2d games.

So....i was wondering if this is possible? If this is easy and what resources do you guys suggest i use to help make this happen besides what i already am using? (Textbook, c++ learner, school...)

So eventually i would like an internship so i can get a job in CSE as soon as im done with college since ill have experience. So i am trying to build a portfolio....

What else should i make? How much programs should i show off? When do you think i will have learned enough to get an internship?"

Hi,

My name is Jake Smit-Marshall (21)

I am a fanatic about rendering and building 3D models designing an creating. I like gaming as well.

So here is my question; 
I want to run programs that are capable making high res renderings (like Lumion 6). I also want my graphics card to be able to do 4K at 80fps for the future when i buy a 4K monitor.

I have searched a lot for what to choose and here are my must haves. 

Graphics: Geforce GTX980TI 
CPU: intel I7-6700K, 4Ghz, 8Mb, S1151
RAM:16GB, 2133Mhz.(still don't know what brand)
Motherboard: MSI Z17A0 Gaming pro
So, i could not decide on my motherboard
and is a 600W source enough?

My definitive question is, is this setup good?
and what changes could i make? Which brand RAM?
Which motherboard? And is 600W power supply enough?

(Budget about 1500 Euros / 1630 dollars / 1100 GBP)
(Building my own case) (only looking for the intern equipment)
(I live in the Netherlands)

Thanks for taking the time to ready my question.

I graduated from top-20 computer science schools in the US (May 2014). I had okayish gpa - 3.54. Unfortunately, I had severe depression during my study, I did not go to lectures a lot and did not study hard. There were even times when I saw my professor for the first time at final exam. But even then, I managed get As and Bs. Did not do any significant side projects. Did not have any internships as well. So, I came to back to my country, worked as developer and 1.5 years later, I want to leave xD.

Fortunately, I think my depression problems are in the past. I feel hungry. I want to learn stuff, build stuff. Never felt that way in the long time. Have some regrets about not being able to use time properly during my study.

However, in my country, cs scene is fucking dead. Low pay, shit jobs. Developers are treated like shit. Economy's going mad as well. Feeling like I get dumber everyday.

I am looking for a job in the US or London, mb Berlin as well. I am not brightest kid around, but with right amout of preparation I think I am ok.

Personally, my top choices are fintech companies like Two - Sigma, Jump trading, Jane Street and etc. But I am not sure whether they even consider internationals.

What companies (besides big-4) are willing to sponsor Visas?
Where should I apply to? ( I have friends that can refer me to Google, Amazon and SIG)
Should I mention in my resume that I need visa sponsorship?
When is the best time to apply?
General tips appreciated as well.

Was pretty cool, I got to research a lot of different things and carved out a quasi-SysAdmin role there.  But it's definitely not industry standard SysAdmin.

* Studying Puppet, Chef, and Ansible in my own time (mostly the learning VMs for now, if anyone has any practice projects they recommond I look at, let me know!)

* Practicing Python and Ruby daily to make sure I don't lose the syntax

I'm currently a sophomore at Berkeley, studying CS. This summer through Berkeley's Huang Program I have the opportunity to study Chinese intensively at Beijing. The following fall/spring semester, I'll have to take fourth-year Chinese (effectively fluent by then). The following summer, I'll get a lot of help to secure an internship in CS, but in China. 

As far as opportunities go, how does this one sound on a resume? I actually don't know, but it seems to me that doing CS internships in America looks better than doing CS internships in China. 

I don't think I'll ever get a shot at the Big Four (I still don't have any personal projects), and I don't have anything lined up this summer or next otherwise. But I'm worried that locking my summer-after-junior-year into a CS internship in China will prevent me from some better CS internships in America down the line. 

If this changes anything: I do have Chinese heritage (but obviously not fluent, growing up in America), female, and have a Vietnamese last name. The Chinese internship will probably be very low or no pay."

Recently I've received a few job offers to pursue computer-science careers that aren't perfect matches for me.

My long-term goal has always been to work as higher management at a tech startup or even own one one day.

The FT offers I've received were:
1) in an IT back office for a large industrial engineering firm that I interned at this summer (I declined)
1) technical consultant at a cloud solutions startup that is expected to IPO/be acquired in a few years (still deciding).

My dream job is to work as a mobile developer at a startup after graduation, however I have only just begun Android mobile development this year (first relatively simple app idea is currently nearing completion). 

Luckily, I have worked at a small startup as an Android development intern, but my experience there was largely UI/UX consulting, testing for usability/functionality suggestions, and some basic web work that ultimately wasn't used. However, my Android developing skills are developing quickly and I feel like I'll soon be able to spin that experience as more of a role involved in development (I can talk about the concepts that were going way over my head during my time there, since I will now have the experience and knowledge to back it up).

Side note: I was let go from the Android development role due to their size and my lack of experience at the time (this was in 2014/early 2015). I haven't included this experience in my resume/linkedin, but plan on adding it now that my Android development skills have gotten stronger.

My question is this- do I have a chance of getting a mobile development position by graduation, or should I be happy with my job offer for the time being? Should I focus on gaining more experience before I try for a more technical role? My soft skills are very strong, and I'm being offered more salary than most CS graduates in my department, but the location isn't in the Bay area (something that is also important to me).

I haven't prepared for technical interviews etc at all, because I was honestly pretty naive about the whole job search for CS students. I stupidly thought that I would be able to easily land a mobile development position. I recently had a technical interview with a financial software firm (data engineering role) and didn't advance because I had no idea how technical interviews were conducted, and what I was being evaluated on. It was a wake-up call to say the least. Should I keep trying with other firms, or should I focus on building skills?

Here are my qualifications:

top 50 liberal arts university in midwest usa (CS major)
3.15 cum gpa
3.25 major gpa

Professional experience:

-ID tech camp CS instructor @ Stanford (summer 2014)

-IT @ large helicopter/industrial production company (erp &amp; infrastructure intern, completed a troubleshooting form submission website project using a proprietary website builder for corporate websites) (summer-fall 2015)

-remotely worked as an 'android developer' at a small startup in menlo park (haven't included on my CV until im confident in my android skills) (summer 2014 - spring 2015)


What are my chances? Sorry, this may be a super long and badly organized post. Will edit when I'm at a computer."

So I am currently a 17 year old in Minnesota, specifically Hennepin county. I was driving from school to my internship when after going down a straight shot of road and then turning right I was stopped by an officer.

I drive another intern so she was in my passenger seat.  The cop approached me from the passenger window and asked why I was going 45 in a 30 mph zone. At this point I was confused, at no point did I feel like I was recklessly driving and I definitely don't believe I was going 45 miles and hour, not to mention there was a hill on the way to the stoplight. Anyways, I responded saying ""I was on my way to work"" she then asked for my licence and insurance which I pulled out and gave to her. Then she returned with a ticket for reckless driving and asked if I had any questions. I said no and went on my way. I felt that I was polite the whole time, I did not argue and I gave her everything she asked for. I would of maybe tried to smile and be a bit more friendly but I was so confused.

I really don't want a reckless driving on my record, I felt that I was in control of the car and that my speed was also due to the incline I was traveling down.

When she asked why I was going so fast and I responded that I was on my way to work.. Did I admit guilt?

This is also my first traffic violation, I want to fight this and I am not sure what steps to take.

This whole thing is stressing me out and I appreciate any help I can get. Thanks."

I had originally transferred from community college with a mathematics associates, and finished Calc I - III, but now that I'm in my first semester of a 4 year university, I decided that I would take 3 math courses in one semester, One being Theory of Combinatorics, and the other Math Theory of probability. I have bombed all quizzes and tests in both of these classes. Just today I got a zero, a fucking zero on my combinatorics quiz. I just can't wrap my head around the type of thinking that is involved in this type of branch of math, in addition with the probability course, I'm starting to understand the material as finals approach, but I know I fucked up the second mid term I just know it. I was hoping I could bang out my math minor within this semester, because If I pass these three classes, then I complete my math minor. I study for hours, just staring at a problem, then I have no clue how to approach, then I have to look at the solution (I KNOW THIS IS NOT GOOD), then I understand the work, but to come to the conclusion on approaching the problem in that certain matter would have never popped into my head. Afterwards I just feel like an idiot for looking at the solution and try to move onto another problem.

I just feel depressed and incompetent and just feel that I'm not going to be a good programmer if I can't even learn these two classes. I'm in classes where I just feel like everyone is a god damn genius and if they knew how to program, they'd be ten times better than me. If I can't even learn combinatorics, how am I going to make fucking efficient algorithms for programs? I really don't want to be a mediocre programmer, but the thought of failing these two classes, just makes it seem that will be the case.

Finals are in a week, and I have another quiz on thursday in combinatorics that will reflect what will be on the final. I don't want to give up, but it's just so fucking hard seeing an awful grade after trying to understand something for hours.

I'm worried that I won't be able to get an internship if I fail these two classes. I had an internship before, but had to go to the four year university, so I had to leave that internship after a year of working there as a programmer.

**Background**

* I am 21 years old. 

* Senior at Vanderbilt University (#15 in the nation)

* First to go to college in my family.

* Born in US. Parents from Mexico.

* As of writing this, I have not applied anywhere. I know, terrible. This is what my winter break will be.

* Majoring in Economics

*  Minoring in Corporate Strategy (things like marketing, accounting, entrepreneurship)

* Minoring in Spanish. 

* I plan to graduate May 2016.

* President and founder of my own organization, focuses on social dance instruction.
* Musically talented- play a few instruments, most notably the button accordion which ties me back to my Mexican heritage.
* Part of Vanderbilt’s team in a national competition for Credit Karma. We did not win :(
* I came in pre-med, got a few D's and F's in science classes so I switched to econ.

**Stats**

* My overall GPA upon graduation will be around 2.6, maybe as high as 2.8 as I have been doing much better in my classes this semester. 

* My econ GPA will be in the 2.1-2.4 range

* My corporate strategy 3.6-3.8

* My Spanish GPA in the 3.5-3.8 range.

I have work experience (about 2 years on and off, 2 summers but this can be fudged because I do some work remotely) with a small company run by a family friend. I was literally the only employee besides the founder and excelled at everything I was asked to do there. I have a glowing recommendation from her and an offer to come back after I graduate. I explain the problem with this later on. I put all her ecommerce stuff in place, the website, design, etc if that helps my case.

I can also get great recommendations from my Corporate Strategy and Spanish professors as these are the areas where I do the best and enjoy the most.

My parents are incredibly supportive and money is not much of an issue. Although we are not rich, our family has not even noticed any significant hit due to Vanderbilt's incredible financial aid. Moving forward, I estimate I have around $60k (not including any money from me actually working) for an MBA, MS, or whatever I can do as long as it furthers my career and isn't frivolous spending.

**Problem: I feel lost and like no noteworthy company could want me straight out of college due to my low GPA.**

Everywhere I look, companies list their required minimum GPA at 3.0 to even be considered as an applicant. 

I don't have any internship under my belt for the same reason; I did the summer job at the tiny company instead.


**But I already have a job offer right?** 

The problem is that the family friend's company is exceedingly small (it's just her and I with seasonally another worker), and she can barely afford to pay me $10 an hour for the short hours I work there. 

* This does not seem like a good choice to me because I do not see it furthering me in a real career. My parents agree. They want me to further my education.

* Most likely I would make around $250 a week if I did this. 

* I would live with my parents rent free. Which is great.

* I would do many small part-time jobs at making about an average of $50 per day. This would be taken care of by my dad, who has many lined up.

* Taking this road, I estimate I could pull off making $30k a year. But this isn’t about the money, it’s about my career.


**So...**

I want to further my education. What does that mean to me? Here are 2 paths I can think of:

* **Become a CPA- I know this sub isn’t about this, so just disregard if it doesn’t contribute to anything**

 * Go home once I graduate.

 * Take online courses while I work at the small company.

 * Pass CPA exam.

* **Get an MBA- this is what I see myself ideally doing, although I am not dead-set on it before I hear as much advice as I can.**

 * Go home once I graduate.

 * Work at the small company for 2ish years. Not sure how ""worthwhile"" or ""legitimate"" this kind of job would look to schools/employers.

 * Study extensively for relevant exams. 

     * Price for preparation, even if it's $20k-$30k, should not a limiting factor in this regard.
     * I understand this may be a very high estimate, but I am willing to invest everything I make into getting into school as are my parents. If a more realistic price is something like $1k, thats great too.

 * Take relevant business school exams.

 * Get into school, earn an MBA.

**My questions:**

* Is getting into a business school still realistic for me?

 * If so, is getting into a top school still realistic for me?

 * If not, what can I do to better my chances? Or is this path over for me?

* Now disregard my ""preferred"" path of an MBA. My friends are getting jobs at companies like Deloitte, Sachs, large banks, etc. I understand those are not realistic for me right after college. From your experience, what can I do to climb back to the level I fell from?

* What other advice do you have for me?

* Can you lay out some realistic paths for me and/or adjust my proposed paths to better reflect reality?

* Longshot- Do you know of any jobs that would take a chance with someone like me? Anywhere in the US is fair game for me as long as it is beneficial to getting me back on the right path. 

**Thank you SO SO much for any input you may have. Let me know if there is any other info I can provide to better aid your insight.**

I took a biopsych course since I loved the courses I took in college, but realized that it didn’t interest me as much. Thinking that maybe I could use my heal policy degree for something, I decided to apply for health policy doctoral programs even though they sounded really boring. I applied to a few programs, but was not accepted into any of the three schools to which I applied – thank God. So the search continued…

I’ve always liked architecture, so I tried that route. I took an architecture course at a local community college and really enjoyed it. I decided to apply for architecture master’s degree programs in the area and re-took the GREs to get a better score, took a drawing class at the same local community college to fulfill the prerequisites of the masters programs, put the required portfolio together for the application, obtained letters of recommendations, and applied. I was accepted to two of the three programs to which I applied. However, I talked with a few architects before informing the Universities of my decision to attend, and decided that the profession was a little different than what I had imagined. I turned down the two offers and decided to keep searching…

Another thing I’ve always loved is food. I gained weight when I started working after college, I learned how to cook and found joy in managing my diet. The wealth of knowledge I’ve gained learning how to maintain my health has been an amazing experience. I get questioned all the time about my eating habits and I truly enjoy talking about what I eat and how I maintain my weight with others. Realizing this, I took a nutrition class at the same community college as before and found my calling. Ever since taking the class, I’ve been trying to figure out how to become a nutritionist. I would love to work with the community and reach individuals who may not have access to a nutritionist.

Ideally, I’d love to quit my job and go to school full time. I don’t have a family right now, but I have about $80k in loans from college (which I’m aggressively paying down) and two dogs – one of whom is sick and requires that I have some sort of income. I’ve done well in my current job. I’ve been promoted several times and was recently recruited by my current boss to come work with him. My current boss is great, but I am drained when I get home leaving very little time for studying. I’m officially on the path to entering one of the two accredited online nutrition programs, and although, my current job pays well, I still cannot afford the cost of the classes in addition to my loan payments ($1,100/mo.) and other living expenses. I therefore cannot take more than one class at a time and it will take years before I am able to complete the classes I need to get into a dietetic internship.

I considered going to Canada for cheaper tuition and taking out more loans to cover additional expenses, but I don’t know if that’s the best idea. Also, foreign nutrition certifications may not transfer back to the US. I’ve finally figured out what I want to do with my life, but I don’t know how to make it a reality. Any suggestions?

I decided to apply for architecture master’s degree programs in the area and re-took the GREs to get a better score, took a drawing class at the same local community college to fulfill the prerequisites of the masters programs, put the required portfolio together for the application, obtained letters of recommendations, and applied. I was accepted to two of the three programs to which I applied. However, I talked with a few architects before informing the Universities of my decision to attend, and decided that the profession was a little different than what I had imagined. I turned down the two offers and decided to keep searching…

Another thing I’ve always loved is food. I gained weight when I started working after college, I learned how to cook and found joy in managing my diet. The wealth of knowledge I’ve gained learning how to maintain my health has been an amazing experience. I get questioned all the time about my eating habits and I truly enjoy talking about what I eat and how I maintain my weight with others. Realizing this, I took a nutrition class at the same community college as before and found my calling. Ever since taking the class, I’ve been trying to figure out how to become a nutritionist. I would love to work with the community and reach individuals who may not have access to a nutritionist.

Ideally, I’d love to quit my job and go to school full time. I don’t have a family right now, but I have about $80k in loans from college (which I’m aggressively paying down) and two dogs – one of whom is sick and requires that I have some sort of income. I’ve done well in my current job. I’ve been promoted several times and was recently recruited by my current boss to come work with him. My current boss is great, but I am drained when I get home leaving very little time for studying. I’m officially on the path to entering one of the two accredited online nutrition programs, and although, my current job pays well, I still cannot afford the cost of the classes in addition to my loan payments ($1,100/mo.) and other living expenses. I therefore cannot take more than one class at a time and it will take years before I am able to complete the classes I need to get into a dietetic internship.

I considered going to Canada for cheaper tuition and taking out more loans to cover additional expenses, but I don’t know if that’s the best idea. Also, foreign nutrition certifications may not transfer back to the US. I’ve finally figured out what I want to do with my life, but I don’t know how to make it a reality. Any suggestions?

Thanks. "

I scored &gt;2300 on the SAT, but my 2.8 GPA and lack of meaningful extracurriculars did me in. 

The last few months have been different. I'm currently finishing up my first semester in Computer Science at a decent (but not relatively renowned) regional school in the Northeast, and, provided I do decently on my finals, on track to receive at least a 3.8 GPA for the semester, if not higher. I'm hoping I can keep this up for the spring semester. I'm also applying for summer internships at the moment, and hopefully I should be able to secure one in my field.

My question is: will this be enough? I'm afraid that the more prestigious schools will take one look at my high school GPA and throw my application into the fire, without even considering all the hard work I've been putting in since August. 

Realistically, where can I look as to top-tier universities for CS that will give my application at least a fighting chance?"

Not only that, but because I am currently living with my family, they would most likely be affected in more than one way. 

Are internships a necessity for securing a job in back-end web dev after graduating?

3w13ls,1,2015-12-08,How to Get Interviews?,dzdizzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w13ls/how_to_get_interviews/,"Hello Reddit!

Here's my situation. I'd like to get an internship with a decently sized company this summer.

I went to my school's career fair and met with the Big 4, gave the recruiters my resumes, chatted and whatnot. I was told to apply online, but most of them did end up taking my resume as well (to ""put in the applicant pile"").

I ended up getting interviews from two of the big four. Though I sadly didn't get an offer from either (need some improvement there, I guess :) ), I'm encouraged by the fact that they even decided to interview me at all after looking at my resume.

Now, I also talked to some of the larger companies at the career fair that weren't Big 4, but still well known. Intel, IBM, Oracle, and the like. These companies all asked me to apply online, which I promptly did. That was back in September, and I really haven't heard back from most of them. Logging into IBM, for example, I can see that all of my applications are ""pending"". The same with HP, Motorola, and everything else. I've maybe gotten one or two rejections out of the dozens of companies I've applied online to, but I seem to be stuck in application limbo for the rest.

Here's the thing - I know that it's quite common for applications to be ignored in the CS field. Last year, I might've just chalked it up to none of them wanting me as an intern and me not being good enough. But this year, that theory just doesn't seem to make as much sense. Companies from the Big 4, known to be highly competitive for CS, are giving me interviews, and even spending thousands on airplane tickets for my on-sites, and yet I don't receive so much as an email from literally anyone else? I feel more like I'm stuck in application limbo from my online apps than I am being purposely ignored.

Is it possible that the Big 4 will give me interviews, while I get ignored by pretty much every other large company out there (Epic, IBM, VMware, Motorola, Lockheed Martin, etc...)? Was it because the recruiters for the Big 4 companies actually took my resume, while all the others told me to apply online? How can I get myself ""unstuck"" from limbo?

I'm not trying to humblebrag or anything, but I'm fairly confident that if I can get to the final round of Big 4 interviews, I should be able to secure an offer from a large company that has a lower hiring bar. It just feels like I'm not getting noticed by them, which is really confusing for me.

Any tips to get out of this hole? "
3w13mw,2,2015-12-08,My Success Story - Recent Civil Engineer Grad Changing Jobs,iwantashinyarcanine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3w13mw/my_success_story_recent_civil_engineer_grad/,"TLDR: 1. Network, Network, Network. 
2. If you already have a job, you can be picky when you are trying to switch - believe me. 

I wanted to share my story about changing jobs a year and a half after graduation. I really felt I needed to share because this sub helped through my frustrations and my triumph.

Background:

I graduated with a Civil Engineering Degree from a program in British Columbia in May 2014. The December before I graduated my friend working for a heavy civil construction company gave me a call saying they wanted a recent civil engineering grad. Sent in my resume on the Thursday, interview Saturday, job offer Monday. I was happy as hell because I had a job lined up as soon as I graduated plus they offered me much more than I was expecting as a starting salary.

When I started working, I immediately was shipped out of town onto a project where I worked a 12 and 2 rotation, working around 13 hour days. The money was amazing, but the work was mindless, the crew was enjoyed belittling me, and ultimately, the owners of the company enjoyed tearing me a new one any chance they could get. Really, I was lied to about my role and felt that the long term career projection was not taking me anywhere. So i decided to switch.

The Search:
About Mid-August 2015, I had an exceptionally bad day at work. Bad enough that when I got back to my rental suite that evening, I dug up my resume and started polishing it up and began my search. That evening, I decided that I would only apply for jobs that I truly felt was a good fit for me. Having a job that at least made ends meet while getting me a decent skill set allowed me to be exceptionally choosey about jobs I applied for. Most jobs that i pursued were what I honestly thought would be a good fit for me. Being honest about where I wanted me career to go and where I saw myself in 1-5 years allowed me to hone in on companies and roles. 

I used APEGBC (engineering regulatory body) for a good job listing data base to give me an idea of jobs coming out. I cant speak for other fields, but if there is a regulatory body or an association that companies have to sign up for can give you a good list of companies in the field that you are interested in.

My Statistics:
Job Applications: 6
Job Interview: 2
Job Offer: 1

Like I said, extremely picky. That averages a little under two applications each month when I was actively looking. Essentially, I had to sift through jobs that I knew were not a good fit for me and find the ones that I felt I was a strong candidate.

The Networking:
A lot of people are going to sigh when I say this, but both companies where I received an interviews were from someone in my network who was willing to refer me for the position. One I met through volunteering during school (something I highly recommend) and one was a classmate from my program. Going even farther back, I received my first job after graduation through a referral through a friend (used to play football with him) and my summer internships I got through a referral through my uncle (both of which were at professional firms directly related to my degree).

Point is: everybody has a network. You just have to dig through it sometimes to find the connections. 

The Interviews:
I don't have too much magic in regards to my interviews. Make sure you come in dressed to impress, confident, knowledgeable about the position etc etc. One thing I felt really helps is being able to have a good concise summary of your employment history. Both interviews asked me to give them a play by play of my two previous professional jobs and it was something at the first interview that I felt I did poorly.

I am not an expert but that was just my experience and a couple of tips to help contribute to the community that helped me so much. Feel free to pm me or comment if you have questions and I can try and answer them!

3w16mg,1,2015-12-08,TIFU by tearing a ligament in my ankle for the third time this year all while being drunk.,I_think_im_clever,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3w16mg/tifu_by_tearing_a_ligament_in_my_ankle_for_the/,"So for starts I'm 22 which isn't good to have this many problems so young so don't be a dumb ass like me. Anyways this happened over a course of the past 7 months but the 3rd time just happened on Sunday. It all started when I was studying abroad in Finland. We frequently went out and had some pretty crazy nights. Fast forward to April when I tore my ligaments in my left ankle by running home from the bars with my friend absolutely smashed at 5am. We were walking at first but I felt like shit and my friend told me to see if I could throw up. So, that I did and hurled quite a bit alcohol into the sea. I felt great after that and decided it was time to run! We were making our way home when I started running off course a bit and running along walls and what not. That's when I decided it was time to try and do a 360 off of a 2 foot retaining wall... It didn't go as plan and I laid there reenacting [Peter Griffin after he hurt his knee running.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TEZQ2rg-Rlg) My friend wanted to hit the sack so he told me to hurry the hell up just thinking I was kidding. I tried to stand up and instantly fell over. Now this part's kinda funny; my friend is a medical intern at the hospital and I tell him to call and ambulance and for some damn reason he has no idea what the number was so we had to Google and try and explain where we were. They said they would send and ambulance right over which felt like an forever. We saw the ambulance driving around but it wouldn't come near us and then we got a phone call saying they couldn't find us. I went to the hospital and proceed to get xrays and was sent home the next morning with crutches and brace. It ended up being a level 3 tear which is considered the worse. That being said IDK if it was lost in the language barrier or what but I wasn't really told to come back and get PT or anything on those lines. So I kinda just laid in bed until it didn't hurt and started trying to keep up with everyone else. Once I got home to the US and back to school I went out with some friends to catch up and have a welcome home back weekend sort of thing. We drank quite a bit before heading downtown and then ended up parking on the 4th floor of the parking ramp. A couple of my friends started running down the ramp so obviously I joined (Don't make some smart ass remark about if your friends jumped off a bridge would you?). Now that's when I once again decided to try and jump up and hit one of the exit signs with my hand because ya know I got those mad hops. And once again it didn't quite go as planned... I instantly knew what I did and asked my friend who drove us downtown to drive me to the hospital as he was the only sober one. Show up to the hospital, wait quite sometime and get the whole shindig again xrays and all on my right ankle and it ended up being a level 2 tear. I get a boot and crutches and make sure to take care of it this time. set up an appointment with my Orthopedics office and get the proper care and also take this opportunity to talk about my ankle from Finland. My doc runs me through some tests and tells me I did some pretty permanent damage to it, but doesn't need any surgery unless it starts to hurt. Now fast forward to this weekend it was my good friends birthday and I hadn't drank since last time I messed up my left ankle so I decided it was about time considering I was finally in a small brace and out of my boot. My two roommates and I just recently had gotten new beds so we had 3 twin sized mattress in our closet and people tended to jump on them when they were drunk (They honestly were bouncy than a trampoline). Once again people decided to start jumping on them like always I knew not to jump but I decided to stand on it and just kind of bounce with everyone's jumps and my friends accidentally jumped into me and I slipped off the 3 bed thick closet trampoline onto my left ankle (the Finland one) and instantly twisted it severely I knew once again instantly that I re-tore it. I went to my room grabbed my old boot from my left ankle and put it on and went to bed. I can only assume it was this week because It didn't properly heal in the first place. So I woke up the next day and drove my self to the hospital again and I meet with my Ortho doc on Friday to get it evaluated. So ya don't be a dumb ass like me but enjoy being young just understand the consequences. I have so many plans and things to look forward too, but now I have to wait until I get better. I'm an extremely ambitious person and I'm always pushing myself to the limits. I know a bunch of you will call me a dumb ass and what not, but to be honest I enjoyed every moment up to those points and don't regret any of those nights. I have to live with it and I don't fear anything but fear itself. I have a trip planned to Chile this winter break and I'm hiking the W in Patagonia, I'm not going to let any of this stop me from pursuing my dreams!

TL;DR: Fucked up and tore the ligaments in my ankles 3 different times within a year all because I was drunk.

Anyone here know anything about it?,kondor35,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/3w1bm8/industrial_andor_systems_engineering_anyone_here/,"Hello. I am a high school senior about to enter college at SJSU for Industrial and Systems Engineering.

A month ago, I was set on changing my major to Comp Sci. or Software Engineering because I have an interest in software and computers, but mostly because of it's great job placement and salary. But as I did more research on ISE, I thought that I might like this major and profession. Being that your a professional in this field, do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

1. What is the job search like? If I attend SJSU, which is a pretty reputable University in Silicon Valley, and get good grades, is it pretty simple to land internships and jobs after college? How saturated is the job market for ISE? I read that a lot of ISE's are unemployed somewhere :P.

2. Do you love your job? Is it fun?

3. If you don't mind me asking, what should I expect for the starting salary and my mid-career salary? Money is not everything to me, but it is pretty important. 

4. What are some skills I should learn or something I should do while in college to help my chances of succeeding at landing a job and doing well? I understand that this is a very broad field

5. I heard that it is very possible to become a Project Manager with ISE. What must I do to increase my chances to becoming a manager? I've always liked being in charge and being the one who makes sure stuff gets done, I think I have a natural talent for it.

Thank you :). I really appreciate it."

Throwaway time. I live in a third world country, and I've been passionately programming ever since I was a kid. I got multiple freelance gigs over the years, and have even been accepted into the Google Summer of Code program.

I just recently received an offer for a job in Europe. As you can imagine this is an incredibly big opportunity for me (coming from a third world dev). I came to them asking for an internship, but they think I'm a good fit they're willing to bring me in full time (as they'll be taking care of visa and all that stuff, so it's a pretty big commitment on their part).

I'm now seriously considering taking it up. I love College, but I think this opportunity is too good to pass up. I'm literally living paycheck to paycheck (or gig to gig) right now, as I'm self supporting, while also helping my family as my dad is a stroke victim.

I'm 19 by the way. What do you guys think? I know that this incredibly subjective, but I just want to have your guys opinion on it.

Eventually I want to work on the big companies, somewhere like Google. Maybe I should stay in college, learn theoretical stuff, and try my best to get an internship there, but then again I could learn the theoretical stuff on my own free time as well.

EDIT: I've heard that US H1B visa is not given to people without degrees. Is there no possibility for me for example to work at Google HQ just because I don't have a degree? Well anyway, if ever I get a job, I won't give up and will look into part time colleges, but that might be tough for a bachelors. I already have one year and a semester done in my home country but I'm not sure if the credits would transfer."

I am in my second semester of grad school, getting my MS in Operations Research, concentrating in data science/analytics. 

So this company actually contacted me about their internship via my resume on either LinkedIn, Indeed, or my school's career site; I did not apply or contact them initially. Their glassdoor review seems a little questionable as of recently due to a lot of rough reviews this past month about their management team (it's a very fast growing 2 year old startup), and I was additionally little skeptical considering they contacted me...but I thought it wouldn't hurt to do a phone interview at least. A few questions for you guys:

What is a ""good"" offer or compensation for a summer internship? This company in particular seems to pay its data scientists ~90k. Also, they said they don't have any positions open at the moment, should I care about that? They are local (research triangle), so that is nice.

Did any of you all get internship/job offers from places you never contacted or applied to?

I have yet to have the chance to really apply to anything else, and have never been offered an internship so I don't know the procedures...should I scoop it up if they say end up wanting me, or try my luck at some other places first? Do places often give you some time to decide? 

Also, any tips regarding interviews with this field specifically in mind would be great. I generally am pretty confident and comfortable in interviews, but all tips are appreciated! 

Thanks!!!

We have had multiple confrontations. I've tried talking to them one on one, with a coworker present, and with our boss. She'll change for a few weeks then go back to her old behavior. She constantly points out and makes a huge deal about any mistakes I make, micromanages me, and is very passive aggressive. Once to my face she asked me ""No offense, but how do you manage to work solo shifts?"" 

I know she's dealing with depression, but I have depression myself. She constantly undermines me and makes me feel useless and terrible at my job, even though no one has a problem with me and everyone (including our boss) says it's her not me. She was supposed to be let go in may after she made me leave work in tears but it never happened. :( this left me distrustful of my boss so I haven't spoken to him since before that incident in April and I've just been putting up with her behavior because I really need the money for this job to pay down student debt and I get tuition discount for working here. So if I took another job I know I'd have to take a pay cut, plus pay more for school (I'm trying to change careers and get a programming degree. I have a business/hr bachelors). 

Anyway. Today I got in a fight with her in front of the whole office-the first time since may when she had me in tears. I just want to quit so badly. It sucks to have everyone say they're on my side but not help stand up to her or move me to a different position away from her or anything to actually fix the situation. Should I go talk to our boss and tell him this is the last straw? Should I just find another job and then quit? Should i finish my first year or school (not til may) and try to land an internship in my new career? I'm assuming he won't bother talking to me since he never spoke to me after the other incident either. I can't deal with her anymore and we have to sit right next to each other and work together so ignoring her is not an option. "

In a few weeks I'll be starting my graduation internship for 6 months, as a Research Software Engineer Intern.
It's my first internship, I'm very motivated to learn new things and I'm wondering how can I get 100% of benefits from this inernship.

Since I have to provide a report for the school at the end, so let's start with that : 

1. Try to keep a daily notes, I'm thinking about Google Docs it seem to be pretty good and it's online (maybe evernote too) ! 
these notes will be personal notes, to help me write my final report. 
But I don't really know the best way to do it, what should I keep track of ? everything I learned ? everything useful ?

2. Networking, looking for a job :
I'm kind of introverted person, the kind that have a one job to do, do it properly and go home.
Should I start also looking for a job somewhere else while doing my internship ?


Thank you all for your help !

It was definitely not a firing, they liked me and offered to give me references, but I don't want them saying that I got let go for lack of experience because that obviously looks bad.

The problem is that the other company I interviewed at last week, doesn't know I got laid off. I told them the internship would last until January, because that was what I was promised.
I do not want to lie and get caught in a lie, but obviously if they want to hire me they will ask for a start date and I will have to tell them that I am no longer employed there. 

I could say ""My internship ended earlier than I expected because there was a communication error as to how long I was promised to be able to work there"".

Or I could say"" The internship ended a little earlier than expected"" and if they prod I could say ""they went with someone with more experience"".

Also, is it ok to give my previous bosses as references even though they may say I got laid off because they went with someone with more experience? I asked them when they laid me off if it was performance related or I did something wrong and they insisted it wasn't, but I don't know if that was the truth and I don't want them saying bad things about me.

I've been in a PhD for 6 years now and am heavily leaning towards quitting. I'd like to discuss this with as many people as possible before I go through with it, so thanks for any input!


I've passed into candidacy, but have only 1 (well-respected) conference paper in publication. I have 2 other technical conference papers but they're not well-respected. I have a second authorship on a journal paper. 


Based on my oral exam, my committee would like me to have 2 journal papers accepted before being able to write up and defend my thesis. The first of two papers is an extension of the well-respected conference paper so some of the work is done.. however, I just found out the results from the conference paper didn't generalize as well as I hoped and the results aren't great. 


I'm tired of grad school.. it's negatively affecting my relationships, and my mental and physical health. I feel really stifled, like I'm trapped. I'm tired of working in solitude. I don't enjoy the work, and plan on going into industry in a slightly different area of work, post-grad. I have two job offers lined up (yay!) in that area (I got them after doing internships and part-time contract work). I'm not sure how much longer it would take for me to finish, my guess is in the range of 10-20 months. 


It's not clear to me that finishing a PhD will provide added benefit, as I think work experience is much more highly valued for the direction I'm headed (I'll be doing applied machine learning work). Financially, in the short term, continuing grad school is a terrible decision. In the long term, I'm not sure if finishing would provide added financial benefit. Would having a PhD open doors to more interesting jobs? Potentially... but I have some years of research experience... Also, I'm leaning more towards a position with more of a engineering role as opposed to research. 


Thanks for listening to my mind barf :) and thank you for any input!!!

Things are going really well for me, or at least it looks that way.  I'm set to graduate next year with not only my BS in Finance, but also an MBA.  I'll have some debt, $20,000 I think, but it's all government loans, not private, and I don't feel too overwhelmed by that.  I'm ridiculously frugal as it is.

My issue is getting through the next year and a half of school.  I hate it here.  I go to a small, Christian university near my hometown that isn't very academically challenging.  I have a GPA of 3.96 without studying because this school is so easy.  It boggles my mind, how little we're learning.  I'm really, really bored with my classes.

I've been considering studying abroad for a semester.  I have a German minor; the only thing I need for the major is a study abroad.  Still, it would be expensive, and it would away from time worked at my internship (see below).

Moreover, I have little ambition for my field of study.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I became a business major.  Specifically, I'm a Finance major.

I have an internship.  I really love the company--the culture is very positive and friendly, and my supervisor has expanded and adjusted my role to help me grow and integrate myself within the company.  They've told me several times that they'd like to hire me after graduation.  I like the company, and I don't think I'll find anywhere as positive and rewarding as there.  That being said, I'm not too fond of cubicle life.  I'm sure lots of people feel this way, but seriously, working in an office is slowly killing me.  

Nothing in my life seems really...real.  Everything I see seems to be through a sheet of something, not really there.  It's weird, but I have a lot of friends who I know care about me, but I feel really alone.  I know I shouldn't--they remind me that they care about me, and would be there to talk if I need them--but I still do anyways.  It seems I've duped them all into believing I'm worth knowing.

I guess I just really feel aimless.  I want to just drop out of school or something.  I don't feel like I'm learning anything, or doing anything worthwhile, nor do I believe I'm on the track to doing so.

I feel so lost--so disconnected--so detached from everything.  I would appreciate any advice you have for me."

However, I have gotten offers titled ""Product Intern"" and ""App Analytics Intern"", which does give me exposure to the nature of the tech world and I do get to code some. 

Am I better off taking classes at my local university this summer or taking one of these internships, even if they aren't exactly software engineering?"
3w64y0,2,2015-12-09,"Had a Big 4 internship, not getting any New Grad interviews",newgraddev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w64y0/had_a_big_4_internship_not_getting_any_new_grad/,"Hi, I don't really know what to do and I feel like this is more of a rant than asking a question, but I guess I need help figuring out my issue.  Last summer I was lucky enough to get an internship at a big 4 company.  I was not lucky enough to receive a return offer.  I was upset about this, but it was OK, I was sure I would find another opportunity soon.

Now I got to go to Grace Hopper in October and got a lot of interviews there.  Unfortunately, only one offered me a job and I turned it down.  Everytime I asked for feedback, all my recruiters told me my interviewers only had positive things to say about me.  Some said I lacked technical skill.  OK I get that.  Others didn't say anything else.  In those cases, I assumed I simply was not competitive enough (these companies were like Airbnb).  How do you compete with top 10 school grads?  To be honest, I feel like a very mediocre programmer.  I got As in my programming classes and I know how to code, but there's no way I could beat a top 10 grad.  How do people get out of feeling this way?

Also, I've literally gotten all my interviews from Grace Hopper.  I've cold-applied to about 30 companies and only 1 of them responded to me.  These companies I've been applying to are mostly companies like Groupon and Hulu to smaller startups like FiveStars and Dot&amp;Bo.  To be honest, I was under the assumption that companies would love to give me at least an interview with a big 4 on my resume.  Now I realize that it's not true at all.  So I guess with this I'm asking what other companies should I be applying to and if someone could take a look at my resume?  Also, I know I don't have to exclusively apply to New Grad roles, but how do I convince a company who has a general listing to give me, a new grad, an interview?

One last thing...some of my interviews have non-standard technical questions.  For the most part I almost always expect a general coding question, and although I haven't done well on all of them, I know I can practice this and get better.  However, some questions get web specific.  For example, ""what is RESTful?"", ""what happens when you type in a URL?"".  I guess this isn't that unexpected as I list some web projects on my resume.  I mean yes, I do build these web projects, but I guess I don't know the full extent of what I'm doing.  And it also sucks because these are simply ""spit back what you know"" questions that I'm just not prepared for.  How can I better prepare myself for another interview like this?  I just feel like there's just so much to learn and I don't know how to prepare or where to start.  Is it fair to be asking new grads these types of questions?  Should I expect a lot of companies to do this?

So, sorry for the long post, but I need general advice on how to really get an offer and how to seem like an ideal candidate to hire.  I've been feeling a lot of mediocrity lately and I want to know how to get out of that.

**Edit:** changed ""startup"" to just ""companies"".  Startup was definitely poor word choice.

**Edit2:** I don't know if anyone else will be looking at this, but I wanted to say thanks to everyone that commented!  I know I've wasted a lot of my opportunities and that anyone would be happy to be where I am, but I think I just need to keep pushing through and working on my technical skills. There's still plenty of opportunity out there! I always knew referrals would help in getting interviews, but I guess I didn't know how much they really meant.  I was lucky enough last year to have one of my only technical interviews with a Big 4 through cold-applying, so I didn't think it would be hard to go through this again.

I also wanted to mention that a lot of my peers and family have been expecting me to get some amazing job offer (especially after interning at a big company) and I think that's been slowly getting to me.  I'm even too embarrassed to tell my mom that I didn't get a return offer.  And after failing interview after interview, it's starting to make me feel like I'm letting people and myself down and that getting that internship was a fluke.  I'm just so eager to get a job so that I wouldn't have to feel this way.  But, I think that how some of you said that a great internship doesn't promise a great job has grounded me a bit.  I always knew that, but I was surrounded by people who expected that from me which messed with me.

Also, I think it's pretty funny that people assume that I'm male even after I mention Grace Hopper :P

**Edit3:**  Again, I just wanted to emphasize that this is about *not getting interviews through conventional ways* (cold-applying).  Hence why the title says ""not getting any new grad interviews"" as opposed to ""not getting any new grad offers"".  I get that I don't just get offers because I just so happened to intern at a good company.  But I think a lot of people have helped me realize that it's not necessarily my application, but it's more of the process, so that's, in some ways, really reassuring to hear."

As a mathematician, these more theory heavy fields are incredibly alluring to me.

Sure I've taken OpenGL graphics, VR, and AI in undergrad, but I don't know if that will be enough to get me a position out of undergrad. I suppose my fear is that I'll end up cornered into the same web dev. stuff I've been doing and dreading for the last two years of my internship.

Let me start off with some background info. I just turned 25 this month, and I'm 62 credits deep with a 3.4 GPA at the best CS/engineering school in the state. When I was 21 I was arrested while sleeping in my car for a DUI(misdemeanor) and possession of a controlled substance without a prescription(felony). The felony I'd adjudication withheld, meaning I wasn't actually convicted, and I still have all my rights. However, I'm still obligated to check the box. Also, no, I'm not eligible for expungement or a sealed record since both charges occurred in one arrest. 


        Now, the older I get, the more I'm wondering if I'm wasting my time. It's pretty depressing, actually. I've been pretty depressed about it all year. I've been busting my ass taking all math, programming, and science electives, and in the back of my mind lingers the constant worry that I'm fucked for life. I spent my late teens and early twenties heavily addicted to pain killers and xanax, and quit cold turkey almost 4 years ago after the arrest. Despite all of the progress I've made, I can't help but feel like I've been dealt a life sentence. 


        I haven't had a job in two years because of my charges. I've actually been playing poker professionally in that time span, alongside school. On top of classes, it's incredibly stressful, and I'm constantly stressed and depressed/irritable. Working part time 30 hrs a week at some place for $8-$10 an hour is a complete waste of time at my age while trying to be independent. 


        My worst fear is that after I complete my B.S., I won't be able to find a job, and I'll be trapped grinding poker. 


        I'm getting to the point where I have to start worrying about landing an internship. My chances seem pretty slim, having to list the felony and the d.u.i. on applications, with a barren resume as well. 


        If I can't find an internship, I'll have to invest all of my free time working on top notch projects. Thing is, I don't have any free time, between poker and classes. I might have to quit playing poker completely just so I'll have the time, and take out max loans so I can focus on projects till graduation. I'm just so stressed and depressed, I can't remember the last time I genuinely felt happy or at peace. I love CS and programming, it's just my daunting future that worries me. Most nights I can't even sleep thinking about it. 



       Sorry for rambling on, and the wall of text. I feel like Im screwed for life. Any advice would be appreciated. "

3w8gxl,7,2015-12-10,Full-time vs. intern to full-time offer,toughdecision1729,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w8gxl/fulltime_vs_intern_to_fulltime_offer/,"Getting straight to it, I have two offers on the table right now. Let's call them Company A and B. 

Company A is a solid, well known company with thousands of employees. But not really well known for software engineers. They are offering me a full-time position with a solid starting salary. I like the area its in, I like the company, I just am unsure if the work is truly what I want in the long run and can already see myself applying elsewhere in about 2 years. 

Company B is a smaller company, about 200 employees. I wanted to work here because there work is directly focused on an area of programming that has been my hobby for the past couple years in my free time, and this job would let me turn it into a full time career. They got the whole startup feel but with more job security, the location is again good, and the people are great. They offered me an internship which, upon performance, would turn into a full-time position offer. 

Now if Company B had offered me a full time position, I almost certainly would've taken it immediately. But now I would have to pack up and move to an expensive city on an interns salary ($24/hr) where half goes to rent and half goes to my food/bills for 3 months in the hopes that I get a full time offer and am not left jobless and have to move back home. 

Company A is obviously offering me a solid and stable gig, but I feel like I'll want to move on fast to a new company that will challenge me more as a software engineer. 

With about a week left to decide I am totally lost on the decision I want to make. Does anyone else have any prior experience or insight into a situation like this? I'm unfortunately at a total loss of what to choose..."

Never worked a single hour but I also feel like a total stranger in this country. I don't have any qualification in Cs yet but I've been studying and I'm ready take up a job as an intern or entry. 
Moving to the North America has always been a dream of mine and over the past 2 years, things only made me realize how much of a stranger I am in my own land. Family is not supportive, I don't have any baggage, emotional or physical to take with me (except tech ofc). There is really no happy ending here for me, in this country.
How hard would it be for someone like me to get a Visa? Which are the steps to follow and is there any other way to get there? How easy is it to get an intern job as a programmer there? (USA or Canada)"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[You have been criticised by many for bringing your political opinions into your reporting too much (mainly people confusing your Twitter opinions with your actual job in reporting\). I for one think that you do remain balanced.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4re6?context=5)|Who you are, your life experience inform what you are, and I try to be balanced, but I can't pretend I am always neutral. I try to be objective, but I accept that sometimes when powerful emotions are in play, this can be very, very hard.  I don't think my political stance has changed since I became a reporter; it was profoundly changed by working as a volunteer teacher on the banks of the river Nile in remotest Uganda.
[Do you find it difficult to keep your own personal opinions out of your reporting? and Has your political stance changed over the years as a result of the things you have seen and experienced?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4re6?context=5)|There is no such thing as a neutral human being. I am a man, you may be a woman... what is neutral between us in that regard?
[Would it be fair to say there has been a general decline in the quality and morality and of the british media over the last forty years?  If you agree or disagree, why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4pn1?context=5)|Well, I think Channel 4 News is holding its own, and I think we do a far better programme than when I began. It's an amazing team, it belongs to you, it costs you nothing. But yes, I think there has been a negative pull on the British media and I blame some of the proprietors for that. I still think the BBC is pretty good and I would defend it to the death, even though I have never worked for it.
[Given your coining of Poppy Fascism, a term with which I agree, are there any other over sensitivities in society that you are sick of? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5uih?context=5)|I am worried about the empire. Any moment now, somebody could come knocking on your door and invite you to receive the Order of the British Empire (OBE) even become a Member of the British Empire (MBE) or worse still a Commander of the Birth Empire (CBE).
 |It does seem to me time that we respected the idea of honouring achievers in our society without inflict them with this antediluvian word 'empire'.
[Hi Jon, thanks for doing this. Is there a meaning to the sock colours?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4vrg?context=5)|I choose them carefully every morning, and they are informed by how I feel, whether I am in love, who I'm going to meet today, what's happened in the news, and whether I have any oats left for my porridge.
 |Brighter colours seem to suggest for me a brighter day, and I hope to infect others with the same idea! Men in drab grey socks are a grim and distressing sight.
[What can be done to save the distinct voice of Channel 4 news ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5d4w?context=5)|Raise your voice! Get a petition going! Tell your MP to do something about it! It's yours, it costs you nothing, and it's genuinely different from anything else on offer.
 |If they sold it off, they wouldn't give you the money, and whatever followed afterwards would not be able to afford Channel 4 News.
[Do you think British newsrooms are diverse enough? Not just ethnicity but it feels like all walks of life aren't really represented in the press. For example lower socio-economic backgrounds and those with disabilities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4tdd?context=5)|Well although I am an upper-middle class twit, I'm an exception in my office. I have watched the newsroom become more and more diverse as time goes by, and I would point to the groundbreaking report we did with the brother of the man accused of stabbing tube passengers in East London, which we secured because we had reporters and producers who came from the communities affected.
[Do you watch BBC News much and what do you make of it if you do?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu516a?context=5)|I listen to BBC News more than I watch it, and I think BBC radio news and the news-based programming is exceptional. In all honesty, I have television news on my desk from assorted channels, all day, so I have very little appetite to watch any more of it when I get home.
[Who is the most impressive politician you've talked with before?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu56xm?context=5)|Well, inevitably, Nelson Mandela. But there are others, too: there was an amazing Norwegian foreign minister called Jonas Gahr Støre, who had a brilliant grasp of world affairs and I reckon could yet be a candidate for Secretary General of the United Nations.
[As someone looking to become a journalist what tips have you got for getting into the industry? Also is it worth applying for Student membership of the National Union of Journalists?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4sba?context=5)|Work experience, internships — neither of these will make you any money at all, but they will introduce you to our world, and to people who may become useful contacts when you try to get a job.
 |In the meantime, wherever you are, try to blog or tweet or Facebook what you're seeing. Good luck!
[Will you be returning for season 6?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4gzn?context=5)|My contract forbids me from discussing any of my appearances, but I am still basking in the glow of a red wedding and I love going north!
 |And I am certain... that [winter is coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGjH0FL-OoE).
[Where do you get your ties?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5dir?context=5)|Anywhere I can find them – particularly craft shows – but I have a favourite, who has made ties that I have bought for 30 years, and she's called Victoria Richards and operates out of Peckham – funny? Peckham Rye tie?
[What would you say are the key differences between UK and USA news, if any?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5qdo?context=5)|US news, with notable exceptions (NY Times), is incredible parochial and myopic and despite its sensationalism and absurdity the diversity of the British press does serve to ensure that there is some brilliant reporting across the board.
[Are there any news stories that you've found emotionally difficult to cover?  How do you deal with stories that contain huge human suffering?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4och?context=5)|I found the atrocity in Paris very difficult. I [interviewed a woman doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANfWOBN_LVA) who had tended some of the maimed and dying. She managed to contain her own emotions, but I found tears rolling down my face.
[Jon, do you believe that more news organisations should refer to ISIS as 'Daesh'?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu64sm?context=5)|I think it probably would be a good idea to agree what they're actually called, and I think the more we use the words Islamic and State we play into the prospect that, in some dastardly way, they will come to represent both.
[What do you think of Donald Trump? How will you react if he eventually wins the US presidential election? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5efr?context=5)|I don't think of Donald Trump. I find it the easiest way to get over him, and I think if the rest of the world followed suit, we won't need to worry about him ever becoming President of the United States.
[Hi Jon, thanks for doing this AMA!  What do you think is currently the biggest political problem facing Britain at the moment? And how do you think it might develop? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu58zn?context=5)|Housing and the deep inequality between rich and poor. Particularly between very rich and very poor. I don't think there will be a revolution but it has all the characteristics of what has led to revolution in the past.
[Two Billion Miles sounds like a gripping narrative piece that is painfully relevant in times like this. Was there an event or a person that didn't quite make it onto the show that you're still thinking about and wanted to share with the world? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5jrb?context=5)|I think there's an event every single day that didn't quite make it on to the show but that I wish had sone so. The refugee crisis is still a crisis even when we don't show it and that is true of so much else - Gaza, Boko Haram's activities in northern Nigeria, I could go on more.
[What event have you reported that surprised you as it saw the biggest social change despite it possibly being not the biggest story at the time?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4ll4?context=5)|Although I knew it was massive, 9/11 created a far bigger social and political impact than I imagined at the time.
 |It cast negative shadows over many Muslim communities and we are all still struggling to reverse that.
[How much of what happened in 2001 do you see resonating today in the wake of Paris?  Edit: I feel special now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5pyg?context=5)|I think 9/11 and the consequent wars have all infected the world we live in to a far greater extent than we even begin to understand.
[It's a matter of record that the UK Secret Intelligence Service tried and failed to recruit you in the mid 70s. Have you ever regretted your decision to turn them down given how the nature of threats to the UK have changed, and did they ever try again? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5b56?context=5)|How do you know I really did turn them down?! Maybe I was just conning you.
 |But seriously, I did turn them down. I have never regretted it, I couldn't possibly have been a journalist and a spook on the side, and nothing that has happened since has made me change my mind.
[What's your opinion on the media providing a platform for organisations like ISIS through publicising their content, or for racist public figures such as Donald Trump? Should the media publish everything or should we not provide a platform for racist, hate-filled comments?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4vy7?context=5)|Well, the fundamental is that we must strive to protect free speech and that includes having to put up with people like Donald Trump. BUT there are laws that govern racism, homophobia and other grim conditions and those laws should be upheld at every turn.
[How do you feel about the mainstream medias lack of objectivety? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu5j2n?context=5)|I think in some ways it creates a bit of absurdity, but then you could argue that in a capitalist system, somebody's got to put the money up and make a profit. I'm glad I don't.
[How many times have people made stupid jokes about you ""knowing nothing"" in the past 6 years or so?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3w8bop/i_am_jon_snow_british_journalist_and_newscaster/cxu4yyz?context=5)|My estimate would be in excess of 100,000 times. And the funny thing is, lots of people still think they're the first person to do it.

3w943h,11,2015-12-10,Depressed and needing some support,augustautumn,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3w943h/depressed_and_needing_some_support/,"I am a long time lurker here. I have stories but not nearly as bad some of you guys here. All in all, I ended up depressed with some anxiety issues growing up around the typical Asian household. My parents aren't bad people. They don't hound me nearly as much. But I grew up having those high expectations for myself. I saw the struggle and negatives of being in a typical Asian household and I wanted out. I didn't want to struggle like they did or fail and be around the people who would not let you forget it. Except that I did fail, or I stumbled badly. I graduated with a degree in Accounting but have only done unpaid internships and low paying contractor work in the industry. I have suffered from depression for my entire adult life with signs of vulnerability to it when I was younger. Now I'm not blaming my parents for how I turned out but I can't deny that they had a big role in how I developed over the years. Now that I had this big scare with a real interview this entire week and feeling like my heart would jump out of my chest and run away from me, I realize now that I need to get my life together. Yeah, some of you guys may roll your eyes. But for the past few years out of school, I haven't had the best people around me. The few friends I do have are depressed as well. With parents who only shit on you with no real insight on how to succeed besides doing well in school, I wasn't prepared for the real world. I always skirted by and faked it and I didn't end up learning anything whether academically or socially. So I need some help. I'm looking for a pen pal of some sorts who is willing to hear me out. I literally have no support system in real life. I'm fairly desperate for some real talk.

Now that I've been scared out of my comfort zone. I have an interview tomorrow that I am planning to ace or basically do the best I could possibly do after hiding from the real world for so long. If I bomb it, I plan on keeping in contact with the person. I haven't been able to sleep all week and I don't think I will until I either get the job or I get a rejection email. It's all good with me. I don't plan on sulking in my bed afterward. I plan on moving forward but I need someone to remind me. It's a big thing to ask especially from a faceless account on Reddit. I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I could find it elsewhere. Depression lies and it has really changed my mindset concerning things with myself. I have been active in the accounting field for years but yet, I feel like I have done nothing. I'm not sure if there's ever a real sign on if you're doing something right. So I'm hoping to work together being okay with that.

I have done some research on some old classmates and alumni from my school who did not go the conventional route of Big 4 to CPA to private industry. I have updated myself on the requirements for the CPA. I already own several self study guides for the CPA and I'm ready to really start studying. I've realized that the lack of support for my field really hindered my own push toward achieving this goal of becoming a CPA. I'm tired of hearing about how hard accounting classes are or the jokes about how a lot of marketing people were former accounting majors or accounting is so boring or anything else negative about accounting. That's what I had to put up with every since I said I was studying accounting. I want some positive feedback in the field or real feedback. I want to speak to motivated individuals and not slackers.

I lost quite a few years of my life to depression. But I still have the lingering issues of not feeling good enough and that's the Asian upbringing. The depression just exacerbated that issue. If any of you guys have dealt with this, can you let me know your methods on how to get better? I have sought out professional help through my school's counseling center when I was still a student. I was assigned to the only other asian person in the department. She was a nice person but completely unhelpful with my issues. My depression was made worse when I suddenly lost an important member of my family. That's when I truly gave up on life. But I do not have the best health insurance so it's been hard to find someone else who would understand the issues with an asian upbringing. So I want to try to tackle this without professional help as of right now. The amount of change that the scare of an interview did for me was incredible so I can see myself doing better with my own will. 

I hope to get a job by June next year so I can start paying off my loans, have some savings, and move out of my parents' place. I know that once I do, I'll only keep getting better. I've been feeling too guilty for wanting to live my life after the death of the family member. I always feel so guilty for wanting a life for myself and I hate that my parents instilled that in me. My life at home is awful really. I have trouble sleeping and my parents stay up until after midnight. Even when I was in school, I always had to wait until after they were asleep for me to sleep. They just don't care that I have to wake up early for class or being so sleep deprived does nothing for knowledge retention. The walls are paper thin and my bedroom is right next to the TV. Everything else I can avoid like their dinner times and the food issues. But I can't avoid not being able to sleep. No, I cannot move out yet because I literally have no money. I cannot crash at a friend's place. I can't escape just quite yet. They just really irritate me. "
3w9g8p,5,2015-12-10,How do I analyze the technical requirements of a project?,Frekkon,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3w9g8p/how_do_i_analyze_the_technical_requirements_of_a/,"I got a job where I have full control of a project and I'm in charge to analyze the project to get technical requirements, how much it's going to take and the cost.

3wbksi,2,2015-12-10,Suddenly being let go? (CA),throwaway_494293,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3wbksi/suddenly_being_let_go_ca/,"Hello /r/legaladvice !

I'm a 22 year old male and currently finishing up my last semester at a university in California. I was told this morning that I would have to be finding a job elsewhere as I am hired as an ""intern status"" and as soon as I finish school, I can no longer be working with the company. I was working part-time when school had started and full-time hours during the summer prior to school. My start date was in late June of this year. 

Around the beginning of November, my supervisor had asked me when my last day would be. Convo going something like this:

Supervisor: Any thoughts on when your last day would be?

Me: I didn't know I was being let go..?

S: Oh if you're an intern, you must be a student in order for you to continue working here.

Me: I see, are there any opportunities for full-time here at this office? I would love to continue working here.

S: Let me look into that for you.

***fast forward a few weeks, now in mid November***

S: So I have good news, you don't have to be a student to stay on board as an intern! So yay!

Me: Whew, nice. (This gave me more time to think about what I want to do in terms of try and stay with the company or if I should look elsewhere as I've already almost been let go abruptly.)

***fast forward to today 12/10***

S: When you're done, let's meet briefly

Me: -finishes work up- Ok, what's up?

S: I'm sorry to inform you but I verified and found out you do indeed have to be a student in order to stay on. And I apologize our office is not looking to hire any full-time at this point in time.

Is this just the end of the line for me? I figured an employer would have to give me a reasonable amount of time for me (the colloquial ""2 weeks notice"" that I hear often in the workplace) to collect my things and allow myself time to maybe look for other work without having to have a break in employment status. Are there resources for me to seek out in terms of unemployment, etc.?

Thank you all in advance!!"

Just transferred to a decent state university with a 3.85 GPA. I had always planned on pursuing the academic route, so my current situation is pretty depressing.

This semester has been incredibly horrible for me, I basically have experienced a very rough patch in my personal life (including temporary homelessness and depression), this impacted my grades severely. It's looking like I'm going to make 2 B's and at least one C, with one bordering on a D, depending on my final score tomorrow. (Calculus I, which I would think would be a horrible class to fail on a transcript) This will effectively drop my GPA close to a 3.2. I feel like I have, in one semester, ruined any chance at actually pursuing a meaningful graduate education, because I have diminished my chances at getting into a desirable program. (Was wanting to do something in computational neuroscience) I want some opinions or maybe stories of people actually coming out on top from a similar situation.

End of my undergraduate education, I could have a 3.7ish GPA, and I plan on actually getting involved in research next semester. (Had a small internship so far, but it was only five weeks and probably not worth much in the long run.) I am worried that this horrible semester will haunt me forever and ruin any chance at me being competitive.

So... Should I throw in the towel? If not, where do I start rebuilding my academic career so I can get back on track to applying for graduate school in 2 years?"

I love what we do, how we do it, and what it involves. The startup took a pretty big chance bringing me in, but it's been great so far. I am 'interning' until February, and then we will reassess my contributions to the team and hopefully I will continue working with them with a slight pay increase.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Here is where the struggle begins, I recently got an offer for a summer internship with a different company, company Y. They are offering substantially more pay, but the work isn't exactly what I want to be doing and it also seems like it may be more monotonous and boring.

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, should I potentially take the risk at work for X and have more fun while I'm still young and can still be supported by my parents, or take risks later and take a less risky internship now?"

I had originally completely dismissed the concept of ""foundational year"" courses (courses that ""prepare"" you for the actual CS course), because they seemed like a waste of time, but when I thought about it, all the university related opportunities are still (or should be still) present - career related options, socialising with tech people, joining programming clubs and stuff like that. I've been wondering if this is actually worth an year of someone's life or is it better to just get on into the actual Computer Science course? I'd be very happy to know you guys' opinion on this. Lastly, sorry about this not being completely directly related to salaries/companies/business, as I am sure you'd enjoy such a conversation more, but this topic is also related to CS careers so it should hopefully be fine.



**tl;dr** I've got an offer for a CS programme from a decent university (City University London), but I got an offer for a foundational year + CS programme from an another decent university /it also has the Russel Group label attached to it/ (Queen Mary). I am wondering if the second offer provides me with any significant benefit."

**Academics:**

* **UW GPA: 3.78** &lt;--- Biggest worry

* UC GPA: ~4.2-ish

* ACT: 35 w/ 28 Writing (36 Writing Superscored) (English: 35 Math: 34 Reading: 34 Science: 35)

* Feel confident in my supplements, especially the ""Why NYU/Columbia"" and Harvard's topic of your choice

**Rec Letters:**

Obviously I haven't actually seen them so I'm just going off of my feeling and what my counselor has told me:

* 10/10 amazing from CompSci teacher

* 5/10 meh from Physics teacher

* 7/10 solid from Economics teacher

* 7/10 solid from prior head of secondary education (K-12 school)

* 11/10 incredible counselor report. He told me he had to tinker with the formatting to fit it all on two pages - the limit is one.

**Schools:**

* Columbia College/Harvard

* UC Berkeley/UCLA/UCSD

* Northwestern

* NYU CAS (demonstrated interest by visiting)

* Boston University

Additionally, someone from my class got accepted Columbia ED today, and she was a literally perfect applicant: 4.0 GPA, 2160 SAT, incredible ECs, the best rec letters ever and presumably amazing essays. There's no way I'm going to be able to live up to her in any regard except for standardized tests, diversity and maybe essays. I feel like I'll be compared to her no matter what happens, which will inevitably sway admissions towards the big fat ""Denied"". Then you also have this one girl who got deferred from Harvard today and will now also apply to Columbia. Once again, she's a great applicant - 4.0 GPA, 2250 SAT, and the rest of her application is also presumably on a similar level to mine.

Basically, I guess my worry boils down to being compared to others, which might leave me behind. Or maybe they'll take all three of us? Who knows. Will admissions compare me to other applicants from my school, especially already accepted ones? Will they even accept more than one applicant from a school?

Thanks and good luck to all of you!"
3we48m,1,2015-12-11,Two internship offers. First time negotiating salary!,ShittyAlgorithms,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3we48m/two_internship_offers_first_time_negotiating/,"Hi everyone,

I have recently heard back from a second company that they would like to extend me an offer. 

The first company is offering me ~$33/hr, but it would only be 10 weeks, I'd have to relocate (and pay rent in two places), and I think the work would be less interesting. After accounting for the additional expenses it works out to more like $25/hr for less weeks.

The second company is wanting to know what my expected salary would be. It sounds like they want to negotiate before making an offer. They're in the same city as me and are offering me a data science internship, which is really in line with what I'd like to do with my career. I wouldn't have to pay rent in two places and I'd be working for more weeks over the summer (which is good — I have debts).

Does anyone have any advice for how I should do this? I've never had an internship before. I think I'd be willing to take a lower offer from this second company because I believe it would be better for me in the long run. However, I don't want to sell myself short.

I was thinking of saying something along the lines of ""my other offer is for $33/hr, but I'm willing to negotiate"". Maybe I should place my bottom line at like $24/hr, though? It seems a bit weird to me to be negotiating salary at an internship when I don't really know my market value very well.

Thanks! :)"

I'd say that I have a pretty strong resume (I interned at NASA, and I have 3 years of research experience as well as a little over a year of project management experience on top of - as of today - a pair of Bachelors' in Physics and Computer Science), and plenty of people seem interested enough to speak with me, so it's got to be something I'm doing in the interviews.

In general, the interview process starts out with the introductions, questions about how much I know about the company in question (I generally look into what they do and the backgrounds of their CTO/CEOs if I can get my hands on the information), and I return with questions about what, particularly, they're looking for me to do so I can tailor the rest of my answers to that.  If there's something that was ambiguous or felt incomplete about the information on their website(s), I'll ask for more details about that.  After that, they ask why I'm interested in &lt;city they're located in&gt;, and I respond that I don't particularly mind where, but I want a place to settle down for awhile, since I've been moving halfway across the country every summer since my freshman year for different jobs, and I would like to stay in one place while I get my feet under me again.

Then they ask about why and when I got into programming (I dabbled around in middle and high school with arduinos and switched to CS after I got back from NASA), which, since I lead the conversation there, follows into questions about what I did during my internship and why that caused me to switch.  I make sure to mention that I didn't really know anything about what I was doing going in (and neither did my PI, so I had to learn it basically on my own) and that I still ended up with a functional prototype of a pretty complex system after 4 1/2 months, which they're still using in the lab.

Next come the questions about my personal projects - usually they start with the rockets, ignore the tesla coil, and move on to the quaternion library and the (in progress) NES emulator.  Occasionally (I think only if they were involved in scouts, themselves), there's a final question of affirmation that I am an Eagle Scout, and it moves on to the whiteboarding.

The white board is usually some banal example (fizzbuzz, reverse an array without a loop, print the numbers 1-100 starting with ""for(i=100;"", you know the type), though I occasionally see one that isn't instantly apparent, and then the interview concludes with a ""we'll contact you in the next week or so,"" I thank the interviewer for his/her time, and I say that I look forward to hearing from him/her.  Then I follow up in a little over a week (when they haven't contacted me, in direct contradiction with their statement at the end of the interview), and they've decided to pursue someone else with more experience, who's a better fit, etc.  ""We'll let you know if the situation changes.""

So, is there something that I'm doing wrong here?  How could I do better at convincing prospective employers to pull me in?  My rent contract expires at the end of the month, and I'm getting rather desperate at this point, so any tips would be appreciated.

3wee45,0,2015-12-11,Begin my career or build a financial foundation,dentnexus7,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3wee45/begin_my_career_or_build_a_financial_foundation/,"I have a recent dilemma on my future and I have to make a decision. 

Background:
I recently graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering in May 2015. I decided to backpack through Europe after college as a gift to myself. For the past two months or so since I got back I've been searching for a job. I am in the final interview stage for a company right now (interview is next week). I believe I can interview well next week and get my foot in the door to begin my career. The position is $25/hr for first 4-6 months and then switched to salary. 

This week, though, I've run into a new job opportunity that is not in my degree field but has excellent hours and excellent pay. It is a private driver. 3-4 days a week,  5-6 hours a day plus random extra hours here and there,  $70/hr. For 2 years with possibility of being longer. I part time valeted for 2 years in college and am currently a valet to pay bills while finding a better job. This opportunity would begin next Friday. 

Thoughts:

I am not sure what to do. My parents are expecting/wanting me to begin my career. But this driver job sounds like a great opportunity to create a financial foundation for myself and my future. 

If I choose my career,  I can get paid well, and gain more experience (already had 2 internships btw) but with longer hours. I can get my foot in the door but ultimately the position is not what I want to do in the long run (I'd be developing on a mainframe with an old language, cobol,  for an electric company. But really,  I want to develop and work on some newer,  more significant future technology. For example oculus rifts or something). 

If I choose the driver position, I will get paid much better with less hours but no experience in my field. I will not get my foot in the door with my career,  but I will create a financial foundation for my future and with the extra hours I'd have,  I can begin teaching myself how to develop on something I want my career to really be,  for example oculus rifts. 

Notes:

There are many other pros and cons to each choice, I'm sure,  but I just pointed out some big main ones. 

The driver position is for 2 years right now, but if I can't/dont want to do 2 years,  I'm sure it will be fine if a replacement is found accordingly. 

Oculus rifts is just an example of what I want to develop on. I actually still don't know where I want my career to go and what I want to work on.

I feel a career is the way to go,  being as people are raised to do the norm and start a career after college (at least I was,  I mean). But I can't help but think that I have the rest of my life to have a career job and I'm young and it will be ok to not begin it yet since people with Computer Science and Engineering degrees will still be heavily needed in the future. 



Anyone with any wisdom or solid input on my situation, please help me out on making a decision. Thanks."

I don't know what the hell I was thinking at the time.  
As expected, some guy copied my code and put it in their own code. So a few days ago, I received an email from my prof saying that they detected an academic integrity violation in my assignment. I was really confused, because being a true asian, I would never cheat and I worked my butt off for 2 weeks on this assignment. It took hours of debugging, and they told me I cheated. Then I realized people could access my code, publicly, because I'm a rare breed of dumb asian. Also, turns out uploading code was an academic violation. Now I'll either get a 0 on the assignment, 0 on the course, or neither and get a permanent record on my transcript saying I cheated.  
I didn't even make it to the internship to Google.  
TL;DR: Didn't read university version's End User Agreement, someone copied code, probably getting kicked out of uni and disowned by asian parents"

I am currently at a crossroads in life and would very much appreciate any advice/criticism. Sorry for the block of text.

25/ F - I worked at Geek Squad for 3.5 years doing IT troubleshooting/Repairing laptops and moved into a Database Administrator role. Loved that position, but I couldn't afford the last 2 years of university. I joined the USAF to get some funding for college, my job in no way relates to programming unfortunately. 

Fast forward 4 years and I am separating with my B.S in Information Technology (focus on programming). I am also admitted into Graduate School for my MS in Information Technology for Fall 2016. Currently I am applying for summer internships in programming or IT roles (trying to stay away from helpdesk/support) to get more experience. Additionally, I am moving to a completely to a new state where I do not have as many networking IT colleagues, but I have met a few.

I think ideally my future role would be more of a Project Management over software/IT, but I know that is not a ""starter"" role. The reason for this is because the business side of things interests me as well as the technical aspects. I feel that I have great communication/management skills that could be melded with the technical side. Before getting to that type of role I know it's important to have a focus.

Currently my focus is working on my programming, however my professional versus educational skills are not up to par and I want to LEARN more, hence wanting an internship. Although I do enjoy programming, I am not an expert at any one language. I have worked with several and dabble here and there (C++, Java, HTML, PHP, Python, VB). Math is not my strong subject (hence not getting a CS degree) and I am nervous I will not be up to par at all with other programmers. This is why I think it would be smart to try and get a programming internship, learn, and move from there.

The problem it seems, and understandably so, that your coveted programming internships are filled by CS or Software Engineering majors. I have applied for over 20 so far (a strong resume and cover letter) and have gotten one or two bites, but nothing has lined up. Granted I have not moved there yet and this has all been on job boards. I had a GREAT internship offer for an application developer / rotating internship, but they offered it for a different location.

Is there another area of IT that would fit the bill for what I am eventually wanting to do? What are some things that I can do to boost my programming skills? My friend back home talked to me a bit about GitHub (just signed up today, still a bit lost) and CodeForAmerica. Now that I am not in school full time and working full time I have more time to work on these skills outside of school, but as far as working on projects, where should I begin? 

I guess I am nervous about my place in the IT world, transitioning from the military, moving to a new state, and starting graduate school. Any advice would be appreciated....

Thanks! :)

3wgldj,1,2015-12-11,What kind of position is this called?,thezoomaster,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wgldj/what_kind_of_position_is_this_called/,"So I recently got offered an internship at a really cool startup in SF. The recruiter says its a QA position, but I talked to the Manager I'll be working under (""Automation Engineer"") and after learning about the kind of stuff I'll be doing it doesn't sound like typical QA-ish type stuff I've heard about.

For example, I'll be:
*A ""full stack"" engineer
*Building applications and frameworks that will help developers dev faster, like computing data and building dashboards from it
*Build scalable automatic testing systems 
*Not do any actual testing - it seems like I'll be mostly be building the frameworks and various applications that will help developers test

It's a very small team right now so I'll  be able to build something with legitimate impact and with cool tech and be assigned a project to make over the summer.

I'm just wary of the ""QA intern"" title because it is my junior year summer and I have heard horror stories about being pigeonholed into QA positions and how difficult it is to get back to dev. However it seems like this position will have a lot more development than actual testing. I haven't received a formal offer letter yet, but I was wondering what exactly this type of work would be called? Is it actually still just QA? Or is it dev ops or engineering productivity or something else? "

Never thought this day would come, but now I have a choice here of which I am both grateful and concerned.              
                       
**Company A**: I was an intern last year at this relatively ""well-known"" game company. They have offered me an internship this year again (related to big data, which is what I want), in a different department. However when I was there, I discovered gaming is not my thing and no matter how different work I'll do, it will always be related to gaming and I feel I will not be able to break out of that niche in future if I wanted to.             
              
**Company B**: The next choice is to sign the offer letter of a ""BIG4"" but the project I will be working on is not directly related to big data. I will have 2 other team mates doing the same work. The company is huge and has all sorts of departments and great perks, and my mentor from company A says that it will help me grow in the long run. I have a few days to reply back to company B. The pay at this place will be about 15% more than at company A.              
              
I feel like I am still not happy with either of these options in front of me. I have always wanted to work at G or FB, but I am still waiting to hear back from them, and am unsure whether I will get an interview date soon since it is already winter vacation. Plus I have to reply B soon. Last year, I got to the hiring committee review at G but was denied because they ran out of space for more interns. :(               
                            
I'm a hard worker and I have secured these offers by trying really hard, and they were never easy for me. However, I am unsatisfied and unsure whether choosing one (either A or B) will look like a good decision in retrospect when it is summer. My heart lies at G and FB. My interest lies in Big data and I want to gear my career towards it. G and FB pay almost 20% more than B and almost 50% more than A. Money is not important to me at this point, but it would be a great help if I could secure G or FB.              
                
Has anyone been in such a situation before? Are there suggestions for me? I would like to hear if any college student has been through such thoughts before, and how they resolved it.
             
Thank You."

She's a single mother, going through a lot to help us get through life. I appreciate that. But she has no boundaries? Like

When I was in school, I almost made a boyfriend and she found out and went absolutely ape shit on me, grounded me and basically wrecked me for the entire year. Which was fine back then, you know. I was young and stupid and he was a shit guy.

But she's fucked my privacy since then. I gradually just learned to deal with it, and started telling her everything about my life because it was easier that way, she would not be suspicious and I would be left to live in peace. I stopped doing things I could mention infront of mumma, I was basically Golden Child for the first year of college. I got good grades (top 10), did internships, came home on time, had good friends, did good society stuff, everything.

Second year mai I started taking on too much and started burning out. Still no boy, but this whole ""tell mumma every detail and listen to every whim of hers"" was getting old. It was getting to the point that thinking of disobeying her would give me actual, physical anxiety. She would behave like a child with me- take my clothes and not return them, talk about her boyfriend troubles with me, check out guys with me. It was nice, but only because I had literally no one else to share my life with. She started turning into my whole world, like every decision I make and every breath i take revolves around her and if she doesnt want me to, I wont do it. My friends stopped inviting me to events and stopped doing stuff with me because I simply couldnt- if mummy wanted me in the metro and home by 4 means I had to be home by 4. Not doing that gave me so much anxiety because when she gets angry she says and does the most terrible stuff. I can even sleep in my own room because of this- i was told go sleep in my brother's room as he was getting lonely these days and I couldnt refuse. I feel like her doormat.

Two months ago, I met a guy. And. Just. I had avoided all sorts of relationships till then, but he's different. Theres a future there when I think of him. Problem is that he's leaving to study in the UK in May and I'll be here without him for a year (or even longer if I dont clear UK myself)

So when I realised I was really attached to this guy, mummy could see it too (in my behaviour) so she asked me about it and I told her. She told me that she supports this, but to hold off the loving feelings and just stay friends. Too late, I'm pretty sure I'm falling in love with him, and vice versa. No big deal, he and I both agreed to go slow and wait for each other till we have a solid base career to start stuff from. 

So now he and I are texting each other all the time, and we've kissed (nothing more) and we send a lot of lovey texts which I cannot let mumma see or else I'm fucked. But mother has problems with me texting people as well. SO yesterday (my exams are over now, I have nothing to do) I was in bed and texting him, and mumma came inside and got angry and took my phone. She may or maynot have read texts. I dont know, because today she wasnt showing any signs of reacting or being angry with me.

Either way, my fear is that she will somehow sabotage this and make me stop talking to him. I gave decent exams, hopefully 80+, definitely 70+ out of 100 in each paper this semester, but she might use my grades as an excuse to get me to stop talking to him which I dont want to do.

She knows the kind of hold she has on me, and if she yells at me and threatens me to stop talking to him, I'm afraid I'll be cowed into doing it. I want to stand up to her and tell her not to interfere in my relationships. How do I tell her this? How do I break free from her influence on me? I dont want to be scared anymore and I just want to give this guy a fair chance. If mummy tells me to cut contact, every time I meet him secretly, I'll be guilty and I cant take that. please help r/india"
3win56,115,2015-12-12,23yo. Screwed up in college. Graduated in 2014 with a degree I don't care for. Haven't done shit since graduation up until now (no interns/jobs) but finally realized I have to do something with my life. Here's 5 years of my life.,itsmepaulchan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3win56/23yo_screwed_up_in_college_graduated_in_2014_with/,"I really need to share my story because I've been depressed lately since I JUST realized I fucked up the last 5 years of my life doing absolutely nothing and wasting my parents' money. This is going to be long but I'll include a TLDR at the end.

I present to you the past 5 years of my life

In 2010 I got into a good private school with intentions of majoring in chemistry. I was always a pretty good student in general but I never tried my hardest and I'm pretty sure I was the worst procrastinator (ex: started and finished 5+ page papers the MORNING it was due...crammed for exams few hours before it started...never did ungraded HW...never went to adviser/used any helpful resources)...you get the point. 

So much of my first year of college was somewhat lax...I took a bunch of random intro courses and got mostly B's and A's without doing much work. I talked to my chem adviser to plan out my courses for the next 3 years because I really really wanted to go study abroad in Japan. So she told me I had to take a advanced 300 level course that's usually taken by juniors/seniors because it was only offered during the fall. I took the course during my 2nd semester of my freshmen year but I had to drop this course because my grades were borderline failing. This ruined my plans to go abroad.

My sophomore year is when things started to get real problematic...but I didn't realize how bad it was until the 2nd semester of my junior year. Pretty much...I took organic chemistry and barely passed with a D- and got a C in physics...this was due to me doing absolutely shit, thinking I could wing all my exams just like I did in HS. I should have visited my adviser but I did not. I don't remember why but if I had to guess, it would be because I was embarrassed.

My parents always called me to see how I was doing and I kept telling them I was doing fine in school. My mom always told me to do internships and whatnot but I didn't listen because I was a fucking moron. 

My junior year came around and I started to take the more advanced courses for my major. To no surprise I got a C in one of the courses and this was when my adviser whom I barely have spoken to in the past called me in and told me that my major GPA was very low and if it falls beneath a certain threshold which I bordered, I was going to be forced to drop out of college (I did not know about this btw). 

So one would assume I would be shocked and scared. But no...I wasn't as worried as I should've been because I kept telling myself that everything would be fine. I managed to call my mom which was the hardest part because I've been telling her all this time that I've been doing ok in school. To my surprise, she was very considerate and told me to do what I thought was best. I went back to my adviser and she advised me to switch majors. I didn't want to do college all over again and the tuition isn't cheap as well so I ended up switching my major to sociology because I happened to have taken a bunch of sociology courses in the past 3 years of college because they were pretty easy. 

I switched my major to sociology and got to meet with the head of the department and etc. They were all super kind and helpful. In order for me to graduate on time, I needed more sociology credits so in the summer after junior year I went to a CUNY and finished all the required courses. I was back on track to graduate on time so my senior year played out exactly like my other years...I barely studied and didn't give a shit about my courses so pretty much I would go to class, come back to my dorm, play computer games for HOURS, sleep, and then wake up and do HW right before my classes. The one thing I am proud of is the fact that I presented my senior research at a big sociology conference. Other than that, I graduated with no honors or anything mentionable. I have no internships/job experiences in my 4 years of college because I have never sought out help from my school's career center.

From graduation up until right this moment, I haven't done ANYTHING in regards to my future or career. I've been slouching around in my house, living off of my parents. I've created an expensive annual gym membership and I haven't been going frequently. My mom has been constantly telling me to search for jobs or internships but I've been lying to her, telling her I've been looking when in reality I was just playing more games. I haven't even made a resume/LinkedIn for fucks sake. I am now still and will forever be super grateful and lucky that my parents (especially my father) are able to bear with me doing absolutely shit for so long and to provide for me.

Last month of November is probably the most important time for me in this long depressing story of mine. My mother and I went to Korea for a month to get a bunch of surgery done and to visit family. I got to meet a bunch of family members that I didn't know existed and realized that I've become an uncle. It was a really good experience for me. However, the most important part of the trip was that I had no access to games. I couldn't play games for a whole month and I can't remember the last time I didn't play games for a week. Albeit I did re watch the whole series of Friends when I was in my hotel. I didn't really do any sightseeing or anything super memorable but just seeing new family was more than enough for me to be content with the trip. My cousins there are much older than I am and they've been telling me their experiences with jobs and such. There wasn't really anything to take away from their experiences except the fact that getting a job isn't a cakewalk.

I came back home less than 2 weeks ago and something just snapped inside of me, telling me to do something with my life. I'm having strong feelings of regret which is why I'm feeling a bit depressed but I'm also kinda glad that I had this moment of realization. I've been lurking through some of my HS friends' LinkedIn profiles and am seeing that almost all of them are employed and have done internships/etc. I'm feeling left behind but I want to start my career now before it's too late. I've been playing less games than usual and have been going to the gym for the past week. I hope to maintain a healthy lifestyle as my past lifestyle was completely awful. Recently I've been looking at my options and have been thinking about several choices such as going to grad school, finally make my resume and start applying for jobs/interns, and to look into career counseling. 

My mind is pretty boggled since I'm trying to do so much at once in terms of finding a job for a career. I understand that a sociology degree isn't the most sought out degree for high paying jobs and I definitely don't want to do social work. I honestly just want a career in which I can advance in. Currently I've been looking into human resource positions because I believe that my degree in sociology is relevant to that line of work and the money is pretty good if I ever make it to a manager-level position. But first, I have to make my resume and etc. It really sucks that I don't have any relevant experiences or any internships as I found that most of the entry-level applicants do have some sort of experience. 

**I'd appreciate any advice or comments in regards to finding a job for someone such as myself.**

**TLDR** : Had to switch major from chem to sociology in my 2nd semester of my junior year in college to graduate on time b/c I fucked around too much. Fucked around for another year and a half (up till now) after graduating with no internships/past experiences under my belt so feeling depressed. Finally realized that I need to start a career ASAP.

Just to add, I'm very thankful for the few friends that I have whom have been very supportive about my situation. Without them, I would be feeling a lot worse and probably wouldn't have had the courage to post my story. "

My story is basically this, I just got my BSc in CS and I'm working on my Master's. However, I'd prefer to start working full-time rather than finish my Master's. If I got a worthwhile internship though, I would probably keep going with the degree.

I want to apply to a couple places that are pretty selective.

Can I apply as full-time first and then if that doesn't work out apply as an intern? Or would I be auto-filtered out?
Is it generally ""easier"" to get in as an intern or new grad?

I have side projects, real experience, etc if that makes a difference. I.e. I'm not a totally inexperienced new grad."

I have pretty bad testing anxiety and choked during the second half of the test not even finishing the verbal sections.  My GPA isn't great either at a 3.4 with a BA in Econ (but I took the easy route in school, and still fucked up). I am now taking one class in economic research methods to boost my record a little, but I am not sure if this is really helping.        
     
I wanted to continue my education with an MPP or applied social research  masters for social policy in hopes to work for international organizations such as UNDP, UNDESA or local NGOs that emphasize on research for social and economic development.  I know that my grades could still get me into a lower tier MPP program, but I am not sure if it is worth the investment as I know that MPP graduates starting salary is usually not very high, and I don't think I would be qualified for any funding.       
     
I don't have much research experience, which I think is also holding my application back. I worked on a research project for one of my professors and under a PhD candidate (whom I worked directly with) in Tanzania as the assistant, collecting and cleaning data and managing local workers. I have one UN agency internship, and I am currently working as a volunteer research assistant for a local NGO that works in East Africa, collecting country background information for technical support.        
    
The professor I worked for on the project agreed to write a letter of rec for me, but asked to see my application packet before hand, specifically asking me for my GRE scores, letter of intent, and CV. I am too embarrassed to show him my scores, afraid he will reconsider his decision even after being in the top 20% of his class and working for him.

Most of the schools I wanted to apply to where in Europe which don't require the GRE, but I was still considering schools here such as, American University, and UMASS Amherst or the Demography program at UCI. Now I am thinking to just apply to European masters, they are less expensive and some are one year programs, maybe I can do this in lieu of post-bac or graduate diploma? I don't think the training I have right now is sufficient enough for me to get a job beyond an internship. I have applied for research assistant jobs all over the country and abroad and I haven't heard back aside from unpaid internships.    
     
I guess I am asking for advice or personal stories. I am just stuck in a rut beating myself over this.  My parents are not very supportive of my career route. I don't know whether its better for me to focus my energy on finding a job that is relevant and push back my masters until I feel like I am a more qualified candidate, or put in the effort now and just apply for the masters.  

TL;DR  Low GRE okay GPA, looking for advice on how to move forward and whether if it is worth it for me to apply.   
    
    
EDIT: If anyone was interested in what programs I wanted to apply for here are some schools I am interested in Europe:    
    
Univ. of Copenhagen- Global Development, Pompeu Fabra- Sociology and Demography, Central European University- MPA, University of Stockholm- Applied Social Research, UCL- Social Policy.  My goals for going into a masters program is to firstly gain more research experience within social policy preferably at an international level, and then learn more about the policy making/ managerial side of organizations, that's why I have been going back and forth between one-year research masters or policy programs that do have a significant research work related portion.

Next summer I'll be intern at one of Google's regional offices in Europe. It's a business analyst role, where I'll make use of SQL, excel and additional programming skills to analyse big data about clients' consumers' behavior as well as clients' spending in Google AdWords. As my internship begins in June, I've got 6 months to prepare for the internship. I'm currently in the second year of my international business bachelor's degree, but have done a Computer Science minor (including Database theory, Java, Computer Architecture and Business Inteligence) on the side this Fall. I'd like to develop my SQL/Excel/Programming skills to be on pair (or better) with full-time business analyst employees. How would you go about it?

I've got a big interview for an internship with one of the big 4 and I really want to kill it and get the job. I've been going over practice problems and reading through Cracking the Coding Interview and I wanted to cement my data structures/algorithms knowledge more, so I'm trying to decide between the two books in the title. 

I have CLRS and The Algorithm Design Manual, and both are highly reviewed and recommended, but to my understanding CLRS approaches the topic from a much more graduate/academic standpoint, and thus has a lot details, whereas The Algorithm Design Manual is less intensive.

From people that have read both, which do you think would be the most time-efficient for me to read? I'd like to know which I could realistically get through in less than a month and retain what I've read. I don't need/want to understand the implementation of Red-Black Trees, but I do want to get a good overview of Trees, Lists, Graphs, etc.

Thanks in advance, and any other advice on prepping would be much appreciated :)"

I am a computer engineering student in one of the better universities of my country (Turkey which as you may know a sinking ship).

I currently, don't have any significant extracurricular project to put on resume which may be the issue here. By the way, the part time job in the resume is 18 hours per week (which I carry on together with my education)

Could you please take a look at my resume (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5z_WyaKlrZAS3BOWEcyeExfOXc/view) and give me some recommendations on the resume, on the companies and internship application (or even on the life itself)?

3wp760,10,2015-12-13,Interview for dream industry next week- CA government water pollution abatement. Lots of questions!,steeeeeeeeeeeeevs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3wp760/interview_for_dream_industry_next_week_ca/,"Hi, r/jobs, 


I've been a frequenter here for quite some time and I'm back to ask for some advice concerning a new opportunity.  So let's get right into it. 


**About me**


* Graduated 2012 from a UC with B.A. in Environmental Studies/Sociology. 


* Emphasized law and policy with a serious interest in water law/policy/regulation/quality/distribution.  Was inspired by a professor who happened to have worked on the regional water board of this area to pursue a career in water. 


* Active in the local water scene-- i.e. attending and writing about local desalination debate in 2012; attending 3 conferences detailing new and emerging technologies in the sustainability field; sampling trainings through program sponsors at PG&amp;E's Pacific Energy Center; participant in campus sustainability office events and networking. 


* Internship with an organization funded through PG&amp;E, SCE, SDG&amp;E, and TVA to work with on campus students in area of water and energy conservation.  Notable achievements: successful grant for campus funds for an energy retrofit project on campus; 3 major outreach events saving thousands of kWh/year for the university; project planning and implementation; increasing social media representation (including building and publishing the first independent website for the program); overseeing total of 5 interns throughout time with the program. 


* Worked on special assignment between quarters including: with a large construction company on a LEED certified campus for a huge name in animation.  Worked with LEED professionals, architects, and project managers to provide administrative support-- also got to see real-life application of water recycling in new construction (relevant to the position in that the site uses reclaimed water for grounds irrigation); and working with a school district Energy Manager to complete an energy retrofit project, saving said district $10k in utility costs within the first year. 


* Post-grad: worked intermittently with a large school district in fiscal services, payroll, accounting, maintenance, facilities, technology, etc. to provide backup department support, employee technology trainings, and to streamline new processes.


* Following this, worked for 2 years with a boutique CPA firm as ""Director of Client Relations"" focusing on building and maintaining relationships with high-profile client base, customer service, scheduling, tax assistance, and general adherence to federal, state, and local regulations pertinent to the industry.  


* Overall: 6+ years of administrative support experience- 2 and a half as executive administrative support.  Industries ranging from public to private; education to tax. 

* Want more than anything to work in the water industry! 


**About this job** 


After months (5 to be exact) of unemployment, I have been offered an interview with a large name in water pollution control in my desired location (2 hours away from where I currently live).  This is an entry level administrative support specialist position to work in the admin services department of the regional treatment plant.  I have passed the examination and am now preparing for the interview.  Which brings me to...


**My specific questions** 


* I have a small gap (5 months) of unemployment that I need to tactfully explain in my interview.  What is the best way to say ""Since July (when I quit my last job) I have been a classified sub at the school district I worked with in the past and have been intently focusing on finding not just any job, but the right job (which I believe in my heart of hearts this job is).""  I want to avoid coming off like I've been getting rejected a lot (which I have) or like I'm not doing anything to professionally develop/keep busy. 


* I am up against roughly 8 other candidates, most of whom are local.  This puts me at a disadvantage, I know.  I need to be able to explain the distance and why, despite that, I am the best candidate.  I fully anticipate a question regarding this and have been trying to come up with the right way to say ""I have targeted this area because of its ecological significance (and economic significance-- huge agricultural industry that benefits from the water treatment/recycling here to abate groundwater withdrawal and seawater intrusion), I want to build a life here, I have always been involved in promoting environmental stewardship here (re: my college internship happened to be in a community about 45 minutes south of this opportunity).  Distance or not, I am the best candidate due to my past work experience, my educational foundation in the industry, and my desire for long-term growth with this specific organization.  I am relocating full-time (currently I am part time in the area) at my own cost commensurate with the right job opportunity."" 


* I anticipate being asked about the specific types of records/reports/confidential information I've worked with and the exhaustive list is LONG (it takes me about 3 minutes to go through the list when timing my response to the question).  I've only put those things that are noted in the job announcement but it is still long.  How do I fit everything in without (a) it being a 3 minute response and (b) without sounding like a list? 


* I also need to have the right way to explain why I quit my past job.  My real answer is that I left in the summer months to give the firm enough time to find/train my replacement before the busy season (January-April), but mostly because the work wasn't satisfying and I wanted to rededicate my career/life to the environment and move to my desired location.  Previously I've stated in interviews ""I left [firm] in the summer with one month notice to give them the time needed to find and train my replacement before the busy season.  I stayed past my notice to train my replacement personally, as the position is very integral to the office functioning, and because in two years I learned a lot of nuances that come with knowing the staff.  As an added layer of security, I created a position manual for the new hire with all of this information and other tidbits of staff likes/dislikes, certain VIP client preferences/needs, and all procedures and technologies that would be involved in the job.""  Is this what hiring managers want to hear? 


* Any (and I mean ANY) other things I should make sure to mention to give me a leg up.  


**Misc.** 


* I've posted my resume here and on r/resumes before, I'd be happy to post/pm it to anyone interested in seeing how I match up to the job description. 


* This is a government position for a Joint Powers Agency in water recycling/wastewater treatment. 


* The first round of interviews (as explained by the HR coordinator that administered the exam) is a panel-style interview with several members of the agency; followed by a second interview with the specific team I'd be supporting; and finally a lunch to ensure that personalities mesh. 


* I've gone through the first two stages of the process (application appraisal and those pesky employment exams). 


Anyway, I'm sorry if this went a bit long.  I'm just looking for every bit of advice I can get because this is the one.  This is literally the start in the career that I studied for, in the area that I want to be in, in the salary I want with the benefits I want.  I just need to make them want me as badly as I want them.  Thank you so much in advance, r/jobs!

3wpf77,1,2015-12-13,Appropriate equity compensation for early startup,TryExceptFinally,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wpf77/appropriate_equity_compensation_for_early_startup/,"I am currently a 2nd year university student who has been recruited by 2 fellow students at my university to work part time as a software developer for their startup. 

This startup is very, very early. The two founders are non technical and have been working on the design, marketing, and business strategy for several months. They now want me and 2 other computer science students to start to implement, with both a mobile app and web. 

Currently there has been no code written for the site. The founders have a lot in place but its all in the design/marketing/strategy side. The plan is for two other developers and me to work part time during  winter break and over the second semester and create an MVP of sorts (in the form of an app and site) for their startup. I would be under contract as a consultant rather than an employee

I have a few pressing questions. The first is what type of equity I should be expecting. On one hand, I'm not working the product full time (have classes and all that entails) and am not an experienced developer. However, I, along with the other two developers, would be the sole technical talent on the team and would be creating the site/app from scratch. Additionally, they currently have no funds to pay me hourly (they're going to try and get funding in the spring). As a result, they're paying me solely in equity. 

While I'd much prefer to get paid (since the odds that the equity ever becomes of value is extremely low), I'm slightly ok with it because I think the site will be very interesting to create. I'll have a huge project/experience to put on my resume and will learn a ton. But I do want to make sure that I get fair compensation. If you guys think I should try and get some sort of wage (they say they have a limited budget and would much prefer to pay in terms of equity), Let me know that as well. I figured I wouldn't be able to since they are college students who haven't received any funding yet.

Additionally, what should I watch out for in terms of contract signing. Although the two cofounders plan on going out to Silicon Valley this summer to work on the startup, I will be working at Uber this summer and have no plans on bailing on them. I want to ensure that nothing I sign has any affect on my internship contract with Uber that I've already signed. 

Thanks for any and all advice!"

Old laptop died and now I need to get a replacement for the new year. 

Some specs. I'm leaning toward; 8+ ram, SSD or hybrid, 2+ processor speed (not sure about multi core)

For school I'll need it for Microsoft office and programming: html, CSS, Java, c++, MySQL, and maybe php soon. I definitely wouldn't call this intense coding, But it can get up to hours at a time.

For internship I may need it for server work. I haven't personally worked on a server before so i'm not sure if I'll need anything special like running Linux.

Light gaming for my sanity. Mostly the new civilization game. Gaming is light, for when i'm not home.

Other odds and ends: nice screen since I'll be looking at it, backlit keyboard would be helpful and preferably around $650 but compromises can be met.

3wpuoj,1,2015-12-13,"What should I do? 4 years, 4 and a summer, etc..",krustykrags,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3wpuoj/what_should_i_do_4_years_4_and_a_summer_etc/,"So I'm having trouble deciding a few things, and I thought I'd use my first Reddit post to get yall's opinion. It'll be long, so sorry for that. I'm a junior majoring in computer science and minoring in business, and I've always planned/made it a goal to graduate in 4 years, which would be May of 2017. I'm finishing my semester and there is a chance that I will have to retake my Systems class, which is what has created some options that I'm having trouble deciding between, so what would yall do?

If I fail or get a D, I will have/choose to retake the class. My last 3 semesters are already busy: 17 hours next Spring, then 16, and then 15 for my last. If I retake the class, I can do three things: 

1) Just push a class back each semester and take one class in the summer of 2017 and graduate. 

2) I can take 17 hours next semester, 16 next fall, and then 18 during my last semester which would include my Capstone project which takes a lot of time, so I would be possibly jeopardizing grades/the project. 

3) I could petition and just take 19 hours next fall instead of 16, with courses like Operating Systems, Data Comm., Linear Algebra, and Database Design.... i.e. what the fuck, but it would allow me to still only take 15 hours during my capstone project.

Just a few notes: I can't transfer in any more hours from community college, I plan on doing/need to do an internship this coming summer, and I'm already taking a class in the Maymester this coming May.

Some things I've thought about is that if I don't graduate till August of 2017, I guess I'd have another semester to bring my GPA up more, but I also my not have as many opportunities since it'll be in the fall. GPA isn't something I'm necessarily worried about, I have around a 3.3/4.0, but it can obviously be better.

Thanks for anyone that reads the whole thing, I'd appreciate your opinions."

I've been working in Taiwan for 4 years, as far as I know `Silicon Valley` and `SF` are well-known for starting a world-class  startup.

Therefore, I hope I can have the kind of chance to work with a group of smart guys and learn something from the culture there.

I'm from Taiwan so I need to acquire an `working visa` like `OPT` or `CPT` to find a job legally.

There's a school `UCSC http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/`  providing the kind of `OPT` visa 

And I'm eligible to find a `no-paid internship` during studying session.

My aim is to find companies that like in the early stage of `Facebook`, `Stripe`, `Snapchat`

Where can I get more chances like that ? `SF` or `SanJose` or other areas that I don't know ?

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[How has the study of quantum physics altered your personal philosophy and attitude?  Not related to books for children but I've always wanted to ask! ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw0t0y?context=5)|Good question.  Since I spent so much time at the [Perimeter Institute](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/)---which has some of greatest minds in physics---as a graduate student, I feel like I got to learn quantum physics by being thrown in to the deep end. As quantum physics is a probabilistic theory, I thought I ought to really understand probability theory first. Turns out, for me anyway, deeply understanding probability and statistics has changed my world view far more than quantum physics has.
[Hmm... Interesting, how so? Do you make decisions differently based on what you've learned about calculating probability and evaluating them and statistics?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw2y0x?context=5)|Short answer: I am a [Bayesian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian). I strive (but rarely succeed) to make explicit my prior information and understand that probabilistic statements are **logical** deductions rather than **physical** one.
[So at its core isn't quantum mechanics physically probabilistic?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxwlwiy?context=5)|Quantum mechanics is a logical construct invented by humans. If it expresses uncertainty, it is our own.
[I do not follow what problems women have in STEM fields. If a person wants to study and work in  the science field how are they stopped by anything but talent and hard work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxx53dc?context=5)|There is institutionalized gender inequality in all aspects of life. So why would you expect STEM to be any different? You want actual numbers? For STEM it is 3:1 male-to-female ratio. There is no easy answer as to why and how to fix it. The PDFs I linked to in my post discuss the issue as it pertains to astronomy, but I suspect that most of the observations and arguments generalize to other fields (perhaps even more so).
[How do you feel that society and male engineers should respond to these stereotypes? How should universities support women in STEM who, during their internships, face male coworkers or managers who are sexually forward towards them? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw5wsz?context=5)|Even when we do, from my experiences---which fortunately is few---I find that bystanders (coworkers, other managers, administrators, etc) just don't know how to react. We need to do more than train people on what is and what is not acceptable but also on how to prevent or stop harassment as an observer.
[Where do you come down on the simulation hypothesis?   Is C actually just the maximum computational speed of the simulation?  Last, do you let yourself wonder about how entangled pairs do their thing once one of them is measured?  TIA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw1g76?context=5)|Not something I've heard about.  But if [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis) is what you are talking about, I am about as [pragmatic about physics](https://twitter.com/csferrie/status/673709702853713920?s=09) as one can get. So I must first ask, what does idea teach us about how we can manipulate and control the world around us?
[That's the one.  As to the mechanism of entangled pairs correlating, I would hope that might teach us about a deeper level of physics.  I think Bohr was of the practical, ""shut up and calculate"" school of thought, so there's nothing wrong with that obviously.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw1tn6?context=5)|Keep in mind that [pragmatism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism) still requires deep thinking. It's not at all about ""shutting up and calculating."" Nor do I recommend not thinking about the simulation hypothesis. We don't want all our eggs in one basket.
[Hi. What got you interested in writing children's books? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3wggpu/iama_quantum_physicistmark_zuckerberg_shared_a/cxw0q11?context=5)|I read [The Pythagorean Theorem Babies](http://www.amazon.com/The-Pythagorean-Theorem-Babies-Math/dp/148200058X) and thought, hey, I could probably do that for physics!  Turns out, self-publishing is surprisingly easy.  It's getting celebrity endorsement that's the hard part ;)
[What about black people in STEM? Or people from lower-income families? Do you think upper-middle-class women are at more of a disadvantage than lower-income black people?

I'm almost finished college, and have set myself up to a pretty great career start in software engineering.

I've been on a 12 month internship, which has really helped me expand my knowledge and realize how shitty I am in social situations.

I am someone who always appears tired, and known to consume lots of coffee. I don't have the hyper excited personality of my coworkers, which makes me feel insecure. These guys can talk about whatever they feel and be happy about it.

I'm not sure if its because I'm black or because I'm insecure, but I shy away from contributing to conversations and would rather focus on getting work done.

Even with people I know, I rarely talk about myself and my hobbies, interests, likes, etc. I am private with things because I would rather not be made fun of.  

For some context, I am pretty insecure about being black. People tend to view me as white-washed, even though I personally don't see that at all. It has made me cut ties with a significant amount of people. I have been teased a lot during highschool, and even with my friends when they tease about my blackness my mind can't just chill. I get really insulted and offended but don't show it. I casually say its racist but am not direct. 

So, I want to become a more social person and really get invested in meeting people and girls. I want to have fun talking with people, and not be depressed about why I'm so different and weird. 

Please help me achieve this goal guys! And if possible share your experiences

The position started out alright but due to not being offered any benefits, an increasingly toxic work environment as more people jumped ship, the company sliding further into the red financially and resulting pressure for employees to ""work harder"" with little direction of how or why as a result I was started to hunt around for a better position at a better company in the same field (marketing though my degree is in arch). 

I went on interview after interview as I sent out resumes all over. Some went very well other didn't.... but after 2 years nothing would come of these interviews and I'd either received a polite email stating they went with someone else or never hear back period. My friends would be able to find good jobs with a reasonable salary at decent companies with opportunities to advance but not me for some reason. Goes without saying I felt massively discouraged with my job hunt and entered a period of stopping and starting it every time a new person would leave.

I physically left the company but am working remotely for a temporary basis- as the only person in my department at half the pay which is now intern level pay. I can sense that I'm about to be laid off or let go though soon also since there was gossip that they're going to layoff people to save money after the Holidays and I got hints of this also from the top. But now my confidence has taken a hit in terms of my interviewing abilities and I barely getting any results for resumes sent out recently,for some reason I can't find a better job. I think to myself; ""This is not good is if this as good as my career gets."" 

I'm on the fence about quitting since continuing on might ruin my chances of getting a good reference or may even damage my resume since I'll get pegged into a corner for this skillset.... I'm not really sure what to do at this point beside returning to school to get a degree in something more marketable/ versatile than arch or going freelance since it seems like no better paying company is willing to hire me at this point, maybe there's something coming up in searches for someone who has my name that's preventing me being considered for an offer? I'm not sure what it is at this point but I'm about to go into panic mode since I'm going to be nearly 30 with barely any saving, no retirement savings and no health insurance which keeps me up at night to say the least.

I've hit a wall and have no idea how to get over or around it at this point. Any advice?"

3wrrzy,2,2015-12-14,Looking for advice,MrLKR,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3wrrzy/looking_for_advice/,"Hello reddit,

I'm seeking for some advice in getting interviews for job opportunities as a Jr. software engineer. As an undergrad, I double majored in Computer Science and Biology and graduated with a 3.77 GPA this May. For the majority of my undergraduate career, I pursued biology thinking I wanted to be a doctor, sparked by various events that occurred in my life. However, I also enjoyed computer science, which is why I took it on as a second major. Only until towards the end of my senior year did I decide that I would pursue software development career. I haven't had much luck getting any interviews.

A little background on my work experience:
1. I developed pipeline scripts for biological research purposes for two years as an undergrad working in a lab. This involved using Perl, SQL, bash, and R primarily. In fact, while pursuing my research work experience, I took classes like machine learning and bayesian statistics to better understand and tackle the problems.
2. I've worked for two labs. One of them lasted for the summer that I got into a research program for while the other one I worked for while I was in school. My projects involved analysis of biological data.
3. After graduation, I worked as a web developer intern to get experience outside of development for life-sciences. Although there was an offer to extend the internship, I turned it down since I did not enjoy front-end development as much and wanted a greater challenge.

It has been approximately 3 months since then. I have been looking for opportunities that I thought I would be a good fit for me and places I would be motivated to work at (big places and small places). I enjoy working with data and I feel I can apply my skill set from the research experience to help me with software engineering opportunities.

My concerns are that I do not have the tech internships recruiters or companies are looking for. I have been trying to put some code out there with github but my projects are still work in progress. I've put parts of it out. I have been trying to build some basic games with Unity. I believe that I have the ability to pass algorithm and coding interviews, but I've yet to get garner any interests with the job applications. Granted that I'm in NYC, there should be a fair amount of opportunities. Most of the people I got to know were from the life-science side of things as opposed to the computer science/tech. I'm not much of a networker either. I know there are life-science tech startups in NYC but I've yet to hear back from places that I have applied to that I found interesting and I would like do software development outside of the life-sciences for a change.

Any advice/suggestions?"
3wsk21,5,2015-12-14,Finding a life worth living (29M),aliwoli,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3wsk21/finding_a_life_worth_living_29m/,"Hi findapath,

I'm a 29 year old university drop-out. The field was Computer Science and the only part I really liked was software development aspect, which I now resent after having had several unpleasant experiences during my time at university.
I'm living in Central Europe.
I'm officially unemployed for 2 years now without any work experience expect some short intern ships where my employer always loved me and my performance. There I had to learn that I couldn't handle the work environment well and build up high amounts of stress and anxiety in relative short time.

I'm supposedly clinical depressed and autistic, as well as highly gifted.
Sadly I'm in no way motivated by money or prestige. (That does mean that money does not get me started, but being fucked over financially will surely make me stop)

The core question is (assuming I don’t ask the wrong question to begin with):

**How to find what I'm passionate about / create a life worth living?**

I tend to be good at analysing processes and finding flaws in procedures.
I tend to see stuff other overlook and provide an often valuable point of view no one else thought of.
I like to discuss and tend to take the opposite position in an argument and play Devil's advocate.

As far as I know I'm not really interested in something specific, but I like (for my lack of intuitive understanding) to read about the human condition and anything regarding the way humans interact as groups or individuals with groups and individuals and why they act the way they do.

I either work very fast and skimp over details or are lost in details and never finish.
Under stress any performance goes to almost zero.

I know I need clear predefined structures but at the same I shut down and become lethargic and more depressed when I'm confronted with repeated sameness in tasks and the lack of chances to to use my mind.
I don’t work well with customers and strict hierarchies.
I cant handle long commute to work by public transportation and cant drive myself.
 cant work more than 30-35 hours a week, unless the workplace provides its employees with certain things like lunch, because the remaining time of the week wouldn’t be enough for me to counterbalance the stress and get things done like grocery shopping or doing laundry and sleeping. 

Extensive assessment brings up that I bring an average to outstanding potential in anything but interpersonal skill and self-organization, where I under perform.
But regarding interest and what job could be feasible employment agency, jobcenter and job coaches and I are at a loss
There is a tendency that whatever it might be a university degree is probably needed, but I can't afford it and wouldn't know what field would be suitable anyway.

I would appreciate any idea someone may come up with.

I know this post will probably piss off a lot of people, so if you don't want to hear GPA whining, please leave this post now.

I'm a second-year chemE, and I didn't do so well this past semester. 3 B's and 2 C's. This brought my GPA down from a 3.47 to a 3.2. I'm feeling pretty down about my grades and school in general right now. I know this isn't the end of the world, but I'm still fairly concerned.

Could any older chemE's out there put this into perspective? How much does GPA really matter to companies? I know a lot of people say that as long as you graduate from Tech, you'll be fine, but I've seen a lot of companies with GPA cutoffs at 3.5 or 3.2. 

I already have an internship lined up this summer, so I was hoping that my GPA wouldn't matter too much."

Where should I start? I really don't want to show up day one of the internship and have to admit that I know literally nothing about cyber security. I understand that internships are learning experiences, but I'd like to have a foundation in the basics (I won't go through the cyber security class until the semester after the internship)"

Is CS1 the most ""bang for your buck"" class that I can take if I decide I want to become a programmer in the future? 

My situation:

1. I'm not a comp sci major. I've taken Intro to C, OOP and a mobile dev class. I'm planning on taking databases and CS1 at least before I graduate. Will CS1 cover enough ground to act as a solid base in order to apply it/learn in the future? I'm interested mostly in mobile development, especially in the geographic and scientific arenas (think: GIS, for those who know what that is). 

2. I want to work an internship this summer and then graduate in the fall. This is impossible to do if I finish out a comp sci minor. Most internships I'm interested in are on the other side of the country so it's not possible to take classes in the summer that are related to comp sci.

3. I'm not really a school type of person (despite almost being done with it lol)... I've figured this out and I really don't want to go beyond a bachelor's degree. So I'm looking for the most ""bang for my buck"" at this point. I sort of dread having to sit through even more classes, especially some of them which I don't feel will have much direct benefit for me. I've noticed that I like pursing side projects outside of school more than the stuff that I've worked on in class (in a range of subjects, not just comp sci). 

4. I'm not 100% sure that I want to be a programmer, but I really like computers in general. So I would like to still keep my options open. Ie. I'm guessing that I'll like any career that has anything to do with computers, programming or not

Opinions on all of this? If you want to, feel free to convince me to finish out a comp sci minor... but currently I'm leaning towards just CS1 because of the reasons I've given above."

Firstly may I apologise for yet another post about this sort of a thing, I am sure it's beginning to make some people crazy!

I'm a UK university student with a job offer in FS audit at one of the Big 4, but my ambitions have been to go into an investment-related field (applied for various asset managers and private banking with a focus on wealth management - I don't have a specific focus, but I like the idea of being a portfolio manager or eventually moving to a hedge fund because I find portfolio allocation and performance analysis quite interesting, likewise with hedge fund strategies). FS audit was my back-up because at least it was FS related, and would allow for the ACA after 3/4 years as well as some experience within the field from a back office perspective (regulation, IFRS/GAAP, some valuation, etc.)

My issue now is that, as all of my applications this year have floundered (could be because I have made crappy applications, could be that the positions are saturated and they look for internship conversions, could be a mixture of the both), I am looking at becoming an accountant. And I definitely do not want to be one as a career.

I know you can make the jump from audit to other places, and that career prospects are generally quite good (become a partner, go into industry and become an FD/CFO eventually) but that just doesn't follow the passion I have for financial markets and financial instruments. So what should I do?

My possibilities ultimately come down to:
- Take the job, do the job, try hardest after ACA (perhaps whilst completing the CFA at the same time) to move into equity research, fund accounting or the valuation team at the company with a view to eventually moving into something more investment based)
- Take the job, and still apply for grad schemes in my first few years
- Don't take the job, do a masters and then reapply

It'd be interest to hear peoples opinions on this, whether you have any experience or not. I'm also willing to answer any more questions that might flesh things out.

Thanks"

* Early 20s - 2 years experience out of school

* Internal promotion

* Big corp on the fortune list
* Currently make 50k, live in major city near office

An old manager from my internship days has approached me for an internal promotion (to the chagrin of my current IT dept). The discussions with my upper bosses were mixed but some did have great info they shared - such as earning potential of IT vs HR.

However, I see myself eventually moving south or west one day and see a senior title change as a good thing for my resume - especially since my current manager is nothing to write home about. My new manager is EXCELLENT and would advocate for my future growth. There are exciting projects on both teams in my company. There are a lot of politics that would occur to make the switch happen.

For me to switch, I feel I would need a 15k bump at least. My bosses argue that 2 more years of IT exp will open up HUGE earning potential... while I've seen first-hand people in our HR dept move up the ranks quickly.

Either way, my work would be technical. More technical in IT obviously (I do reporting, database work, etc). While HR being a little more meet-n-greet/creative in HR (delivering/loading excel data, doing agile analysis)

I've completed the interviews (and got positive reviews) and they seem like theyll be giving me details of financial compensation in the next day or so.

Honestly the TLDR would be the TITLE... any thoughts out there? Really appreciate it.

I was one of four applicants, and I would have assumed that they would have emailed me the results, either way. Now that I am waiting, and it's a day later than what they told me, I'm assuming I'm not getting the job. I am OK with that, I'm still young, but I'm just wondering if I should do. I want to do one of two things, **one, email them and ask what I can improve on in the future and why they didn't choose me.** **Or two, just tell them that I am still interested in the position.** They might just be running late, so I don't want to piss them off.

I was hoping to get some help on a very restrictive situation that I am in. So basically I am in the year between my MSc and PhD and I decided to work for an internship somewhere. I got a very strong startup offer that involves software engineering and ML but I have also inteviewed with amazon and the feedback seemed quite positive, but because they will only accept a couple of people in the specific project they did not provide me with a clear response yet and they seem to be slow. I have studied extensively software engineering, data science and Artificial Intelligence. Both companies are in an extremely popular tech area. The problem is the startup company gave me only a week to decide and then gave me a 48 hour extension, basically I have 2 days to decide between the following options:
1. Wait for amazon and automatically lose the other company's offer.
2. Choose the startup and if amazon comes positive renege the startup's offer

In the first case I will have to look for another job, I have enough funds to go on until February. But that will be cutting it real close. Even though I have another startup that wants me to work with them but they are just waiting for their funding rounds which will be done by the end of the next week. 

Also, how bad is it to renege an offer? I really don't want to take that route because they have been really nice and honest with me  and they are really good people.

So yeah that's my situation, please let me know for any advice"

(Details inside),alexh36,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/3x1smg/what_would_be_a_good_company_to_begin_my/,"Hi everybody. I'm having trouble pinpointing what exactly the title of my job would be, and if there's even a place where I could do such a thing but I figured I'd make a post to see if someone with a greater level of knowledge surrounding the subject would be able to shed some light. Here goes:

I began working in restaurants at the age of 15 and have held jobs at probably 8 different companies since (now 23). I started off cooking and had intentions of becoming a chef before deciding management may be a better career route. As a result, I started college as a hospitality major with the goal of opening up my own restaurant. Throughout my time working in restaurants, I realized that management on a single store level really wasn't for me, so I switched to operations management and marketing. Though I strayed away from a major that was directly associated with food, it has been my passion since I was a kid and I really hope to find a career surrounding it. I recently had an internship as a sales analyst for a CPG company and I thought a job with proximity to food would keep my interest, but in reality it couldn't have been more distant to what I'd like to be doing.

The job that I've envisioned in my mind is a sales/distribution job that would sell to restaurants - something akin to Sysco, but preferably working with products that are going to require a higher level of expertise and knowledge to work with. Essentially I'd rather be selling Wagyu beef to The French Laundry than strip steaks to Fridays.

There are numerous questions I have surrounding this: What type of entry level job will put me on a path to be doing something of this sort or perhaps even lead to a collection of knowledge adequate to open up my own distribution company? What are the skills necessary to succeed in a field like this and might it be better if I began in something completely different to develop a business acumen? What are some companies that I might want to look into?

I would greatly appreciate any input and if anyone has a job similar to what I've described I'd love to know your story.

3x28ng,4,2015-12-16,Choosing small SF startup versus Big Four company?,grid_zeroSolver,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x28ng/choosing_small_sf_startup_versus_big_four_company/,"So i recently got intern offers from two different companies I’d really like to work at. One is a Big Four company and the other is a small SF startup (Think Unicorns but not necessarily private still). How the heck do I evaluate these two offers? Benefits and pay are similar and I am going for an internship. 

Here are the pros and cons:

Big Company
Pros:
-Work on software the impacts billions
-Great name on resume (Big Four)
-Established intern program with great events
-Meet great connects
-Easy return offer process. (Don’t need to re-interview).

Cons:
-Make less of an impact in company as a whole
-Parts of codebase can be 20+ years old
-Potential to be put on bad project
-Not as “cool” as some hip young startup

Neutral:
-Work in C++ when most of background is in Java and higher level languages. But this could be seen as a pro because it'd raise my skill level at C++. (Currently I don't think I like C++ but i might change mind after internship).
-Don't live in SF


Small Company
Pros:
-Really believe this technology is the future
-Small culture means bigger impact and get to see more of decision making process
-Apt in SF
-A lot of cool scalability and distributed systems problems I am interested in.
-Use java and modern tech stacks.
-“Hip”

Cons:
-Idk how good the ""name brand"" is. it isn’t airbnb or uber and other unicorns/recently-ipo’d companies may not have that same reputation.
-Doesn't have long established intern program
-Small number of interns = less possible connects

Neutral:
-Already IPO’d so no big cashout, but still small and IMO has much room to grow.


Final Notes:

-At both companies I could work on scalability problems that I am really interested in, but I expect the smaller place will have more interesting and modern tech stack. I guess the smaller company would be more in line with my past internship and research.
-Not sure if I want to work at either company full time so I am really looking to maximize my job opportunities for when I graduate."
3x2osi,2,2015-12-16,Leave a guaranteed CS job in UK for a career in US?,throwthrowaway5234,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x2osi/leave_a_guaranteed_cs_job_in_uk_for_a_career_in_us/,"So a bit of context.. I'm a UK student and I've completed two internships at one of the largest IT companies in the world. I've come out with guaranteed employment once I complete my degree in the summer. I'd like to think my CV is better than average because of my internships and experiences that I've had during them, including a couple patents and publications. The department at the company that I'll be going to is not guaranteed, but there is a high chance that it could be one that I would love to work in, and essentially be doing what I love on a daily basis for a higher than average salary (£30k with the big bonus of not working in London). I've asked the company about a transfer between UK and US, but the two units are pretty much separate entities, making this kind of opportunity not possible. They would require me to apply to the US division as an external candidate.

&amp;nbsp;

My areas of interest are primarily around IoT, emerging technology, and site reliability. I preferably want to work in an area that is focused more on developing a product rather than maintaining existing corporate software. All of my interest and experience in these areas are from work experience, personal projects, and my dissertation.

&amp;nbsp;

Now for the conflict.. My girlfriend is American, currently pursuing her Master's degree here in the UK and is only allowed to stay on her current visa until a few months after she graduates unless she can get a job with a company that would sponsor her work visa. So far, she has applied to a handful of companies that are capable of doing so, but has not been successful, and the remaining options are running out quickly. A common solution that we hear all the time is ""Why not get married?"", which sounds great on paper (and to us!) for resolving these problems, but there are certain financial requirements that I must meet before she would legally be allowed to stay. One of these requirements is earning slightly above £18K (before tax) in the last year, or have over ~£60k in savings. If I were to begin my job early, say in July, I would be able to qualify for these financial requirements in about 6-8 months, depending on over time work etc. Requirements in the USA on the other hand are much easier to meet.. We can have a sponsor that can be legally responsible for me until I am financially stable, and there is a fraction of the waiting time for the visa to be processed in comparison to the UK system. Her family members are more than willing to sponsor me in the process, but my biggest concern is how successful I would be in finding a job in the States. I'm also under the impression that CS career, culture, and opportunities are much greater in the States than they are in the UK, which is a large proponent for moving, since it would benefit me throughout my career to have a larger range of opportunities and inspiration to draw from.

&amp;nbsp;

While I may have work experience, and a CS related degree (Web Development with C Programming), I have no knowledge or experience with Algorithms and Data Structures; two things that are very common to see on job requirements these days. In addition to this, my programming skills aren't amazing, but I like to think that I can pick up new things quickly, and am more than capable of learning on the job.

My programming languages are primarily:

JavaScript

AngularJS

PHP

Python

C/C++

HTML/CSS

&amp;nbsp;

To an extent, I feel as if I've got it made with my current job arrangement since I've already got my foot in the door and they don't require anything further from me other than attaining a 2:1 in my degree. My fear is that because of my shortcomings in CS, I wont be able to find a development job in a similar area, especially in a foreign country. Every day, we hear stories about university graduates that are more than qualified unable to find a job, which makes me think that it would be ridiculous to leave what I have. 

&amp;nbsp;

Having only worked in a large corporation, I don't know if I would prefer a startup or corporate environment, so I am open to both options.

&amp;nbsp;

A couple options that we've considered are:
 
For me to work these 7 months are then we can apply for her visa, having met the financial requirements. This would be a long waiting game as well; visa applications can take between 6-12 months to process, and long distance ain't fun.

Do long distance for 2 years while I complete my graduate program, and then go to the US.

&amp;nbsp;

Ultimately, my questions are:

&amp;nbsp;

Am I being stupid for leaving this guaranteed job for uncertain employment in the US?

&amp;nbsp;

Would my other qualities, skills, and experience offset my lack of CS knowledge?

&amp;nbsp;

Are CS-related jobs (i.e. SWE, SRE) in the States ""easy"" to come by?

&amp;nbsp;

What considerations should I take in to account if I choose to head over the pond?

&amp;nbsp;

Is there anything else that I haven't thought of, or is unclear?

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks!

But, they dont allow working holiday visas.

Have never went to uni or anything, but i work as a lifeguard and have saved up money to travel. I have done the summer camp thing aswell, and tbh it wasnt really my cup of tea. I also dont qualify for internships etc because i am not a student.

Any advice would be great? I hope that i have a chance of moving to america for a long amount of time traveling and working, or even staying in the one spot working."

3x40bx,5,2015-12-16,Lessons learned this year as a solo founder (x-post r/startups),StartupStroke,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3x40bx/lessons_learned_this_year_as_a_solo_founder_xpost/,"I first posted this in r/Startups but felt like it could be of help to some other wantrepreneurs/starting entrepeneurs as well. 

Most of the things I have learned in the past 3-4 years have come from others sharing their knowledge, so I’d like to see this as a small way of giving back. It is mainly focused at starting entrepeneurs or want-to-be-starting entrepeneurs, but others might get something out of it as well. 


These are some of the lessons I have learned as a solo founder so far. Honestly, it has been a heck of a ride and I can’t wait to see what will happen in 2016. By most definitions I don’t run an insane business; but the growth in customers is great and the monthly (recurring) revenue is growing month after month. 


Starting a startup or business is one thing, but doing it solo is a whole other thing. It’s covering every single aspect that you have to cover for your business. Developing your product, marketing it, collecting leads, sending cold mails, calling potential clients, thinking about finding employees, doing taxes, closing deals, administration, and a whole lot more. You can hire employees at some point, but at the start 100% of the work is yours.


**Use your close network**

But being a solo founder doesn’t mean you have to do it all by yourself. There are a lot of people around you that are willing to help. Some want to help and want to get paid in return, others don’t need to get paid at all. Family and friends will offer their help. Family will usually do it for free, friends are willing to work for a small payment. Look around at the people you know, and just tell them what you are doing. Don’t expect everybody to be extremely excited, but some will find the idea good enough to offer their help.


**Develop your product without your own limiting thoughts**

It’s a huge struggle to cover every aspect of your business. It starts out with developing a product people actually want. And there are only limited ways to find out what that product looks like. A product may look great in your eyes, but you’re not your own customer; you’re just you. 


Go out and talk to customers. Go to some Meetups and just talk to people. Ask how they’re solving the problem you want to fix right now. Then ask them for anything that they struggle with. In my market a lot of companies hire a freelancer to do what I offer but struggle giving the right instructions and information. Or they hire a new employee and pay twice as much as they would with my product. So I developed my product in a way that solves this pain. And the product is never done; it is constantly in development to create a better version.


**Should you find a co-founder?**

You are constantly on the watch for potential co-founders, but at the same time nobody seems right. And that’s a huge problem that is caused by the fact that you actually don’t know what you are looking for. You’re looking for a co-founder that is almost a twin of you, because you yourself know what it takes. But it’s important to get out of that box. 


Once you realize you actually have to look for someone with almost entirely different qualifications it gets a lot easier. Don’t find someone that already understands every aspect of your product and market. Find someone that helps you think outside of the box - because you are most-likely stuck in your own box.


**Working at a coworking space**

A co-working space is a great location to find potential clients and get help with growing your business. I hired a desk at a local startup co-working space and signed a deal the first week and had another 2 potential deals lined up. After a few months at this co-working space a student with sales experience came in. This student has had a huge influence on my sales skills, the way I did my proposition and the amount of deals I sign. With every single deal I sign today I still thank him - if I didn’t meet him I wouldn’t have signed 90% of the deals I sign today.


**If you don’t grow, your business won’t grow either**

Getting out of your comfort zone is one of the hardest parts as a solo founder. If you have multiple founders you can just tell each other to “shut the fuck up and fucking do it already”. But as a solo founder you have to tell yourself that every. single. day. From the moment you get out of bed till you go into bed exhausted at night: you just have to shut the fuck up and fucking do it already. Because if you don’t, your business will never grow.


**Set your goals and stick to them**

Dreaming about what your business can be one day is a very important aspect. Sure, the future changes every day. And it’s never going to be the way you want it to be. But it’s important to set a goal for yourself. You don’t have to remind yourself every single day; it gets boring at one point. But it is important to just take your time once every 2 weeks or once a month and see if you are still on track with your ultimate goal. 


Just take a goal that seems plausible and actually excites you. Money can be a goal, having 20 employees can be a goal, growing internationally can be a goal, X amount of customers can be a goal. Just take a goal and stick to it. It’s never going to be as fast as you want it to be. Sure, it would be great to be a millionaire in a year. But the truth is: you won’t be a millionaire in a year. You won’t have 20 employees in a year, or 10000 customers. But that doesn’t mean you can’t work your ass off to get as close to that goal as possible.


**Celebrate your wins**

Celebrating your wins is important as well. Yeah it’s easy to feel bad the whole time because you didn’t hit your target this month. But if you hit 80% of the target you mostly succeeded. Occasionally take the time to celebrate a good month. Spend some money on yourself, buy some new clothes, grab drinks with friends, do something you’ve wanted to do in a long time. Because next month you will hit that target, and you can fully reward yourself.


**If you develop yourself, you develop your business**

As a single founder your business will be as good as you are. If you snooze that alarm 20 times than you are wasting your own business hours. Self-development is the only way to develop your business. Read, and never stop reading. Don’t just read the gems that everybody keeps talking about. Once in awhile just pick up a book that isn’t necessarily 100% related to where you are now. You will always get something out of it; maybe not today but something might click in a year from now. A lot of knowledge is just stored in our brain, but when we get into a situation that’s relevant to that knowledge your brain will connect it and you will greatly learn from it.


**Create a lifestyle that suits you**

You’ll read everywhere that you need to get a healthy lifestyle. I don’t think you have to stick to this 100%. Just find a lifestyle that you like and can stick to for a long time - and actually helps you be productive. Yes, alcohol don’t fit in a healthy lifestyle, but if I don’t get to relax with a drink with friends every now and then I know I will just get bored with life. 


**Breaks are not a waste of time - they are necessary**

Breaks are the sole reason you will never get stressed too much. I remember these weeks during the first few months of my company where I would work 80-100 hours, worked every single day of the week. Then one Sunday I wanted to take a break, and I didn’t even know what to do. 


It felt like I dropped off the world and just forgot how to have fun. I called up my dad and we ended up going to the lake: and all I could talk or think about was business. I couldn’t let go off it at all. This seems like a great thing, but I felt like an addict that needed his drug (work) every single moment of the day. I felt more stressed than I ever felt, looked like I didn’t sleep for days and had zero interest in anything else but work.


**Develop non-business related skills**

You can never skip a day developing yourself. You don’t always have to develop skills that are related to your business - I actually recommend not to. Find stuff you can do on the side. For me, it’s lifting with a friend 3 times a week and taking my Sundays to study biology and history. Find stuff that motivates you during the days you don’t work. 


**Get rid of distractions**

Develop a non distractive environment for yourself too. Earlier I was talking about the co-working space. This seems like a great place, but it can be distractive at times too. People will walk up to you with questions. The guy across from you will talk to you once in awhile. Don’t expect to be productive 100% of the time. But know that coworking spaces have a lot more advantages than disadvantages.


**Find a workday routine that works for you**

You should also find the perfect way to work productively. For me it was plugging my earphones in and just listen to Spotify for hours on end. Compile a playlist with your favorite music or just select a playlist on Spotify. For a long time I listened to my own playlist that consisted of 8 albums I really liked listening to. 


Eventually I started listening to the Lounge playlist on Spotify, it has a nice beat that just let’s me work productively. I am listening to it while I am typing this as well, it helps to keep my focus and to type at a relatively quick speed. Just find some good music and focus on stuff you have to do. 


**You have to cover everything - 100% of the work**

Being a solo founder means you have to cover every little aspect of your business. And it’s a shit ton of work. Here’s a list of things that I did this morning:
Find new ways to find new leads, look for these leads, compile a list of leads, find e-mail addresses of their CEOs, craft a good cold e-mail, schedule e-mails, wait for replies, counter sales objections by e-mail, call if it seems like the right time, counter sales objections on the phone, follow up with the right info, follow up if no response, sign pilots or deals, do after sales customer care, work for clients, find the right freelancer for the job, e-mail the freelancer with info, instruct the freelancer, call the freelancer, send more instructions, conference call with the freelancer and client, wait for freelancer to deliver, check if the product is good to send to the client, get feedback from the client, instruct the freelancer, wait for the freelancer, check the product again, send to the client, make sure the client is happy with the result, call the client, send the invoice, upsell to the client. 


And that’s just prospecting, lead generation, sales and delivery. And you are constantly looking for ways to make this easier, quicker and less stressful - which you definitely should!


During the day you are constantly wondering if you need to find a co-founder, but that will take a lot of time. So maybe it’s better to hire an intern? But that takes a lot of time too. So I should just get someone to work in-house, but it’s expensive and takes time. There’s a million questions going through your head constantly. 


**Find others to help you - they’re happy to**

But do know that out of the 100 things you do during the day there have been others that have done the same. And people are very willing to give advice to you. The startup community is a fantastic community to work in. Other founders are always happy to help, and to do a quick phone call if you need advice. Sometimes they even invite you for coffee at their office to meet them. 


I’m a relatively young founder, and a lot of older founders just want to help you. Because when they were your age they also had mentors. And whatever they say or however they help you: always follow up on them. Tell them how it’s going, send them a thank you note, send them a card for Christmas. They’ve taken their time to help you succeed. Sure, not every founder will give you the insights you want at that time, but in the end every successful founder will say something that might click years later. 


Just hit them up on Linkedin, send a request and ask if they are willing to help a new founder with some advice. 20% of them will happily take their time. That’s 10-15 minutes of highly valuable time for them, when they’re not working their asses off growing their business. And they are willing to spend it with YOU. Be grateful for that.


**Your business has to make money**

Get to profitability as soon as you can too. Sure it’s easy to just dump a ton of money (note: your own money!) into your business. But your money is likely limited. Find ways to earn money with your product. If it means you have to change your product then so be it. You’re not working your ass off to find the perfect solution for people, you’re working your ass off to be able to survive right now, and to help future employees survive. 


Make money, because it keeps your company alive. Yeah Facebook and Twitter never made a shit ton of money at the beginning. But you’re likely not building the next Facebook or Twitter. Making money is important, so try to make money from the first deal you sign. It doesn’t have to be a huge profit right away, you just need to find out if you can actually make money with your product and if the demand is big enough to build a solid business out of it.


**Should I get an investment?**

Finding investment will be a struggle too. I haven’t gotten an investment, but I am constantly thinking whether I should or not. Yes, the business is profitable. But it could be so much more profitable. You would have to give up a part of the business, and you’re not the sole owner anymore. There are other people that will influence the way your company runs. And they can just shut down if you’re not profitable enough. Try to get solid ground yourself first, and then look for an investment. 


And don’t just take any investment you can. Think about who is investing in you. Sure it’s great to have 100K from an investor to grow; but if that investor is not even closely related to your market all you have is a bag of money. 


Find investors that are well known in your market. Not only will they be more likely to invest (they know the market, so they know what’s likely to succeed), but they will critique your idea if it sucks - and you can use this to create a better product. Plus if they finally do invest in you they will have the knowledge, network and money to help you to keep growing. 


**Tools will help be more productive** 

Find the right tools to make your work easier, but make sure to do everything manually first. It’s easy to look for the quickest solution, but you will only know what you really need if you do it manually first. Right now I use 8-10 different tools for lead generation and cold emailing, and another 7 for things related to my product. Some of the tools I use:

* [Yesware](https://www.yesware.com/) for e-mail templates and tracking (Switching to Toutapp soon though due to Yesware yearly billing)

* [Streak](https://www.streak.com/) (CRM for Gmail)

* [Find that Lead](https://www.findthatlead.com)  (Find email addresses with just their first and last name and domain)

* Google’s Business Apps

* [Kimono Labs](https://www.kimonolabs.com/) (Scrape specific info from web pages)


Make sure to look for alternatives for your tools every now and then. There are a ton of new alternatives coming out every month. Just check out Product Hunt every once in awhile and see if they have new tools for email tracking, new CRMs and more. Tools will significantly increase your productivity and will also help keep track of your work. Yesware helps me keep track of the open rate/response rate of different e-mail subjects. It’s a great tool to split-test your cold emailing.


**Don’t stick to your current way of working**

Always work on new ways to do your acquisition, marketing and other things. The first 4 months I highly focused on content marketing (without content promotion). This was before I heard about the 20-80 rule of content marketing: spend 20% of your time on the post and 80% on promoting it. I spent over 600 hours writing 100+ blog posts, yet I didn’t see much traffic from it. 


Because I focused on SEO in those articles I saw my traffic increase, but I could’ve gotten a lot more if I followed the 20-80 rule. Instead of content marketing I just focus on cold emailing now, as content marketing is something that will pay out later. Sure, it’s really cheap, but so is cold emailing. Re Strategize every now and then and find what works best.


**Always keep learning - find interesting sources to read**

Find some good blogs to read. You don’t have to follow every single article they publish, but when you search Google for specific information you will see a lot of the same sites pop up in that niche. When I started out in sales I found [Steli Efti’s blog](http://blog.close.io) a bunch of times. Some of his posts focus mainly on cold emails. 


I’m a huge fan of Steli Efti and his way of teaching.

**You’re going to need to do sales - even if you suck at it**


If you’re like me then sales can be a huge hassle (I didn’t have a lot of experience before). Get out of your comfort zone and just start calling people. At first it simply sucks. You might not even know what to say. This is where cold e-mailing helps. You send a bunch of emails asking a question specific to the problem you are solving. Make it a short e-mail, nobody’s going to read your 500 word cold email. Make it 2 sentences. Just write everything down and work it down to 2 sentences. It’s possible, just don’t pitch your product.


Let’s say you’re trying to sell Slack: send an email to the CEO asking what they are currently using for their communication. Just send 100s of emails (about 50-100 a day) and just watch the answers flow in. When they email you what they’re using, just pick up the phone and call them. Ask them some follow-up questions about their experience and just listen to what they’re saying. Everything they say is an argument for you to create the solution in their case. 


*Example:*
“We’re currently using a bunch of tools: e-mail, WhatsApp, some employees even use Facebook Messenger to talk to each other”. Follow-up with a question about how they keep an overview of it all. Changes are they aren’t, as they use too many tools. Then start your proposition: “We created a tool that has the perfect overview for your team. Employees can send private messages, but you can also create channels for certain projects.”


**An email signature will increase your conversion rate when cold emailing**

I have an e-mail signature with a small picture of my face, my phone number, and a link to my website. I created the signature with [WiseStamp](https://wisestamp.com) and it’s automatically added to any e-mail I send. When I send a cold email the biggest USP of my product is always clear in sight. Use something like “Slack - we make internal communication easier”. Most people will click on it and go to your landing page. If you use a short e-mail like I do (2 sentences) everybody will see that signature. Because there’s a picture added it looks a lot more trustworthy (although some people will block images from their e-mail client). 


**Don’t sell your product, sell the solution**

Cold e-mailing/calling isn’t about selling at first. You don’t know how to sell your product until you know what the pain points are in your potential customers business/life. You can only create a clear proposition if you know what they’re doing right now. Plus they’re much more open to a product when you describe it as a perfect solution. 


**It’ll be more satisfying than anything else**

Being a solo founder is a lot of work, but it’s a lot of fun too. Sure, the stress can wear you out. It can be a drag going into work every day, to send those e-mails, to make those calls. But if you’re not doing it then nothing will happen. If you want to create a successful business you have to get out of your seat and just work hard. 


It’ll be a struggle to create a new product, platform or service, and then growing it into a big business. But if it was easy somebody else would’ve done it already. You’re not in this game to have an easy life; you’re in it to work hard, to work your ass off every single day for minimal payment at first, so you can create a great company that you can be proud of for 5, 10 or 20 years, or even the rest of your life.


**Thanks r/Startups!**

Would love to hear about the experiences of other solo founders, and others. R/Startups has been a great resource of information for me in the last few months, so let me know if you got anything out of this."
3x4l0c,116,2015-12-16,Memory issues on Layer 8,KeeperOfTheLAN,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3x4l0c/memory_issues_on_layer_8/,"Monday, first hour, I was still half asleep from the nap I took on my undecently long commute, nonetheless I decided after a nice weekend that I would face this week with enthusiasm. It didn't last long. I sat in front of the computer, as usual $Boss had already turned it on and logged in long before I got there, so i can start swimming through the sea of tickets, there it was, THAT ticket.

It was at least the eighth time we got it. The title just read: ""Slow"". Whenever we get a ticket with that title we know who is it from, and the copypasted description it will have, without even opening it. As usual, the ticket was sent on friday just after I left for home.

&gt;**$Ticket**=""General slowness of the computer when opening Word documents, PDF, Excel, Etc..."";

I didn't took any notes from the ticket, I just went to $User's office, without even bringing my set of screwdrivers or even a pen, I knew what I was going to face and what was the outcome going to be. I've been there so many times during the short period I've been working here that there's no need to act too formal with him, conversation goes as follows:

&gt;**$KoTL**: Hi $User, I'm here again, sorry for not  coming on Friday, I was already away. Same problem as usual?

&gt;**$User**: Hi $KoTL, yes, both computers are going terribly slow, this has been going on for too long, can you really not fix it? I can't work like that. _/\*Note that the user needs to use a piece of software that has not been updated in years, so when he received a new computer he got to keep the old one, as this software does not work on anything newer than Windows XP\*/_

&gt;**$KoTL**: I've checked it many times and I can't do much else, I'm just an intern. But I'll check it out.

&gt;**$User**: Yes, please.

Computers themselves were working really good, even the old one, but yet I fired the usual tests and fixes on both, knowing that they won't do anything, just so $User sees I'm working on it. Memtest, CCleaner to clear temporary files and check the registry, check if the drive is fragmented. Everything is fine, just under 100 MB of temp files on both computers combined, no problems.

We (as in the $OtherIntern, $Boss and I) have run tests on both computers and we have determined long ago that the problem lies within the network. Said slowness is due to him saving and reading all of his documents from a server. Even small files take ages to load, and even though we explained it to him every single time it seems like he refuses to understand. We have tried every solution we could try. Replaced ethernet cables both at his office and at the networking closet, changed switch port, replaced ethernet splitters at both ends(yeah, I know, not the best solution, but I can't do anything with that), replaced the splitter by a basic switch, and tried every possible NIC configuration. All to no avail.

I ran a speedtest, Ping was 4 ms, download speed was horribly slow but upload got almost to max speed.  I saved the results, and took some screenshots of his PC copying from/to the server so the ones in charge of it see that there is actually a problem with the downlink. It's most likely caused by a faulty cable between the outlet and the networking closet, nothing we can fix, that's $MaintenanceCompany's domain.

I explained the issue like $User was 5 for the $Deity knows how many time. I even stressed several times that his computers are perfectly fine, that it's a networking problem, and every time he asks me to fix it (you know the drill: ""You're IT, you have to fix everything""). After several simplifications of the explanation he seemed understanding.

&gt;**$User**: So, $KoTL, you can't fix it, what do we do now?

&gt;**$KoTL**: Don't worry, I'll forward the ticket to the corresponding person and send them the screenshots to show them there is actually a problem that must be fixed by them, not us.

&gt;**$User**: Thank you so much, would you do that for me?

&gt;**$KoTL**: _/\*Heading away\*/_ Yes, I'll do it right away, see you!

I checked the status of all his previous tickets about this issue. They were either lingering for a long time without nobody paying any attention to them, closed by someone at $MaintenanceCompany without explanation (or even assigning a responsible person), or closed by some higher-up for being a duplicate ticket. I forwarded the ticket explaining everything with detail and including the screenshots, and as it was already break time I went with $Boss and $OtherIntern to grab a bite.

Not a great start for the week, but just a minor nuance, I still felt enthusiastic about the week.

Back from the break I sat in front of the screen, and suddenly everything went dark, thunderbolt and lightning filled my world, $Workplace now felt like Mordor and all enthusiasm died in painful agony, as the wish for a higher being coming to destroy humanity grew.

New ticket, 5 minutes ago, title: ""Slow"""

3x4x98,0,2015-12-16,I graduated from a top school with great grades &amp; why I regret it,isoX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x4x98/i_graduated_from_a_top_school_with_great_grades/,"I graduated 2 years ago from a well known university with a 4.0 GPA. Since then, I've worked at 2 tech companies where I took home 6 figure salaries. Sounds great, right? Here's the catch: my CS education has been absolutely useless in my career.




I worked my ass off and wasted 4 entire years of my life in order to learn a boatload of theoretical garbage that I've not used once in my career as a software engineer in Silicon Valley. Even worse, I PAID ~$150K to be tortured with this experience.




I started a company in my last year of college and grew our revenues to a modest ~5K/month. Not too impressive, but I learned more from this experience than I did from every lecture and homework assignment combined. What did my college education give me? The ability to pass ridiculous technical interview questions. That's it. I learned how to be an actual software engineer by building a functional product. I learned how engineering teams function by creating an engineering team. I learned how the software industry works by becoming part of it.




Why do tech companies require college degrees? Going through university is the most common path to success, so why not just do naive pattern matching and only look for resumes with top schools? Companies greatly prefer false negatives to false positives. One bad hire is much worse than rejecting 100 geniuses. This strategy is great for business but horrible for us.




I propose a better solution: instead of taking massive loans and wasting 4 years being miserable while studying for exams... Learn software engineering on your own and spend 4 years on projects you care about. There are online lectures, in person boot camps, and so much more. Do you really want to make trivial school projects? Learning programming is orders of magnitude more fun when you're creating something you truly want to exist in the world. A better use of college loans? Start a company and change the world. And if you fail... your experience will still be more impressive on your resume than any typical college grad with a few internships. Work won't feel like ""work"" if you're doing something you love.




Obviously this path isn't for everyone. However, if you're sufficiently determined, your time, money, and energy can be allocated much more efficiently than 4 years of taking stressful exams.




I regret going to college. An entire ~5% of my life was spent being miserable and learning things I'll never need to know (and if I did, could learn online). Life is short; make the most of your limited time."

3x5hxi,2,2015-12-16,What could have been,EntitledAsian,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/3x5hxi/what_could_have_been/,"I need to get this off my chest. This is also a warning to others. If nothing else, I am a warning.

I have been working in a Fortune 100 company for several years. My work schedule is 40 hours a week or less, so there is absolutely no problem with work-life balance.

What's the problem, I should be happy right? No, I'm not enjoying this career at all. I make enough money off of my investments to pay off my living expenses, yet it would be a bad choice to simply quit the job because it means giving up my largest income stream. I have some hobbies which can potentially give me supplemental income, but it is not as effort-efficient as my main job, so I left them as just that -- hobbies.

I could always change careers. Currently I'm in tech, but I would like to enter the field of finance. But that means I would have to start from the bottom, and potentially set me back several more years. How did I end up in tech? Growing up, I didn't have thoughts of my own, and I ended up doing a Computer Science degree because it was the only one (out of Doctor, Lawyer, etc.) which I didn't dislike. I was motivated by what I didn't dislike, not what I was passionate about. As for what I'm passionate about, it's too late to pursue it. Please don't make up some lie about it never being too late.

I'm addicted to money. Money is my muse. My true calling in life is to make tons of money for myself, or for others. This means an investment bank, hedge fund, market making, portfolio management. The thing about having these as careers is, you need to slowly build up your base of trust. People usually start right out of university, or even before they graduate, in a Big 4 internship. I would start from square one at the ripe old age of 27.

There's nothing wrong with being behind the curve by a few years. No, there's absolutely nothing wrong. Colonel Sanders started his business in his sixties. Janacek composed Jenufa at the age of 50. George W. Bush married at the age of 31. But it's the attitude instilled in me throughout my entire childhood, directly or indirectly, that haunts me forever. I'm behind the curve, late, tardy. Retarded.

You might say I'm overreacting. That's why my username is ""Entitled"" -- I am entitled. The fact is, I have God-given talent. Not quite a child prodigy, but well ahead of the curve. In the Parable of the Talents, I would have been the servant who received the greatest number of talents. But all this was squandered. In my imagination I plot out paths which I could have taken, as outlandish as they may be but still plausible given my talent. High-flying investment banker, making seven figures annually. World-famous composer of music, clients clamoring for me to lend my voice to their project. Particle physicist, studying the next mystery of the universe. All these paths would have required a lot of hard work and focus on a specific direction. I did not have a specific direction. To reiterate, a lack of direction was my direction, and negative reinforcement was my reinforcement.

And where were my parents in all of this? Instead of focusing my direction, they sat back and let my talent work for them. On autopilot. I acquired grades. Stayed in the good graces of teachers. Received awards. Absorbed whatever lessons were thrown at me outside of school. The pattern is clear: everything I did was passive. I did not work for good grades. I did not seek out fruitful relationships with teachers. I did not chase awards. I did not desire to better myself with lessons.

Through the anti-pattern of Asian parenting, my parents had produced a lazy scoundrel. What could have been was squandered. Flushed down the toilet. Doors slammed shut and boarded over, candles snuffed out, pearls thrown before swine. Fuck all.

Yet all of this doesn't have to end badly. Though I failed, I failed in the Asian sense. I failed into a six-figure career, which is beyond the wildest dreams of many people. Every day I try my best to not be lazy. To improve the littlest scrap of thing in my life. I should be happy. But I'm not. I want more, because I could have been much more. If only I were raised right. I'm haunted by all of this. I'm entitled."

I am sick of the constant customer service and I want to actually make stuff, not only fix it. I loved the few programming classes that I took in college, but I went into the IT support route because initially, I had some connections in that field. 

Some background info:

- BS in Information Technology, where I took a few programming classes in C, so I have fundamentals of programming, but not a full-fledged CS degree level.
- Some experience making basic websites with html/css
- Some graphic design experience

I want to focus on back-end PHP/MySql, largely because in my area of the country, those are where most of the jobs are, and also because PHP isn't that. 

I am thinking of starting with wordpress and trying to reach out to some non-profits that want a fully functioning site. Good plan, or would some other programming projects be a better idea?

I am willing to start back at the entry-level again. I would look for an internship, but I don't think too many people would take a 30 year old person who already graduated college on. My current company may be willing to transfer me internally, but they may not.

How would you break in if you were me?

Any thoughts on this really appreciated."

I told my boss and she had the idea I could do my internship in a close department with premed students. I was excited about it.  I had a meeting with the people who would be supervising me and it seemed like I may not be able to do what I want and may not get all the contact hours I need.

So I suggested to them maybe I can split the internship up and do half at the hospital and have at the other place. The two supervisors independently met with my boss and told her they were dissapointed and that they really wanted me to intern.

My boss told me this and offered to set up an informal meeting with everyone. I was swayded again and told them I'll see if the hospital will let me split it up.

The hospital will not let me and I'd have to do it both semesters there. I feel like I would learn more at the hospital than the other place...and at this point would probably just take the other place to people please.

I feel really guilty for possibly leading on my coworkers, being wishy washy and feel like I wasted their time. I am just really easily swayed and influenced but when I thought about it at home decided the hospital will be best. Don't know how to break it to them.

* got phone interviews at google facebook twitter amazon, failed them all
* got on campus interview with microsoft, passed it, went onsite this past week and i definitely could have done better technically but i feel that i clicked really well with the interviewers and went through the coding questions the best i could by continuously voicing my thoughts and asking a bunch of questions before i tackled the question on the board
* finished fall 2015 semester, grades aren't too good (think im like at a 3.5 this semester)
* worked on a side project all this semester so i have that under my belt

so now that im stressfully waiting to hear back from microsoft and final exams have just finished... i don't know what to do anymore. before i went off to my interview and before my final exams i was always working, averaged like 5-6 hours of sleep a night (even on weekends lol), and now all of a sudden my obligations are all ""completed""

given that winter break is starting, i know im supposed to really use this time to get ahead of class work next semester or even make a dank project with code (which im thinking about, but idk what to make), but i feel so burnt out right now.

so what should i do to slowly work back up to speed? i also want to apply for more jobs in case microsoft doesnt work out, preferably to some startups in the bay area/LA. anyone have any tips on how to go about finding startups that are hiring interns that actually accept people from schools that aren't UCB/UCLA/stanford in those areas?

anyway, thanks for reading all this, this is kind of a rant and ramble but this is what life's been like for the past 3-4 weeks lol

TLDR: finished finals, finished interviews, don't know what to do now. what do i do over winter break as a CS student? how can i apply for more internships preferably in the bay area/LA at startups? what's a hot tech that i should learn over winter break? what do you guys do to deal with this burn out?

Just completed a Masters in the fall, but unfortunately, things have fallen apart completely after my graduation. I'm hanging on by a thread at this point, but my mental state is starting to rot even that thread. I do get work sometimes, but it's intermittent, changes from day to day, and doesn't cover enough for me financially. I do have some savings, but I can't depend on them for much longer. I have no structure in most of my days, and any schedules that I have aren't in sync with most of the people I know, so it also isolates me socially.

&amp;nbsp;

Although I have had symptoms of severe anxiety and depression for many years, I had only recently been treating it directly. I have seen a CBT specialist over the past few months, when it became clear my symptoms were interfering with job hunting and school applications. While the sessions were helpful initially, recent sessions have been far less helpful. I'm not armed with the tools that I need to make my life functional again. Or rather, I am armed with some tools. It's just that the tools make no sense. Yes, I know that I need to change my own self-perception. Yes, I know that I need to start humanizing other people. No, I can't say exactly how I'm supposed to do that. And no, these tools are not going to help me eat. Have you tried digging a hole using an abstract philosophical concept? Or tried to cook dinner using nothing but a pillowcase? Let me tell you, it is really hard.

Anyway, basic backstory. My upbringing was not the greatest and a little abusive from one parent, but I somehow managed for the first 18 years. My undergrad and masters was in the humanities. I did not do an internship in school, because 1) my undergrad did not offer or emphasize them, 2) I focused on studying instead of forging business connections, 3) I did not get the few internships I did apply to, and 4) my plans after undergrad were a little different. I wanted - and still want - to become a scholar and pursue my discipline to its limit, but experiences over the last year has made me question this goal. So while I do have a skillset built up over the past few years, I have no easy in with any industry, let alone the kit I would need to be competitive. I don't want to go further in education unless I know that I can get something stable after it is done, and fuck this I have no idea what I'm even doing anymore.

&amp;nbsp;

I also realized over the past few years, I had also been making friends with and dating the wrong people. As a very shy person when I was younger, my friend selection was somewhat eclectic. The people I knew were interesting and made time for me in school settings, but never for anything else when I would try to initiate. The few that I've kept since undergrad have largely cut me off, even the few that I kept on writing to. Making the wrong friends isn't new for me. I believed the whole nonsense about people being friends for their lives and always looking out for each other - reality is not the same. Generally, I've been hurt much more by people I've made friends with than helped. Making new friends is a chore, partly because I never know how they're going to act at any given time, and partly because for the majority of them, I have to put in *all* of the work and they don't even get back to me when I do.

&amp;nbsp;

I dated women along these lines, too. They were women who didn't love me for who I was, but rather for the attention I gave them. Many times I felt that, despite being told many times that they loved me for my own self, that I was always being traded up for a newer, superior model. Many of the women I dated were a little older, cynical and offbeat, which made for fun conversation, which I wrongly interpreted as being the only good ingredient of a solid relationship. I've been single for quite some time as a result, and it gets to me. Like many people I know found their perfect partners at some ridiculously young age and it's implied that I'm somehow less of a man because I didn't grow alongside someone else.

&amp;nbsp;

The worst part is that there were other friends and other women clearly interested in me who would have been much better for me psychologically, but I ignored them because, with the pattern of people that I knew, I didn't believe their behaviour was genuine. Why are you acting so nice to me? What do you want? You cannot possibly be treating me that well for *no reason at all,* right?

&amp;nbsp;

Everyone around me tells me that I'm still young and still have plenty of time to change the direction that my life is going. I know this. I want to believe this. Even though I know this personally, I can't help but feel that it's too late for me to make a recovery - too late to find work through school again and too late to make friends with people around my age. I'd now be about 4-5 years behind where I should have been, and I feel that my peers and employers would not look at that sympathetically. Older people in general tend to assure me, but younger people do not. Instead, we say to each other, *""If you didn't do X, Y and Z before this age, you're totally fucked and should give up now.""*

&amp;nbsp;

Isn't that a horrible thing to say? That instead of taking life as it comes, that you're screwed up forever because you were supposed to do all of these things that you never knew about at the time? I know that there is still time for me, but each day I become less sure of it. It's a horrible feeling - knowing that a lot of what you're thinking *is* irrational and yet you are still helpless to stop yourself from believing in it anyway. I want to believe that things will get better as I get older, but will they truly be better, or will the goalposts have moved? *""Hey, not put together by 30? Try waiting til your 40s. By then you'll really be happy.""* And so on.

&amp;nbsp;

I have two previous suicide attempts under my belt, one at 11 and one at around 17. I crawled back from both of them. I'm afraid of death. I don't want to die unless I have absolutely no choice but to. But that point seems to get closer every day. Thoughts about what sort of method I should use crop up very frequently, and I'm worried.

&amp;nbsp;

I've barely started my life and yet I am exhausted already. If I get to the place where I need to try it again a third time, I don't even want to think about it. Just get it done before any second thoughts stop me."
3x702p,1,2015-12-17,Should I tell a company that I would accept an offer from them? [Internship],internship_hunting,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x702p/should_i_tell_a_company_that_i_would_accept_an/,"I have an interview in about 12 hours with a competitive, yet fairly small, (about 150 employees) silicon valley company for a summer internship.  They're my top choice of the couple of companies I'm currently interviewing with, and if they give me a reasonable offer, I'm going to accept.  They are aware that I'm in final round interviews with other companies, but they don't know who, or how many.  Should I mention that I would take an offer from them at the end of the interview, or would I just be putting myself in a compromising position?

I want to ensure that they know I'm serious about working there, and that they aren't just my ""back-up,"" or something, but I'm not sure of the smartest way to convey my attitude.  Can anyone help me come up with a good way to tactfully convey that I will accept an offer, or should I just not mention it at all?"

Small anecdotes and advice would help me INCREDIBLY, so thank you.

Currently a sophomore Ag Engineering student. Discovered my innate love for programming and software last semester and really it's all I think about. I've already done a ton of side projects (ruby, c++, Unity3D C#, more java stuff) alongside CS125, and I'm taking 173 and 225 next semester. Further courses also interest me like 431/233/241, but taking these courses is about to seriously take its toll on my graduation date. I still have a ton of biology coursework to complete for my degree in Ag Engineering (ugh).

I plan on visiting the spring ECS career fair to (very hopefully) get an internship involved with software and programming. I was hoping if I could get an honest answer from someone more experienced. Here's the issue: I did not-so-well in my past calculus and physics courses here. I came in with very little experience and jumped straight in without many prior strong study skills. The early theory really took its toll (I learned it well, just not in time for exams). So transferring isn't an option apparently with my 3.1. I wish there was a way to convey my passion to get a spot, but I understand their hands are tied in CS.  

I have two options. Continue in AgEngineering with Renewable Energy Systems and pursue a minor in CS here at UIUC with all the available resources of a top-5 CS/engineering school... or transfer. I have NO idea where I would go with a 3.1 (it would obviously be a down-grade), or if the major compared to the minor is something to even worry about (I know you can get an internship with basic data structures/algorithms/problem analysis). I really wish I knew more, and that's what I wanted to ask of you. If you know anything relevant, seriously anything, please comment.

Thank you again in advance. Have a great break!"
3x74pc,2,2015-12-17,Not sure what to do with this job offer,Gezorko,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3x74pc/not_sure_what_to_do_with_this_job_offer/,"Hello everyone, have a bit of a conflic here.

I am a 20 year old student, currently in my last year of studying Interactive Webdevelopment, after this I will study for another 4 years in order to try to get a job as a Art Director.

I am finishing up my internship, where I live it is required that during your education you complete a full time internship that lasts at least 90 days.

During this internship I have learned alot, I have worked my ass of and really made some great contributions to this company, so much so that I have been offered a part time job next to my studies.

The problem is that I also work as a webdeveloper on my own, I make websites for people and it pays really well.

For a couple of hours of work I could easily net 400-500 euro's if I manage to get a customer, I have a customer every other month but I don't depend on this income to be able to live - I live with my parents and they pay for my study aswell, other than this I save up my money and don't need a steady base of income in order to live. 

This job would pay pretty good, but I feel like if I put more effort towards getting customers for websites on my own I could make so much more money with all the things I have learned.

So I am faced with 2 choices here, either take this job and maybe not get paid much, spend alot of time working but have a steady income.

Or turn down the job, and put effort into finding customers, not always getting money but when I do its so much more effortless, and will help me do a bit of networking along the way.

I am not expecting to be paid a whole lot of money/hour at this possible job, I will probably make slightly more than the minimum wage for a 20 year old... which is about 10 euros an hour.. in comparison to earning 100 euros an hour while doing things as a freelancer for customers.

I could make more hours at this new job though - but with my studies on the side im not sure if I have that time."

I wanted to ask for some tips on being able to get a residency visa to live in Portugal and eventually become a EU citizen after.


Here's my background. I am a US Citizen who is going to graduate from school with a Bachelor of Science in Finance. I have a ton of Finance internship experience, so if my plan fails, I can always come back home and work a decent job. 

**My plan**

I plan to go to Portugal from June to August this summer. I am going to live in an AirBNB apartment for the entire time and plan on taking $3,000 of living money. I know it might sound like a little, but I want to get use to living on a small budget. (Travel and Apartment will be paid) I have a couple of friends over there who I am quite close to, if that helps with legal issues. Hopefully, I can get a call center job there, but I would need a work permit, which I am also confused about (do they apply for it for me or do I apply for it?) 


So, this is where I need help. What do I need to do now, in order to ensure that everything is good when I go over there. Do I need to apply for a visa here in the United States, and then go fill out other forms in Portugal? I live in Chicago, so there is no embassy of Portugal here. Also, what do I need to do when I am in Portugal for those 2 months? 


Any thing would help a ton. 

Thanks,

Questions|Answers

[What is Abrams like as a director from what you can tell? Where does his focus lie when making changes to a shot, scene, performance?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy25wvy?context=5)|What is Abrams like?  By far and away the most inspiring person I have met in the film industry. There were times when he would just stop us all and say ""Guys... We're making Star Wars"". In terms of style though, we could certainly tell that his focus was energy. A potentially dull dialogue scene was transformed by his choice of shot and his constant optimism. Performance wise, he had the patience of a saint. I remember a particular scene where one actor just wasn't giving him what he wanted. I have seen directors get furious very quickly over this, but Abrams just smiled all the way through. Totally knows how to get the best out of actors.
[How long were you on set?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy25wvy?context=5)|How long was I on set?
[Wow, sounds like Abrams is a pretty stand up guy. I'm sure he did a great job.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy28a1d?context=5)|Whole heartedly agree.
[What was the production and the crew like? What was J.J. Abrams' process like? Did he talk to actors privately or did he do it another way? Were there alot of suits from Disney checking up on things?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26y70?context=5)|JJ has an amazing relationship with an assistant director called Tommy Gormley. He deserves huge credit. He has this piercing Scottish voice, and is the man who got shit done. He was very funny, but my god you wanted to please him. He was the one who talked over the ""God Mic"" whilst JJ would go and quietly talk to the cast. Not in a ""whisper so no one can hear us"" way. He was happy for everyone to hear!
 |The production crew had similar feelings to the extras I think. They just really wanted to make a good movie, and as a result everything seemed to work like clockwork. There was one particular day that was hell (the rally scene) but we all came out smiling in the end! Certain things have to be done on film sets no matter how painful and time consuming to get the finished article right. 
[Have you met/spoken to any of the main cast?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy264o6?context=5)|I had breakfast with Anthony Daniels on one of my first days there. I had no idea who he was! But he sat and had breakfast with me. Really down to earth guy and seems to love talking to the extras. He would ask us all what we do for a living and really try to get to know us.
 |I had minor interaction with the other cast members (smiles/nods etc) but they were all too iconic and intimidating for me! Plus, they're working... As an actor myself, that feels like walking into the CEO's office without an appointment.  
[Did you feel a bit nervours while on set at all? Since it being a really big movie and all that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26fy8?context=5)|Absolutely. The first few takes my heart was pounding. After all, extras work is such a mind fuck for an actor. You're so close to where you want to be and yet so far from getting there.
 |We were definitely aware we were making cinema history. That was where the nerves came from. There was absolutely no fear of a tyrannical AD or DoP or anything of that nature. We were constantly referred to as ""Star Wars Family"" and the fear was simply letting ourselves down in the context of the biggest film of all time. Hopefully we delivered!
[Hello Torin! I work for FakingStarWars.net a parody news site. Can you tell us about some funny things that happened on the set? Thanks! -JJsCat.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy262ao?context=5)|Hi JJsCat. Sure! One of my favourite things was just JJ one day saying ""Okay everyone uh... Remember... It's energy energy energy. That's the most important thing. Always. 100% energy!""
 |We all looked around at each other taking in his enthusiasm, and they he just swivelled on the spot, pointed a finger at us, and said ""But NEVER... Let energy overcome quality.""
 |Also the time a fellow extra loudly farted in a massive set in the far background. The guys around the main action couldn't hear, but we we're in fits trying to walk normally!
[Are you trying to pull an Alexander Rhodes here and get top billing? I sure hope you are. And I sure hope it works.  Edit: The Jack Reacher extra from a couple years back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy276ps?context=5)|In all my heart, I want nothing more than to be an actor. It's just about taking this kind of work with a pinch of salt. As fun as it is, it isn't acting. I see it like a paid internship in the film industry - you can learn a great deal about what it's like on set, but you have to treat it like any other job you use to fund acting. It isn't your route to Hollywood but by god you can make the money do some work by paying for classes/head shots/showreels etc. 
[How big of a star wars fan are you? Have you been into it your whole life, making this some sort of a dream come true for you, or was it just something that kinda just happened?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy2645u?context=5)|I was just the right age to catch Episode I when it came out. This was my experience of Star Wars...
 |Haha. I could lie and tell you I'm a lifelong fan, but in reality I'm more just aware of the films in a pop-culture sort of way. I like them, don't get me wrong! But I'm not a superfan.
 |Having said that, when I was told what it was, I did shriek like a little girl.
[Haha. That's the only sensible reaction, in my opinion. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26byj?context=5)|Funnily enough, I was doing my dissertation in the University of Birmingham Library when I found out.
 |I tried to carry on writing, I really did. 
[Did you feel like you were really in the starwars universe and not just an extra?  How engrossing were the sets?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26mno?context=5)|Yes. The first day I walked onto the set was breathtaking. Nothing can prepare you for how real these sets are. They had a team from bioFX who were grating moss flown in from forests in Belgium for the floor. As far as I was concerned, I was there. Huge amount of effort, a lot of which will go un celebrated! So here's to those guys! 
[*They had a team from bioFX who were grating moss flown in from forests in Belgium for the floor.*  To think, how much money, effort, and time goes into every process that involves that mossy floor, for probably only a few minutes of screen-time that isn't even the object you're focused on...](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278sq?context=5)|Utterly amazing.
[Why are you walking so oddly?!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26mry?context=5)|Caught off guard... I had been talking to John Boyega about Identity School of Acting just before the take. They wanted me to overtake that group of soldiers walking past but each take they got closer and closer. What you don't see in that shot is me falling into them and them going over like dominoes. 
[Please tell me the domino take made the final cut!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27knr?context=5)|Haha! We looked clumsy almost every take! Didn't realise we were out of frame though so tried to style it out...
[Did you at any point think ""This is too much of an ANH remake, Abrams is not risking enough and instead making it too safe of a movie""? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26djh?context=5)|No. I don't for one moment think Abrams was playing it safe. Certainly, as a Star Wars fan himself, he was looking to emulate the lure of the original films. He was meticulous. However, at the end of the day there is that famous literary saying that all great stories can be boiled down into The Seven Basic Plots. Maybe he just came in one early... ;). 
[Are you aware of any, what could be considered, really good spoilers or key plot points? Obviously not asking for you to share them, but do you have that knowledge that others would have loved to know the past year or so?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278ie?context=5)|Bear in mind I wasn't even officially allowed to tell my parents what I was doing. I have been sitting tearing my hair out watching all the leaks! I knew some major spoilers.
[If so, has it been tearing you up inside not to tell anyone?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy278ie?context=5)|As tempting as it was to share them, JJ's insistence on ""Star Wars Family"" meant I didn't WANT to share them. I wanted (and still do!) people to enjoy the film spoiler free! 
[Did you play in any cool roles? Example- Rebel soldier, some civilian or a stormtrooper?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27ndc?context=5)|All of the above. I joked that the waistcoat character seen in the trailer is actually way out of his depth. I was one of the only ones in that costume on set and wasn't allowed a gun. As far as I was concerned I was an intern doing Alliance admin...
[Can you tell us what extra you played and how much screen time you had?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy268wl?context=5)|Well, I played the extra you can see in the trailer and some other masked roles. I'm afraid I can't tell you how much screen time I had as I haven't seen the movie yet! But I can guarantee it probably all boils down to less than a second or two. Haha! 
[Were the assistants treated humanely on set? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27gt0?context=5)|As far as I was aware. Obviously it's a hugely stressful environment. I'm sure some people got snapped at! But I know for example that Carrie Fisher's assistants absolutely loved her. She is totally charming.
[Besides your fellow actors how much in your scene was real i.e. not CGI?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy289ad?context=5)|They were so keen on keeping everything real. As I haven't seen the movie it's difficult for me to say... However, what I would say is that I felt like I was there. As far as was humanly possible, CGI was used rarely. 
[What were your qualities that landed you the role?  Height/weight/hair/eyes etc.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26hst?context=5)|5'11"", around 12 stone, long hair (so they can do what they'd like with it) and eyes didn't really come into it... Honestly though, the real secret was being easy to work with and eager to please, as in any job!
[You worried about getting in trouble with disney for doing this AMA?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy27wv7?context=5)|Yes and no. They're obviously scary. However, now that the movie is out, there are people sharing their involvement on all kinds of social media.
 |If they want to get in contact I would be the first to bow to their demands. I have loved working on this film and wouldn't want anyone to have a sour taste! (RIP OP)
[Did you like the movie ?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy26055?context=5)|I haven't seen it yet! Can you believe it?! Haha. Booked in for tomorrow.
 |Having seen the amount of work that went into it, I can't imagine I wouldn't like it. 
[You're playing a dangerous game, OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3x7i5z/iama_extra_in_star_wars_the_force_awakens_ama/cy271ix?context=5)|Oh...? In what sense?

3x80b4,18,2015-12-17,I want to live a simple life but i feel trapped and uncomfortable with it.,hg1984,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/3x80b4/i_want_to_live_a_simple_life_but_i_feel_trapped/,"Background: I am a 22 year old, male, college business major from Texas. I have a great family, and we are fortunate enough to be financially well off (as in my parents paid for my college in full). Sorry for my rambling, i will tldr.

I have (in the last couple of years) developed pretty severe depression/anxiety/ and stress to the point where i am meeting with a mental health professional. I believe i have developed these in large part because of lack of interest in most of the ""business"" jobs I look into or try. Example: I spent all last summer 50 hours a week on Quickbooks in a cubicle. Sound fun? Well it wasn't. Anyway, I want nothing more than to just finish out my degree (I only have about a year and a half left) and move some where simple where i can get a nice part time job (or something equally as easy) and live in a small apartment or house and live a nice, simple, stress free life. The kinda places you see on r/earthporn I enjoy hiking and biking and kayaking because they clear my head and release stress. That sounds so.. romantic to me. I have this idea in my head that all this corporate bull shit, where everyone screws every one else around, and I am constantly being bombarded with ads telling me what i need and why i'm not good enough. ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."" -Tyler Durden

But here is my dilemma (Part 1 of 2):  
I grew up pretty well off, along with my friends who were in similar financial situations (and by we I mean our parents). So I went off to college and chose business as my major, thinking this was the path I was always meant to go down, along with my friends. Now, I am addicted. I see the new Mac laptops with the force touch track pads and the bigger better faster rotating anal bead 5000, and I want it. I NEED it. I am the exact brain washed consumer zombie that whoever is in charge wanted me to be. And I hate it. I don't like business, its stressful and I don't really want to waste my life in an office building moving around money for some CEO for the next 50 years just so i can afford an inflatable hot tub in every room of my house.

Dilemma (Part 2): I am terrified of failing or deviating from my current path. As much as i want to just take my degree and lack of debt and move to a nice small town near a nice river and get a dog. I just have this sick feeling that I will regret it. My dad doesn't necessarily love his job, but he motherfucking provides for us. Put me and my sister through school, Health care, even took my mom to Greece this year. He's the greatest dude I know. Now, he isn't pressuring me to become him or anything like that. I am pressuring my self basically. What if i move next to my river and meet a nice girl and knock her up? Now I have a kid and wife and a part time job.. And I will not, I cannot let them down, I will provide for my (hypothetical) family. But assuming i am living next to my hypothetical river, I probably have minimal work experience in the corporate world, and I am starting at the bottom level probably. I just can feel the pain of being a 35 year old intern, trying to make that paper for my family, and if i failed I know it would kill me to watch my hypothetical family go into debt because my 22 year old self didn't want put in the effort. I am also worried that because of my depression/anxiety, I will move to my river and never speak to anyone and become a recluse, which i don't want either. 

Now I know that my business degree doesn't force me to go into business. I could look into other fields, but I haven't really found any of those that interest me either. I like history, art history type stuff and traveling, but thats more because they always just felt like stories to me. Plus, once you start getting into actual historical stuff, I get bored with all the dates and political crap. 
Also, I know that i could look into National Parks, or Museums and maybe be able to provide for a family and not have a super high stress job. I just know myself and I think that I would either get burnt out on the things I actually enjoy, and I would be doing it for probably a mediocre salary. Additionally, I  just am sitting here typing this knowing that eventually, even by my river, I will see an add for the iPhone 17 plus, that now has holograms and I am just going to NEED it. But I won't be able to afford it because my 22 year old self didn't want to actually work for a living. The worst part is that I don't trust myself to make this decision. Between my anxiety/depression and the fact that I am a fucking child who got too drunk last week and puked in the shower, I just don't know what kind of adult I want to or should be.

So here is where I am at in my decision making process:
Option 1: I just continue down my path and try to limit the bad aspects of my corporate life, make a good salary and be financially stable, like my dear old dad.
Option 2: I say fuck it, and go find a river. Buy my dog and pick a place with a low cost of living.
Option 3: I go the complete opposite route and embrace my hatred of corporate life. Work my ass off while I'm young and resilient, save like the Great Depression is coming and try and retire as early as possible and live off my Investments/savings/401k, and maybe get a stress free part time job to supplement my income. 

PLEASE help me friends, where do i move from here? I realize as a 22 year old I probably shouldn't know all these answers, but I need to at least be moving towards my goal or end game, I don't want to stand still, flip flopping and doing a little of all of these and never actually finding my sweet spot. 

TL;DR: I want nothing more than to go live by a nice river and get a stress free job, but I am in so deep in our consumer culture and corporate BS that I am terrified of what will happen if i leave it behind. Especially if I end up not being able to provide for my family, and I don't trust my self to make this decision."

I used to intern at a charge card company as an entry level help desk support. HR and IT are located at the main office in a small building at the back. Other departments are located at another bigger shopping mall. To get to this other building, you have to walk across the either the road downstairs or go through the connected parking garage. That's why I always sigh whenever I have to go to the other building.

One day, my co-worker received a support request through WhatsApp.

&gt; ""QuestionMySarcasm, $user seems to be having problems with his laptop. Can you please go check it out?""

Wait, $user's laptop? I had just migrated his documents and data over to the new one the day before, and everything was properly configured. So yeah, that meant that I had to go to the other building to take a look.

&gt; ""So, what problem are you having with your laptop?""

I was nervous, since I was the one who configured it, and screwing things up and disrupting their workflow was one of my biggest worries.

&gt; ""My laptop isn't working. The screen isn't showing anything. Look, it's on.""

I peeked at the light indicators and indeed, it was on.

&gt; ""Um, have you tried restarting it?""

&gt; ""No. How do you restart it?""

I promptly held down the power button until it boots up.

&gt; ""Oh.""

We both laughed. And I wasn't even annoyed because $user was so friendly towards me :D

TL;DR I walked over to another building just to push a power button"
3x8nfo,0,2015-12-17,C+ in my first college CS class - what should I do?,passacaglia7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3x8nfo/c_in_my_first_college_cs_class_what_should_i_do/,"I'm a freshman at one of the top 2 CS schools in the country. Took the most accelerated intro to programming class (in retrospect, not a wise idea; I had a conflict with the next-level-down CS class) this quarter and ended up with a C+ in the class. This class is known as the class the really ""hardcore"" CS people take, but as far as I know, most get A's and B's.

I did well on homework assignments (we had 7 fairly long programming assignments), but very badly on the exams - 60% on the midterm and then 70% on the final when the average was around 80%. I felt very slow to grasp the concepts compared to others in the class. I think I had too much confidence in my abilities; people in my class had taken Data Structures or built many successful apps in high school. 

I'm worried that this grade is going to hurt my chances (already slim as a freshman) of getting internships or research in the summer - it will appear that I couldn't perform well on the only CS class on my transcript so far. Over break I'm working on some outside projects - I really want to get better at building practical projects. 

Any suggestions on how to recover from this failure? I don't think I should take this as an indicator that I shouldn't do CS - it's my first quarter in college, this was the hardest programming class I could have taken, and I know that if I'd done the easier class, that most CS majors take anyway, I would have done fine. But I desperately want to improve, and I don't want something like this to happen again. "

He didnt get an internship because he was trying to graduate on time and so he doesnt have work experience. All our work at school was in java. That being said, there are really not that many junior java positions out there as of right now. Hes applied to big companies, mid size companies and startups. Not to mention, hes even tried to find internships but they wont take him because hes not still in school. He does have some side projects on github that hes worked on and is still trying to teach himself more to be competitive and his grades upon graduation were great. 

Hes interviewed a few times with companies but they clearly havent gone well and hes become extremely depressed and suddenly lacking the willpower to continue after constant rejection. Im trying to be as supportive as possible but I realize that hes in a tough position and I may not be able to offer as great advice as ya'll. I've suggested that he consider applying to graduate school as he is interested in AI and Machine learning (note: hes applied to ALL kinds of java related jobs even if they dont do AI and Machine learning). But he does have loans to pay off and would rather get a job. Honestly, what would do if you were in his position?

His schedule so far has been:

Wake up

Apply to jobs

code/work on side projects

interview prep

apply to jobs

I also did machine learning research this past summer, which I really enjoyed; I'm looking for an internship for this upcoming summer, but I'm pretty convinced right now that I want to go into academia/research in the long run.

At this point, should I additionally major in math? AFAIK, it would be really helpful for theoretical CS; however, my major concerns are that it's a bit too late and a bit too much work, and I'm not sure if I'd like the material.

3x9gz8,198,2015-12-17,The Big Bug of '00,faisent,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3x9gz8/the_big_bug_of_00/,"This happened many years ago, in my first ""real"" IT job - it was almost my last because of the events I'm about to discuss.  Honestly, writing this is kinda cathartic...


$Company hired me because I could navigate a WindowsNT GUI, knew what a service account was, and wasn't afraid to learn Novell NetWare (I told you this was an old story).  They also hired me because one of my friends was the son of one of their Executives.  I was coached on the test by my interviewer.


$Company did accounting software; specifically asset depreciation.  Our customers were accountants, specifically Tax Accountants.  We had the entire US Tax Code in the office and updated the software every year, we did State Taxes as well, and updated that with greater frequency.  If you think regular users are bad, you've never spent over an hour on the phone discussing a five cent rounding issue on 10 million dollars of assets.


Accountants, I learned, are really intense about pennies.


As I'd done a bunch of customer service jobs in the past (over night shifts at $Diner for example) and because I wasn't actually crazy I ended up Tier-3 in short order and got to deal with the really weird calls and problems.  I'd get to look up bizarre tax-code relating to depreciating slot machines on Indian Reservations and then explain why we didn't have what was clearly part of the US Tax Code in the system to a raging accountant.  Fun stuff.


Then came new management; all the old execs were fired, the Developer leads were all gutted, QA slashed to the bone.  Luckily because of all this, our call volume was up and Tech Support was saved from the axe.  Horay!!!  I can't even blame QA for what happened next, those poor bastards were still reeling from seeing all their co-workers fired; empty cubicles piled high with discarded gear was their domain.  I *slightly* blame the devs, I'm sure one of them knew what that code contained; but I never figured out for sure.


I really blamed the new PM.  That woman was a nightmare for us anyway; complaining that ""Tech Support"" didn't do anything besides play games (we were avid Starcraft players on the local LAN) but when the queue is 80 calls deep and there's simply no end to your misery sometimes you just gotta nuke your friend.  She'd found some old code that ""Looked pretty useful"" and got it re-introduced into our 2000 release.  I don't know how she found it, whoever had quarantined it away was gone by then.  But she'd found it, and got it put into the new calculation engine to ""free up cycles"".


Yeah, basically it corrupted the database after a calculation.  It was a very *small* amount of corruption, and if you were a small shop that only did any tax stuff once a year you'd probably never notice it.  However, if you were an Enterprise Customer who ran multiple calculations a month on hundreds of millions of dollars worth of assets (our software being one of those millions...) you might notice that if you ran a calc on Tuesday and then ran the same calc on Wednesday you might be off a few thousand dollars, which would only get worse.  The same people who'd argue for an hour about a nickel were now seeing calculation errors several orders of magnitude higher.  


The ""cycles"" that PM had saved?  That was Christmas Break...we were heading into Tax Season.  And yours truly was the one who got forwarded all these ""weird calculation engine"" tickets.


Needless to say it was a nightmare; several of our better support guys left for greener pastures.  We had to put post-its with the words ""BE"" and ""NICE"" on our intern's monitor as he would frequently stand up and berate people in Mandarin.  Even the beaney-baby guy stopped talking to us in strange little beaney-baby voices -- what little joy in his life was replaced with this bug-induced madness.  My boss basically checked out but allowed me the luxury of only dealing with ""tier 3"" issues; instead of taking inbounds I was now expected to contact all of our Enterprise Customers tell them not to upgrade and then try to ""fix"" any of them that had experienced the issue.  


Thus began my month-long relationship with $Customer.  I'd call her daily.  *We'd try new and interesting things that wouldn't work.*  We'd both sigh together.  She was patient and kind with me; we even cracked a few jokes over our hours and hours of calls.  She was smart, I rarely had to have her get her IT guy on the line while doing database backups and restores.  I checked out the purchase order on her software license to see if she lived even remotely close.  I'm glad MySpace wasn't really a thing yet and Facebook hadn't been invented; I'm better off - no a better person - for not being able to cyber-stalk her.  Frankly, she was the type of user a help desk tech could fall in love with.  But $user/$support relationships should never be - for who knows who ultimately has the power?


After weeks, we reached a solution.  Before every calculation she'd back up her entire database.  She'd run the calc she needed and print off all the necessary forms.  She'd then restore the database so that she could do the same thing, *for all the 20-odd sites the company had scattered all over the country every month until the patch came out*.  She wasn't pleased.  The last thing she said to me still haunts me:


""*faisent* I'm not angry with you, you've been more than helpful to me the last few weeks and I know you tried really hard to come up with a solution that would work.  But I'm **angry** *faisent*.  Give me somebody I can be angry with.""


I put her on hold.  I could foist her off to the ""Customer Complaint Line"" (hosted by peers who's queue was at least as impressively deep as our own).  But $Customer deserved better, and I was smitten.  I walked over to the PM's desk.  She was there, eating her bottled-water and salad lunch (I really loathed this woman).  Back on my phone I told $Customer that I was going to transfer her over to the PM responsible for the latest release.  With a couple of presses and a transfer button she was gone, I never heard from $Customer again.


I did hear from the PM, my boss, my boss' boss, and up the chain.  I think my job was saved by the VP of Sales as I'd help him close a 250K deal before Christmas.  Regardless, about a month later I'd gotten my MCSE and was off to greener pastures myself.


I'm a grizzled old engineer now and can chuckle about days long past without twitching or medication.  I let my interns carry on shouting at customers for it helps keep them young.  I can spend an hour writing something up on Reddit because my systems purr like contented kittens.  


But sometimes around tax time I'll think of $Customer, I hope she got that patch..."

Took the most accelerated intro to programming class (in retrospect, not a wise idea; I had a conflict with the next-level-down CS class) this quarter and ended up with a C+ in the class. This class is known as the class the really ""hardcore"" CS people take, but as far as I know, most get A's and B's.

I did well on homework assignments (we had 7 fairly long programming assignments), but very badly on the exams - 60% on the midterm and then 70% on the final when the average was around 80%. I felt very slow to grasp the concepts compared to others in the class. I think I had too much confidence in my abilities; people in my class had taken Data Structures or built many successful apps in high school.

I'm worried that this grade is going to hurt my chances (already slim as a freshman) of getting internships or research in the summer - it will appear that I couldn't perform well on the only CS class on my transcript so far. Over break I'm working on some outside projects - I really want to get better at building practical projects.

Any suggestions on how to recover from this failure? I don't think I should take this as an indicator that I shouldn't do CS - it's my first quarter in college, this was the hardest programming class I could have taken, and I know that if I'd done the easier class, that most CS majors take anyway, I would have done fine. But I desperately want to improve, and I don't want something like this to happen again.

This fall, I lowered my credits to 13 and instead of getting a part-time job, built my resume with clubs, learn basic professionalism, and score decent grades. It was stressful, time-consuming, and I had to jump through every hoop imaginable.

If i take summer classes, i will  be taking the data structures/algorithm class in fall of 2016, which i assume would have me up to speed for competent internships for the next summer due to my background in algorithms and more competent programming.

Bedridden for years. Recently diagnosed with: Autonomic Dysfunction with Vagal Neuropathy, Reactive Hypoglycemia, Gastric Dumping Syndrome, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Chronic Daily Migraine. This is all because I continuously pushed for answers.

Everyone in my life has abandoned me. I am constantly surrounded by ignorant narcissists and cannot get help. Doctors have dismissed symptoms for years, yet I persisted and finally got a diagnosis that explains the rest of my symptoms (Autonomic Dysfunction).
The problem is the treatment doesn't work, my symptoms are not manageable, I'm unable to function, I have been homeless on and off for years because I am unable to work, and my cognition is in the toilet (brain fog). I am constantly blamed for this condition, as if I did something to deserve this. I've done some time in the Army, was an exercise fanatic, always excellent in school, and have done two internships in a place most would only dream about prior to becoming ill. It amazes me how quickly people forget who I used to be and how they authoritatively tell me I'm depressed.

Now I'm at the point where I'm educating doctors based on research I've done on pubmed, and demanding testing be done. Most won't listen to me or take me seriously, and even if they decided to humor me and run some ""different"" testing a lot of it isn't covered under insurance. I'm looking into things like ""intestinal permeability"" since I react to most foods, and ""organic acids testing"" because I need to know what my nutrition levels are. Most docs give me another Rx for zoloft before they even consider proper sleep, nutrition, exercise, and mental/sexual/spiritual health, which in my mind is complete bullshit.

The healthcare system is broken in this country. The Veterans Affairs department is only good for shooting me up with more psych drugs that I don't need. Turns out my psych issues are autonomic related, and had I listened to myself years ago I wouldn't have gone inpatient psych over 10 times due to the psych drugs themselves!

I guess this is my last resort: posting online. Any and all advice would be great."

I know side projects are important, and am an active member of our local Code for America Brigade and have made a simple Slack/ Github integration, but with an entire CS degree crammed into 1.5 years, there just isn't time for extended, non-trivial projects. 

Family responsibilities mean an internship isn't really an option and I can't afford to graduate any later than June (unless I can somehow get a remote part-time job that pays $25+ an hour).  

I'm doing the program full-time while staying home with my two young children and I feel like any job where I can sit down and focus on a problem during normal working hours without constant distractions or exams at 2 am with a crying baby in the background will be a piece of cake, but the job search is seriously freaking me out.

I have experience working for a software company as an end-user trainer and the problem solving part is second nature to me, I can google with the best of them and make sense of a lot of languages, but I still don't feel fluent in anything (again, 1 year just isn't enough time, for me at least).

- I reach out to a lot of industry professionals and recruiters at engineering fairs, online, and through referrals by classmates and others.  The big problem I have seems to be the: ""We only have positions open for people with experience,"" or ""I want to help out, but they have positions open for people with experience.""  How do I get around this ""referral, but no engineering experience"" problem?  

- I work on projects regularly.  I've taught myself advanced Java &amp; Android development (have an app on Google Play), helped my cousin design a space product (confidentiality agreement) for a startup he is planning, built a 2 DoF optimized solar rotator, took some online CFD courses and built a wind tunnel simulator as a project outside the classroom, etc.  The problem I've had is getting HR to give weight to these projects (people I've spoken to seem to react positively to them, but also wish I had experience).  How do I get HR to give much higher consideration to them when it comes time to giving me the interview?

3xapn3,0,2015-12-17,How am I doing so far? Having doubts about my future in this industry,csthrowaway0x0001,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xapn3/how_am_i_doing_so_far_having_doubts_about_my/,"Hello, I am currently a junior comp eng student, basically half was done with university. After reading this sub, I am having a lot of doubts about my performance so far and if I will succeed in the future.

I am a student from Waterloo, currently has completed my 3rd co-op term. I will be going into my junior year in the winter for computer engineering.

In terms of co-op, I have had 2 co-ops in Canada, first working with Java and .NET, second working with .NET and Angular/web dev. My 3rd co-op term is in the United States working with Java and Angular.

 I do not have many huge side projects though, only 2 I would consider to be somewhat worthy to present. The first one is a C# program that controls the Thalmic Lab Myo that can be used to configure any movement and can recognize it along with profiles and portfolios, I use that to play games with motion. The second one is just a chatroom bot that I thought would be spiced up if I hook up a backend server to it and its own database to be able to become somewhat of a personal assistance. This chatroom bot is also written in C# with ASP.NET

However, I am a huge hackathon attendee with 8 hackathons under my belt, 3 with winning mentions. Most of the hackathons though I work on the backend server side writing it in ASP.NET with C# and getting it hosted up in Azure.

I also have a personal website that is not very much, I am personally not much of a UX/UI person so it feels fairly static (as in no fancy animations, just some gradients to get the flow better and Angular to help me with forms and bindings)

I also would say my mark are adequate enough, currently with a 85% average or in my school's GPA terms, I think a 3.7

Now, comparing my portfolio with other people, it feels inadequate. My peers at my current coop location are also avid hackathon attendees with over 50% win rate and have won over thousands of dollar of prizes, I have barely went over $200 with winnings. They also have many fairly insane side projects that are huge or are used by other people (downloaded from play or app store). Many of them also have contributed to open source projects. At work, they made it known that they look down upon me with my coding quality (although my manager praise me that my coding skills are far above his level of expectation from the likes of me) and my commits. Comparing myself to them, I seriously feel inadequate.

Comparing it to the people in this sub, it feels like I am behind if by the next coop term, which is in the summer, I do not get a job in a unicorn start up or a big tech company. I personally feel my portfolio is not even adequate for such because my peers have gotten interviews but not offers with those companies and I do not think my skills are comparable to them. They are also in CS or SE while I am only in CE

Another concern was that for my 3rd co-op term, if you know how the waterloo co-op system works, that basically in my first round of application which we are only limited to 50. I have gotten no interviews and was the only one in my class that had gotten no interviews during the first round. Although I only applied to desirable US companies for internships, I felt that I was behind as compared to my class based on how I performed. It was by absolute sheer luck that I got this job in the United States because the person that got the offer was probably asleep by the offer acceptance deadline and I was the back up.

I also feel like my language and stack of choice is a huge concern. After reading the article about what people Y-Comb companies want, I have to say just due to my language choice alone, I fall under the enterprise developer, which they do not want. I have to admit that I am very comfortable with development on windows and in all still foreign to development on Unix based systems even though I had 1 coop term to work with it. I feel by this alone makes me an undesirable candidate.

For interviews, I also feel like I do not have enough experience with technical interviews as I have only gone through 3 of them while my peers have went through at least 10+ with companies that do multi-round interviews. These days, I do program everything I can from Hacker Rank and CTCI but I do not know how it will translate to real world interviews.

For marks and performance in school, I do apply everything I learn and I believe my mark is high enough. My class ranking is always in the top 10 BUT I am not on my school's dean's Honor list. For my school and my program in particular, to get on it is a formula that basically is only for people with 87 or 88%+ averages or 3.9 gpa. (average - class percentile &gt; 80)

Overall, I am just concerned with my current portfolio and how I am currently doing. Comparing myself to others makes me feel utterly inferior and it is through plain luck that I have gotten some of the things I have today. I do believe that my luck will run out and I do not want to be left behind. I want to end up with that dreamed and desired job on the west coast getting paid a lot or making things that will truly change the world. I DO NOT want to end up being an enterprise developer living life looking forward for the day to end so that I can just get home. Basically, I want to get to somewhere with my career and know that I did well instead of just wasting it to get by.

Overall, here are my concerns

* peers are better than me as compared to me
* my portfolio does not feel like it is adequate
* it is through luck that I got an internship in the states
* My tech stack is very Microsoft/Java or ""enterprise"" based
* I am not on my program's dean's honor list
* my interview skills are behind compared to my peers

Thank you for reading and any suggestions for what I should do to be ready or to make myself adequate to work at the dream companies are really appreciated."
3xbdck,1,2015-12-18,I [22f] am a junior level psychology major doing undergrad. I want very much to do well and make it into a grad program. I do not want to work anymore while studying but I am terrified of debt. Advice?,karmicdancer,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/3xbdck/i_22f_am_a_junior_level_psychology_major_doing/,"Tl;dr : I [22f] am in my junior year of undergrad pursuing my psychology degree. So far I have not had to take out loans because I have prepaid college credits and have worked fulltime since I was 18. University is harder than community college was and I see I cannot continue working like this and hope to do well. I am very scared of student loans. Advice please!

......

So I am currently a junior level psychology student and have realized I can't do fulltime work and hope to do well in University (transferred after I got my AA). While I love art and writing, my deepest desire has always been to be in the mental health field, perhaps as a therapist or counselor but I want to be able to have freedom within the field to change my job in case I get burnt out as a therapist, since many people do. I am serious about going to grad school, after many years of considering the pros and cons. So I want to do AWESOME now that I'm at University. I want to do well in my classes, hopefully get a part time job or internship related to mental health, join clubs and organizations (I have no interest in going Greek though) and I want to make it into the psychology honors society, as I think it would be good to have these experiences in my background and to network with others who will be in my field. 

But I am terrified of taking out student loans (and many tell me, with good reason). My roommate currently has $30,000 in debt after he graduated, and seems very calm about it, and has told me most people at college have to take out loans. But if I am looking at grad school, I know that I'm going to have to take out loans in the future too, and the idea of all this debt is overwhelming. If I can make it through undergrad without going to debt, I would feel much better about taking out loans for grad school. I don't know how these kids can be so calm about these huge piles of debt and I feel that they don't look at the reality of how much money that is and that it will probably be more to pay back with interest. I don't want loans to ruin my life, and have read many stories where they did ruin the person's life.

All that being said, I always file my FAFSA. I have not gotten very much at all from FAFSA in the past, usually only about $1000 - $1500, due to my age, my job, my grandparents income (they legally adopted me as a baby), etc. This month my grandpa retired meaning that both of my grandparents are now retired, and they cannot help me at all monetarily and I wouldn't want them to anyway. I also quit my job due to a bunch of personal health issues and life problems I have been going through that I won't go into, but that job sucked my happiness from me, and I am glad I quit. FAFSA has gotten me only $1500 for the upcoming spring semester even though I filed as an independent (not sure I did this properly, as I did have to give my grandparents income information), and with my own savings and the possibility of a part time job (as long as it does not mess with my grades) I think I can make it through this semester. But I need a financial plan for the semesters after that, I definitely want to take summer courses, and I am not sure that the Prepaid college program is going to stretch all the way to the end of undergrad because I wasted some of the credits as a freshman.

I have wondered if I would be able to get any disability financial aid since I am diagnosed Bipolar and have several years history of medical visits, one baker act, and it definitely effects my quality of life and ability to do well in school. I have researched some mental health scholarships and do plan on applying. I have not filed for any kind of disability with the government and am not sure if that's the right thing to do.

I am most concerned with the FAFSA. I feel like I have not been filing it true to my situation and that is why I receive so little aid. Also since all of these income changes happened at the end of this year, when I file in January, it's going to show that my grandparents and I had an income and thus result in a higher EFC. I want to sit with someone knowledgeable about the FAFSA, tell them my situation and see if they'll babystep me through the one I have to file in January, but I don't know who to turn to, as the financial aid office at my university can be difficult to deal with.

I have promised myself to see this degree through and take out loans if I have to, but I definitely don't want to do that. Can you guys give me any advice or information that might help me? I am located in Florida."

It doesn't have to be a new idea or related to the raspberry; I just want to challenge myself to do something. Maybe an old/unoriginal idea is better since I am still learning.


  Also, for those with windows computers, do you recommend visual studio over say a command prompt compiler? I have visual studio but I have honestly gotten to like typing out the compile commands in the terminal and making my make file. Is there like gcc or g++/clang that i can download for free to use like cygwin or is there something better?


  I am sorry for such a long post and all the questions. I did google it. I just was looking for a bit of advice/guidance for a beginner. I posted this here because I might be leaning more towards software than hardware.


Thank you.

So I walked in the graduation ceremony on Tuesday this week, but all our grades weren't in and I was nervous about my Systems and Controls class. I needed at least a C to graduate. I had failed it the previous semester and it was a subject that I just could grasp no matter how hard I tried. And on top of working my internship while I'm doing school full time including my senior design project, I wouldn't have had the time to put forth the needed effort for ME to do well in it anyway. So 2 days later on the hard deadline when grades are due I check my grades and sure enough I got a D. So I check with my professor to see if there was ANYTHING AT ALL that could be done to help me out so I graduate and officially roll into my job. Long story short he tells me that I was so close and agrees to help me out and bump me to a C and that he wouldn't want me to not graduate because of a graduate level course. My knees got weak. Just couldn't get out without one last heart attack. Well, it's been pretty dope r/engineeringstudents but my time here is complete. Good luck to all of you and keep working hard!"
3xbvzs,6,2015-12-18,Is it more plausible to work on side projects and programming before trying to get a job when you have nothing that counts as experience?,decaffccino,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xbvzs/is_it_more_plausible_to_work_on_side_projects_and/,"From the UK, graduated last summer with a mediocre CS degree with a 2:2 from a good university, which translates to a pretty abysmal GPA from what I gather and in our system you might as well have failed apparently. I graduated in 4 years instead of 3, I would delve into the specifics, but it was a mixture of family and personal problems that began at the end of my first year, something I refused for a long time to acknowledge were affecting me.

So I graduated without an internship or any projects under my belt, spent a few months stagnating, because I didn't know what I wanted to do, then went on a working holiday from December, worked in hospitality for some months and did a lot of travelling. Came back, did some proofreading of company documents on the side. None of this really added anything, a recruiter recently told me, they don't care, all they care about is stuff to do with programming. So I'm feeling a little like, wow, I should have just tried to get a job before my degree finished instead of apparently wasting my time overseas. But the past is the past, can't do anything about it now.

So during my degree, my strongest language was always Java, things like SQL, HTML, CSS I picked back up through codecademy recently, I learnt AJAX, Javascript and XML during one of my modules too, but I prefer to cast them as 'familiar' to me, because I've never done a project in them like I've done with Java.

I don't even know what being proficient is. According to one site, if you can't manage a practice question on topcoder you can't program your way out of a paper bag, which is disheartening because I tried one of their easy questions and found it really difficult. 

Am I supposed to enjoy programming? 
When I'm trawling through the problems in CodingBat and SPOJ, I don't think, oh gee, this is so amazingly fun; I could live and breathe this. Granted there is a degree of satisfaction and relief when a program works and passes all the tests.
Is it also bad that I need paper when solving problems? I feel like when I solve problems, it takes me too long to do it and then when I implement it, there are much more efficient and simpler ways. And I sit here thinking, why did I not think of that, why did I not think of using that data structure? 

One of the things in my degree that got me interested was a module to do with designing apps and websites, human computer interaction, taking colour and layout etc. into consideration. I even got to draw panels of what my group's app would potentially look like, the whole prototyping process was actually fun, the user testing was fun and learning about the psychology behind how people perceive things was fascinating. 
I also really liked making a website in my first year, because the result was so satisfying, it looked pretty, it did things, I could click and it would take me to new pages. 

* Should I hold off on applying for jobs until I have something more substantial in my github account? 
* Does it matter what I want to do, because I’m currently just applying for everything to do with software development? 
* Would it be better to just try and get an apprenticeship somewhere instead? I’m thinking I should try looking at graduate internships too and the local job fairs.
* How bad is an unemployment gap?
* Should I put the code I do for competitive programming into my github, or should I just link my account back to my LinkedIn?
* LinkedIn don’t have an option for putting how good you are at a programming language, do I just put it anyway?

(Does Wiltshire even have Java software jobs?)
I'm starting to think I should just apply for jobs relating to my work experience now, because I feel like a lost cause."

I graduated college a couple years ago with a business management major after not doing great with my intro computer science classes freshman year.  By the time I had matured to the point where I was a good student, it was already late Sophomore year and I had switched my major.   
After not loving the job prospects ahead of me, I dived into a couple programming books (Head First Java, Codecademy courses, O'reily javascript etc.) and really enjoyed it.  I taught myself well enough to the point where I got an internship supporting Google apps and writing apps script, then a second internship developing javascript internal applications.  The company I work for is great and hired me on full time to develop C#/Java/Web for internal applications support, but I worry often my future career options are dim because I am without an official CS degree.  (I've been full time for nearly two years now).
  
My question is this:  is it worth me going to a local school night class to take their masters program classes to prove I have the programming chops?  In additional to being self taught I have learned a lot from the senior devs where I work, but I feel like I need to have something in paper.  Would me developing a few personal web apps etc. and posting them to Github really help my cause?  I spend about 15-20 hours a week outside of work learning and doing small projects for fun, but I want to be spending that time best I can.  Any ideas or advice?   I really appreciate it - thanks all, and happy holidays.

I just couldnt concentrate with 2 other people in a room for 8 hours a day. it was just too much. he tried talking to me several times but i was so full of adrenaline that i couldnt tell him that i dont like to work there anymore and that i want to quit. 

so today he had another talk with me and i told him everything is fine and that i think the work is intresting, just because my anxiety was so high that i couldnt say the truth. 

when i went home i called him and told him i want to quit because i lost motivation and because of personal reasons. 
He was really angry and basically told me that i am a pussy because i couldnt tell him that in person when we had a talk and i pretended everything was ok. 

now i feel like a fuckin failure and i'm scared that i have to give a few days notice before i can actually quit.

I know it's harder to get into a Big 4 company as a working full-time compared to as an intern transitioning to full-time.

What I want to know is, how much harder is it? I've recently failed a few Big 4 interviews, and I'm feeling kind of discouraged that if I can't get an internship with the Big 4, I won't ever be good enough to work for them, even if I interviewed later on in my life as a full-time (since the questions would be more difficult).

Does anyone have any experience with failing to get an internship at a Big 4 as a student, and getting a full-time later on?"

I'm currently a sophomore at a state school with a reputable comp sci program and had a few questions in regards to applying for summer internships.

Coming into college I was somewhat undecided so my first year consisted of gen ed classes. I began working with java last summer and have grown to enjoy it immensely so I switched my track to a computer science one. 

For this semester that just finished I took the first cs class required for the major(java,basic programming, OOP etc..), next semester I'll be taking the next course involving data structures and the like as well as a foundations of cs course more involved with the logical/mathematical side of things.

Due to a stupid policy with scholarships at my school having to take a certain amount of credits towards your current major every semester as well as a policy for needing to take the first two courses in the cs sequence to be admitted to the major I will be switching to Information Systems major next semester and then after next semester switch to the CS major.

I would like to apply to summer internships this winter break but I have a few questions:

1. In my resume, should I list the courses I will have taken/knowledge I will have by the summer or the courses/knowledge that I currently have?

2. In a similar vein, should I list my major as Information Systems or computer science, given that at the time of application I will be IS but as of the summer I will be CS?

3. I have a few project ideas I'm going to flesh out over the break as well as a plan to learn some web related programming(html), is there anything else I should be doing to maximize my intership chances for the summer?

Thanks in advance"

I nailed both of the algorithms question, but I completely fucked up the follow up question to my last interview, where the interviewer essentially asked me an open-ended question about how to make a process better. I essentially blanked and it was 5 minutes of me going ""uhhh"" followed by a not-very-good solution.

I'm a Junior Physics major at Northwestern University, concentrating in Astrophysics and with a CS minor, with a 3.388/4.0 GPA. The issue is that I have only recently picked up the CS minor after doing some NASA funded research on exoplanets this summer. My research required tons of python scripting to make .txt files that would populate input files for a fortran integrator that integrated planet orbits. I also used python to make graphs of data and use output files to make more input files for longer runs. I feel very comfortable in Python, but never got formal training. My CS minor is slow to start, and I will only be taking 2 language classes this year, one that is Northwestern exclusive called Racket that is function based, and C++/ a little C. I'm teaching myself Swift, Ruby, and maybe eventually HTML/CSS stuff. I can navigate around a linux shell pretty decently, and have some experience in batch scripting on the schools super computer cluster. I'm having major issues finding internships that will take me as a serious candidate though because of my lack of formal computer programming experience it seems. I've applied to roughly 50 jobs since the start of October and have gotten one online interview at a trading firm, but either not heard back or received rejection letters otherwise. What can I do secures interviews so that I can show I am a good candidate? I'm a very social guy and give good first impressions, so I feel like i'd excel at interviews if I could only get some.

3xev19,1,2015-12-18,Is Transferring (back) a Good Idea for Software Engineering?,BobbyPin88,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3xev19/is_transferring_back_a_good_idea_for_software/,"History: For my freshman and sophomore years, I attended an elite math/science school. I did well, and maintained a 3.6 GPA. However, I was less than happy there due to the very stressful workload and limited social life, so I transferred to a liberal arts college.

It is now the second semester of my senior year. My major is computer science, and I will be looking for a software engineering job upon graduation. I have the option to return to my old school, but I am struggling to come to a definitive decision. It is certainly a much better school, ranking wise (top 10 versus top 100). But it is also extremely theoretical (honestly, it teaches theoretical computer science, not computer/software engineering), and the workload is intense. If I go back, I'll have to spend one extra year. The main draw is the opportunity to use the prestige of the school to more easily get top-tier internships (probably in Silicon Valley) which I can convert to jobs. The cons are the stress, the limited social life, and (I guess) the opportunity cost of the extra year. I also worry that the theoretical bent won't transfer very meaningfully to my future career. 

My other option is to stay where I am. While the school isn't nearly as good, I will have the time to learn things on my own, and hopefully get a good job/internship this summer anyway. My instinct says I can learn everything I need to know from the internet and by working on projects. I am much, much happier here in terms of stress levels and social life.

Going beyond the practical, I think this decision has something to do with a deep-seated feeling that if I don't go back, I'm somehow selling myself short and I'll regret it. At the risk of sounding arrogant, I find my current school is very easy and I am able to maintain a 4.0 GPA with very little effort. This sounds nice, but it tends to make me lazy with regards to time management and study habits, which makes me feel like I'm wasting my potential. I guess I just want to apply my abilities to the utmost. At the same time, I know that by going back to my old school, I'm signing up for a year and a half of all-nighters, very poor teaching, and next to no social life.

Thank you for reading. Any advice on making this decision is welcome!"

Since middle school all the way to now, college. I'm 22 about to graduate college and to this day I let people walk all over me, I'm so tired of it. I want to be respected, I want people to value what I have to say, I don't want to look or feel  stupid. I want to be considered tough, I want to speak up for myself, I want to be assertive somehow be a ""bitch"" because let's be honest, girls who have ""bitch"" attitudes are respected.

For example:

Relationships:
Broke up with ex-boyfriend recently because he was taking advantage of me. After months of dating, he didn't want to introduce me to anyone. I was used for sex. This is not the first time it happens. Men just used me, treat me like shi. This is a pattern. 

I'm so over dating! I want to work on myself, but I don't know how!

Work Wise:

-I worked at many jobs. The worst experienced I had been when a manager at a restaurant who always verbally abused and once told me that I'm mentally retarded because I was always making  mistakes. I cried and quit the job. I didn't do anything about it. Wish I did at the time when I think about it I get angry for not standing up for myself. Wish I could go back and slapped the bitch or kill her. (won't actually do it lol.)

Another case was when another manager at a different job pushed me and yelled at me for no reason. Once again I didn't speak up, she apologized, though. 

At some restaurant jobs, coworkers were also rude to me. Talking behind my back, yelling at me, calling me stupid, ignoring me. 

Now I'm doing an internship at an office and people are much nicer. However when I think of the past and the way people treated me I get so mad at myself. 


Family:

-I don't speak to my little brother who is 18. He doesn't respect me as the older sister. We got into a huge argument months ago in which he called me a ""WHORE"" ""a dumb bitch who can't keep a relationship"". Just awful things. 

Social life:

-People that I considered friends often times make fun of me when in a group of friends. I'm not the type to stand up for myself so when I'm around a group of friends people often times make ""jokes"" and I laugh it off. I hate confrontations so I'm an easy target.  I try to avoid groups.

-I meet this girl in small class this semester. She was nice and all. but recently she started acting like a bitch. When I participated in class she made rude remarks, faces, ignored me at one time called me stupid when I made a joke in class. 

Is like people I meet think is okay to talk to me badly. Think is okay to ignore me. Talk down on me. I never stand up for myself. When I'm in a situation where I'm disrespected I freeze at that moment and don't say anything.either laugh it off or stay quiet. I also replay that scene over and over again wishing I could go back to time and change the way I reacted. 

This is embarrassing because I'm already graduating college and I'm 24. I'm supposed to have my shit together, but clearly I need to work on myself. Therapy is not an option because I don't have money.

How do you break into this field? I find it hard to find places even offering internships. Do you generally need a masters or PhD?

I wanted to basically make my own version of the service they provide here: https://www.barcodesinc.com/articles/inventory-control-system.htm.  Basically a system that tracks your inventory and related statistics, calculates food cost, tells you when to reorder, etc.

At first glance it doesn't seem too hard.  I just completed software engineering this past semester, and can kind of visualize how the process would go.  I could start writing up some use cases and UML diagrams to see how it would all work out, but I'm afraid this could easily get to be too much for me to tackle alone.

Another concern I have is the legal issues of using an IDE/language for developing commercial software.  For example, if I wanted to use C# to write this program, would I have to pay Microsoft for a commercial license for visual basic?  What if I used Java instead?  I don't plan on selling the software to outside parties, but there is a possibility that I get paid to write it, and/or the program gets used by my family's restaurant as part of their business operation.

The last question (for now, lol) I have is that if I pursued this, could it be considered an ""internship"" if I were paid by the restaurant to write it? (there is definitely money to be saved by having something like this, so I could see it happening). However, it just feels wrong to call it that when I'd be the only person doing any sort of software development there.

Anyway, that's it for now.  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.  "

im a sophomore cs major at a school in new york and i'm pretty burned out... this semester i spent focusing purely on interviewing and doing a bunch of coding practice questions to exercise my algorithms and problem solving skills, and well luckily it just BARELY worked out. on top of that i didn't do too hot in my classes (lol worth tho), im going to finish with below a 3.5 this semester... but it probably doesnt matter right because i got the internship? lol

but yeah anyway, i'm not really sure what to do now. i finished finals, winter break is here, spring semester starts in like a month, and i want to use this time effectively. i'll probably spend the first week and a half catching up on sleep and fking around by playing games and stuff but after that i need a game plan. i want to make more cool shit with code, so i'll definitely continue with this mobile app idea i had.

but that's honestly all my coding experience--i just read up on a random technology/API, make a 50%-working app, and then i rinse repeat with a new technology. i'm a bit worried that because this is all i've been doing, i'm going to suck at my internship. i want to do very good, so my question is how should i prepare for my internship? i really want to make the most out of it, and i want to learn a ton and code really cool stuff, but how should i prepare to do that?

also, this up coming spring semester i would like to get a job at a startup or something (given that im in NYC this should be plausible), just like a one time gig or something. do you guys have any experience on how to go about getting a job just for a semester?

thanks for reading this, sorry this is kind of ramble-y but honestly i couldn't do better cuz my brain is dead from all the stuff that happened this semester and i just took my last final lol

TLDR: how do i prepare for an internship at the big 4? what should i practice, what should i read? also how can i get a spring semester gig with a company so that i can write/push code for them? where do i look for these jobs?

thanks bros/sisters, keep being awesome"
3xi2xo,1,2015-12-19,Sophomore Computer Science BS Major. Looking for internships. Could use some advice.,sldjkf,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xi2xo/sophomore_computer_science_bs_major_looking_for/,"I'm a computer science major at a top 50 university in the US (just to give some scope, not trying to brag or be a dick) and I am looking for a summer internship. I'm not really sure what I want to do, so I'm thinking of just applying to a bunch of places and figuring out what I want to do after the fact. I've heard from people that CS internships are really for people after their Junior year from kids at school, but I don't believe that. Any and all help will be appreciated.



**Questions:**

What are some things you wished you had known going into this process?

What would I be doing with Networking, Software Development, Information Systems, Data analytics etc.? (I'm not sure what much of this entails in the job world)

What would be the best starting point to have the most opportunities?

What would be the best for my skillset? (if it can even be considered that)



**Classes I've taken (plan on getting CS BS and MA BA):**

CS1 (Basic Python)

CS2 (Java, we learned stacks, nodes, etc. I think they're all memory storage related things. Also we learned Big O notation and that stuff)

Basic Computer Architecture (Verilog, MIPS, We build a SSDP for MIPS in verilog)

Logic (Boolean algebra, Turing Machines, DFAs and NFAs, Proof by induction)

Calc I, II and Multivariable

Stats (from HS, plan on retaking)

Robotics (from HS, probably will take another robotics class in the future)



**Next semester:**

Randomness &amp; Computations (basically math involving randomness, Large numbers, Probability, all with applications [from class description])

Linear Algebra

Computer Systems (Comparing and contrasting machine-level systems)

Intro to Abstract Mathematics

I've gotten all A's or A-'s on on my Major related course (all the ones above) except Calc 2 (B+)




So if someone could look at this and give me some advice I'd really appreciate it. I'm very lost looking for internships and I don't even know where to start. Thanks. Also I have no relevant experience other than the classes.

EDIT: Also my non major classes brought my GPA down to a 3.0 (first year) but I'm still not sure what my GPA for this semester is. I'm also going to visit the Career Services at my school at the start of the next semester."

3xikyw,2,2015-12-19,"I've been a CS undergrad for two years now and just attempted my first independent programming project. I am lost down a rabbit hole of Maven, Git, and IDEs and I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.",canireddit,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3xikyw/ive_been_a_cs_undergrad_for_two_years_now_and/,"I'm feeling really down right now. I'm two years into my CS degree and I understand the fundamentals of programming pretty well. It's time to start applying to internships but my GitHub is empty and I have no projects to show for myself. When I ask around at school, people either say ""I'm in the same boat"" or ""just make anything!"" So today I decided to just start making anything.

**My goal:** use the Last.fm API to generate a .png collage of my most listened to albums of the past year.

**How the process has gone so far:** Okay, this should be pretty easy, right? I just figure out how to interface the API into Java and I should be set, yeah? Oh look! Someone already [wrote some code to bind the API into Java.](https://github.com/jkovacs/lastfm-java) That should help! Now let's import their work into mine to get started. Hmm, in their readme it says I can just add the .jar to my classpath! Wonderful, I know how to do that. I did that in my databases class to add a SQL linker to Java. Okay, now where do I find that jar? I've poked around for a while now, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll just save their whole project as a .zip and add that to my classpath. Nope, that didn't work.

Okay, they have a bit about grabbing their Maven dependency. I've heard of Maven, so maybe I should learn it. 

&gt;*spends a half hour installing Maven and learning how to create a project*

Okay, cool, my project is ready and I have it imported into Eclipse. Time to add their dependency! I googled around a bit and it looks like I need a plugin called M2E. Cool, I installed it and...now I have no idea how to use it. The documentation is terrible for people that haven't used Maven yet, and googling ""add dependency maven"" isn't providing me with anything that makes sense, even after sitting down and reading it all carefully. And now I have my project existing in an Eclipse workspace and what I think is a Maven repository, and I don't know how the two are supposed to work together. If I compile in eclipse, is that the same as running ""mvn compile"" in command prompt? How do I integrate all this into a git repository?

**What my problem boils down to:**

I can learn how to use Maven. I can learn how to use Git. I know Eclipse fairly well. How do I learn how to use all these things *together*? How do I just *start making a programming project* without getting lost in a sea of questions and installations and confusions?

3xiodc,7,2015-12-19,"Looking for my first job as a new grad, and I'm scared and confused.",abunchofchesspieces,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3xiodc/looking_for_my_first_job_as_a_new_grad_and_im/,"Getting into Stanford was both the best and worst thing that happened to me. I thought I had it all figured out, but that acceptance letter changed everything.

Before I got in I thought I was going to be a Physics major and go on to grad school after graduating. I was good at Physics in high school, so it just made sense. I didn't even know that CS was something you could do in college. In my second week as a freshman I found out about the intro CS course and decided to buy a cheap laptop (my first computer!) and go to the first few classes on a whim. I ended up liking the assignments so much that I just kept taking more classes (at some point I learned how to touch type in Dvorak right hand, but that's another story).

It wasn't like I was a genius. I had pretty average grades. Mostly B's, some A's, and some C's. I was a mildly obese shy teen who had (regrettably) studied his ass off to the exclusion of everything else to get to the school he wanted. I worked on my classes, but I also wanted to eat better, actually step foot in a gym, resolve the myriad of issues I had inevitably developed during my crazy high school years, and get some hobbies! I spent my holidays catching up with my family, losing 40 lbs, and doing stuff I couldn't do when I just had to go go go between ages 12-18. I was just happy to work hard on my classes and proud that I was doing fine in a field I had no idea actually existed for most of my life.

Even then, classes were hard. I had to take a fifth year because taking 3 CS classes in one quarter was death for me.  The time commitment was very high, and I burned out several times near the end of quarters. Sometimes it hurt, and I wanted to just give up. It's fun when you figure out to solve a problem by realizing that you can *GASP* put a for loop *inside* another for loop, but nobody talks about the times when you get a zero in your assignment you worked on for weeks because of a random impossible to reproduce bug that crashes every autograder test. I would work 15 hours a day for 10 weeks straight on two separate classes and get a D for one and an A+ for the other. 

I somehow graduated with a 3.2, battered but still glad I did it. Everybody kept telling me that the diploma I received was going to open a lot of doors for me, and my future was bright.

I live in NYC right now, and looking for my first job. I feel hilariously underqualified for any jobs I see out there. I feel like I'm being punished for deciding to live a more well rounded, emotionally satisfying (and depression free!) life. I'm not even talking about the ""X years of experience"" stuff. Apparently I was supposed to live and breathe coding. Most places don't even consider candidates that don't have at least 1 internships or doesn't have some kind of impressive passion project they've been working on. My resume is essentially a list of class projects I completed. An OS class, a compiler class, a database class, a networking class (didn't do well on this one), and so on. Standard stuff. Essentially I'm not the greatest, but I don't suck, and I can learn if given time. 

This is not really a rant, I know I'm not going to change the world by complaining about it. Not everyone has to go through the soul searching I underwent. I understand (and envy) those who can dedicate their lives to their craft and are well compensated for it. I'm just really scared about my prospects. I'd like to get an entry level job by May at the latest. I'm not sure whether I should just turtle up and spend the next few months studying for interviews/developing side projects, or just say fuck it and apply everywhere even if they want new grads that are more experienced than I am (and also keep studying for interviews).

I'm scared and confused. Is there anybody who was in a similar position? How did you handle it? How can I use my time wisely while retaining my sanity?"

3xjpss,6,2015-12-20,Rant about My Job.,apolla3,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3xjpss/rant_about_my_job/,"I hate my job.
It's really a shame, I love who I work for. But I hate what I do with a passion. I have an engineering job but I do the most basic and bane work there is. Interns could do my work. I would have thought from the high praises my boss(es) give me that I could move on by now to other projects.

My job is unfulfilling. It makes me depressed. I get more satisfaction out of my extracirricular activities but they're just not enough to keep me sane anymore.

My SO literally works at the same company as me. He does similar work, but doesn't understand the depth of my problem. He says I should suck it up, I make too much to quit. I think he's more worried about what his position will be like if I quit and he's still there . He says others haven't switched projectd either but they at least have a variety to choose from. I don't see my career going anywhere.

I feel trapped. The thought of having to go back, feeling unappreciated, makes me sick. I know I have anxiety issues but this is different. I want to cry. I have cried at work before, because it seems like there's no way out. No one wants to listen to the moderately well-off girl who hates her job ""for no reason"", as they say.

I see others moving up in the company who were hired a few months after me. I see people with multiple projects on their timesheet, whereas I am only entrusted with one project. I'm efficient at it, but I feel like I'm being left behind.

Evaluations are coming up. Every year I mention I'd like to work on ANYTHING ELSE, other projects, etc, but all I get are false promises or ""we need you to stay where you are.""

I want to look for other jobs. Based on the BS they give me for my eval this year, I will have to make a choice. Is it selfish to want to be happy where I work, to give up benefits and a rather understanding boss for the unknown?

I wanted to make a difference in the world. I am nothing, just a monkey at a computer all day. No one else gets it--I just want to be useful, needed, irreplaceable. They could operate without me, I just trained some new people. I won't be leaving them in a lurch, but I wonder if this is the right thing to do.

At this point, it feels like my sanity is at stake. And then obviously, my career. Possibly marriage."

Quick background on me: I graduated with a CS Major at a Top-10 school and took a PM job at a large start-up right out of college. I've been working here for 1.5 years now, but I've come to realize that I'd be better fit as a developer. My only problem is that, while I have CS projects and a GitHub with some of my work, I've only interned as a PM. I've never actually done an internship as a developer or SWE. 

I'm confident in my technical abilities, but I'm not sure how best I can demonstrate this on my resume. What are some resume suggestions for a PM without a SWE internship to 1) demonstrate that he's technical enough for entry-level developer jobs and 2) he's dedicated to actually being a developer for the foreseeable future.

3xkiba,36,2015-12-20,There is a Naked Mole-Rat Man that Lives in the Woods by My Friend's House,knowssleep,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3xkiba/there_is_a_naked_molerat_man_that_lives_in_the/,"This happened five years ago, in a the time I took off between my getting my associate's degree and transferring to a four-year University. My dirt-bag fuck-off years, so to speak. My mother had just thrown me out of the house because her meth-dealing boyfriend thought I was ""trouble"" , and I was staying with Chuck, one of my best friends from high school. I was 20 at the time and he was a year older than me, but still living in the woods with his parents and driving over an hour and a half to college each day. He was a little bitter about it- he often complained about all of the opportunities for internships, networking, and extracurriculars he was missing out on- but he managed to get his bachelor's degree with zero debt, and has a decent job landscaping now. Better than most people in this dirty old town can say, that's for sure.   

Anyway, he let me post up in his garage with my pitbull, Jerry. Jerry had to stay in the garage so he didn't hump his parents' yorkie to death, which suited me fine. It was the perfect zone to get stoned and watch shitty nineties comedies like ""Baby's Day Out"" and ""Encino Man"" over and over again. Chuck was 21, so he was able to buy liquor just about every night- though he had to sneak it past his parents in his backpack. It was a little bit of a weird situation, I admit, but we had a lot of fun.     

Chuck's parents were great people- Christians in the truest since of the word. Even though they were prudish about drugs and alcohol, (and given Chuck's predilection for things like ether and painkillers, perhaps they were right to worry) they were more than happy to take me in for over six months, helping me to look for jobs and even buying me random gifts the whole time I was there.    

Chuck lived right on the border of a national forest, and in his youth had cleared dozens of ""trails"" through miles of thick pine scrub and swampland. I say ""trails"" in quotation marks because most of them were either half-assed dead ends, or labyrnthine mazes that occasionally became overgrown in certain areas, making them appear to be dead-ends when closer examination revealed them to be only the tip of the iceberg. And of course he never knew which was which, but I loved getting him to take me out there after I rolled us a nice fat blunt or two. Especially at night, with a backpack of Canadian Mist whiskey and a couple of flashlights.    


	******************************************************    

 On this particular night, we were not even that far out. We were only in his driveway-which wasn't more sophisticated or populated than his ""trails"". It was a long, sandy dirt road hacked through two miles of forest decades before, with only one shady-ass neighbor halfway down, who just sat on his porch in his underwear all day with a shotgun and a far-off stare . We were a little ways past his house, toward the back-country road that he lived off of. It's hard to explain just how far from civilization we actually were, except to say that we were about half an hour fby car rom the closest gas station.   
We were sitting on a rotten log	, near a swamp that the ""driveway"" curved around, deep enough behind the scrub that no one would have seen us from the dirt road even on a bright day. We were smoking a tiny joint of some pathetic dirt weed that I'd had to walk ten miles down the road to pick up the day before. It was a large amount, but it was hardly worth it.   
 
""We're white trash, you know that?"" Chuck said. ""I mean, even if I do finish my degree in Neuroscience, there's no hiding it. I don't feel comfortable in anything but a wife beater and gym shorts.""    

""Don't sweat it, man,"" I said, puffing and holding it in, ""You're the smartest guy I've ever met. Your always talking about like, neurons and Roman history and shit. The people that matter will see past all that.""    

""I guess you're right, but it's pretty impossible to find anyone else with the same interests out here. I've yet to make any college friends, and at this point in my life I'll never be acclimate to a big city. Or even a little city, for that matter. Even a town, really."" 
   
""Well, your cool with me bro. Only my buddy Chuck would smoke some shwag with me in the middle of the woods while we sat on a dead body.""      

""JESUS CHRIST!"" He shouted, shooting up and looking down behind him. I really miss fucking with him. ""I hate you, Hunter,"" he said.    

I lit a cigarette and stared at the moon for a while. It was a beautiful, mild winter night, just windy enough to put on long pants. In those days, nothing mattered but being out in the wild with my friends, and the isolation was a welcome repreive from the madness of my dysfunctional family and the ubiquitous judgemental stares of the old bastards that the rest of Florida is notorious for.     

Jerry started growling. Pitbull though he was, I'd never heard him make anything but panting and mewling noises until that night.     

""A canine, nonetheless!"" Chuck laughed. It was an inside joke between the two of us- something that a mutual friend had shouted upon seeing a K-9 officer parked on the side of the road. But a primal instinct kept me from laughing.     

""SHUSH,"" I said quietly but firmly as I watched the shadows moving suspiciously. The moon's reflection on the sugar sand and pine needles glowed like porcelain, obscured by a thousand jet black shadows from palms and pines. Listening closely, I could hear something making a sound like an old man smacking his tongue against the roof of his dry mouth. Something was moving slowly in the direction the dog was staring, and as soon as I focused on it, it craned its head up like stock-footage of a meerkat.      

Jerry started barking like crazy, and Chuck managed to point our flashlight at the thing. Staring up at us was what appeared to be a gigantic naked mole rat, about four feet high with a human-looking pink body and hands. For some reason, instead of frightened, it made me angry. How dare this hideous creature intrude on our nice night?!    
   
""GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" I screamed, running headlong at the creature. Chuck must have thought I was talking to him, as the light suddenly retreated towards his house. It was just me and Jerry now, both on all fours, screaming and charging through the brush. I don't know if it ran, or if in the darkness I had simply barrelled past it, but after a while I realized the creature was gone. The tongue-thrashing noises had stopped. ""AND DON'T YOUR ASS COME BACK NOW, NEITHER,"" I shouted into the night.       

         *******************************************************

The next morning, Chuck didn't say a word to me or his parents. I don't think he even bothered to take a shower, he just hopped out of his bed and into his car, straight to school. I finished up the last of the Canadian whiskey from the night before, and suddenly the anger came back from the night before. It evaporated, however, when Chuck's mother, miss Chinaski, offered me some home-made pickled pigs feet for breakfast.       

""Chuck didn't even bother to say goodbye,"" she said. ""That's unusual. Oh well, more pigfoot for us!""     
God I love pickled pigs feet. The Chinaskis weren't exactly farmers- Mr. Chinaski owned a greenhouse in which he grew ornamental flowers that he sold to Wal-Mart and other major retailers in bulk- but every month they would drive up to a farm twenty miles away and stock up on various cheap meats, such as pigs feet, goats head, cow tripe, etc. Ms. Chinaski could make an awful lot with an offal lot, I tell you what.    

""Mr. Thompson,"" Mr. Chinaski walked in, eyeing me suspiciously, smiling and pulling his overalls over his potbelly to rest loosely on his boyish chest. ""What were you boys getting up to last night?""      
""We just took Jerry for a walk,"" I said. ""Why, what's the haps?""      

""AHA!"" He shouted playfully, ""So. . . did the little mongrel get into anything?""     
""Not that I know of. Why do you ask?""    

""Hmmm. Well, something has been eating my fertilizer. I guess I'm glad it's not Jerry, all that phosphate's probably not good for him. Light him up like a Lightin' Bug, Guar-an-teed,"" he said, rubbing his chins thoughtfully.    

""Holy crap,"" I said. ""What would possibly eat fertilizer?""   

""Big plant?"" He shrugged.    

	******************************************************* 

That night, Chuck decided he wanted to talk about the mole-rat man. ""So, what the fuck was that?"", I believe his exact words were.    
""Well I don't want to scare you dude, but I think it was half mole-rat, half man. And it might be eating your dad's fertilizer.""    
I showed him some pictures on his computer of naked mole rats, and he concurred that they did look like a tiny, less anthropomorphic version of the monster we saw. We also Googled ""What eats fertilizer,"" but we didn't find anything more enlightening than ""Big plants?"".    
Just thinking about the creature made me irrationally angry. That night I had a dream about it wearing my mothers clothes and jewelry, making out with her scumbag boyfriend and making that terrible tongue-flailing noise.    
I was sleeping on an air mattress in Chuck's room that night, instead of my cot in the garage- we'd fallen asleep watching Adult Swim on cartoon network, neither one of us really felt like being alone that night- and when I woke up I was punching the air. Chuck was wide awake and staring at me.   
""Dude, WTF,"" he said. ""You just kept saying, 'I'll rip your throat out you bastard' over and over again. Was it mole-rat man?""     
I didn't see the point in lying. ""Yes,""  I said, ""he makes me really mad for some reason. Do you get that reaction from him?""     
He considered it for a minute, then said, ""No, it's more of a pants-shitting terror for me. I don't know if I want to go back out there anytime soon.""      
When he said that, I was livid. I couldn't smoke in his house, and I sure as Hell didn't want to go outside alone. But going outside and wandering in the woods was really the only thing to do when Chuck was at school. ""This pussy-meat mole-monster is ruining my life,"" I said, punching the air mattress. It instantly started deflating.     
""Duuuude, not cool,"" Chuck said.         

	*********************************************************  

A few days later, we woke up to Chuck's dad stomping and shouting about holes.     
"". . . And this dirty ol' ankle biter was just diggin' in the damn yard! As soon as I hollered at him he scampered off like he was on drugs or sumpin,"" I heard him talking to Mrs. Chinaski in the other room.    
I wandered outside groggily for my first cigarette of the day, and saw exactly what he was talking about. A dozen shallow holes, like big armadillo holes, were dug around his greenhouse.      
Just out of curiosity, I pushed back the creaky steel door that served as entrance to the half-acre building of wood and black shadecloth. Not for the first time, I thought about how underneath the thigh-high metal beds of plants would be a too-perfect hiding spot for a monster, serial killer - or moleman. On the few occasions that we had let Jerry roam around the greenhouse, we had lost him for hours underneath the hundreds of thousands of plants, occasionally rushing past our feet from underneath one bed or another like  snake in the grass.     
As Mr. Chinaski had said, there were holes in the fifty pound bags of blue fertilizer, and little blue pellets strewn all around them, both inside and out. After I was done investigating, I went back inside to find Mr. Chinaski on the phone with someone, sounding uncharacteristicly agitated.    
""Yes, I'm sure it was one of your kids. Who else could it have been? I think they might have been h-whackin' off in my greenhouse too, I swear I felt one of their dirty little hands try to grab my ankle last night.""    
He must have been talking to someone down the road, I thought. Of course he wouldn't have seen the moleman. He was one of the most logical people I had ever met- even if he had gotten a good look at the him, his brain would have said ""naked child neighbor"", just to save his sanity.     
""Mr. Chinaski,"" I said, ""there's something I need to tell you when you get off the phone.""    
Maybe it wasn't a great idea- I was sure he was going to accuse me of being a druggie and kick me out- but I told him about the naked mole-rat man we had seen a few nights before. Maybe just because he was such a great guy, he actually gave me the benefit of the doubt.   
""Well if that isn't the most spine-chillin' thing I ever heard,"" he said after a thoughtful pause. ""Gives me the heebie jeebies. And your sure you aint just been smokin' them left-hand cigarettes?""    
What I almost said was, ""So what, there's a goddamn moleman on the lose!""      
Fortunately, what I did say was, ""No sir.""     
He unlocked his gun cabinet and pulled out sixteen shells and a 30-06. ""Well, I guess I know what I'm doing tonight,"" he sighed, shaking off a visible chill, "" I aint gonna shoot a kid, but . . . fuck molerats."" This was the first and last time I'd ever heard him curse.     
     
	  ***********************************************     

Mr. Chinaski held a vigil in his tree stand that night, and Chuck and I waited for word in the garage, drinking malt liquor, doing whipp-its and watching Beavis and Butthead on an old VCR. There is truly no better way to appreciate the beauty of the show.   
""So What do you think, Hunter? I mean, what are the chances he actually kills the thing, even if he sees it? And does it make it more or less terrifying if we have a mole-rat man's carcass on our hands? What if it's just a really hideous, mentally-handicapped person and he goes to prison for murder?"" That last question made us both laugh pretty hard, but it was probably just the nitrous oxide.    
""Don't worry,"" I said. ""You're dad's a smart guy, so worst case scenario: he shoots and misses. At least then maybe the bastard will think twice about hangin' round here again.""    
A lot of people get freaked out when they see a balloon of nitrous being passed around- and in most cases where you are inhaling a drug in gaseous form, you're looking at something that's going to cause brain damage- but it's actually a pretty safe, short-acting drug. It's basically a mild analgesic that happens to come in gas form. As long as you make sure that you are getting oxygen as well (as simple as remembering to get a breath of actual air every thirty seconds or so), it's not going to kill you.     
Now that that little pro-drug PSA is out of the way, I will recount to you how I got way to fucked up on nitrous that night and knocked over Chuck's cockroach collection, spreading hundreds of cockroaches all over my cot. I'm pretty sure that's the worst thing that's ever happened to someone from doing whipp-its, right after that guy who killed himself by filling a garbage bag with the stuff and putting it over his head.     
Chuck had been (rather succesfully) breeding cockroaches to use in an art project with one of our mutual friends, a photographer/ drug dealer who called himself ""Puppet"". His work never did take off, but he had some really interesting ideas for ""Images that no one has ever seen before."" He wanted to take pictures of hot girls naked and covered in cockroaches, and while he was busy finding hot girls (I'm not sure if that ever did really pan out), He assigned Chuck the important responsibility of breeding cockroaches.     
""OH NOOOOO,"" We both screamed as one as the irridescent little monsters scuttled over my cot and into the cracked walls of the garage. Without saying a word, we both flew into a rage and started breaking things. When I asked him about it the next morning, he put it into words more elegantly than I ever could: ""Our lives aren't working out exactly the way we planned, are they?""     

	  **********************************************************    

Turns out, everyone had dreams about the mole-rat man that night; even Mrs. Chinaski. In her dream, the creature had scuttled in and stolen her freshly baked cookies. For Mr. Chinaski, the dream involved killing the creature, only for it to fall apart in his hands when he tried to carry it back to the house, and punching a wall until his hands fell off.  
In Chuck's dream, It just sat there in his driveway, looking up at him and picking its nose while he locked the doors to his car and huddled under the passenger seat. In my dream, it was watching me masturbate while watching ""Wheel of Fortune."" I didn't notice it was there until it attempted to solve one of the puzzles in a high-pitched, childish voice- at which point I woke up screaming and picking roaches off of myself. I didn't tell anyone about my dream.     
Mr. Chinaski came in with his gun and exhaustedly recounted the events of the night. While he didn't see anything, he did hear something making slurping, tongue-sloshing sounds in the woods. He admitted that they had made him irrationally angry, because they reminded him of the noises his father had made when he was dying of lung cancer. ""Plus, it was just annoying after a while,"" he added.    
At this point, we were all tired of being scared of such a stupid thing. Every night I would take Chuck and  Jerry into the woods to smoke, and we would go further and further each time, hoping we would encounter the things again and hopefully beat the living hell out of it. But it wasn't until one night in particular that we saw it again.     
One of the old trails that Chuck had carved out led to a prehistoric-looking swamp, filled with dragonflies, sideways oak trees, and gigantic ferns that were bigger than the average person.  ""This is as good a place as any,"" he said, pulling a hypodermic needle out of his pocket.    
""What is that, heroin?"" I asked.   
""No, dude, it's anabolic steroids,"" He said, flexing his scrawny arms. ""Nah, it's actually crushed up oxycontin in saline solution.""    
""Holy shit, that's worse,"" I said. Honestly, needles are about where I draw the line anyway, but that just sounded horrible. ""You do what you want man, but I've seen enough of that shit in my lifetime. Believe me when I say that road is a dead end, and comes with no glowing recommendation from me.""     
Ignoring me, he shot himself up- amateurishly, missing the vein twice- and sat down on a log, his face a mixture of apprehension and excitement, fading slowly into a goofy grin. He sat there a minute without saying a word, then started staring behind me.   
""Hey, look who it is, "" he giggled. Something about the way he said that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up, and looking down at Jerry I could see something was giving him a similar reaction. ""GGGrrrrrrrrr,"" I heard him whispering.     
Looking up, two pink eyes were looking at me from inside the cavernous hole in a cypress tree. When my eyes focused in the darkness, I could make out the things whole body, sitting slumped over in the tree's cave. When I stepped toward it, it started making a more high-pitched, chittering noise than it had before. *That must be its warning sound,* I thought. *It's fucking threatening me*.    
Not thinking twice, I broke off the biggest branch I could find off of a downed pine and charged toward the damnable beast. I began beating it down with my fists, closing my eyes to avoid looking at the hairless abomination. Halfway through I dropped the branch, realizing that I hadn't used it as a weapon once- that it had only served as a confidence booster.    
When I opened my eyes, I saw the worst thing possible: Chuck's broken and bloody face smiling up at me. ""Pain is . . .ecccccstasssssy,"" he mumbled.     
""Said like a true fucking cunt,"" I said, and hit him again. I could hear the chittering again in the darkness, and this time I knew what it meant. It was laughing at me.     

	*********************************************************************

It was really hard to explain to Chuck's parents why their son was so messed up, in more ways than one. I explained that he had been attacked and traumatized by the mole-rat man, which was half true, anyway. HIs mom cried immediately, and his father eyed me suspiciously, then said, ""That dirty rat. This won't do at all."" They just seemed. . . defeated.    
After I put Chuck to bed, I sat outside the garage, staring into the early morning and smoking one of those cheap cigarettes that looks and smells like it was wrapped in a strip of paper bag. Thinking.   
It occured to me that whatever this thing was, it was feeding off of our anger. It was the only reason I could imagine why it made everyone so irrationally angry, and why it kept showing up in our thoughts and dreams. *Or maybe,* I thought, *I'm just a drug-addled loser, who is letting his imagination ruin his friend's life.*    
Could it be possible, that somehow this was all my fault? I couldn't imagine myself digging holes in the yard or chewing on fertilizer in my sleep, but was it really that much more far-fetched than some cryptozoological creep hunting my friend's family? Somehow, though, this explanation seemed both too simple, and too complex. I ashed on an ancient lawn gnome, and wondered who exactly was meant to see these lawn ornaments in the middle of the woods.    
 
	   ******************************************************************   

I woke up to the Chinaski family yorkie going crazy. I looked over my shoulder to make sure Jerry was still sleeping next to me and not raping the poor thing again, and then groaned in frustration when I saw his hackles raise. *It's the damn thing again,* I thought. If it was, I wanted to be sure this was the night I ended it. I opened side door to the garage and, sure enough, there stood a four foot tall naked mole-rat man, only a few feet outside.   
For the first time I saw the things full body from the light of the garage, its dry, cracking skin covered sparsely in thin spurts of blonde hair every few inches. I held out its human-like hands, as if expecting me to give it something. This close I could even smell the thing, a musty and antiseptic odor not unlike a year old jizz-sock. I felt the anger rising up in me again, but this time I was determined to fight it. That's when the fear came.   
""What do you want?"" I asked.    
It looked beyond me, towards Jerry, and made a shaky, spastically robotic come-hither motion. It was chittering again, a sound that made my stomach drop. Jerry ran past me, and too late I realized what was happening.  
""NO!"" I shouted into the night, but they had already disappeared into the dark and endless woods that started ten yards from the door. Once, on Google Maps, Chuck and I had tried to find the end of those woods.  We discovered that in some areas they stretched out all the way to Daytona Beach, two hours away. They could be anywhere. And I already knew that one way or another, Jerry was never coming back.    
I told everyone in the house, even Chuck, that Jerry had simply run away. They tried to help me look for him, but I wasn't hopeful. I didn't mention the mole-rat man again, partly because I didn't want to think of him, and partly because part of me hoped that he'd gotten what he'd wanted and gone away. And then a part of me, the part of me that wanted to see Jerry again, hoped that this was not the case.
   
	*********************************************************************   

I moved out a few months later, and went to live and work part-time with a cattle rancher near the university I am still currently studying at. As far as I know, no one has seen or heard from the naked mole-rat man since. Sometimes when I talk to Chuck, he makes jokes about it. Of course he does; it happened a long time ago, and he has no way of knowing that thing took my best friend away from me.    
I don't know what became of Jerry. Sometimes, when I'm feeling optimistic, I wonder if maybe the creature was some kind of Vengeful First-Nation God or Trickster Spirit, that makes people turn on each other and then frees their domesticated animals, and then takes them on amazing adventures through the forest. But I very much doubt that. That is not the feeling I got from that entity at all.      
I remember you, Jerry. I remember the way you would put your paw over your face whenever you had to use the bathroom in front of people; the way you would beg for a cigarette but never for food; the way you chased dragon flies in the forest; the way you humped that Yorkshire Terrier like a goddamned king.    
And when I graduate next year with my Masters in Ethnobotany and start walking the Appalachian Trail, aside from weed, smudge sticks, and religious icons, I'm going to be taking a picture of you. And if I see that mole-rat man again, he's going to have to answer for what he done.

3xlm64,2,2015-12-20,TIFU by losing at FIFA,the-enlightened,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3xlm64/tifu_by_losing_at_fifa/,"This happened back in May. I've been a lurker for quite a while now but just recently made an account. So a little background - I am a university student, absolutely adore FIFA (online 1st division champion) and can get very competitive. I always admit defeat if someone beat me fair and square but a lot of the times its because of stupid game errors and that really annoys me. I also have a slightly darker side where I love listening to psychedelic music and writing. 


So I had recently secured an internship, and was going home from Uni to pack my bags and get everything ready to go. I was extremely happy since it was fairly hard to get one being a sophomore. The night before I was leaving Uni, I decided to invite a few friends over to play FIFA and have some beers; a chill night before I leave for a few months. So a few of my friends come over, we're playing FIFA, having a couple of beers and it's all very friendly. I play someone one-on-one and it starts to get competitive between us. And it is at this point that FIFA starts to get really annoying (he got a goal because of the stupidest deflection and I had about 4-5 shots on the post). I end up losing the game so I ask for a replay. He beats me again, partly because of his skill and partly because I am just playing a bad game. Now I'm starting to get frustrated, and I go over to get another beer but they're all finished so I open the half-full bottle of Vodka and start chugging it. In retrospect, this was probably the worst decision of my night. So now this is where my memories start to get hazy. We stop playing FIFA, and watch some Netflix, eating some food and just hanging out and I take this opportunity to become a dick to everyone in the room. I am making jokes about everything which are either pathetic or very slightly funny. I pick up my friends' shoes and start throwing them across the apartment, I'm throwing random stuff at everyone. I'm also yelling at people at the top of my lungs about how I can crush each and everyone of them at FIFA.


Now something you should know at this point is that I recently started watching a show called Hannibal (introduced to me by my roommate). At this point in the night, my roommate starts to play with the fact that I'm drunk. He tells me I'm shit at FIFA anyways (and just btw, we barely get along). And my immediate response is to tell him how I'm going to do things to him in his sleep worse than Hannibal does...and in an extremely descriptive way. And then I go over to him, slam him, and pin him to the ground. And I'm saying 'haha fuck you man!' the entire time. After literally 10 mins of pinning him to the floor, I get up and tell him he should have fought back. I also say how everything I was saying about Hannibal was a joke all along. 


Fast forward to 4 a.m. in the morning I suddenly regain consciousness. My roommate and another friend are still in the living room, and a realisation hits me about what I have done. Turns out I finished the half bottle of vodka, I embarrassed myself in front of all my friends who literally went home one by one as I kept throwing their stuff around the apartment. I still haven't talked to two of them since then. And as for my roommate, all he was trying to do was calm me down and turns out I was straight up sitting on top of him for a good 10 minutes while talking to a friend still at my place. Scared my roommate that I was going to eat his limbs once I ripped them off his body and how I wonder which part of his body would taste the best. After apologising to him for 30 minutes I finally passed out only to wake up and find that I had missed my bus back home.

As you can imagine, I haven't played FIFA since. 


TL;DR: As a result of losing at FIFA, got drunk and embarrassed myself in front of all my friends. Scared my roommate that I was going to fry his limbs in hot oil before I add some Srichacha to them. And ended up missing my bus to go back home from Uni. "

I performed well in community college and transferred to a top public school for Computer Science. I struggled very hard in the upper division courses and graduated with a 2.0 GPA. Although I did okay in lower division programming classes with an insane amount of help from others, I simply drowned in upper division coursework. I essentially got carried on all the projects by smarter students. During senior year I got so discouraged and burned out that I studied just enough to pass classes. I didn't work on personal projects or take online classes. The only actual programming I did was at work.

I worked as a backend developer intern throughout senior year and my boss said that my programming skills are weak. He said I was methodical in my process and worked very hard, but I didn't understand problems well enough to solve them. This discouraged me a lot because I tried hard to improve on the job, but when he realized my skills weren't great, he stopped helping me. And for a while I seriously struggled with the job. 

I graduated, studied for the technical interviews, and got a job at a big company in the Silicon Valley. Although I struggled a bit during the technical interview (4 hours long!), I displayed a huge amount of enthusiasm for learning and the company's mission, and that might have been what got me the job.

I'm still going through training, but I'm terrified of having to start doing real work. The project is significantly more intricate than anything I've ever coded and the code base is a monster. I barely graduated college and don't know how I'll ever be able to contribute anything meaningful to it. But on the other hand, this company is doing exactly what I wanted to do with my career and I'm hell-bent on becoming a better programmer and learning because I genuinely do want to be a useful addition to the team and contribute to this project.

I show up early, leave late, try to soak up as much knowledge as I can, ask my coworkers questions, take notes during meetings, and spend an extra hour or two at home catching up. However despite trying so hard sometimes its obvious that I haven't fully thought through a problem or done good enough research before asking for help, and that's something I need to work on.

I'm not in it for the money. My position doesn't even pay that well. But its like a switch went off in my mind. I went from being indifferent about being sub par in college to wanting so desperately to be a good programmer. But I feel like the train has left the station. It's too late to catch up, and at some point people will realize I'm actually an idiot and fire me.

Obviously my solution is to practice more. Spend more time programming, reading books, taking online classes. But what else can I do to quickly ramp up and suck less?"

I graduated about a year ago with my chem eng degree.  I did an internship with a petrochemical company as a process engineer.  Now I'm a lab tech in R&amp;D working on soft drink bottle designs.

&amp;nbsp;

None of my experiences were anything i was particularly fond of.  I really enjoy coming up with creative problem solving solutions.  The process engineering job I had, I noticed that people were all interested in maintaining the status quo and not taking risks. I HATE it when people say we have done this for the last 20 years were not going to try anything new.  I was at a plant that was being run into the ground with little maintenance. With my current job, I am just a lowly tech so my opinion doesnt go very far.  I am also only a contract worker so Ill need to find a new career path in a few months. 

&amp;nbsp;

Despite being a chem eng, i really enjoy coding. I was teaching myself some basics after I graduated having minimal exposure in my classes (other than matlab). I have always been very interested in computers (both hardware and software) .  My primary reasoning for chem eng was renewable energy but there arent many jobs for recent graduates.  People have suggested design engineering and consulting but I know very little as to what that entails and how to get my foot in the door.  I am going to be taking the FE soon and possibly the GRE also depending on what would help me advance my career the most.

I'm supposed to be working with him to get results on a few tests we run. I'm just an intern, but he's a technician. He isn't a software engineer. So I think he hates me just because I'm interning as a software engineer. But basically, whenever I ask him for results via IM he doesn't really respond. He was tasked with setting up three additional systems for me, but he never did it and I had to wait four days for someone else to do it. It made me look bad because my manager kept asking me why the systems weren't up yet, and I didn't want to throw this guy under the bus, so I took some heat for it. 

When I went to ask him for results in person, another coworker and him were talking about Star Wars and he pretty much was very rude and told me that he'll report results on his own time and that I don't need to ask him for them. And then when he told me what build he was running, it turns out that he hadn't even read my instructions properly and was running the build incorrectly. 

This guy complains about his pay and his lack of appreciation, and I've been trying to give him credit for the results he's supposed to be getting us, but I end up doing everything myself or asking other people to do his work. I'm supposed to have a leadership role because software engineers have more responsibilities than the technicians where I work, but he refuses to acknowledge that and treats me as if he's above me in authority. So how can I deal with it? Should I be aggressive and mean and tough the next time I ask him for something? Should I tell my manager first? Should I just tell him that I'm not understanding his attitude and that I'm trying to help HIM out? So far I've been very nice and maybe I look like a push over to him, but I need to get those fucking results and I no longer want to look bad because of someone else. I've been doing my job but I feel like maybe it doesn't look like it because the person who is supposed to be testing the builds and getting results refuses to be responsive or dependable. What is the professional way to deal with this kind of horseshit? It's honestly making the entire internship a toxic experience for me. It's a toxic environment because of this."

If you see this, https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t35.0-12/12415471_10208265624615617_766656016_o.jpg?oh=d3096a0076cd1fc87b4aa009b3abd314&amp;oe=56796570

since 2000 prices have basically being going up yearly by as much as 14%.

Just this past Jan we moved into a new house (we booked it with a builder) and our homes' value went from 450 to nearly 500k already.  450k got us a semi-detached with 1900 sq.ft.

Im a university student and I just got an intern placement for 16 months that pays really well, way above average for an intern pay. 

This intern placement is very assuring of my future prospects and my family wants to book a new home (another builder is making a new home subdivison 2 minutes from where we live).

The thing is, im scared as hell. Prices have clearly been going up by like 10% every year, but nobody's salary goes up 10% a year!

My mom was trying to tell me how prices are going to keep going up and by the time im done college they will be so high and its better if we book a house now at the current prices.

Her logic is, back in 2004 we had the option to buy a new home but this same logic of market crashing ended up with us having to pay 450k in 2014 for something we couldve bought for literally half in 2004. (We finally booked a new home after overcoming that fear in ~2013-2014)

Doesn't there have to be a ""stop"" somewhere? The prices can't just increase this much every year forever and I dont want to end up in the situation where say we book a new house, then the market crashes and well, theres goes a few hundred thousand dollars. But then again I also dont want to end up paying more later than i have to if it means the prices are just going to keep going up.

Not sure what to do. I live with a fam of 5 in our current semi-detached of 1900 sq.ft. The new house costs nearly 700k but its detached and 2600 sq. ft. I'm just scared of losing money incase market crashes because to me..this is unsustanable the constant increases."

My situation is that I am the youngest (22) person in the my team. Everyone is 35+. It's great that I can learn a lot from them, but I feel I can't really relate to them. They have children, houses, etc.


I feel like I'm learning a lot, but I also feel like I'm missing an element in the workplace. I'm not making any real friends in this environment (by friends I mean friends that I can hangout with/do fun projects after work). There is no social event in my team or any of that nature.. Maybe I'm not a good fit?

I guess my real question is how important do colleagues impact your work life. Does social event/social interaction outside of work with colleagues matter to you guys? Or is it just a job, once you're done with your daytime hours, you don't interact with them after hours."

3xqhbf,5,2015-12-21,Former boss won't pay me out.,silkyjohnson6,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3xqhbf/former_boss_wont_pay_me_out/,"Edit: Sorry for the wall of text. There is a TL;DR at the bottom. Also this occurred in Alberta, Canada

So about a year and a half ago (June 2014) I needed to finish a month long practicum so I could get my diploma in video production. I found a small production house that worked perfect for me. There was only the Owner/Executive Produce (I will refer to him as ""Boss"" now) myself, and another young part time intern. I enjoyed working there because I wasn't shoehorned into one job and got to work on all parts of production. Video editing, animation, audio, camerawork and more. Even though we were not getting many jobs or contracts it was still a good learning experience for me because I had access to the software and could practice. 

After my one month practicum was over my boss decided to keep me on as an assosciate producer. He couldn't afford to pay me much but I was fine with that as I was more interested in the experience. We agreed to start at $1500/month while I worked there full time. We still weren't getting many jobs but there was plenty of work to be done around the studio. I ran many errands around town picking up supplies. I answered all the calls to the studio. I helped set up a web T.V show with him and even helped out with renovations (building an editing suite, soundproofing the room, switching offices around multiple times, painting, ripping up carpet, wiring internet and speakers).

Over the course of this time my boss kept on assuring me that I would get a pay raise as soon as we got more jobs and he was very appreciative that I was helping him out for so little. A couple times he couldn't pay me on time as he was waiting for a cheques to clear and I didn't complain. He said he was very thankful and wouldn't forget how helpful and understanding I was being. He would talk about the future of the company like I was a part of it and that we we're building something together. (I had no money in the company so I knew I wasn't fully in it, but he led me to believe that I got in on the ""ground floor"" as he stated many times) 

I started to feel a little insecure about the money about a year into working there as I felt I had no real financial security and since I had been making so little not a lot of savings to really fall back on. I addressed my concerns and he agreed and said I would get a raise to $1650 a month. That was nice but I was more worried about the security aspect and asked for him to draw up an employee/contractors contract (I had been getting paid by cheque and cashing it in as a contractor). He said of course He'll get his lawyer to draw one up, but he assured me it wasn't really necessary and I could trust him.

A few more months rolled by and we still weren't getting any new contracts. He brought on his ""Actor"" friend (I use the term loosly because he really hasn't done anything) to be a Producer and writer. He then cut the other young part timers hours back but my assured me he was keeping me on. Finally my boss let go the other young guy over a pretty minor thing (borrowed a tripod and put it away wrong). This wasn't the first hasty firing I had seen him do as he'd had falling outs with 2 D.O.P's (Director of Photography) he hired and with two seperate marketing companies we were supposed to be partners with. After the firing he still assured me that I was being kept on and I was helping build something. He even raised my pay to $1750

About a month later we had a shoot for a commercial. I packed everything up the day before as my boss and his ""actor"" friend sat in his new office that I just finished fixing up doing nothing. The next morning (Saturday) of the shoot we get there and it turns out I messed up. I forgot to pack a microphone cable. That could've been a big deal but the shoot didn't start for another hour and we were close enough to the studio that the ""actor"" could run back and get it before it was a huge problem. So he went back and got it and the 18 hour shoot went smoothly after that.

After the shoot we had a brief conversation about it where I apologized and accepted blame, I did fuck up after all. He agreed that I fucked up but it still worked out and we went back to the studio, unpacked and he said he'd see me on Monday.

Monday (Oct 19)  rolls around and I show up in the morning. He calls me into his office and said he has to let me go as things aren't working. I'm obviously rattled as I thought I had some sort of job security, compounded on the fact that I was getting major knee surgery in a week which he knew about, and didn't think I fucked up that bad. He assured me he would pay me the rest of my monthly paycheque.

A week later I texted him asking if I could come in and get a post dated cheque because I wanted to have all my stuff together before my surgery as I was gonna be out of commision for a few days/weeks. He said he would e-transfer me the money on Nov 1. I said I would rather have the cheque but he insisted on the e-transfer.

Nov 3 rolls around and still no e-transfer. I send him a text and he has a little freakout telling me to be patient and not press the issue. He says I fucked up the camerawork so bad he had to push the completion date for the commercial back (He never said anything about this before when he was reviewing footage or the first time I texted him over a week after the shoot) He said as soon as the cheque for the commercial clears he will pay me out.

I was very patient after that. I waited 6 weeks until I texted him again. When I texted him I got no reply. texted him again no reply. Finally on the third one he replys ""The busniess has gone belly up. Sorry man."" Now I feel bad. I didn't think I messed up the camerawork at all but maybe it fucked up the whole contract ad put him out of business. That guilt quickly faded though as that night him and the company uploaded the commercials to facebook, and the camerwork looked fine!

I text him the next day asking what was up. The commercials were completed and the cheque was obviously cashed but I still haven't got paid. Radio silence. I have texted and tried to call him but have gotten no response since he uploaded the commercial. 

Even if he is going out of business I worked on that commercial and if he got paid for it he has to pay me out. I know I shafted myself by not getting anything put in writing but I can prove he was paying my salary through my bank statements and have text messages from him saying that he would pay me as soon as the cheque for that commercial cleared.



TL;DR



I worked for a guy for a year and a half. I got paid a meager monthly salary. Since it was a small operation and since I was assured that I would be taken care of I never pushed very hard to get an employment contract (I did ask for one though and he did say he would draft one up). I made a minor mistake on a commercial shoot on Oct 17 and was fired on the 19. He said he would pay me for the whole month of october on Nov 1. Nov 1 rolls around and no money. Text him on nov 3 asking about it and he says as soon as the cheque is cashed for the commercial I'll get paid. Text him 6 weeks later on dec 17 and get a reply saying the business went belly up and he cant pay me. That night he uploads the commercials I worked on onto facebook and since then he has gone radio silent. Not returning calls. Not returning texts.

Am I entitled to anything or since I have nothing in writing am I fucked? I knew I was being naive but I didn't expect to get taken advantage of like this.

Overall for my term in college, I didn't do too horrible and finished with a 2.84 GPA. My hardest class was Physics 1 which I finished with a C- in and after that my next lowest grade was a B- in my Calc 1 class and my other classes were all A's. I enjoyed certain aspects of engineering, but over the course of the semester I've found that solely focusing my studies on just electrical over the next four years may not be the best fit for me. I know that during my career I want to be able to apply myself in multiple ways so I can eventually go into the business and management side of engineering, as I don't want to spend my entire working life doing a technical job. I know engineering is a lot of experience, and I was thinking that instead of solely focusing on one specific aspect, that I could benefit from studying both business and a field of engineering that's less time consuming to obtain a degree in during my undergraduate years.

My purpose for writing this posts is to get some advice on where to go from here. At the moment I'm considering changing to a double major with both computer science and general business, as coding has always been one of my interest and is an extremely important technical skill to have, while business is a background that can only benefit people in the job market. Since a lot of engineering has to do with experience, I know that by using my CS degree I can still get internships during the summers between my spring and fall terms, therefore adding to my technical experience, and that my business degree can only open up more possibilities for a career path that just solely focusing on one aspect of engineering.

This subreddit has been extremely helpful during my first semester and has given me tons of insight to what engineering really is, and I thought that going here for some of your guys' advice would be beneficial for me when making my decisions for my academic future. Thanks guys!"

However the problem is they want me to learn how to do something mainly because I live close by. I want to do it but it's really complicated and could take a long time to learn. I don't know if I really have that kind of time with bills and all.

What I enjoy doing is video editing but it seems assistant video editors have to have almost 5-10 years experience in the industry to be assistant editors. The one that was recently hired is 34 years old.

I am currently 26 but still have a lot of bills to pay plus aging parents that have increasing medical costs because of their age.
I have a degree in film in video and have studied Film producing which involves pre-production, budgeting, and the like in terms of school projects. 

I have had two internships where I did both physical production with cameras and post production with different types of video editing software.

I really like computers and really enjoyed doing video editing.

But because the whole ""Do what you love"" thing doesn't pay the bills anymore I need to find something that I can do with the skills I have.

I know I don't want to do sales, I am bad at it, I have anxiety about it and I spend more time trying to help someone than sell them something for commission. 

I'd like to do something maybe administrative or computer related but I just don't know what I can do with my current skill set where someone will actually pay me.

I live in Chicago is that makes any difference for this post.

I think I went into this process with my head up my ass. I thought I was a super well qualified candidate and then my dream school rejected me, 2 good Catholic schools deferred me, and so far I had only gotten into one small Catholic school which would be 100% FULL PAY
Then... I got a phonecall that an SEC school offered me a full ride.
So now my college agenda looks like this
Fordham - accepted (no money)
Boston College - deferred
Notre Dame - deferred
Full ride to SEC school (can't say which yet)
And I am waiting on GW, UF, Georgetown, and UChicago

I guess I was waiting for that OMG I GOT INTO X SCHOOL! moment and I may not ever come. Anyways - since I was to go to law school (and that is hella expensive) should I just take the full ride to the SEC school even thought I'm not crazy about it? Or should I throw a few more hooks out there (any recommended schools for PoliSci would be great!) Idk. I need some unbiased advice for once.

3xwar0,4,2015-12-22,Problems with job search as a senior,SUCK_MY_DICTIONARY,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3xwar0/problems_with_job_search_as_a_senior/,"Hey all, wondering if anyone has stories or advice in this category.

I've been searching for a job recently to no avail. Every info graphic I see puts Electrical Engineering high on the list of most wanted degrees.

I've put in probably 20-30 applications, I've had about 4 interviews. And every single interview felt like they were looking for someone that wasn't me, and even when I said ""I've had good experiences in the past learning new unfamiliar topics."" they tend to not really be too interested after that point.

For instance, yesterday I had a full interview that started out with a software programming test for 2 simple functions in C++, Java, C# or a couple others I didn't know.

I know C++ a decent amount, but my last class was Sophomore year. The rest I haven't learned. The EE department at my school doesn't give credit for CompSci classes. I have kept up on programming languages but mostly LabVIEW and recently Python. So asking me to do these other ones kind of got me a little antsy.

I go through the interview and they ask me about hardware, analog and digital. I nailed all those questions. But when the last guy comes in, the big boss, he throws the programming test in front of me and I got it mostly right but it wasn't exactly syntactically correct and I forgot to do an input check for negative numbers, so he sort of gave me that attitude like I didn't know the first thing about software....okay.

And in general, what seemed to be a great interview ended up feeling pretty poor at the end because we closed on a note that showed what I can't do while completely disregarding the fact that if he had asked me to do the same thing in Verilog, VHDL, Python, LabVIEW, etc., I would have knocked it out of the park. He also didn't comment on my ability in hardware, when it seemed a lot like they needed someone good at hardware and I was a really good fit.

For reference, I've had 3 internships. I've studied abroad. My GPA is a 3.4+. I go to a good school with a good reputation in engineering. I feel like I have the credentials to be an awesome job candidate, and I constantly don't hear back from companies or hear back that they're not interested.

What really gets me is that I keep getting told by my brother and I know from other friends that they had multiple offers their fall semester and chose the best one. Here I am at the end with zero prospects and I am seriously worried about this. And their idea is that I must be doing something wrong, but I feel like this doesn't make any sense.

TL;DR: Good resume, good experience, well-rounded, actively searching, and getting no results of job opportunities. 

Anybody have any similar stories, or advice?"

I'm not nervous, but I do feel ill-prepared.

I go to my local county college for computer science and I just finished my first semester. All I learned was how to build forms in Visual Basic. On the side, I taught myself basic html/css/bootstrap. I finished the semester with a 3.48 GPA, if that matters.

The company provides tech support and services including IT services, social media management, web design and hosting, merchant services, security, and a few other things as well. They're only taking on two interns.

I gave them my resume but honestly it's completely irrelevant because I started college late(age 20) and I've been a carpenter/remodeler since mid-senior year. I was even in the carpenters union at one point and things just didn't work out, mainly because I've grown a strong disliking to the work and everything involved(constantly travelling to different places, inconsistent hours).

I just discovered this subreddit and would appreciate any advice. Here is some background:

I am 24 years old with a Bachelor's degree in Journalism. I had a couple of marketing internships while in school but they were not very helpful for advancing a career. My first job out of school was as a manager for a family entertainment center (pizzeria, laser tag, mini golf), which was actually fun at times and I really learned a lot about how a small business is run. I was also not paid well and working 45+ hours a week so after 4 months I had decided to quit and find something else. My next job was in sales and operations in a small department of a large company that was experiencing some significant growth. I was there for a total of 9 months before my girlfriend and I decided to use some of our savings to quit our jobs and move to a new city and start fresh. That move was 6 months ago and I am very happy we did that. It was tough finding a job in a new city but after 2 months I found one also in sales and operations, this time for a very small company that resells software to mid-large sized organizations. I've been there just over 4 months and while it isn't perfect, I get paid well, the benefits are nice and there is a lot of potential for the future as my boss would like to train me to become a high-volume account manager with more potential for more commission.

Here is where I'd like to seek some advice. Ever since we moved to this new city, I have been thinking very thoroughly about what I'd like to do with my life, even if it would take years to reach. I've decided that I'd like to pursue a career in policy analysis in the public sector.

My questions are: 

Should I go to grad school within the next year? Or should I continue working, saving money and gaining more experience at my current job and go to school 2-3 years from now? Should I explore taking complimentary classes or certs in the before applying?  Should I find an entry level job in the public sector before school? Should I continue working in my current job and go to school part time (the Univ. near me has a part-time program I could get into and I'm certain I can handle the time commitment)?

I feel I've exhausted my thoughts on this so I will stop here and answer any follow up questions as needed. Thank you for anyone who read and is willing to offer their advice. I appreciate any and all thoughts."

I recently got interested in CS professionally, and decided on it as a career track. I have taken no classes since a simple programming class in high school.

I'll finish philosophy in another year and likely be able to graduate with a second bachelor's in CS in 1-1.5 extra years. 

My question is about internships. There is a military base with a few contractors in my home city, and several of them offer internships. The descriptions for the internships are often vague and have few to no requirements (for instance, must be a CS major at an accredited university). I wanted to know if it would be a bad idea to apply for a few that seemed fairly low level this summer, that way I could get some experience and maybe land something better next year when I know more CS? Or should I just wait and take summer classes and apply again in a year? Also fwiw, I'm probably 2 years away from graduation.

3xy7a3,1,2015-12-23,Thinking about setting up VOIP for my mom's business.,goeatsomesoup,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3xy7a3/thinking_about_setting_up_voip_for_my_moms/,"Diagram:http://imgur.com/mtxYg4Y

So just to preface, I'm an IT intern at a company that develops point of sale software. It's only been 6 months and I feel like I'm finally starting to get the hang of things (took down several email domains for 40 minutes cuz I didn't know what propagation was during my first month on the job ooohohohoho). My job is to work with mySQL databases, set up/manage server/switch racks, wiring patch panels all that good stuff.

Anyways, so I *think* I know what I'm doing, but I just wanted some reassurance/feedback before I spend my money on this project.

So my mom owns a nail salon and I noticed she's been paying $120 a month for just a phone line with caller ID. That is it. Nothing else, no long distance, no forwarding nothing. And I thought that was retarded so I decided it was time to put some of my newly learned skills to use. What I want to do is, start an internet plan (AT&amp;T is charging $45/mo for 25mbps which isn't too bad imo) and use an ooma device as the VOIP thingie. From there we'll transfer the phone number and hook up the existing business phone. Now, I'm well aware of the minutes limitations, but I doubt we'll go over 200-300 minutes a month, time is money and we don't spend much time on the phone making reservations. The only thing I'm worried about is the reliability. If you look in the diagram I attached, options 1 and 2 rely on the ooma. I personally would like to use option 3 since that helps ease up on the single point of failure issue, but I don't really know how I would set it up. My mom is very tech illiterate and I don't think she'd like to have to dial GV every time she needs to call a customer back.

I don't mind paying the taxes and fees for the ooma by the way if that matters. I looked through its features and it looks like its up to the job, but if you have any other suggestions do let me know. I'm not too familiar with VOIP in general and ooma looks like the easiest to work with.

The server does things, one of those things is function as a DVR for the cameras. I was thinking I'd get 2 western digital purple drives and run them in raid 1. OS will run on its own SSD. I'm not sure how I'd handle cloud back up since the upload speed is not nearly enough for 8 1080p IP cams, but for now raid should suffice. The server should be secure in the storage room, but if necessary, I can also have it write to an external HDD in like, the attic or something I dunno. Might be overkill since not much really happens at a nail salon. Obviously I could go with an all in one pre built DVR solution, but the server is multi purpose. It also plays music, and hosts quickbooks to run payroll and all that stuff. It's also a better idea to move it to cloud, but like I said, my parents are the kind that are too old to want to learn anything new so I'll just have to deal with it. They thought $120 for just a land line is normal so that's their mind set about tech in general. Oh in case it isn't clear, the server already exists, but it's a shitty dell optiplex running XP from 2003, but I plan to migrate the software to windows 10 with a new server and run QB in virtual XP with no external network access.

As for the wifi, I initially thought it would be a good idea to create a hotspot for the customers, but I'm worried about security. So for now the plan is just for employees only, which includes my parents, no SSID broadcast and all that.

______________________________________________________________

Also I want to say, my main question is about the VOIP. The server, the networking equipment, IP cameras, that's all stuff I can handle on my own, the VOIP thing is a little new to me so I just wanted to make sure what I'm doing in regards to that is solid. I do plan to keep the land line for a month to test VOIP incase anything goes wrong. But feedback on the rest of the setup is good as well.

The lead developer of the startup contacted me and offered me a job to work similarly for her application. During a telephonic conversation she happened to ask me whether I was had a pay package in mind and but also conveyed that due to this startup being in the nascent stages she may not be able to pay me that well. Now my understanding is that she is open to the internship being a paid one(as per the convo),but I'm in a dilemsma how to ask for a pay. 

Confusion due to muliple factors are in play here: 
1. Being a fresher with no particular expertise, I'm not exactly sure what pay I can ask for. 
2. The founder of a startup seems to be far more experienced and more than money, I could really do with networking with such a person.
3. Being a startup, it has a potential to take off, and I'd love to be part of it in the long run. 
4. At this point of time I can sustain myself for another 6 months without pay.

This will be a long one. 

Like many on this sub, I am looking to switch up my career and would love to hear from those that have successfully done so. 

The important info:

29 years old

Education:
B.A. English Language and Literature
M.Ed English Education

Participated in no extra-curricular activities or internships as I have been working full-time since I have been legally allowed to. 

Relevant Job Experience:
3 years as a high school teacher (AP Literature mostly)
3 years as director of an independent learning center

I have no network to speak of beyond a couple really good references.

The Dilemma:
Right now, I'm a maybe above-average fish in a small pond. I'd like to move to a bigger pond. Partially for salary--I've been stuck in the low $50k range for these past 6 years--and partially because I'm bored. The main issue at hand is that I'm having a lot of trouble marketing myself.

I've done good work in both of these roles. I've had lots of great observations and feedback from supervisors as a teacher, and I've worn a lot of hats as a director, but I can't help but feel that I don't have much in the way of notable accomplishments to make myself stand out. 

Additionally, the skills I have are of the less tangible, and seemingly less appreciable, kind. I'm good at research and communicating difficult ideas; I'm empathetic and great at build rapport in an instructional or conference setting; I have great public speaking skills and little stage fright; but lots of people are like that. I feel like I need some more hard skills to bank on. 

To compound the issue, I have (as I'm sure many do) a fair amount of student debt and little savings, making additional training extremely difficult. 

I would like to work in a somewhat creative capacity for a larger organization than my current one, which is about as small an operation as it gets. 

Careers I am interested in:

* Assessment/Curriculum development
* Digital lesson/content creation
* Data Analysis for an educational organization
* Writing in almost any context
* Other related jobs

Since there should be a question: How can I make myself more immediately marketable and actively work towards progressing my career? What kinds of steps are even viable options for me?

**Basically my question is directed to previous interns on what they would do to prepare for the internship.** (IE visual studios projects, coding problems, version control, debugging etc)

I don't know my team yet so I don't know what type of language I'll be working with or the type of project I'll be dealing with. 

I know people work and learn in different ways but if there are any helpful tips and tricks please let me know!

I've met this girl a few years back, while on college (I was in my final year, she was in her second year), we weren't really close at all, and we met just because we had friends in common - actually, I was dating a friend of hers. When I graduated, I immediately got into a big company here, and one year later, my boss told me that I could get someone to work with me, as an intern. So, I asked a few friends if they wanted the job, and that girl answered in a very positive way. We then started to talk more, and getting to know each other, and eventually she came to work with me. We've been working together for roughly 16 months.

And now starts the whole friendship / friendzone dilemma. I'm not the most atractive guy in the world (not at all, trust me), and she's kinda cute - also, not the biggest beauty in the world - but I'm really into her. She's super nice, we have some things in common, and we make a hell of a team. But she's not into me at all. 

One day, when she was sick at home, I had to check her e-mail, if any important thing had arrived, and made a pretty scumbaggy thing: I went into Chrome, and Facebook loaded, into her account. And I went to read some of the conversations she had with my best friend (also works in the company). And I felt really bad doing it, but some of the things I read were really unpleasant, and outright mean. I was in shock. Questioning my sexuality, calling me a jerk and a bi-polar person, and making things on purpose just to make me feel bad.

This happened 2 or 3 months ago. But every day that passes, we are spending more and more time together (I usually sleep in her house from time to time, when we go to a movie or a concert), and I feel a urge in me to confront her with that situation. The awkward part: although the things she said, I still like her, and still have a great crush on her.

I'd like to hear some thoughts on this.

**TL;DR: I ""accidentaly"" read some mean things a co-worker (also a crush) said about me, and I'm having a strange urge that I should talk to her about it, and ultimately confess my feelings to her.** "

I wound up not getting the on-site one, and they told me ""they want me to have more experience, then I can reapply for next summer"". After many more failed attempts, I've accepted an internship in the spring at a fairly large, non-software-based company for software development. Its not a stellar internship, but I'm happy with it. Everyone always stresses the importance of side projects when applying for internships and jobs, but as a change-of-major student in CS, I sometimes feel like I'm behind and not sure where to start. I have a great GPA, solid extracurriculars, and now I finally have a software internship, so I feel like the area of side projects is the one thing I have missing that my fellow students can hold over me. 

My questions is, where do I begin with side projects? I definitely want to do them, I just have no clue where to start. I've started to do a few tutorials on android programming since I know java from school, and I also have messed around with basic HTML and CSS and built a basic personal website.

But I am worried that since I am graduating from a school that's outside the US, I will have a hard time being hired and sponsored for a visa. I used to go to a school in the US but I had to transfer to a Korean school due to financial issues.

My plan right now is this: 1. Take as many relevant/advanced courses I can next year. 2. Work on developing a portfolio. 3. Apply for tech internships in my country (hopefully Google).

But I'm not really sure what else to do aside from all that, nor do I know whether doing all that will even make me a viable candidate for US tech firms. It'd be great if you guys can give me some advice and point me in the right direction. I feel very lost.

Also, I wasted a few years of my twenties because I had to go to the military (two years) and worked as an English instructor (needed the money). I'll probably be about 30~31 when I graduate. I know that's a big minus in the tech industry =/."

Maybe it's just the part time/retail/food jobs I don't like to stick around at but even at that IT job I don't see myself there for more than 4 years if I were to ever get a job there.

I have no real world experience; didn't do any internships or have a job during college because I was a bio major and the curriculum was too much for me. During my job search I was applying anywhere and everywhere. After a few unsuccessful months, I began growing more and more desperate and when I got offered a part-time job as a buyer, I pounced on it, figuring to take it to gain office experience and build my resume.

Fast forward to yesterday when I heard back from a county government job I applied to when I was looking for a job. They want me to forward them my resume. The only requirement for the job is a relevant college degree, which I have.

My question is do I put my new job of 3 weeks onto the resume I send to them? It would make me seem more experienced and thus more attractive as a candidate, however the fact that I am looking at this job after just being hired could hurt my chances as I may be seen not being able to stick with a job (the other positions on my resume are short-term: a recent 3-month stint as a tutor, a recent 9-month stint as a private tutor, a 2-month stint as an admin assistant back in high school; I do have a 3 year stint as a waiter which I do not list on my resume because it was so long ago(07-10; it is on my linkedin though)). Or I could just resubmit the same resume I submitted at the time I submitted the application, but lying or deliberately excluding information is subject to disqualification, I'm pretty sure.

I nailed the first interview with the initial HR/recruiting team from both companies. I have nearly three years of IT experience and personal projects that I bring up. I've been told by a number of people I have a strong resume, both in terms of presentation and content. Even when I get my resume reviewed, they give me a few tips for improvement but say it otherwise looks great.

But when it comes to interviews, I feel really clumsy. It seems like no amount of preparation helps, because I always seem to prepare for things that never come up (but have in past interviews).

I never really get a natural chance to talk about my projects, and I'm always asked why I'm transitioning to development (I have a largely systems/IT background). I typically answer along the lines that I have found I enjoy it so much more because I love solving puzzles and building things. I don't know if those are bad answers or not.

In the last interview, I felt like the call ended pretty abruptly. When they asked if I had any final questions, I asked them a few about how my role as an intern would fit into the team, their methodology, how often they meet, give feedback, etc. Most of my questions were answered early on, or with the couple I asked at the end. They asked again if I had any more questions, I said, ""no, I think that covers it,"" then the call was ended pretty awkwardly and abruptly, saying they'd talk it over and would ""be in touch.""

I always wanted to be an airline pilot, but after high school, everyone went to college, and since college is free where I live, it was pretty much the most viable option, so I went too. I had no clue what to study, so I decided to go for a high school teacher's degree in psychology and economics.

What I had not taken into account back then though, was the fact that I have never really been into theoretical stuff or learning abstract things at all. I have always been more of a 'practical engineer', who likes understanding machinery by operating it and not just studying it.

Anyway, 4 horrible, stressful, unsuccesful years followed, I have not been performing well, and I've had issues learning. I was so preoccupied with shit that I didn't even think about whether I was doing the right thing anymore, I was just trying to keep going. But everything was just a huge struggle, so I was looking for some internal defects - depression, ADD, or even the whole college learning system being faulty, or I was just shrugging it off by thinking doing only shit you don't like is simply part of growing up...

Fortunately, it was at this year's internship at a high school, when I came to realize that I don't want to be a teacher at all, and that I was just blindly following other people's career paths, simply because they looked reasonable, and 'everyone was doing it'.


So here I am now, ready to attend flight school and more happy and energetic than ever. I have no issues learning at all, because everything we have to learn for the flight school exams is exciting and 100% relevant for the career.

Looking back at those 4 years though, I am amazed by how long I've been able to put enormous amounts of effort into something I haven't been convinced about in first place.

So here goes my advice: If you have the chance to change the situation, go for it, even if it means taking a risk or losing some relationships due to moving to another place. You won't regret it. It's such a simple wisdom to say *do what you love* but apparently, it's really not that easy to follow. But as long as you can, you should really try as hard as you can - otherwise it's not legitimate to complain about ""shattered dreams"", if you haven't even tried in first place.

**TL;DR:** If you can - do what you love. It might seem more convenient to follow *some* career, but one day you will get sick of it."

Could this blow up in my face?,chickenpi,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3y6iwf/ive_signed_for_a_ft_role_but_now_have_an/,"Following an internship I landed a graduate offer for big 4 CF/transactions to start late 2016. However, I've been sending off a few applications to some banking 2016 SA positions, and now have an interview for S&amp;T coming up.

Neither are bad roles by any means but clearly the banking role would pay a lot more and is probably more exciting. The idea would be to graduate, take the summer (if i got it!), then join the big 4 company for a year and leave in late 2017 depending on the outcome on the SA internship, whether I enjoyed it and got a permanent offer or not.

Clearly this is a bit cheeky at best. I feel like I would be compromising my integrity by simply attending the interview. The worst case scenario would be for both companies to find out what I'm doing and withdraw any offer they have/would have given me. How would you think the SA interviewer would view this if they asked about it in the interview (I definitely wouldn't lie if they asked!), and the Big 4 company if they found out I'd taken another internship? A twist in the tale is that the Big 4 company would have to provide a reference to the bank... whilst expecting me to come and devote my life to them!

What is your opinion on this? Am I being too sensitive? should I think about ditching one option and just go for the other? Is this just business and the way it goes when you're a lowly graduate fighting to get anywhere?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts."

Is this correct though?  Should I have assumed a 1D array? Or nor an array but another data structure like a bidirectional graph, where each pixel points to 4 others?

I also used another 2D array to keep track of pixels I visited. Should I have used something else,  like a stack or queue?

Sorry again for the dumb question. Any help would be great."

Most of the job ads that I find are looking for hella experience but some only ask for 'at least one year, at least two years...' of experience in a certain area. 
I'm not sure if I should apply to these because although they have smaller experience requirements, I have zero experience in this area. 
For example, a clinical trial associate position asks for one year of experience with clinical practices doing 1, 2, 3 and although I have had one internship, it was in quality and not clinical practices.
Should I be applying to positions that seem entry level (because of the experience) even though I have no knowledge about the area or I don't have the majority of the requirements?"
3y8ite,33,2015-12-25,Need Advice. Performance rating dropped and promotion withdrawn 2.5 months after finalized.,helplessdeveloper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3y8ite/need_advice_performance_rating_dropped_and/,"**LONG WALL OF POOR STORYTELLING INCOMING, FEEL FREE TO SKIP TO TL;DR**

I work as a developer and rejected an Amazon AWS IAM offer that required me to relocate to Seattle for this company around Feb 2015. This meant a lower salary but I was genuinely interested in the (new, $700M) project. Our team handles the user-facing portion of this large project. Anyways, 2 months in I'm doing great, working hard. This new lady (let's call her K) who has worked here 10 years joins the team to replace our current back-end team lead (E) who basically was juggling 2 projects and had to dedicate her time to other project. At least point 2 more people join our team, and help out on front-end because for some reason management wants to have a highly functional UI before any back-end is done so they can show it to the customer(s) and get feedback. I voice my suggestions (to start back-end at the same time and start integrating and having actual communication going front to back), but a demo is coming up and everyone is concerned about this.

We have our customer demo with this UI-only ""product"", and get great feedback from all parties. After this time I'm asked to become team lead (J) for the front-end as I'm pretty much already doing what they'd expect of a team lead. No raise/official promotion though. Soon 2 more people join, 1 of who joins my team, and another (J2) added to the back-end with K. Our first major delivery is at the end of October, and back-end officially starts building REST services. Another developer (A), joins. A couple months go by ~June, and I bring up again, that we cannot continue to have front-end so far ahead and not have any communication with back-end as we will not make our deadline. I suggest that we ""loan"" 2 of our current 4 people to the back-end to help bridge that gap. Only an intern is left on my team at this point, while back-end has 5 people + K, who, unlike me, does not need to code as she's a ""100% team lead"".

This is where everything starts going wrong. Actually it was even before people were loaned to K but I digress. She creates very vague requirements for developer assignments, and then tell them to re-do it over and over because it's not what she expected. At the same time, she does not give any guidance on what she actually wants, and perpetually complains about being overworked, stressed, and always stuck doing code reviews, meanwhile doing ~5 hour work days (coming in at 9:45, and leaving at 2:30). J2 brings up some suggestions to the supervisor/project lead (J3) to improve these issues without blaming K specifically. K insists on taking the lead on these suggestions and absolves herself of the need to participate in them herself (standups, defining scope and requirements more clearly, etc). J2 brings this up with the line manager (C), who is not involved in the project, but manages employees' career development, needs, etc. Each employee is assigned one. C tells J2 to be more frank/direct with feedback if she has issues with anyone/processes on the team.

At this point 2 other people on K's team start raising similar concerns and frustrations. J2 is excluded from important meetings by K citing ""workload"" and ""she doesn't want to come"". *J2 decides to leave after 3 short months*. Nothing improves; K is still changing things willy-nilly, two-facing people, and creating a lot of busy work in general that sets the project further behind. I get called in to talk to C after J2 leaves and am asked about the team atmosphere etc, I hint that similar to what the 3 previous people have already mentioned, there are serious issues, and am told to gather some feedback and tell the project lead (J3).

Right before I speak with her, she gives me my performance review (first image, Oct 6th), with the highest ratings in all areas along with comments about my work thus far and taking on the team lead role, simplifying inefficient processes, setting up CI and automated E2E testing, etc all with high praise. This feedback goes to me and C to be signed, and is finalized and sent out to all parties involved. After bringing up these issues with J3 though, she thanks me for raising them and soon a lot of discussions start happening behind closed doors with J3, K, and some people with more tenure at the company. After another 2 weeks, my invitation to the weekly team lead meetings hosted by J3 get cancelled. Every other team lead still attends. *Another two members of K's team leave*, 3 months worked. Aside from the frustrations they raised previously, they do not say anymore to prevent burning bridges.

Around this time, J3 is increasingly upset and concerned that the project will not make the deadline set at the end of October. Since K only has 2 team members left and I only have my intern, J3 asks upper management/the client for more time, and I proceed to integrate the very few working endpoints into our front-end. At this point, a large number of issues arise, such as a simple GET request for 1000 records in a database taking 40~52 seconds, some that completely break functionality. It is clear to me that a lot of this was never vetted/tested or simply magically passed K's code reviews, but I'm careful to not point fingers. I raise these issues while emphasizing their impact, and ask for them to be resolved ASAP. K defers, defers, stalls, defers, stalls, stalls, and does not resolve them or even so much as assign people to resolve them. She forces the devs to make more breaking changes, ignoring their comments on the impact, and creates even more busy work. Meanwhile I'm under increasing pressure as the features that should be working on the UI are not (as a result of endpoint issues). Another extension is requested and a lot of upper management is angry and state that this is the last one (end of 2015). I'm instructed to ""finish everything"" before Christmas/the new year, and K, J3, and most of the other non-devs go on vacation for the month of Dec all the way until delivery date (early Jan).

Thursday, Dec 17th: C calls me into his office. He says my performance review rating has been dropped and makes me add my initial (2nd image). I ask him the reason and why it was adjusted this long after. He simply says ""it was a mistake"", and goes on to say that dropping from 5 to 4 is not a big deal, I'm simply ""not at the level"" of 5/5. He then goes on to say that ""it's okay, because that doesn't affect what happens next. You are getting a promotion. And this raise. It's the maximum we give around here."" K's 2nd last remaining team member lets me know she got an offer with J2's new company and is giving notice.

Friday, Dec 18th: C calls me on my office phone. He simply says, ""actually, we're not giving you a promotion"".

My issue is not with whether or not I got a 4 or 5 on my review, or whether I got a promotion or not. My issue is that my performance review was changed 2.5 months, after it was signed by all parties, finalized with HR, and distributed to all parties.

Needless to say I need advice. I've already been quite distressed the past few months at the state of this project and about K in general, but at the same time I also wanted to do my best to leave my work in a good state and get it over this first deadline hurdle.

**TL;DR:** Project in a very messy situation, I'm under tremendous pressure to deliver while all responsible parties are on vacation, my performance rating from 2.5 months ago was lowered after the fact, and a promotion I was told to be given was withdrawn. Advice?"

3y8jpz,24,2015-12-25,I'm potentially handicapped for the rest of my life and I don't know what to do anymore,Toaster872,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3y8jpz/im_potentially_handicapped_for_the_rest_of_my/,"This is my first visit to Reddit but I don't know where else to seek advice. I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. Please do send me to the right place, if this isn't it. Also, I'm sorry if I ruin your happy holiday (I truly am). Prepare for a long (sad) story:


I don't know where to begin but my life has been been going up and down the last five years or so but things really went bad two and a half years ago.


That was when I was in a minor accident and received what was considered to be a very minor head injury/trauma. What was supposed to be gone in a couple of days has turned into a nightmare for me for the last couple of years. 


I went on sick leave from my studies (I'm in IT) for a year trying to recuperate. I just couldn't study or do much of anything for the first 6 months. It was an awful time but after the first 6 months, I started showing signs of improvement. And I started slowly resuming some of my life and after a year I went back to school to continue my education. 


Things were tough in the beginning but I slowly got back in gear and I had a wonderful semester and lived a relatively normal life with some limitations. During this time I was told by multiple doctors in various specialties that things would only go one way and that was up and that my capabilities would improve, my symptoms would fade and that everything here on out was just going to get better.


At this time, I was finishing up my semester and the exams, I had applied for an internship and gotten a great one. Now all I had to do was finish the last semester with that internship and a final project.
 

Just then, my symptoms came back in full force. From one day to the next, I was mentally crippled again. I tried to rest and see if things would get better quickly but they didn't and I therefore had to call up my internship a few days before I was to start and tell them that I couldn't come work for them and that I had to cancel all that was planned and that I probably wouldn't be able to start with them in the foreseeable future. Especially considering that last time I was sick for a year. I also applied for sick leave again from my school.


I tried to get back on my feet and things go up and down with this condition. I did manage to get my last exam done from the previous semester which I hadn't gone to due to illness but I was still not feeling too well.


Here's the thing. I've been talking on and off with my school about how to approach this and if we can find a way to get me through my education since I only have one semester left. But I have a hard time making plans since things can change so easily. And right now, despite having told my school that I would try to find an internship at reduced time (I can't work full time and it's quite possible I never will) but I just keep getting worse and worse. I'm supposed to start in January or February depending on how fast I can find an internship (if I can - very few want to bother with someone not going at it full time, let alone if they find out my mind doesn't function well).


I do realize that my formatting is awful by the way. I'm just jotting down what comes to mind.


But I'll go into more detail on my medical history for context:
I first had minor symptoms of headaches and tiredness. They turned into dizziness, nausea, vision problems, neck pain, numbness in extremities, occasional memory and concentration problems but nothing major in that regard (contrary to what is expected). I went to multiple doctors who just said rest, avoid this and that, and that's what I did as best as I could but mistakes have definitely been made in the process due to very vague information from doctors.


One of the problems is, if I overexert my mind, my symptoms will flare up and they can do that from one minute to the next with little to no warning that my brain needs a break (something that prior to my injury was unheard of, I could pull all-nighters with no effort). If I relax, my symptoms will slowly fade over days, weeks, months only to return (like hitting a reset switch) from one careless moment to the next. That's why this condition is difficult to deal with.
Relaxing often means doing pretty much nothing, or at least very little. Which is boring and a sad way to live but one has to think of one's health first.


Before I went on sick leave, I finally got to see a neurologist who explained a few things but also mentioned that there's no treatment options, they know very little about these things and nothing about how to deal with it other than let the body heal itself and hope for the best. I got a CT scan (this was three months after the accident). It came up negative. 


I also developed a depression and general anxiety during this time and I went on antidepressants and started seeing a psychiatrist and I went for regular sessions and took my medication all this time during recovery but there were side effects from the medication such as dry mouth, a bit tiredness and I frequently slept for 10-12 hours if I didn't set an alarm. 


After becoming sick again with the symptoms and things just going wrong in my life and having been like that for several months with no significant change (and I had gotten into an altercation with a family member who has mental problems of his own, lost his cool and hit me in the head, which caused my symptoms to flare up even more than usual). I kinda lost my shit for a few days and wanted to shake things up and I stopped taking my medication and everything was fine but months later, no improvements, only things getting worse.


I then went to another neurologist. I wanted a second opinion, since it's been two years now. I mean this thing was supposed to be over in days and it has been years. I thought someone had to have an answer or treatment that could help me. 


He just looked at me when I presented my story and went, basically, ""from my experience with these things, you've never been ill and you should go see a psychiatrist - this is probably mental illness"". 


I was shocked considering the previous diagnoses by multiple doctors and specialists and my medical history. But he ordered an MRI to be sure. It came up negative, but all the vibrations from the machine made me feel worse in the following days. I'm quite sensitive to a lot of things in this condition, even breaking fairly hard in a car can make me feel bad. So I guess I should have expected the vibrations beforehand but I didn't - I only knew that it was gonna be noisy and that was fine.


So I have a specialist saying I'm fine. I have family who say that the way I've been doing things too cautiously and I'm not as fragile as I think I am. That I should get on with my education so I don't end up on welfare for the rest of my life or spend my life hoping for recovery while doing nothing with it. I thought maybe I'll try to follow their advice. Maybe I'll try to start working again. I mean it's been over 2 years. Any damage that can be healed will have been healed within 3-6 months. The doctors told me that.


So I tried starting working a bit again in order to prepare myself for resuming my studies. At first it was difficult and I did feel some signs of overexertion but I shrugged it off a bit. 


Suddenly I could tolerate working again and things seemed fine. Some months passed and I started feeling very bad again. Usually when things get worse, it was from one day to the other. This time it was over a long period of time, so I didn't notice to begin with. 


I have difficulty concentrating while remaining relaxed. Right now as I'm typing this. I can concentrate but I can feel that I'm in a tense state. It's difficult to explain, it's a new situation that I'm unfamiliar with and I just realized this. I can't, for example, watch a video or something. I can't concentrate while trying to kick back and relax. I need to keep my mind and body going in order for me to concentrate.


Before it was in some ways reversed. I felt fine, but I couldn't do much of anything that included displays such as tv, but I could listen and talk for hours or listen to podcasts for hours with no problems. Now I can't do that without feeling restless.


I much prefer my previous state but now I'm unsure if I can recover from this. 
I might have removed my chances to recover by trying to force myself to get ready to finish up my education. 


Of course, there's a chance I can salvage things by ""pulling back"" and trying to rest of the next few weeks. This would of course also mean in all likelihood that I'm dropping out completely. I've already overstayed my welcome and will have to apply for extended time as it is but I can't continue on this path if I don't start this January. That's my last straw. So I'll say goodbye to all I've done with one semester left. 
I think the only reason my school has tolerated me this long is because I'm a straight A student and my teachers have vouched for me because I'm well-liked by them. But no amount of vouching will help me in this matter. It's now or quit it entirely. That means everything I've done and my time there have been for nought and a waste of time (mostly).


My future will also be completely uncertain. My family will be disappointed. I would mention friends, but my social life was nothing spectacular (to say the least) before my accident, it died completely after. Not because I have shitty friends or anything. It's complicated. But I will say that I withdrew. My life was changed and it's hard to live with. Very hard. Writing all this is hard. It makes you think of all the wasted opportunities and all the things I can't do. I can't study, I can't work, I can't do my hobbies. It's a sad life and I know it.


Now I will say this. I'm not suicidal. My belief system makes it pointless, but I do feel like my life is an exercise in futility and in the end, useless. So I'm just going through the motions at it is.


Christmas makes this all the more clear to me (I do understand if the timing seems suspicious.)


I'm seeing succesful family members and I still have my Facebook (have considered deactivating it to spare myself) where I can see all the successes and happiness of the people around me. It's hard seeing people seeing the world, traveling places, getting married, having kids, getting jobs and degrees, buying houses and pets while I'm left with nothing. Nothing at all.


I have no prospects of happiness, love, wealth or anything as it is. The health care system has failed me. They can do nothing for me and there's very little I can do. I can only start trying to pick up what little pieces I have left on the board and try to make something out of it. 


Now all I've written here is only half of the story. I have other problems (I have at least 5 chronic medical problems including chronic pain in addition to what I've mentioned), I have close relatives with massive problems as well.


I was told I was so talented with wonderful prospects in life. This is no longer the case.


So here I am. Writing up a block of text with very little coherence and probably with a lot of missing important details. Not knowing what the hell to do because my options are so extremely limited. And I'm not even 25 yet. I have a long way to go.


I have no one to turn to, no one who can advice me or understand me.


So I thought I'd try this corner of the internet. Hoping someone had that golden advice, those golden words that can encourage me and guide me. Because right now, things seem to hopeless.


I need to find a way to live my life the way it is. I can't just keep hoping that things get better or that I stumble upon a magical cure (although if you have one, I'm all ears). 


I think the key is to find out how to be happy with what I got instead of being sad about all the things I can't have anymore. But those words are easy to say, but hard to actually live by.

This happened about a year ago when I was a senior in high school. At the time, I was the Webmaster Intern for the school and my ""boss"" was the head of the business department. His friend was $BOSS from the local home realtor agency and needed somebody to revamp their website, seeing as it was very outdated. Cue $ME being hired as on-site tech support and Webmaster.  

*2 months later on a Monday*  
I busted a tire driving to the office so, after a lot of swearing, I put on the spare and call $BOSS to let him know I'll be late. While on phone, $BOSS lets me know that the network was down and that I need to fix it when I get in. The office was small, with only about 10 people actually staying on-site, so they use a old office grade router.  

&gt;**$ME**: Greets $BOSS and walk to server closet.   
&gt;Checks back of router, see that the Ethernet cable going to the network switch is undone.  
&gt;Notice a lot of cables between the switches are missing.  
&gt;Plug in cables and wait for traffic to resume through the switch.  
&gt;Pack up and go to desk.  

&gt;**$BOSS**: So what was the problem?  
&gt;**$ME**: There was just a *few* cables undone on the switch.  
&gt;**$BOSS**: Oh, yea. I thought I looked messy last week so I got rid of a bunch that didn't seem to need to be there.  

*Facepalms into oblivion*  

Tldr: Boss sucks and doesn't know how networking works.

I am graduating this May with a BS in CS, and I have a software engineering job lined up at a great company. However, I am worried about the fact that I had incorrectly listed my title for one of my jobs on my resume while I was interviewing with the aforementioned company.

The summer after my sophomore year, I did research at my university through a program that sponsors minority students (let's call it organization X) who want to engage in research. Technically, my title was Organization X Research Intern. However, on the resume I used while I was interviewing, I had my position listed as Undergraduate Researcher. I put Undergraduate Researcher as my title simply because I did not know we were given ""official"" titles, and therefore chose a job title which most accurately conveyed what I did. 

The research position in and of itself was completely legitimate. All organization X did was provide us with a stipend, and some ""soft-skills"" workshops. I did legitimate research, though we did not publish at that time.

I spoke to the director of organization X, who coordinated the summer research program, and she said this was fine since the two titles were practically synonymous. 

However, I am still concerned that this may perhaps be an issue. What do you guys think? Should I tell my recruiter about the incorrect title? "

I am a 19-year-old U.S. university student studying Computer Science and Linguistics (hoping to go into translation software--or at least software--development), and I am currently halfway through my second year at university. I hope to move to Western or Central Europe upon graduation, whether for graduate school or a job. With French (at B2) and German (A2) in progress, I believe I will be linguistically prepared for a variety of options. My reasons for wanting to move are those of work-life balance, better financial security/safety net after having become a PR/citizen, and the best Computational Linguistics schools' and companies' presences there.

The countries I'm eyeing are France (likely Rennes or Marseille), Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, and Austria. I have around $15,000 in savings and currently have a job; I plan to add more to that savings account in the meantime. My questions are these: 

1. What can I do over the course of the next couple years to make the process of immigration much more likely to happen and go smoothly, aside from having the patience of a rock? My grades are flawless, I have internships lined up, and I have no debt and will likely not have any upon graduation.

2. If I should be networking, how should I go about it to gain connections over there? I have one connection in French-speaking Switzerland that I regularly talk to, but no others at the moment.

3. How can I get a job on the other side a few years from now, given the strict requirements of each country for immigration and the fact that I will need an employer to sponsor me? "

3ydmhm,8,2015-12-27,Second bachelor's or build portfolio?,helmutkilo40,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ydmhm/second_bachelors_or_build_portfolio/,"Hi all, I'm a career changer who wants to work in software development, and I'm looking for specific advice. I'm 24, and graduated from an Ivy League university with a BA in History in 2014 (I know, believe me I regret it). I started taking CS courses during my senior year, and now have continued to take CS courses (and math pre-reqs) as a non-degree student at a local state university. At this point I've taken courses in Python, C, and Java, as well as Data Structures, Discrete Math, and Object Oriented Programming.  I had an internship this summer where I ended up doing database development for the company's database, and a have a few side projects, though I've been so busy with school and a part time job that I haven't been able to really dig into them. 


I applied and have been admitted to a second bachelor's degree in CS at this university, but I'm not sure if it's the right move. Part of me feels like I know enough to pass a technical interview (not with the Big n, but with smaller companies and start ups), and that if I invested time in my portfolio, and learning the skills I want to develop (mobile development), I would be able to land an okay entry level position.


If I earn a second BS in CS, it will most likely cost me around $50,000 in loans and 3 years of further study (I have no debt from my first degree).  I like studying, and I like coursework, and have felt that it helps me get a better understanding of what's working under the surface, and has made me more confident as a programmer.  I'm also interested in learning advanced topics like AI and Machine Learning. But I don't know if the time and money spent on getting another bachelor's is worth it at this point in my life, and I am aware that this state university is not in the Top 5, but the Top 50. 


But, I also don't want the lack of a degree in CS to hold me back during my career. I'm very serious about a career in software development and the tech industry, and I don't want to be 35 years old and passed over for a promotion or paid less because I don't have a degree in CS. If a degree in CS is that important in this industry, then I can invest the time in getting a degree now rather than later. 


Furthermore, I keep getting mixed advice. Everyone I talk to who works in industry says to just get a job, and everyone I talk to in academia tells me to get a degree. What are your thoughts? I'd love to hear from people who are well into their careers. "
3ydu6p,2,2015-12-27,Please help me. I've lost ALL motivation and if I don't get it back I could ruin my future plans/life,fivefeetevil,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/3ydu6p/please_help_me_ive_lost_all_motivation_and_if_i/,"I am currently a college junior studying abroad in China. What should have been an awesome experience has turned into the most trying time of my life. I go to a small but prestigious private college in the United States, known for it's academic rigor. When they sent me and 4 of my friends here, they loaded ridicoulous demands on us, and left us with a program coordinator (no relationship to the college) who is largely unproffesional and largely absent. It's a newer study abroad program, and thus underdeveloped but I did not realize how much so until we were stranded here.
We were told we get financial help to pay for food and transportation from our very very VERY expensive school but we didn't. 

I come from a family that is beneath the poverty line. I financed my trip on my own, but had to pay the school 1,450 dollars to a tuition hike that my scholarships no longer covered. I am now broke. I now live off of about 20 dollars a week in Shanghai China from my family. I ran out of money today (which this has been happening for weeks) and I ate breakfast but I won't be eating lunch or dinner. I did have a teaching job to mitigate this, but the mother no longer needed my services. I have no other income coming in.

I also have 4 hours of chinese 5 days a week. On top of that, I and the other students dealt with the stress of a miscommunication from our school to the program coordinator who told our intern sites that we would also be working 4 days a week, to complete 200 hours. We all had hour long commutes which both sites refused to cover transportation costs. It cut into my food money greatly every week. A month in, we had convinced the school in the U.S that the time was far too much, kept us from being able to study (it did) and was more hours than we would receive credit-wise. They changed it to 3 days a week, which damaged our relationship with our boss and the work was that much harder.

All of this stress has caused me to stop having a period. I only eat twice a day (which is so much better than so many other people around the world, but it is taking it's toll). I'm a college athlete and alot of my muscle mass has evaporated. My skin is dull and it breaks out. I'm tired all of time. I constantly run out of money to eat with and have to wait a day or two until someone back home can pitch in for me (which i am grateful for). The pollution in Shanghai made me sick, I am black, so I'm constantly being stared at, followed, having pictures taken of me, being harassed/groped by men, or disrespected.

My finals are in about 2 weeks and I cannot bring my self to study. This christmas weekend my friends with richer families all went to travel. I stayed behind and I am alone. I have spent the past 3 days in my bed for hours, only going out to eat the last two days, and not today after breakfast because I now have no more money to eat. My mom is not sure if she can send anything tomorrow. I cannot study, I cannot write my papers, I cannot get out bed, and I cannot work out. I cant do anything. As soon as I get up I just want to lay back down. I have been on Reddit or youtube or facebook for hours doing NOTHING. This is not like me. I am an honors student, who has always worked hard.

I feel like...I am caged in here. I really need help so I can study again ASAP and hopefully make good grades before I leave.

TLDR: Stressed and burned out in China. Please give me some advice on how to make it the next 3 weeks and study for my finals until I return home"

3yg3p6,3,2015-12-27,[Troubleshooting] I might have killed my motherboard and PSU,kukiric,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3yg3p6/troubleshooting_i_might_have_killed_my/,"**Final Update (3 days after post):**

So, after sending the parts in for testing in a computer shop, one of the technicians (the owner) concluded that both the motherboard and PSU are fried, but everything else is fine (including the GPU). The PSU was delivering incredibly unclean power (5v variation going both ways on the 12v rail alone), which might have blown a capacitor near the 24 pin power socket after a few failed boot attempts.

It's still unclear as to whether the contact with the glue was actually the cause, but the owner suggested it could instead have been a combination of the PSU being old (4+ years) and extended use of unclean power (my house doesn't even have proper grounding, so that could've contributed to the long term damage).

I'm actually going to RMA the parts, as even though it's unlikely I'll get any replacements due to the provided conditions, they're both still under warranty so it's worth a try. In any case, the motherboard can be repaired by a specialized company instead of replaced, and I was already planning to upgrade my PSU in the near future (going to scale down to SFX for better case compatibility).

Finally, thanks to everyone who read the thread and tried to help. It's sad that half of my primary PC is dead, but at least I can get my old desktop up and running with a new PSU until I build my dream mini-ITX machine.

**Update (1 hour 15 mins after original post):**

Just tried the PSU on my old computer, known working at the time of the new build. The PSU fan spins once and shuts down, while nothing else on the system shows any signs of life. No onboard LEDs, no front panel LEDs, no USB power, and the CPU fan doesn't even twitch. Just the PSU fan, and that's it.

I hope this means that my PSU took the fall for the old system, and my (new) motherboard is still fine, as PSUs are much easier to replace and I was going to upgrade it later anyway. It isn't possible that the PSU got damaged and killed my previous motherboard as well when I plugged it in though, is it?

**tl;dr:**

Glued antenna connector into place, spilled some of it into motherboard, which probably killed the system when it turned on. Nothing happens when I press the power button anymore, please help.

**Story:**

So I built a new Mini-ITX taking advantage of some Black Friday sales, and after many delays, the whole thing arrived at around the second week of December. With new mobo, CPU and case in hands, plus my previous PSU, GPU and drives, I started building everything right away. After a few hours, everything was done and working fine, phew.

Except one thing: the Wi-Fi antennas. For some reason, the little connector screw came loose and I couldn't screw the disk on the other side (dunno what it's called) to hold it in place, because hand-screwing in the antennas in would just make it come loose again. It was pretty sad to see the antennas always drop into the lowest position they could, so I applied some instant super glue to both connectors. Fast forward a few minutes to put the system back together, and everything was working perfectly ever since.

But yesterday, something happened. One of the antenna connectors came loose again, and the antenna wouldn't stay up anymore. I already knew what to do, but couldn't find the same glue I used before, so I just grabbed a couple of different glues from an old drawer (mistake #1). After getting frustrated because the first one was expired (a lot of liquid came out, and didn't have any glue strength anymore), I cleaned it up with some Q-tips (without disassembling the antenna part of the mobo, BIG mistake), and applied another kind of glue I found. Everything looked fine after that, so after about 20 minutes I turned the system on, with little regard of what had just happened.

The system booted fine for a few seconds until it got to the desktop, then suddenly it rebooted without any warning. I quickly shut down the PSU, and attributing it to bad luck (Maybe a cable wasn't really all the way in? Maybe something else caused it to crash? Software issue maybe?), just checked up on all the cables, removed the GPU and drives, and turned it on again (my biggest regret). To my surprise, the system failed to boot a few times with the fans just spinning for a second, followed by a reboot. The cycle repeated a few times, and just was I was about to open it up again to reseat the power connectors and RAM (common symptoms and all), the whole thing died.

The power button didn't show any sign of life. No more LEDs, no more fans spinning, and obviously no video signal on the mobo. All that was left was a heart crushing silence and a very expensive paperweight. In a flash, I quickly disassembled the whole system (again) down to the motherboard and unscrewed the antenna connector part (huh, didn't know it was removable until recently), and found there was *still* glue under there. I quickly dashed to grab some more Q-tips and alcohol, and rubbed it the best I could without breaking anything else.

Right now, the motherboard is sitting on top of its box with only the ATX 24-pin power and CPU 4-pin power connected, and the PSU is not plugged into the wall. I'm trying my best right now not to cry as I was very proud of this build, which was *very* expensive (I live in Brazil, so things cost twice as much and the overall income rates are way lower). Even though my parents paid for this upgrade, I  still have some money I've been saving up from a paid internship to get a new GPU, but it's enough to replace either the motherboard or PSU (or both in February) if the worst has happened.

**Pictures:**

Top of the motherboard under the antenna connector (you can see the cleaning left some residue, but nothing that should cause anything to short): http://i.imgur.com/ehC4Eqc.jpg

Back of the motherboard near where the glue got spilled (top right looks like it has a burned spot between the solders?): http://i.imgur.com/SEkafnK.jpg

The antenna connector piece, with glue in excess resting near the bottom (no liquid left after cleaning): http://i.imgur.com/2r1TPdt.jpg

**Closing words:**

Please, I know not all of you are experts, but I hope someone can at least shed some light on what might have happened, and whether I really killed the motherboard, PSU, or both. I can do more tests, buy only after I'm sure it's safe enough to put the parts under more risk (I really, really, really don't want to ruin the CPU as it's the most expensive part).

**Edit:** I did ground myself correctly every time. The system worked fine for a while and rebooted on its own, so it can't be ESD.

**Edit 2:** Nothing smelt of burning during or after the fact, nor was there any kind of noise other than the usual click that my PSU fan makes when it turns off.

**Edit 3:** See the ""Update"" section at the top.

**Edit 4:** Final update."

I'm hoping to try and get enough prereqs cleared so I can apply to a masters program and, in the future, find a career in computer security. I've taken several programming courses, computer architecture/ASM, web development, and am now working on math courses. Since 2008, I've been working nonclinical roles in healthcare. I've slowly worked my way up the ladder and currently work as a supply chain analyst at the corporate office of a decently-sized hospital chain. 

My job is pretty stable, the income isn't terrible (a little over 50k/year) and I have an amazing team. I was recently offered a position at a stand alone hospital doing what I currently do now for $65k/year. The kicker is they know I want to work in IT in the future and also said they'd set up formal sessions with their network engineers so I could learn the ropes. After seeing how it goes, it could turn into a one-day-per-week internship as long as it doesn't affect my or the network engineers' work.

I was really happy about this! I have no real IT experience and networking knowledge is essential for my future career so this opportunity looked really good. 

I told my current superior that I was considering another job because it aligned more with my future goals. She ended up giving me a counter offer of almost $70k and also spoke to the VP of IT about my career goals. She told me she received a commitment from him to have the regional director of Computer Security work with me so I could have the same type of internship deal as the other hospital. 

I was floored. We have a ton of hospitals, so getting a commitment from the VP of IT to allow me to not just learn in his department but specifically in **computer security** is something that I never thought would happen. Because the offers are nearly identical, I've decided to stay at my current job since we're much larger than the standalone facility and I feel I'd possibly get more out of the IT internship here than the other.

I'm not sure what I need from you guys but I'm both extremely excited and scared at the same time. I've made no exaggerations as to my experience in that field, so they know I don't have much. I know that one doesn't just jump into a career into computer security so I feel like I'm extremely lucky to have this opportunity and I don't want to screw this up. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should be learning, looking for, questions to be asking during this time? 

*Sidenote - I'm not worried about being terminated within a few months of accepting this counter offer. My boss and I have a really good relationship and, while I'm not irreplaceable, what I do is essential. Getting rid of me would cause much more damage than do good and with the rate we're growing, we are actually in need of more employees in my department*

**tl;dr:** Work in supply-chain, got a counter-offer from my boss which includes an internship in computer security. No netsec experience, what I should be learning, looking for, or questions should I ask my trainer?

My problem is that currently my Tech GPA is 2.12. I have been completely fucking up in the last 3 semesters, and for some reason even when I put as much effort as possible into my classes, I fuck up on the exams and get boned. I have also been on tech probation for 2 years, and I believe next semester will be the first semester when I get out of it. Whats even more stupid/insane is that I still want to work in the ECE field. I enjoy things such as comp design alot and I am even working as a research assistant at Talbot. 

My question to you guys is will I still be able to get a job? I have a year left, and will most likely be taking one extra semester to try to get my grades a little higher. I haven't been able to get any internships because of my GPA, and I know when I look for a full time job, no internship is going to be a deal breaker for many companies. What can I do to try and get something before time runs out?

My plan for winter break is to apply to a hundred companies, and hopefully get atleast a couple interviews. Do you guys have any ideas as to which companies I should I apply to? I will mostly be targeting start-ups and other small firms.

I'm looking to build an application for my brother. He's a cook, but always struggling to manage his recipes. So I decided to build a recipe-managing application for his birthday. Problem is.. I never built a full application before. 

I have experience in Java and Haskell because of my studies in CS and in JavaScript because of an internship I did. I noticed a framework called NW.js (previously node-webkit) that allows building desktop applications from web-based applications (in which I have experience due to my internship).

So my goal is to build a recipe manager in JavaScript, using AngularJS and NW.js, but I have read in a comment somewhere that Angular is discouraged with NW.js because routing gets really messy. Also, NW.js isn't always considered very good.

My story:

I'm currently in ""what could be"" my last year of my undergraduate studies. I say ""what could be"" because I switched over to CS beginning in my third year and therefore have to cram the four year CS program over a two year period (kind of unorthodox). My concern is that I have no internships under my belt, mediocre grades, and no personal projects (yikes!)

Question:

Going forward, I can finish school in August of 2016 (after summer school) or I can finish in December of 2016 (after finishing the fall semester).

I want to graduate in August of 2016 because I want to finish school as soon as possible. Being a bit older (23 turning 24 soon) I feel that it is time for me to move on. 

However, I feel like I won't be too competitive for jobs if I finish sooner. If I finish later, however, I can get an internship for the summer of 2016 and then be more competitive for employment after December 2016.

Now, most people would probably say to graduate later and to aim for an internship if I want to be competitive, but to be quite honest, I am not too picky on which development job I take. I'm not aiming for the Big 4 or anything like that. I just want a job when I graduate where I will be doing something related to development. With no internship experience, mediocre grades, and no personal projects (I can change this from now to August), but with a CS degree under my belt, are even these ""average"" kind of jobs out of the picture? Right now I value working over being in school for any longer."

First off I should say I'm not doing very well in school; my Major GPA is about 2.7, with my cumulative only marginally higher. In the more concrete coding classes I perform very well, getting B+ to A averages, but with the classes like Theory of Computation or Computer Organization I get C's. 
Most people my age at this stage of college are getting internships. I'm going to apply to a bunch obviously, but it's definitely not how I want to spend my summer, since for the most part I'd be doing pretty low skill level work most likely, as an entry level intern, and honestly it sounds extremely boring and I can have a hard time with that. 
The idea I have is that I really want to do some independent projects to strengthen my Github profile, as well as learn what it is like to be an independent programmer, and to test myself and my bounds as a coder. In the independent study classes I have taken I perform pretty exceptionally well, as the projects are self driven and I have an easy time spending 8-12 hours of solid coding in a day(the college I attend I only take one class a month to completion). 
I am strongly of the opinion that this is what I want to do with my summer, but I need some more input on the pros and cons before I'm able to make a truly informed decision.
Thanks!

3ymed0,2,2015-12-29,I'm not sure if I should move out.,ghost_sanctum,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/3ymed0/im_not_sure_if_i_should_move_out/,"I stay with my parents for the sense of familiarity and its convenient to milk living with my parents at least until I'm finished with my undergraduate, besides having to do chores here and there.

However, it's come to my attention that my goals for myself aren't exactly in line with what my parents are comfortable with. I need to *grow* as a person, and as a 20 year old man about to turn 21, I think I'm past the point where I have to ask my parents permission to make a decision for myself. We don't share the same values, and I feel like in their eyes I'm still 17 or something.

People my age , or younger than me, live on their own. 

In addition to that, I feel like I should be able make decisions like:
- get a medical marijuana card to treat my depression, anxiety, and insomnia
- go out on a date with a girl 
- choose my own friends and girls I date without having to get their approval from my parents
-buy a plane ticket overseas if it means getting an internship
- go to certain social events if there's a possibility I'll make a friend who'll save me from being a homebody in isolation all the time.

There are other, not so important choices, that'd I'd be able to make for myself as well.

I mistakenly tell people what I can and cannot do because my parents said so, and they always seem shocked when I tell them I'm 20.

It feels strange being 20 years old and ending up telling people ""I can't do ____ because my parents won't let me"".


The pros I see of this:
- my social life becomes better ( right now it seems nonexistent )
-my dating life becomes existent , and I have my own place.
- I'm given the freedom to personally explore myself and  grow *as my own person*
- one day I need to learn how to live without my parents anyways

The cons I see of moving out
- inevitable homesickness 
- money is going to be tight 
- my room in my parents basement is my safe haven, and if I move out - no more safe haven.
- it's gonna be tough getting used to living without my parents, and at certain points I'm gonna feel really discouraged , alone , and feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.

I also plan on transferring to university in two years at least, so maybe I should just wait until then.

But it's gonna be weird to be 21, drinking a beer in front of my mom while she's telling me I can't be friends with John Doe because she thinks he  smokes weed.

I wish I could talk to them about how I'm feeling, but they're always gonna pull that ""their house, their rules"" card.

I really want to get *out there* and grow as a person, and I feel like my parents are holding me back from doing that, but at the same I like how much money I'm saving, and I feel like I'm more in a safe space at my parents house.

Given the fact that I have to move out sooner or later, I'm not sure which of the decisions will benefit me more.

In a picture perfect world, I'd still be independent enough to get ""out there"" and make decisions for myself, and my parents would let me stay with them until I'm financially independent enough.

3ymi0w,17,2015-12-29,Is there a way to get a taste of professional IT without making a full jump yet?,vaindeer,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/3ymi0w/is_there_a_way_to_get_a_taste_of_professional_it/,"Hi,

I am a 22 year old with a full time job in the public safety sector. I have a 2 year degree in a social science completely unrelated to anything technical. I like my job but I don't know if it's my passion.

I don't have any particular background in IT but I've been around computers my whole life, know the hardware and basic computer troubleshooting stuff just from experience, and have been using websites like codecademy, and freecodecamp to mess around with some HTML, JS, Python, etc.

I am interested in IT and see it as a promising and growing field, I am particularly interested in security aspects or potentially forensics, that would kind of play into the career field I am already on.

My question is this, I am interested in the IT field but my current job is pretty good to me except for the hours (overnights and every weekend), but as for pay, benefits, PTO, etc, it's very agreeable. Not saying I'd never consider a career change, but I'm not going to change a career before I even know if that's the career I want.

So my question - is it possible to moonlight in some IT work, part-time, per diem, PT internship? Whatever? Just some way to see what the field really looks like from the inside and be able to determine if it would be a fit.

Thanks for any responses!"

I was at my previous job for 5 years (a well-known corporation), where I worked my way up through the ranks and became a senior developer. I also have 2 internships on my resume. I decided to change things up by moving to a new city and taking a job at a small company in a new domain. Here I am. 

When I look at my coworkers I can tell I am over qualified. Perhaps it was a red flag when they turned out a verbal offer 2 hours after my interview. 

I feel like the longer I stay here the more stagnant my skills will become. At my last job I was constantly learning new things. Now if I want to learn something new it has to be on my own time.

People talk bad about job hoppers. I don't want a big mark on my resume if I leave so soon, but on the other hand I don't want my skills to stagnate and end up leaving me to climb out of a career black hole. How do you balance these competing forces?"
3ynzyt,4,2015-12-29,Feeling hopeless and depressed,lonewarrior92,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/3ynzyt/feeling_hopeless_and_depressed/,"Hello everyone, I am a 23-year-old male who has been unemployed for the past year. I graduated from University late 2014 with a degree in Business Administration. During that time, I also worked in the University part time as an administrative assistant. My duties included data entry, answering phone calls and emails, and sorting and delivering mail. I did this throughout my 4 years in college. During my last year in college, a female coworker threatened me with physical violence, and claimed that her boyfriend, who was about to be released from jail, would come after me. She threatened me because her friend, another female coworker and I were getting along well. She felt jealous about this and began to slander me. In fact, the other female coworker explained to me that the crazy coworker was coming on to her saying stuff like “Only a woman knows what a woman needs” and other flirtatious comments. I have nothing against people’s sexual preferences, but slander and threats are a different matter. I felt very uncomfortable by this crazy coworker and told my supervisor. His reaction was “you’re still alive aren’t you?”. He made no effort to reprimand the coworker or show any concern for my safety. I then went to Human Resources, and told the HR manager the situation and she just brushed it off as if it were not important. She then contacted the director for my department and had me demoted with fewer working hours (punishment for whistleblowing). The coworker who threatened me kept her job, and was not reprimanded.

Upon graduation, I left the job voluntarily and began to look for work. Jobs that I was qualified for did not want to hire me. My gut tells me my former employer is bad mouthing me. No matter how hard I try to find work, it never works out. I stay at home applying for jobs daily and have become so depressed. I really don’t know what to do. I’ve even applied to internships and volunteer positions and to my surprise they ask for prior work experience! What’s the point of an internship then? Although I have experience, it does not match their criteria as they are looking for a specific skillset. I then turned to staffing agencies and have regretted it. They just ask me to fill out forms and give them my references. My references have told me the staffing agencies are soliciting their services and never once asked about me or my work ethic. I can’t believe staffing agencies have come to this. It’s as if they post fake job listings to get job seekers to come in the office, take all their information, and never get them a job. I think they have a daily quota and get paid not to place jobs for job seekers but rather to get their personal information. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I contacted the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 2014 to report my former employer for demoting me in retaliation for whistleblowing, but they are so backed up with cases they won’t get to mine until late next year. Even then I doubt anything will be done about this. I even contacted attorneys in employment law and they all ask about my current job and salary. When I tell them I am unemployed, they refuse to take the case as I can’t afford to pay them.

I hate my life. I have thought of suicide in the past but kept trying to move forward. Now I have no reason to live. I have no money, no job, no friends, and no purpose. I have searched for ways to painlessly kill myself, but have no luck. All I see are articles as to why I should continue to live in misery. My whole life I have worked hard, and have helped my peers. Now in my time of need no one will help me. All the people I thought were my friends who I have helped numerous times, turned their backs on me. My own relatives don’t even talk to me because they hate my father. I am not responsible for what my father has done. I am my own person. In fact, I don’t even remember my father. He walked out on me when I was very young. I have never heard nor seen him since. I currently live with my mother, and every day she complains about me being unemployed and always finds something to pick at. The stress is unbearable. I just want to die."
3yoayt,38,2015-12-29,IAMA associate at a large boutique investment banking firm. It's pretty dead at work this week. AMA about IB recruiting or the job,restructuring,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/3yoayt/iama_associate_at_a_large_boutique_investment/,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/2l0lgj/iama_1st_year_analyst_at_a_large_boutique/)

So, it's been pretty dead at work and I thought I'd do a new AMA. A bit of background - I work in a restructuring group at a large boutique investment bank. I came from a target school with a low GPA, but a lot of networking.
 
My group conducted both summer analyst and full time analyst interviews this year. Here's how the undergraduate recruiting process works from a banking group's perspective


**1A. The Resume Drop**: During the summer, we will coordinate with HR to get resume drops set up at our target schools. These drops result in around 500 resumes per advertised position. 

Once we have the resumes, we screen you primarily on GPA and previous finance internships. At this point, we are only really glancing at the resumes - each one gets 10-15 seconds max. While there is no hard GPA cutoff, we will only pass you with a sub-par GPA if you have direct relevant experience.  Cover letters are skimmed. You also get a huge plus with course experience in a related field like mathematics, statistics, economics, etc.

**1B. Networking**: The other way to get into the process is through networking. Most of my networking requests have come through cold emails, forwarded resumes, and on-campus recruiting events. We have a de facto policy to speak to anyone that reaches out - if you're going to go to the effort of reaching out to me, it's the least I can do to talk to you for 15 minutes (unless I'm completely slammed). On these calls, I'm looking for a reason to pass you on to the next round - show me that you've some research on the position, and have your elevator pitch down.

We usually aim to pass 15 candidates and 5 alternates per position to the phone screen.

**2. The Phone Screen**: Congratulations, you passed the resume screen. Now, you get on the phone with me or another junior person in the group for thirty minutes. This is a structured interview. I will ask you three or four fit questions and three technical questions. 

&gt;Example questions:

&gt;- Tell me about yourself

&gt;- Why are you a good fit for this group?

&gt;- Tell me about your last internship

&gt;- What are your favorite classes?

&gt;- [Bond math] All else being equal, which financial instrument would you expect to have a higher yield, a 5 year bond or 7 year bond?

&gt;- [Accounting] Walk me through how X would affect a company's financial statements

&gt;- [Brainteaser] Is 899 prime?

Usually by the time I make it through these questions, we'll have 5-10 minutes for you to ask questions. This portion can really make or break your interview. This is a chance to have an actual conversation instead of just regurgitating canned answers to canned questions.

We aim to pass 7 candidates and 3 alternates per position to the second round.

**3. Second-Round Interviews**: These are 30-45 min in-person or videoconference interviews with the associates/VPs of the group. This is a softer interview focused on fit and can get much more subjective. You'll be asked to walk them through your resume before opening it up to informal conversation. Just be yourself. We're a relatively small group and fit is really important to us. We will literally be in the same room for 60-80 hours a week for the next two years so we need to know you're relatively normal. 

We aim to pass 3 candidates and 2 alternates per position to super days.

**4. The Super Day**: We fly you out to interview for a full day in our office. There's a case study/project, a series of technical questions, and a full hour interview with our managing directors. Do your homework - we expect you to be prepared. Appearance matters too. Dress nice, comb your hair, and smile. 

After the super day, the group has a meeting and an informal poll on who we give offers to. The managing directors have supervotes. We usually give out the actual offers the following Monday.

So, that's it. I'll be answering questions for most of the day.

Edit: I'm signing off for the night. Feel free to ask any questions you have anyways - I'll answer in the morning."
3yobab,147,2015-12-29,I don't know what happened to it,mkcrto,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/3yobab/i_dont_know_what_happened_to_it/,"About a year ago I was working as a help-desk intern for a large American ISP.  I handled requests from internal employees, and one of the most common of those was equipment pickups. So a manager would request a laptop for a new employee and when it was ready we would have the employee come and pick it up.  This story recounts one of those occasions.

Important background: Several thousand people worked in this particular location, so we constantly had a backlog of at least 50 reimages at any given moment, and they were all handled on a first-come, first-served basis.

The story:

A new employee comes up to the helpdesk and asks to pick up her laptop.  
&gt; Her: ""Hi, I'm new here and I came to pick up my laptop. Am I in the right place?""  
&gt; Me: ""You certanly are! What's your username? So I can look for it in the cabinet.""  
&gt; Her: ""It's &amp;lt;her username&gt;""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, let me check.""  

I look through the cabinet and don't see a laptop with her username on the label.

&gt; Me: ""I don't see it in there. Did you get an email saying that it was ready to be picked up?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, but my manager told me to come up here because she needs me to start working on a new project and my loaner laptop is too slow.""  
&gt; Me: ""I see. Well, unfortunately, we have a backlog of reimage requests, so yours probably isn't ready yet. But, we'll send you an email when it is and you can come pick it up then.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

She goes back down to her floor and I help the next person in line. Maybe an hour or two later, she comes back up again.

&gt; Me *(starting to walk towards the cabinet)*: ""Hi again. Did you get the email saying your laptop is ready?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, but my manager told me to come back up because I really need that new laptop.""  
&gt; Me *(knowing that everyone really needs their new laptop now)*: ""I'm sorry, really I am, but we have to process the requests in the order that we get them. But let me check with the person who handles the reimages and see if I can get an ETA for you.""  
&gt; Her: ""That would be great, thanks.""

I look up the ticket number and walk to where we do the reimages. I can see laptops on docking stations sprawled across all the shelves. I ask the guy in charge of them, $ReimageTech, when he thinks this particular request will get done.  He looks into it and says that he should be able to get started on it by the next day. I go back to the user.

&gt; Me: ""Good news, your laptop is close to the top of the pile, so we should be able to get started on it for you tomorrow. You'll either be able to pick it up tomorrow afternoon or the following morning.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

She leaves and I once again help the next person in line.  She comes back up twenty minutes later, but this time her manager is with her.

&gt; Manager: ""Hi, this is one of our new employees and she needs to get her new laptop.""  
&gt; Me: ""Right, it should be ready tomorrow afternoon or first thing the following day.""  
&gt; Manager: ""No, that's unacceptable. She needs it today so she can get started on a new project.""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, let me go talk to the person who handles the reimages and see what he says.""  

I once again walk back to where we handle the reimages and talk to $ReimageTech. He's reluctant but he says he'll get started on it shortly and it should be done by the end of the day. I go back to the user and her manager.

&gt; Me: ""He's getting started on it now and he says it will be done by the end of the day.""  
&gt; Manager: ""That's better. We will receive an email when it's ready?""  
&gt; Me: ""That's correct.""  
&gt; Manager: ""Good, thank you.""  

They leave and a few hours pass. $ReimageTech comes out and places the laptop in the cabinet for pickup. He says he sent the email so the user should be up shortly. Sure enough, a few minutes later she and her manager arrive.

&gt; Me *(holding up the bag)*: ""Here's your laptop.""  
&gt; Her: ""Great!""  

I have her log in and make sure her email and other apps work properly. She is satisfied and they leave. I'm relieved that this headache is behind me.

But, I'm not so lucky. She comes back up maybe a half hour later holding the laptop. She shows it to me and it has a six-inch spiderweb crack towards the bottom right corner of the screen.

&gt; Me: ""Oh wow, how did that happen?""  
&gt; Her: ""I don't know! I had it on my desk and I looked down to read a paper for a few seconds and when I looked back up it was like this! Help!""  
&gt; Me: ""Is it possible that you placed it down a little too hard on the desk?""  
&gt; Her: ""No, I just looked at the paper and then it was like this! What do I do?""  
&gt; Me: ""Okay, well I'll have to put in a ticket for a screen repair.""  
&gt; Her: ""How long will that take?""  
&gt; Me: ""It may take a day or two. The ticket has to get assigned to a technician, they order the part from Dell, then it gets shipped here and they replace it.""  
&gt; Her: ""Oh. Will you give me a loaner laptop to use until then?""  
&gt; Me: ""Normally we only give loaners if your department doesn't have any spares.  You should still be able to use the one that you were using before you got this one.""  
&gt; Her: ""Okay.""  

I put in the ticket and she leaves. 

If only I could have been there when she told her manager that the brand new laptop, that she wasted both of their time in rushing, spontaneously cracked while ""sitting on her desk.""

TL;DR  
User and her manager rushed a new laptop to get done only for the user to crack the screen within 30 minutes, causing it to need repairs."

When I went to the interview, two guys conducted it. 
They asked me normal question like who am I, and they also gave me scenarios related to the job.


Well one scenario was ""What would your troubleshooting process be if a client couldnt get internet?""

My response was 

""If they couldnt get internet then I couldnt do remote assistance so I'd have to go to their computer. First I'd check the ethernet cable on both ends to see if they're plugged in. Then I would open command prompt on their computer. First I'd ping google. Then I'd ping the gateway and check if other users are having internet issues as well. If they were I'd assume it was the gateway and I'd go from there. If it was only the one machine I would assume its a dhcp error and adjust it accordingly.""

The 2nd interviewer looked to the first interviewer and said ""That was actually a really good answer"" 

It made me happy that I seemed to be succeeding in this interview but it also confused me. 

They seemed impressed as if thats not something a typical IT guy would do. 

So it also makes me think what is help desk really like? Is everyone going to talk to me like im some moron who doesnt know what hes doing? Am I too competent to be holding an entry level position? I dont think I did something complex. I did a normal thing for testing internet connectivity. But they were genuinely impressed by it. 

Or were they impressed because its just a helpdesk internship so they didnt expect me to be fully competent "

I'm a junior at a northeastern university (fairly well regarded) looking for internships in the coming year. I switched to CS a little late in the game, so I've only taken four classes in the major--Java, Data Structures, a hardware/logic class, and discrete math. I think I have a pretty good grasp of the concepts though (all As). I've got my first interview for a software development internship in the next two weeks and I'm a bit curious as to what to expect. I've read some of the guides around here about technical interviews, but they don't seem to be a perfect fit for my situation. Here're my details:
*I applied for an internship at a small, tech-heavy company in the healthcare industry
*I've already done a basic, online technical test that was writing a function to do some simple data structures problem online.
*I got contacted for a second technical interview over the phone with an engineer at the company. They said it would be about 45 minutes.

So, basically, how will a tech interview on the phone work? They can't really have me write code, can they?

As much as i enjoy my study I don't have any real experience of IT in a corporate enviroment apart from the 'realistic projects' i get.
Now i was lucky enough to find an internship suitable for me and fulfills my schools requirements.
But it doesn't really feel that 'entry-level' to me because of the responsibilities i get shoved in my face.

Because i will be responsible for the IT service and setup for a small international company with no senior or direct colleagues i can rely on or ask for help.

And it's not that i am questioning my competence or feel like i am not able to manage all this, I feel this will be a great experience for me and i will really learn a lot from this opportunity, but i just need that little push into the right direction.

My work will be a variety of tasks from adding new users/e-mails, resetting passwords etc. to repairing/ordering new laptops/PC's, running backups, providing direct support, keeping the server alive and drinking a lot of coffee.

I know everyone's job is not the same, because different scenario's apply for everyone, but if anyone with experience can advice me. Or give me some tips on how to handle this workload properly and some standard procedures i could apply and check on during my first week. I would really appreciate that.

So currently I am a finance major in Iowa state university currently in my junior year with a 3.60 GPA and I am an international student from Malaysia wanting to stay in the United States.  I know a lot of the companies do not want to hire international students because they have to go through paper work and fees in order to hire me.  It is my dream to be able to stay here in the states.  I am willing to do whatever it takes to be able to find a job.  It is my last year of college so I am wanting some advice on what I should I do so I can locate a company that would be willing to hire me.  Does anyone know of any companies or anyone that offers internships or job offers for finance students who are international students? I really appreciate whoever took the time to read this. 
3ypzh9,1,2015-12-29,Course selection questions WRT interviews and beyond?,parkourdeer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3ypzh9/course_selection_questions_wrt_interviews_and/,"I'm currently a freshman CS major and am signed up to take data structures and computer system fundamentals in my second semester. Most freshmen didn't get into CSF because all the spots were taken by the time it was our turn to register, so I hope for this (and skipping Intro CS first semester) to put me a little ahead of the curve, as it's a requirement for most higher level CS classes.

Problem is, the majors-only section of data structures conflicts with CSF, but the professor is supposed to be quite a bit better.

Since most interviews tend to be data structures/algorithms oriented, I suspect having a better professor for data structures could definitely outweigh the benefits of getting a small head start on CS requirements, but I know that some companies also like you to know the material covered in CSF when you apply to an internship, and it'll help me in terms of being eligible for other classes earlier as well. What would you guys recommend? (If I drop CSF, I'd probably end up taking a non-CS course, BTW.)

Also, less important question, probably, but I've applied to a bunch of places already and wrote that I'd be taking data structs and CSF for the coming semester, so how much would it matter to those places if I didn't end up taking CSF, and do I need to let them know?"

I teach 4th grade. I've managed to make it to winter break with only a few breakdowns, but it seems like I'm having my biggest during a time when I'm supposed to be relaxing. I like teaching and I like my students, but the work and the stress is killing me. I'm dreading going back. During this break I was able to do things that I used to do before I started teaching (play video games, read, sew, etc.) and I'm not really willing to give up my hobbies for nights where I'm getting stuff ready and having panic attacks for the next day. To top it all off, I have one parent in particular who basically thinks I suck because her son has a F in reading. I have some students who are super successful, some have shown improvement, and some are still way behind. The other 4th grade reading teacher (who is kind of like my mentor) has told me time and time again that teachers aren't miracle workers, and that there's always going to be students who struggle no matter how hard you try. I still feel like a failure.

In my student teaching, I earned straight ""highly effectives"" and I was the mentor intern for other interns who were struggling. My principal has come through my classroom a few times and I've somehow gotten effectives in everything but classroom management, which was rated as developing. For someone who is a perfectionist, that one rating destroyed me. I think my principal thinks I suck and I have nightmares about getting fired. I'm slightly intimidated by her even though I know she's fair, and my mentor teacher (who talks to the principal more than I do) says I'm fine. My official observation is sometime when I get back from break and I'm terrified. 

I know that many first year teachers feel like this and there's something called a ""disenchantment"" period. I'm just afraid that mine won't go away. I feel like crawling in a hole somewhere and dying. I'm anxious about being evaluated again, anxious that that angry parent is going to get me fired somehow, and I'm anxious that I'm not adequate. Even during the break I felt guilty for relaxing and not getting stuff done. I've even done research on possibly switching careers. I just don't see things getting any better. I don't know the purpose of this post, I just wanted somewhere to post my sad little rant. "

So I just started college this fall at WPI in mass. The first term I got a 3.3 gpa, but a B in my first CS class. We only have A, B ,C, NR. I got an 87 because I miserably failed the final. The class was an accelerated class that did twice they amount of coverage on topics and work than the regular freshman intro to CS class. The professor said I did very well and should be proud with the grade but it's a B. This 2nd term I ended up getting a B in Object Oriented design because the class was terribly graded. I learned nothing in the class literally nothing I had not know going into it. The class was very opinionated. Eg. using getters and setters instead of a comparator method would make you lose points.. So I sadly got a B in the glass to.. Which brings me to a shitty 3.12 gpa in total for the year. It didn't help that I was rushing a fraternity 2nd term too. I know you need a good gpa to get a good internship and get into a decent grad school. But i screwed myself over with this shitty gpa. I've just bought a new java reference book, modern approach to AI, and into algo books to review on my free time. But I don't think it's going to be enough. I even talk to my professors alot and they knew me on a first name basis. But with all respect, If i can't get a good internship or a respectable job or get into a good grad school whats the point?

I am really ashamed of myself for being in my situation. I am going to University for seven years pursuing mathematics degree. I have very low gpa, which is lower than 2.5. I haven't done any internship because I was so ashamed of myself for having such low gpa. And I couldn't ask for help from others because I was always afraid of getting rejected and being judged by people. I always had extreme social anxiety for my entire life, and this made me not possible to hang out with people and make new friends. Currently, I have no friends and only person I talk to and text with is my mom. 

I lived in United States for thirteen years but I still can't speak English comfortably. I still have hard time expressing my thoughts and this is so detrimental to my social life. I really want to be able to speak English fluently and make white friends, but it is just so intimidating and seems impossible. I wonder if anyone would want to be friend with me and I always convince myself that it's not even worth it to try to approach people because I am going to get rejected anyway. 

I'm so ashamed of myself to meet new people because of fear that people will think of me as immature and screw-up who can't take care of his life. I really don't know what to do with my life and feel suicidal. Only reason I don't commit suicide is because I'm scared. 

My plan is to move out to some place new as soon as I graduate. I don't know if I can handle it but I feel like I have to forcefully put myself in a new environment so it's inevitable to become different person.

3yrps7,5,2015-12-30,Getting an internship / entry level engineering job post graduation?,Blazikant,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3yrps7/getting_an_internship_entry_level_engineering_job/,"Hey,

I'd like to know what it takes to get an internship or an entry level engineering job. I've seen a couple other threads on the subject and I was what things I'd have to adjust differently than from being a student. Some things:

I graduated in 2012 with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering (3.40 GPA).  I never found an internship or an entry level engineering job during the time or since.  During college, I was part of a couple engineering clubs (design build fly, a 3D printing club where we had to design a printer / boat for a race, etc.) and did research senior year.  I volunteered during my Fr. year Summer mentoring high school students on an aerospace project at a museum, and Jr. year took a Summer course on LabVIEW.  Basically, I wasn't just attending class and doing nothing and tried to be actively involved when I could.  

Post graduation, I spent about 2 years unemployed, but spent that time on projects and skill development including:

- taking CFD classes through the AIAA (and made a sub-sonic wind tunnel sim. as a post-project)
- made a complex assembly (Metal Gear RAY) in Solidworks.  Earlier in the year I helped my cousin who is creating a space startup CAD with Autodesk Inventor the product he's trying to make.  
- taught myself some Java, Android development (through TheNewBoston), and made a complimentary color app
- designed a 2 directional optimized solar panel rotator controller 
- made a couple programming toys (simple blackjack program, a Pokemon damage calculator, a 2 player puzzle game based on the trick in the ""COMPLETED"" puzzle in Virtue's Last Reward)

I eventually got a job a coating company disposing hazardous waste in May 2014.  My achievements were designing a can crusher with a mechanic using a modified wood splitter with parts onsite that has worked for over a year and coming up with techniques for simplifying how waste is disposed including creating metal stash points so the painters can dispose of metal separate from the garbage and coming up with a plan with safety lead to dispose of wheel dust during non-weekend times.

The point above is that I'm not just sitting around waiting.  I'm actively trying to keep learning and making new things and show my passion for engineering.  

Job-hunting-wise, I've tried revamping my resume multiple times and have visited my college career center, local unemployment office, and have spoken with recruiters, engineers, former classmates, and HR to get my materials checked and any advice on how to go forward.  I check r/jobs regularly and have been on sites like Ask A Manger reading many of the blog posts and comments on resumes and networking.

Networking.  I actually have a good time with people (LinkedIn, neighbors, career fairs, classmates, etc.), but the biggest roadblock I've run into is that my lack of experience hurts me when I'm suggested jobs.  Example: my former high school principal helped me look at his brother's company, but his company wanted people with a lot of experience.  At a conference the other day, I met a guy who offered to show my materials to a client he knew was hiring for positions that fit my skill set, but they wanted people with at least 2 years engineering experience.  It's been a problem and I don't really know how to get around it.

Grad School:  I'm going to try apply this year.  I haven't in the past for various reasons (tl;dr I really didn't like the ""grade competitiveness"" in college that seemed to overtake the environment).  And I'll take the EIT as well.  

This is a long story.  If this comes off as ""bragging,"" I apologize in advance.  About a year ago, I asked for help on a different subreddit, and some comments were about how ""I came off as bragging,"" which I'm fine knowing as constructive criticism.  But... some comments were, hurtfully, how ""my story couldn't be real""or how I was ""clearly lying.""  ...I was depressed for awhile after that...  I just want to enforce that I'm going to continue to as I have more ideas I'd like to see realized this next year.  

If anyone has any ideas on what steps I need to take to get an internship or an entry level engineering job, I'm all ears.  

Thank you in advance.

I've just graduated from a semi-target school. A 3.65 GPA cumulative with a degree in finance. Im now applying for entry-level positions and i am having trouble finding any that don't require work experience (something i knew, dont bash me). I wasn't able to secure a paying internship during my school years, sadly, which was my only option because of financial difficulties and having to come up with the funds to pay for the cost of college. Therefore, as of right now i have no direct financial industry experience at all. I do although have no gaps in my resume and have at one time worked 2 jobs at once. I did my best to try and show the relevance of my skills from my current job as best as i could.

My question basically is: what now? Do i continue to apply for entry level positions and hope i get accepted to one of them? Are BB's out of the question even though i did make some BB superday final day interviews for a couple of internships (which i ended up not getting). I feel as if i am an attractive candidate based on my work ethic displayed on my resume but the lack of financial experience i feel will ultimately deter someone away.

Any advice?"

Since I've been in an accelerated program, I was not prepared at all for an internship last summer.  While I'm graduating this spring, I'm ready for an internship, but not a junior position.

That said, many companies seem to disqualify applicants that have graduated from their internships.  However, given my situation, it seems that an internship is the most viable path, and not an immediate full-time job.  Considering that, I still want to apply for internships.

Anyhow, here's the resume - http://i.imgur.com/qzFFMJT.png

Next semester, I'll be working on a group project; certainly something of more sophistication than I've written thus far.  Consequently, I should have a better project to add to my resume during (or after) this final semester.

As for my GPA, since I'm going for a second bachelors, I only need to take in-major courses.  I have a 4.0 in computer science classes, but about a B average in the math classes required for the major, which makes the cumulative about 3.6.  I would rather list the 4.0, simply because it's a 4.0, and I don't believe it's deceptive since it's explicitly labeled as ""computer science"".  By contrast, were it listed as ""Major GPA"", I think it would be deceptive.

As for the work experience, it's certainly unimpressive, and that's one reason I opted for CS in the first place.  However, I don't figure that I should just omit it.  At least it demonstrates some interpersonal skills.

Any thoughts/comments would be appreciated!"

3yu3j7,676,2015-12-30,A New Year's PSA: Please do not seek validation from this sub,NotARandomNumber,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/3yu3j7/a_new_years_psa_please_do_not_seek_validation/,"As many of you start your last semester or seek out summer internships, I can't help but notice this sub turning in questions about the 'prestige' of certain job, whether or not they should forgo any social/fun aspects of college to focus on studies/side projects, or other questions that mostly involve how they will somehow gain the validation and admiration of their peers.

 All these questions, as well as answers coming from the undergrads who have yet to venture out into the real world, are honestly disappointing. The prevalent attitude on this sub is becoming more and more treating this profession as a means to end to be prestigious or gain some lofty standing in some City Upon a Hill (Working at a 'Big 4' company in SF). The future is becoming binary in that you're either living that dream or you're a failure in life. Why? Quit looking to this sub with the question that boils down to 'Should I be happy in this situation?' The only person who can tell you that is you. 

One of the easiest examples is the multitude of 'Which internship would look better if I want to apply to XYZ later'. Suppose some anonymous person on the internet tells you 'Oh, definitely take Option A because I heard Company XYZ likes that better', are you really going to base a few months/a year of your life on the possibility that this person is right and you MIGHT increase your chance?  Any experience is good experience, as long as you can talk enthusiastically about your internship/projects, an interviewer is going to be impressed. 

The further extreme is obviously 'Would taking an internship at A hurt me later on' when the post clearly doesn't have any other options. Please, for the love of god, lets not have any of this in 2016. Stop putting the cart before the horse and enjoy yourself.  As I, along with any other poster who has graduated, has said, any experience is truly good experience. You can spin anything into being a positive work experience. Working at any internship will only help you in the end. 

The same advice goes to full time jobs. There is nothing wrong with wanting to work at any of the buzzword companies that are discussed on this sub. They are great companies with some truly great engineers working there. However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of the companies not frequently or never mentioned on this sub. If you can meet all your bills and live a lifestyle that makes you happy, what else is there? It doesn't matter if it's working at a small dev shop in a non-tech hub city or working in downtown of a major city for a top 10 company. Do what makes you happy, the validation of the people on this sub shouldn't matter. 

There is also nothing wrong with working at a company that might not be your dream job. Treat it as though it was though, gain as much experience as you can and at least open up to the possibility that you might be happy there. You can always apply to other companies later on and who knows what the future might hold, but do not treat it as a dead end or a road block to your future life, treat it as an opportunity and take full advantage of it. 

**tl;dr** The only person you need to be concerned about is you. If you're happy, who cares what anyone else thinks?"

(my gf just moved back to belgium after her internship lapsed, and I'm dubious it will last long term but I don't want to give her up and break up, at least not before visiting Belgium on my brand new passport) Got fed up after working four years as a bottom-of-the-totem-pole mechanical engineer at a local small aerospace company and quit with no replacement job. I figure I probably want to continue my engineering career, but I don't even know if I can be happy or not as an engineer. I don't believe I want to work in aerospace anymore, it feels too niche.

**What do I like/want?**
* I regularly go to the gym  
* I want an interesting job, whatever the hell that is.  
* I like shooting sports  
* I love my pickup truck and my muscle car  
* I want to find a happy lifelong relationship that will give me kids before too long, don't want casual hookups in nightclubs, don't want to delay kids until biological clocks are screaming.  
*I've never really had many friends, and I want to branch out and have a life for once. I fear that this means living in a city center, where young people tend to gravitate. I've never lived in one, so I can't say for certain, but the crush of people/noise/no yards/apartment living/bums in the doorstep seems like a real turn-off.  
*I like my parent's suburban house because its easy to park my cars in front of the house. Plenty of street parking. If I lived in an apartment, what would I do with my two cars and my motorcycle?  
*If I had my own house, I'd really want to clean it up and remodel to make it look nice, but I don't want to spend my entire life doing that. It's just important to me to someday have a single-family home I can remodel with good size front and back yards I can do beautiful landscaping projects in and someday have children play in. I'd also have lots of room for woodworking and tools and stuff. But all of that is probably off in the distant future anyway.  

**What do I like about my area?**
*Even if I'm not really utilizing any of it, it seems like there's lots of stuff in the broader metro area.  Entertainment, businesses, services, schools, religion, nature areas, city centers, suburbs, (some) mass transit, general things to do.  
*There's water, flat land, hills, trees, interesting terrain.  
*It never snows, seldom breaks triple digit heat, and isn't humid as fuck.  
*No huge scorpions, killer bees, mammoth spiders  
*I'll take earthquakes over hurricanes and tornadoes any day, thank you.  
*Plenty of restaurants, even though I'm not frequently eating out.  
*It's not isolated as fuck, agricultural, or ""redneck."" (sorry rednecks, you guys are cool but I'm just not one of you, even though I'm white, shoot shotguns, and burn lots of gasoline.)  

**Things I hate about the area:**
*People can be very rude and hostile.  
*Traffic is an absolute nightmare, especially if a bridge crossing is involved.  
*Decent schools are either costly and private or located where the phenomenally wealthy live  
*Housing prices are intolerable  
*State firearms laws are restrictive  
*I know it's not just my area but I don't enjoy tattoos at all.  
*Cant install many performance parts on my cars  
*Drought  
*I'm attracted to Caucasian girls and there just aren't that many around here. I've dated outside my race, dated a European, darn near married a multi-racial girl, but white bread is my thing. Pretty open and shut case there.  
*Complete political hegemony. No one here thinks like I do and it really wreaks havoc on finding compatible dating partners. Is a nice balance in either direction too much to ask for?  
*Where are all the ""normal"" people? Everyone's a tech startup millionaire, a financial district snob, gentrification-causing loft-dwelling artist hipster, unstable white trash, ethnic gang member, or yoga-posing, gender-fluid, militaristically pro-marijuana pronoun Nazi who's going to key my car because it's not a Nissan Leaf. Not that these people are inherently bad or anything, but God, how I long to just find some people who are like me somehow. My tribe, whatever the fuck it is, it sure isn't any of that.  

I HATE LA and have absolutely no interest in New York. Countries other than the USA are probably going to prohibit the guns I want to have, and I'm having a really hard time learning Dutch or Italian, so I need my English and my guns.

I've briefly visited Boise and liked the downtown vibe on a summer evening. Briefly visited Albuquerque and it was too dry and grungy. Briefly visited Flagstaff, which was just confusing. I didn't see much of Denver besides the airport area, though the summer lightning and rain was cool. Nevada is too hot and empty, and fuck Las Vegas and its gambling and artificial bullshit anyway. I loved how friendly Missouri was, for a three day business trip I've never seen so many courteous people in my life. Salt Lake had the most annoying street naming convention ever but at least they had good Indian food. Wyoming was deserted. That's about the extent of my travel experience.

Finally... If I leave CA, and I want to return, am I fucked?"

I studied for a Math &amp; Computer Science degree since it was a field I was interested in and I was always good at math and stuff. I do fairly well in my classes even if I don't put in much effort. I have a GPA of 3.3, with the GPA being dragged down mostly by my terrible freshman year. I've taken classes in Data Structures, Algorithms, Computer Systems, Cryptography, Multi-variable Calculus, and Linear Algebra, and I've aced most of them (not that that means much anymore. I feel like these classes were heavily curved or dumbed down sometimes). I've programmed mostly in Python and Java throughout this time, but I wouldn't consider myself good at either of those languages. 


Right now I work part-time at a drug store while living with my family. I keep applying to jobs online, but I'm losing hope. I've gotten three interviews, and all of them failed. Everywhere I applied simply rejects me. I am being honest when I say I'd be happy with anything-- I just want to get my foot into the door in this industry. I am willing to work unpaid internships, or minimum wage on days where I am feeling greedy. I just want something to put on my resume that is more than ""worked at a deli for a year"", and I want to learn some practical development skills. I am very bad at teaching myself. 


I don't contribute anything to github, mainly because looking at the code of other projects simply overwhelms me. I seriously don't even know where to begin when working on such big projects. I can't network since I don't even have any real life friends, so my only option is to hand out resumes to anyone who is willing to take it. I am a terrible interviewer. I don't think I can ever hide the fact that I am shy, submissive, awkward, and not that passionate about the field, so don't give me any interview tips.


My resume...is lame, but it's probably as good as it can be. I have my name and contact info, a list of courses I've taken, and my meager work experience (working minimum wage at a deli, and working minimum wage at a drugstore).


I'd like a job in the Chicago-land area, since I don't want to move away from my family. Is that the flaw in my search?


Should I even bother searching for a CS job, or should I just resign myself to a life working in retail, to the anger of my father for wasting so much of his hard-earned money?"

I've been an intern web developer here for 2 years with only a beginner's knowledge of networking and server management. With our initial quoted price to start integrating the system at over 100 grand, they're asking me a lot of questions. I don't know a damn thing about integrating an ERP.

Do you guys have any experience to share? Insights, tips, or advice? 

I am the best person with technology in the company, which is very sad....and I'm no genius. The old IBM system we have currently receives information from our warehouses over very expensive T1 lines in real time. I have no idea how any of these companies we get quotes from are planning to migrate that data to a new system. Any light you guys could shed on the situation would be veeeeery much appreciated.

3yxzmf,6,2015-12-31,Socially Awkward People Finding Fulfilling work in this field,billdawg4ever,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3yxzmf/socially_awkward_people_finding_fulfilling_work/,"I am posting this because I am just looking for some feedback/ advice from people who have worked in this field.
I have degrees in the social sciences at both the undergraduate and graduate level. I consider the scientific method to be my trade. I have done data science/ analytics consulting for one high profile NGO, and one smaller operation as well. When it comes to inferential statistical methods etc., and the principles of data, I consider myself an expert.
I have had a difficult time finding permanent full time work in this field (of course many of us have). I do however have a permanent fulltime job in sales/banking/finance that pays OK, but of course it is an extremely challenging job and requires some shitty hours.  
At any rate, I have high functioning autism/ autism spectrum disorder, and my poor social skills have certainly been a barrier for me finding fulfilling employment in a job that matches my education and intellect. With that said, most people won’t assume that I am someone with a disability when talking to me. They will just assume that I am a weird dude that they don’t want to associate with.
About a year ago, the extent of the liability presented by my social skills dawned on me for the first time, and I spent months in reflection trying to map out what I should do that would be my best strategy for finding fulfilling work in the long run.
What I have come up with is that I need to get better with programming languages and the information technology side of things, in order to pursue a career in data science.
I am currently studying programming languages and the principles of computing, non-stop. My intention is to compliment my research/data/analytical skills with programming and computer science skills. 
My theory is, that armed with this knowledge, I can pursue a career as a data scientist/ analyst and circumvent the barrier presented by poor social skills. As soon as I am confident in my ability with C programming and SQL I am going to pursue an unpaid internship if I have to in order to start building a solid reputation etc.
Am I correct in thinking that Data Scientist/ Analyst is a good field for people who are socially awkward? And honestly I’m not the type who is going to do a whole ton of nutty inappropriate shit in the office. But I desperately need an environment where I can be a quiet person who keeps to themselves, and is allowed to sound a bit awkward or odd when I give a presentation to co-workers or discuss some findings with my manager.  
Or perhaps you people out there have some different advice for me? Perhaps I should pursue a different field where social skills are not as imperative, or maybe you think I should invest in improving those skills.

3yy060,5,2015-12-31,Need help deciding between internships next summer,Mechanism_Builder,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/3yy060/need_help_deciding_between_internships_next_summer/,"Last summer I interned at Company A which creates products and works with processes that I'm technically interested in. I've learned much about engineering from my coworkers last summer and I overall enjoyed the entire experience. 

This fall I began interning at Company B. This internship turned out to be a part-time job in that it didn't end after the semester and has no future end point like summer internships. This is good  in that I am able to rely on a part-time income to cover some personal expenses. 

I am not particularly interested in what Company B does and furthermore they work more in the civil engineering discipline whereas I am a mechanical engineering major. My boss at Company B has hinted that this job may turn into a full-time position once I graduate. Some issues I have with this internship are as follows:  

In the four months I've been there I haven't been given one engineering project. My main project has been setting up customer relationship management software for the sales staff and generating sales reports for the sales managers.

Recently I was contacted by Company A asking if I would like to intern with them again next summer. This would conflict with my current internship and I probably would have to quit. This could also be problematic in that for this Fall I wouldn't have a part-time job and would have to rely on my savings for about 4 months (I graduate in December).

I'm having trouble deciding which company to intern with over the summer. A part of me wants to go back to Company A because I learned a lot last summer and I feel I could learn much more. But staying with Company B would be the much safer option.

What path should I take?

So, I'm going to graduate in Spring 2017. My issue is that the final semester will only consist of 1 class. Ideally I would want to have a full time job during that semester, but that would be very difficult since I would technically still be a student and many companies want degrees.

I already have a couple of side projects to show off and am constantly working on more. Hopefully by the end of 2016, they'll be sophisticated enough to land me a full time position. But in the event that doesn't happen, what should I do?

At the moment I'm applying to tons of internships, but I had a really late start (started applying mid December) and a significant amount of companies are rejecting me due to their positions already being filled. Of course I'm not giving up and still applying, but it's a scary thought that I won't have an internship this summer.

I also heard that some internships being offered in the fall or spring, but I can't imagine those being very common. So I can't really depend on those.

So... what's my plan?

I've had first round interviews at Asana, Microsoft. I've had first round interviews, and onsites at Google, Snapchat, and Redfin. I felt like I didn't exactly do my best on the snapchat, asana, Microsoft interviews, but I felt that I had done well at Google and Redfin. For Snapchat, I was definitely not expecting an offer because I was not a good cultural fit for the company at all.

I'm a little bit lost right now and need help figuring out what I should do. I feel quite demotivated right now, and need to pick myself up. A couple of questions.

What's the best way to find good companies that are smaller and lesser known? Is it better for me to simply ""apply everywhere"" and not so much worry about whether or not the company is a good company? How do you get to know startups, especially ones with potential?

Companies do not give any feedback on interviews. I have a pretty high rate of applying to being selected for an interview, which makes me think that my resume isn't my weakest point. Besides, at this point the material that is going on the resume is not going to be changing anytime soon. I was wondering if someone could give me a mock interview and point out things that you feel could be my weak points and what I can work on. 

Thanks a lot!"
