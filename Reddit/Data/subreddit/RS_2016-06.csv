I start full-time work in October but would like to gain experience in another sub-section of my field and/or have the possibility to travel on the weekends while getting paid during the week. Ideally the position would be for July-August, in finance/strategy, and paid (but can accept non-paid). Ideally in (Western) Europe because of my dual citizenship with EU and that I only speak English. I use indeed job search engine to find positions but I am wondering if certain countries do not use that site.

How do I find summer internship/volunteer opportunities in Europe or places that have English job opportunities? Am I too late in looking for an opportunity?

4lz5v2,2,2016-05-31,I am getting my BS in CS online. How should I use that to my advantage?,jobscript,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4lz5v2/i_am_getting_my_bs_in_cs_online_how_should_i_use/,"Sorry in advance if my post is annoying or irritating in any way, or if I am being stupid, naive, etc.

I know that there are probably more disadvantages than advantages of getting my degree online (from a regionally accredited non-local state university), but it's my only choice (I can't get into the CS program at my local university). 

But there is at least one *major* advantage: I have the ability to work full-time. If I can manage to get a software development job (or internship), then I can end up with a nice amount of hands on experience by the time I finish my degree. My problem is I don't know how to go about this.

I was just working on a cover letter to send with my resume to a local company, and I realized I have no idea what to say. I have no experience, and the only thing I sort of have going for me is the fact that I'm pursuing a CS degree. But I have a feeling that the fact that I'm an online student will be looked down upon. 

I can think of two options. (1.) Look for a summer internship, and don't mention the fact that I'm an online student. Since the university is not local, the company may assume I can't work during school. (2.) Somehow explain that I am able to work yearlong since I am an online student. I'm not sure how to do that in such a way that makes myself seem appealing. Any advice is welcome. 

What should I do?

4lzejd,1,2016-06-01,I was screwed at work. I think.,Anoxiachan,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lzejd/i_was_screwed_at_work_i_think/,"This is my first time posting here, and I'm unsure if this is breaking any rules.  But I'm kind of at a loss.  I'm currently pregnant, and while I feel like I've been pretty mellow/positive/cheerful I cant tell if what I'm doing is overreacting.

I've worked at my job for two years.  After four months of being a counselor, I was promoted to a supervisory role, and have been in that position until now.  My husband recently graduated with his PhD (huge accomplishment, super proud) and we were going around the state of Texas (huge) in other towns interviewing for jobs he's applied for.  As of April 28th, the traveling stopped, and I knew that I'd be in the same city I had been the past two years, therefore keeping my job.  My husband accepted a couple jobs here, so okay.

In my office, there is the ""Area Director"", and above here is the Agency Director, who is located in a town 150ish miles away.  The Area Director pretty much supervises the superviors in the lower half of the district.  I've always had a really good relationship with the Area Director.  Shes very motherly and seems to be a good listener.  In fact, everyone has had a good relationship with her.  She generally stands up for us when the Agency Director is being irrational.

The relationship I have with the Agency Director is strictly professional.  I had her on Facebook at one point, but deleted her to keep her out of my personal life, because I learned that she tried to become very involved in things that did not concern her.  My bad for originally accepting her friend request.  Anyway, I do what I'm told, consistently increase numbers, which is what she wants, and I show up to work every day.  I kept low on the radar, stayed out of her hair, because she makes irrational decisions.  

So after my husband and I figured we were going to settle here, I decided to apply for an internship that is offered through my agency/state of Texas.  Its a once yearly thing, they accept 12 employees throughout the state and rotate them in hospitals to gain higher credentials.  I originally applied for this job for this internship.  It opens so many doors down the road.  I sent her required paperwork for her to sign (It needs her approval) a month before it was due.  Three weeks after I originally sent it, and emailed for follow up twice, she decided to tell me that Her and another director decided it wasn't in the Agency's best interest to have two counselors applying from the same clinic, and since the other counselor submitted her things first, she wouldn't approve my paperwork. 

There is another counselor in my clinic applying, which I encouraged her to do so. I'm all for supporting others in their endeavors.  It can get bitter, because they only choose one from our area, so we're basically competing against each other, but I'm okay with that.  I did it last year with another counselor, and we're still awesome friends (we were both rejected the first time)

Anyway, when my Director told me that she decided it wasnt in the best interest of the Agency, I lost my shit.  Lost it.  I knew she had heard at one point that my husband was interviewing, but not at any point did I tell her I intended to leave the job.  So I responded directly to her email and stated that she allowed me and the other counselor last year to submit our paperwork, and she, with no hesitation, signed off on both of our packets.  (We still work in the same clinic)  I explained that I was having a hard time understanding what the difference is in this year, and if anything I still remained more qualified than the girl who I encouraged to apply this year.

She drug her feet through the mud, and hesitated to respond for a few days.  And I brewed, and became pissed by the hour at work.  My Area Director approached me about it two days later and said ""She doesnt want to sign off on your paper work, because she has it in her head that the first person who submits their packet gets it signed and thats it.  Shes worried that both of y'all will get accepted.""

So I emailed her, because the woman cant talk to me directly, even though I've tried calling her at this point.  ""The Area Director discussed with me that you're worried about the possibility that we both got accepted and you lost out on two counselors for a year.  While I understand this is a concern for you, can we both agree that it would be in the best interest of the agency to submit both packets to increase the chances of someone getting the internship within the agency.  Last year neither applicants were selected, and no one is saying that the first girl to submit is for sure getting the internship.  IF in the odd chance that we both get accepted, would it be fair at that point that you and the other leader decide who to send?""  I also added. ""If I had known about your rules at the beginning I wouldnt be upset about the application.  If I knew, and it was made clear to the whole agency that you only intend to submit one packet, I would have filled it out and submitted it, but I wanted to make sure my husband's work situation was fine.""

Basically, she signs off on our paperwork, the internship director in the capital decides which applicants get accepted, and thats reported to our agencies, is how that works.  

In the meantime, while I'm waiting for her bullshit, I talk with my Area Director.  She attempts to commiserate with me about how shes been passed up for opportunities, and she feels its a racial thing.  I told her flat out, I think the only difference now is that I'm pregnant. Which she becomes super defensive about really quick.

The Agency Director reluctantly sends me paperwork two days before I need to submit, and makes a snotty comment about ""If we don't receive a grant for your internship, you will be expected to take leave without pay.""  (The internship is super awesome because its paid under almost 100% of circumstances)  So the fact that she has made this comment pisses me off, which is what she wants, I'm sure.

Anyway,  I'm 27w pregnant.  I'm applying for other jobs in my hometown that is 300 miles away, along with my husband, because nothing is set in stone.  I'm tired of working for a director who attempts to clip my wings and cripple growth.  Its so frustrating. I know this is everywhere, but she wont even directly talk to me. Like shes too good to do so.

Quite honestly I've thought about every way I could try to screw this woman over.  Am I being petty?  I dont know.  If she had announced that she was only going to sign off on one packet, I wouldnt even try to submit mine.  But she didnt make that clear, so I started my application and she drug her feet to even give me a no and a shitty reason.

I've lost faith in the organization I work for.  I have a hard time going to work.  I have a hard time listening to the bullshit my superiors spew at this point. :\  I kind of want to wait it out, use my paid maternity leave, and get the hell out of there.

I'm a computer science major who really enjoys programming, but, as immature as it may sound, I guess I'm really bad at school stuff. I've had multiple internships and projects already and have done great in those, but when it comes to studying and tests, I just can't do it. All of my cs classes were fine, it's everything else that I had to take that ended up hurting me.

So now I'm facing the fact that I'm going to have to leave my college. I am definitely going to go work towards finishing my computer science degree at a community college, and maybe try applying to another college after a year or so there if I do well enough, but right now I'm just unsure of what I should do.

Should I go right back into being a full time student while at home at the community college? Should I try applying for a part time job somewhere and take some classes on the side? Since I already have a decent amount of experience(including 2 6-month internships and a 7-month part time job where I helped develop a website), should I try applying for a cs job for now and go back to school in a couple of months? I just am not sure what path I should be taking right now, and any advice would be appreciated."

I'm a CS student who just finished his first year in college. I've been looking for internships, and I got one for a pretty successful startup for some front-end work. I'll be working mostly with HTML &amp; CSS, but also a lot with JavaScript. It's a decent internship, I'll be getting a mentor to guide me, etc.

However, I prefer back-end work *a lot* more than front-end. I know Java, C++ and a bit of Python and I prefer those languages to the previously mentioned ones. I feel I'm more analytical than creative, and feel am better at the back-end stuff. Also, that's where I want to be working when I graduate. 

My question is: should I be looking at another internship with more back-end work? How much will this help for a back-end job later on? Will recruiters (for both other internships and career) care if I had any front-end experience when applying for a back-end job? 

I don't mind being a full-stack developer (at least on my resumes), also this is my very first internship, so any experience can help I guess.
Thanks!"

However I've noticed that about half of them get back to me after a few days saying that they were ""unable to find a good match for my skills and credentials at this time"".

I have the equivalent of a 3.8 GPA from a well known university, but I don't have any significant side projects and don't have any relevant work experience in the field (other than volunteering as an assistant tutor at university). Before starting studies in computer science I also completed a bachelors in medical science, which I'm wondering has any effect on my application.

Or does the lack of side projects / work experience matter that much that I can't get past the CV screen for an internship? I plan on picking up a few side projects on break however have been taking on extra units each semester (and during the summer) to try and catch up for lost time. I also work 30+ hours a week to support myself financially in an unrelated part time job so have been struggling to find time.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I'm seeing a trend on this subreddit where students have difficulty in a class and are finding their teachers more or less absent when a student has questions.  I'm not too keen on dropping ~$28,000 on a program where the teachers aren't available when I have a question, especially when I have no previous experience in coding.

4m1kfg,45,2016-06-01,"How we sold $45,000 of growth hacking e-books on kickstarter, with just one month's preparation",tianan,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/4m1kfg/how_we_sold_45000_of_growth_hacking_ebooks_on/,"I’m writing this from 14,000 feet on a plane from San Francisco to Chicago. At the time of writing our Kickstarter has a week to go and is has passed $45,000 in pledges. It's an informational product, so after fees it's 100% profit - right into our pockets. We have yet to have a single piece of PR where someone external reviewed or talked about our product, and there are a million things we wish we would have had time to do (not to mention the million things we could have done better): We’ve had no “influencers” raving about us. Have done (at time of writing) zero content marketing.

(By the way, I'm not even going to link to the Kickstarter because I know everyone will complain about self-promotion.)

I see founders with great but unsexy products fail when PR doesn’t give them the initial boost they need. In some ways, this is a guide for how to hack a successful Kickstarter launch without getting PR. Why is this important? Most other Kickstarter guides focus on how to get PR, then get a mountain of PR on day one, and the rest is just tinsel on top. Our product isn’t so much sexy as it is useful; this is for everyone with unsexy but useful products. 

As ever with one of my guides, remember no growth hacks will save you if you don’t have a product people actually want. In our case, this was a product that helps people make more money, so there is a strong case. Here are the ten things we learned, from pre-campaign to launch. 

**Lesson 1: Speak to experts before you do anything**

Spend a week reading up how to do successful product launches and kick-starters, to distill the information of experts. Then dive in with people who have done the exact thing you are trying to achieve (never take advice from anyone who hasn’t). 

When most successful people I know want to learn something new, they try and find the best people that they know to tell them how to do it. They don’t read blogs or articles by content marketers. We spoke to a couple of people who had launched similar products to find out what to do/not do. One call in particular I remember making an entire page of notes for (the genius Nick Walter). Here’s some of my favorite points from that call, in his own words:

1. Kickstarter’s internal traffic is maybe the single biggest reason one should do Kickstarter over another platform, or just launching the product on your own site. Many projects typically see 25%-50% of their total pledges come from within Kickstarter’s network, i.e. sales they would not have got if they weren’t on Kickstarter- This is monumentally important

2. Thank everyone who pledges within 24 hours- I did this as I presumed everyone did, and was shocked to find lots of people who pledged to a tonne of products say this is the first time anyone has ever thanked them. I’m pretty sure this massively minimised the number of cancellations I got
If possible, bring your Kickstarter goal as low as possible- If you’re not near finishing, lots of people hold off in case you don’t hit it. You want it to be a party where the product is guaranteed to ship, so hitting it in the first two days or less means you’ll convert at a much higher rate

3. Put in your Google Analytics tag to track traffic and turn on the ecommerce section - see where sales came from, tagged links etc

4. Put all of your efforts into that first day-if many people donate you have a better chance of showing up on Kickstarter’s internal search

5. Tuesday appears to be the best day to launch, though Monday is also good

6. Introduce a new reward toward to the end of the project to galvanise more bids, and get people to upgrade from one pledge level to the next

7. Weekly updates to backers (more if you get more press). Good updates = genuine sentiment, talking about what you’re working on/how the product is progressing, etc
On rare occasions approval can take up to a week, so make sure you send it for Kickstarter’s approval in good time.

8. One of your packages should be dead obvious to choose, maybe even call it a “no-brainer.”

9. Your preview Kickstarter URL will forward to the Kickstarter page when it goes live, so consider doing a redirect from your landing page as soon as the project goes live.
Have a site as soon as the auction ends to redirect people to who otherwise will feel like they missed out

10. After 2-3 days of closing you can see whose credit card didn’t work and message them to let them know- this will reduce churn

11. Delivering the goods: You can go to the backer report and search by pledge level, and send a mass email to everyone which feels like an individual message. This will save you time!

Secondly, my friend runs a successful Kickstarter agency. He has raised millions for clients. When we decided to launch a Kickstarter, I went straight to him to tell him about it. How I thought it would go: My friend would charm me with stories of his agency and all the PR he could get for us, and I’d eventually relent and offer him money to work on our campaign. What actually happened: He told us “You’re doing an e-book and video course. You won’t get any PR for this."" Then he went back to working on his laptop. Damn, OK so no PR.

We reached out to a few people, but we found he was right. Getting press wasn’t the best use of our time. Turns out to be fortunate because we don't have time anyway.

**Lesson 2: Play to your strengths**

With no PR, we doubled down on the things we were good at. For Austen that meant writing and utilizing his email list, for Vincent it was giving talks on growth hacking and utilizing my community.

All good growth hacks get your users to do the work for you, so we built a viral queueing system using Queueat.com. Typically startups build a landing page, and when someone leaves their email they say “Great! We’ll let you know when we launch.” That sucks as the person has shown they’re interested in what you’re doing, you’re gonna leave them in the cold? 

The queue system we made drops them in something like 500th place in a queue when they leave their email. The only way to get further up the queue is to like our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, invite their friends by email, etc. If they finish near the top of the queue, they get bonuses. In our case it was free growth hacking consultancy, free webinars, free entrance to a secret growth hacking group on Facebook, etc. In your case it might be early access or free products. People LOVE gamification like this, and we saw well over 100% uplift (i.e. we more than doubled the amount of people we invited to the queue. On launch day we had over 2,200 people from the queue waiting for the book to come out. This was great, especially considering we only turned it on three weeks before launch (we decided on a whim to write the book, so we did all of this stuff very quickly- with three or six month advance time you’d have a ridiculous number of people in the queue if you worked through this guide. 

We invited our close email contacts into the queue, then sent tweets to our Twitter network, invited my LinkedIn network, and posted in key Facebook groups to get early traction. 

**Lesson 3: Caveat: No silver bullets**

If you’re waiting for the “one strange trick” which set our campaign on fire, you’re not going to get it. We didn’t create a fake Tinder profile as a girl in the San Francisco area, ask boys what they do for a living, and tell them they could become a startup millionaire if they bought this book (that’s actually not a bad idea, reading that back to myself). 

We had a slow, steady, logical campaign hitting up each of our networks and bringing them into the pre-launch community (the queue). I’ve been telling people for a while now that growing your personal network on Twitter, LinkedIn, email list, and Facebook in particular (your personal Facebook, not a company one) is so valuable. I’ve never sold a product through my network before, but had been growing my community aggressively for the last year. 

Honestly, it wasn’t calculated: It’s a no-brainer that your digital rolodex is a key asset. Once you have the contacts, direct marketing is the key here: Let every single person in your network know what you’re doing and when it’s coming out. The WORST thing you could do is send one tweet or one Facebook post and except everyone to see it. Most people don’t see most posts.

**Lesson 4: Pre-launch campaign**

Jeff Walker accidentally created a method he calls the “drip-feed email marketing” (a bit of a generic name but whatever) a few years back, and I’ve still never found a better way to warm an audience up pre-launch. It goes like this: Send three emails/messages to your community before you launch. The first is all about why you’re launching this product- i.e. what it means to you, how it will benefit them, etc. The second is what the product is, i.e. diving deep into it’s features, and the final email is how they can purchase it, i.e. the release date is coming up in a few days. here’s how you can purchase it. His book dives into this in a lot of detail, and is well worth reading. So we used this format to keep our community informed, as well as the emails to everyone in the pre-launch queue. 

The amount of invites went up after every email. We had no expectations that people would naturally be sharing- people need to be prompted. Seeing that, we decided to set up a Thunderclap for the day the Kickstarter launched, and supposedly its reach was about 1 million people. As we mentioned before, this whole campaign was very last minute, so we actually only invited people to join the thunderclap with 24 hours notice, and mainly to our close network. (So again, think what you can do with proper preparation). I also gave one growth hacking talk in London two weeks before and two talks in Canada the week before launch, to capture e-mails and get people hyped about the forthcoming launch. 

**Lesson 5: Sleepless in San Francisco**

We made $10,000 in the first four hours, meeting our goal. We had a following which was roughly 50% UK and 50% America, so we launched at 2pm UK time, which meant New York could jump on it at the same time, then L.A. would join in three hours later and the party would be rocking. It worked.

Hour one: Facebook, Twitter, and Linkedin status update that we’re live. Email blasts.

Hour two: Thunderclap

Hour three: Tweets going out once every 30 minutes per Twitter account, either to the Kickstarter, or content we had written in the past that now linked to the kickstarter. If a tweet isn’t seen in the first 17 minutes, it will likely never get seen, so keeping a consistent flow of tweets will mean a consistent flow of traffic to the landing page. There’s not much better than consistent, targeted traffic when you’re marketing something.

Hour four: Posting to key Facebook groups. Austen wrote a “how we hit our target in four hours” post, and although the point wasn’t just to promote the product it drove a heap of traffic, discussion, and… two sales :)

**A disclaimer about growth hacking because I know you all hate the word so much:**

First, I know. We don't like the word/phrase either, but that's what other people use so we use it. It’s a slight misconception on what growth hacking is. Growth hacking is often just solid, scalable direct marketing executed in a logical way. We had given everyone who joined the queue a free chapter to whet their appetite- A movie director used our guide to get over 200,000 views on YouTube. 

When you give away a sample of what you’re doing and it’s good, you don’t have to ask them to come over and try your food - They’ll turn up with a knife and fork on opening day. A side note from Vincent: ""In the first four days I spent 100% of my time round the clock replying to everyone who pledged, questions from all over the world about different pledge levels, and continuing to update your community. 

On the second day, I did an AMA (Ask me anything) with #TechLondon, one of the busiest slack groups in the world. After that I wolfed down breakfast and did a webinar with Startup Socials. After that I took a nap for 45 minutes then did a podcast with @The App guy. The second day was monumental in sales also ($8,000-ish). If we had more time to prepare and had lined up more days like this, the numbers would’ve been bigger, but again we kind of did this on a whim at the last minute. ""

**Lesson 6: Bookless book tour/launch party brings the internet to real-life (again from Vincent)**

I have talks in Dallas, Austin, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, and New York, having previously spoken in Vancouver and Victoria in Canada, and a pre-launch party in London in the pre-campaign. Planes from city to city cost around $250 each, so you soon make that back with more on top with just a few sales if you can speak to 50+ people in the room, as well as growing your personal network/email list. Public speaking is the single best way to make a real connection and begin a sales process with multiple people at once, particularly if you’re selling a high value item (like consulting, the main product my company sells). We had multiple packages in the Kickstarter which were hundreds of dollars also. If you don’t know how to start public speaking, do the following: 

Search your niche/keywods for every meetup/event on Meetup and Eventbrite. Find anything that looks active/has a lot of members/people attending

Message all the event owners through these platforms something like the following: “Hey, I’m a big fan of your meet up. I give a talk on the 10 things everyone gets wrong in our industry/10 ways to get better at what you’re doing in our industry”, and I’d love to come and give a talk at your event. I have a massive network I can invite (Just write that, they’ll never check). Can I come and give my talk at one of your forthcoming events? 

Tweet all the event owners at the same time “Just emailed you through Eventbrite/Meetup regarding your event. Hope to hear form you soon!” which will send them over to the page if they didn’t receive it.

About 25% of these will reply positively and you’re off to the races. Always mention that you’re looking to give more talks and the audience will help you out by recommending you to others.
As for the talk, at a basic level just write down everything you want to say on the slides if you don’t think you’ll remember it or are super nervous. Then just riff around it. give away more secrets and value than you’re comfortable with- people will appreciate it, recommend you to others, and even those who could take your info and use it tend to be too lazy and will hire you/buy the book to get one of their staff to implement it.

Put your Twitter handle in the corner of every slide and have an intern collate all the positive tweets people write while watching you- killer social proof to get you better talks in the future
Have your email on the last slide if people want your slides. Now you have their emails to contact them, if you didn’t get them already from the Eventbrite signup. Those emails are handy when you have a book to promote! :-)

**Lesson 7: Alongside solid methods, have some moonshots too**

Marketing is all about trying new things. The problem with tapping your own community is there’ll always be a limit. I tried a few different things as experiments. I went on four or five different podcasts, and could see from the analytics that a couple of them brought some sales, so it’s likely if I had done more there would have been more sales. I was interviewed on TV/Radio in Los Angeles which was difficult to track but went out to a huge number of people. Maybe it caused a bump for those few days? We have so many sales each day it’s difficult to tell. We also got into as many peoples’ mailouts as possible- anyone who had a mailout which reached entrepreneurs/founders and was in my close network we reached out to. This brought som traffic and sales. For those who didn’t have a mailing list, we asked for social shoutouts. No one of these methods brought a considerable spike, but as an aggregate they were all worth doing.

**Lesson 8: Introducing the one-person mailout**

One growth hack we utilised which was extremely manual was one of our secret weapons. We emailed people who had seen me talk, told them where they could see me talk for free, and let them know the book was out. This took a lot of time. Traditional thoughts would have been to bung them all in a BCC and be done with it, but guess what- people are wise to that and your engagement rate will be close to zero. We always ended every email by asking if there’s anything we can do for them or any marketing problem they’re having. My email got comically blocked up the first few times I did this, with person after person getting free consultancy from me for their companies. But because there was no mailing list, we landed front and centre in their inbox (whatever you do, you’re likely to end up in the promotions tab on Gmail if you’re sending to a lot of people unless you’re some sort of email ninja who knows every hack necessary, i.e. not the majority of us). As a side note, Labelizer is AMAZING for tagging groups of emails that you can then share with other members of staff, i.e. you don’t want to give team members or interns access to all of your emails for data security reasons, but obviously you shouldn’t be spending time on manual tasks, so this allows you to effortlessly tag different groups of people and have someone else reach out to them.

**Lesson 9: Things we messed up**

Just as important as what we did do, is what we didn’t do, or did badly. So don’t do…these:

Our tagging of traffic on Google Analytics could have been better. If you don’t know what we mean, here are the basics: use the Google URL tool to create different URLs for every source and campaign. In all the chaos of getting all our traffic sources setup we didn’t put this in for the first few days and missed some valuable data. 

As ever, priotirising traffic is never something worth regretting, but for optimum performance, knowing exactly where everything is from is so useful in deciding what to go deeper on.

We started our launch campaign with only four weeks notice. This was a side project for us, but if it’s your next startup or business idea, three-six months or more will bring incredible results. You can nurture PR, webinar, and podcast relationships, build a gigantic queue, have a weapons-grade content marketing plan, and become a six-figure Kickstarter success story

We got so wrapped up in all our plans for having a huge first week that we had little happening in the second and third weeks other than my talks. Spending more time building relationships would have enabled us to have more external traffic coming in consistently throughout the campaign. When we had that crazy first day, I got that naive entrepreneur hope that every day could be like Christmas, and it soon reduced down due to inadequate planning. As Donald Trump says, Sad!

We also had no content written for content marketing in advance. For some reason I thought once the Kickstarter was out, I’d have time to burn some incense, sit down by candlelight and get some good writing done. Wrong! Next time I’ll have all my articles pre-written and the publications which have agreed to feature me all set up. We could also have used these as content to send traffic to from social channels, with Kickstarter ads sitting inside the content on our sites. Content marketing is a much, much easier sell to publications than trying to get a review copy/get interviewed/be featured, partly because a) All blogs need content, and b) It takes the writer a lot less work/organization/brainspace.

This isn’t a regret as such, but it may have meant more sales: We did basically zero paid marketing. I’m sure there’s an argument for putting $25 in and getting $50 of an e-book sale out the other side, but we didn’t do it this time round. Maybe once the book is out, or maybe not at all. We had no budget to do this with starting out. Now we have a budget, but I once told a classroom of marketing graduates “if you’re an early-stage company with no revenues, paid traffic is for losers”, meaning of course, there are so many ways to get free traffic that paid will just eat the hell out of your margins. Nevertheless, I’m sure I’ll be eating my words soon.


**Lesson 10: Maybe I’ll do PR next time**

I don’t want to leave this article without bringing a few tips on PR ([this post](http://austenallred.com/press) has already kind of become the bible anyway), as many founders reading this will find it useful. I’m planning on doing major PR for my next book, have got PR for companies my agency has worked with as well as myself, so I know the basics. Generally speaking in Kickstarter, your pre-research starts with manually looking at all the similar projects that were successful on Kickstarter (and Indiegogo and GoFundMe if relevant), do a reverse image search on their main image, and see where they got Pr around the time of launch. (Google them too, obviously, but the image search tends to sweep up everything). Then make a list of those journalists and reach out to them, as if they are interested in Y, there’s a good chance they’ll like X also. You can check out our PR chapter from our growth hacking guide here, which has pages and pages of detail on how to do PR the easy way.

**Conclusions:**

It’s been a fun three weeks. You never know what will happen when you hit that “launch” button, and we were very pinched for time, but solid pre-planning and following the above formula should see most products having a very strong chance of hitting their target. Be thorough, relentless, and just a little bit cheeky. As we mention in our book, organic growth is almost always a complete lie. Go make that growth happen, and you too can feel the joy of going to lunch and coming back to see you’ve made $1,000. This is nice and all, but the real fun will be seeing what happens when people read and start actioning this book, i.e. your product is out there in the wild :)"

I'm currently a freshman studying CS. I know the first course of action is to seek out internships, and with a week left of school (and after dozens of rejections), I'm left with an offer from a startup. 

I know this isn't bad, but in such a competitive market, I'd like to be able to push myself ahead of my peers. 

With that said, my parents agreed to pay for a coding bootcamp this summer if I choose to enroll in one. I've heard nothing short of great things from them, and if people really get hired straight out of a bootcamp, then they must be learning something right? I figured if I enroll in one this summer, I'd be able to learn a lot and excel ahead of my peers when I apply for internships again next year.

I understand that bootcamps often don't teach fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, discrete math, etc.) as well as a traditional University, but I am going to continue school after this summer, and I plan to continue for the full 4 years. 

So, without factoring in costs, is a bootcamp worth my summer? Will it really put me ahead of my peers? 

And if anyone has had experience w/ a bootcamp, could you recommend anyone? I'm located in San Diego and am willing to take online courses as well.

I made a nice little script that does some aggregation and sorting, but I have to manually open up the file first and delete some rows, which is now what I want to script.

I've done some research and it appears that the best way to delete unnecessary rows in excel, I should create a separate data frame and just copy the desired content into  it then right? That seems kind of a pain and I wanted to ask if there was a more simple way of just deleting the row if the A1 cell does not equal to ""PLine"" (the start of the column names)

EDIT: Here's a picture to visualize what I mean
https://imgur.com/QuW3IZc

Because each data sheet can reference a variable number of data sets, I can't just delete X number of rows. As I said in the picture, my logic is to delete the row until A1 = ""PLine"" or I guess the other way around would be to copy the data frame where the A-columns start with ""P"" but I'm not sure which way is easier."

**Introduction (first time posting)**

So this is my first time posting here. I'm not very familiar with how in detail you guys get as far as answering specific programming problems. I've thought about asking the guys over at Stack Overflow as well, but seeing as I'm more familiar with Reddit and already have a Reddit account (and not a Stack Overflow account) I figured I'd ask you guys first

**About me (experience)**

So I'm a sophomore computer science student, so the large majority of my knowledge as far as programming goes is theoretical and not very hands on. I know several languages  and I'm very good with computer science theory, but I've had little to no experience working on real world applications. I managed to get an internship working for the geological sciences department at my university. They hired me to work on a web app that they want developed (used for education in the earth sciences). Only problem is that I have zero web experience apart from a few online tutorials on java script. I'm also the only computer science student working on this particular project. There are two other cs majors that work under the same professor, but they're both working on a separate virtual reality project.

**Question:**

So my question is: how the hell do I use Google Appengine? 
I'm currently trying to build a fairly portable web app that needs to really only needs to do two things:

&amp;nbsp;

a) access *MY* google drive (not the app users) and

&amp;nbsp;

b) download a file from *MY* google drive and on to the users computer

&amp;nbsp;

There are some processing steps in-between, but I've already gotten that done on a prototype local app. Is there anything you guys know about Google Appengine or web app development in general that could help me? I really appreciate any and all help

&amp;nbsp;

**Knowledge:**

I should mention that I am currently trying to get everything working in python (I know that you can work in python for the Google Appengine), but I also know Java, C, and C++. I also know very very little Javascript, but I'm willing to learn it if it makes life easier

&amp;nbsp;

**Thanks:**

Again thanks for your help! I really do appreciate the help. Thanks!

**TL;DR: How do I web app?**"

It's a lot of work doing this manually, so I wrote some code that checks column A and then puts a 0 in B if the condition is met. See the following code:

    Sub Example()
    
        Dim LastRow As Long
        Dim i As Long
        
        LastRow = Range(""A"" &amp; Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
        
        For i = 2 To LastRow
            
            If Range(""A"" &amp; i).Value = ""5"" Then
                Range(""D"" &amp; i).Value = ""0""
            End If
            
            
            If Range(""A"" &amp; i).Value = ""11"" Then
                Range(""D"" &amp; i).Value = ""0""
            End If
            
            If Range(""A"" &amp; i).Value = ""17"" Then
                Range(""D"" &amp; i).Value = ""0""
            End If
            
        Next i
        
    End Sub
          
As you can see the values 5, 11 and 17 will be checked in A, and in B, the value will be set to 0 if it's true. In reality, the spreadsheet I'm using is quite a bit bigger. It needs to check for a lot more values.

In the actual spreadsheet, the relevant column is D. This one needs to be put at 0 but for now it doesn't matter. In column D there's a formula (=MAX), that checks the highest number from some columns. The original value (which should already be 0, and the data that I imported from a different program). That formula should stay there, and only if the value (5, 11, 17) is met, should the value be changed to 0 (when I finish the spreadsheet everything gets turned into a value and not a formula regardless). 

Now what I want, is for the code to be much shorter. You see 3 lines, of checking a value and then replacing it. There's actually about 30 or so, that need replacing. Is there a way, to replace the 5 with something, like ""MyNumbers""? And then MyNumbers = 5, 11, 17? 

What I would like is for someone else to just add a number to ""MyNumbers"" and then the code would run the same way. My coworkers haven't even heard of VBA yet, so I need to explain this to them in a very easy way... If they're going to copy code, they'll fuck it up one day and they'll be back at the start. This is a proces to eliminate mistakes being made every week. It's just an internship, I shouldn't care so much, but I want to leave with giving them this... That way they'll remember my great work.

I'm currently unemployed and looking to get into web development. I found out about FreeCodeCamp just recently and have started doing the first module. I also just recently found out about a bootcamp starting where I live that uses the FreeCodeCamp curriculum to teach web dev but also provides instructors five days a week for a few hours, a workspace to collaborate with others in, and possibly a paid internship with a local company.

I was thinking of doing this bootcamp because I know it's hard for me to stay motivated sometimes in learning something and I figure it might provide better opportunities to learn from other web developers and find a job more easily. I'm thinking of just doing the Front End module to get my feet wet. They're going to provide me with a scholarship so it'll only cost me $1K which isn't an insignificant amount of money but not too harsh either.

So for those people who've done FreeCodeCamp and gotten a job or are still doing it, does this bootcamp sound like a good idea or is it mostly a cash grab? It's the first time they've done the bootcamp and I researched the people who are running it and they look legit and some of the instructors are teachers at a local university. So it's like getting college level instruction/guidance without paying insane tuition.

I did some programming in college so I'm not a total novice but it's been years since I did any significant coding. So I could do it on my own but I think this may be a better option for getting a job more quickly. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
4m7bk5,4,2016-06-02,Help with Junit tests,alsdkfjlaksdjf,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4m7bk5/help_with_junit_tests/,"Hey /r/learnprogramming

I just started working as an intern for a company, but I have only finished freshman year in college. I feel competent at coding in Java, but for my job they have me making Junit tests. Easy enough, I can google the syntax and all that and I can read their code easily enough (although it isn't commented...). My problem is I'm not exactly sure what all the fringe cases are that I'm supposed to test for.

public final class DataFormatter {

    public static String formatBinaryDataAsHexString(byte[] data) 

{

        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {

            sb.append(String.format(""%02x"", data[i])).append("" "");

        }

        return sb.toString();

    }

}

Clearly, it takes byte[] and formats it into hexadecimal. My mentor said to test what happens if you pass it null, what happens if you pass it just one byte, stuff like that. This is the simplest example I have, so my question is as follows. How am I supposed to know what I have to test for? On top of that I'm not super great with writing the tests, but I can figure that out given how much time I have (he said even if I don't write a line of code my first week and just read up on documentation, that's fine.) Thanks!"

Computer science major, graduating Spring 2017 and currently have 3 classes left to finish and can put in 30+ hours until I graduate.

I've been working at my current company as a software intern for about 10 months. I like to think I've been doing a really good job and I really get along with people here.

I tried to ask my boss for more hours a few weeks ago because of all the extra time I have. Unfortunately, I got denied the extra hours due to the law so I sought out other internship opportunities.

I successfully got offered a full time internship this summer at a place I really wanted to work at for a while. I'm very eager to work there and the pay is more than 50%. However, when I informed my current manager about this, he was genuinely upset and about 30 min after I gave my notice, he counter offered. 

As of right now, I've been told to wait for an offer because HR is on  vacation and won't be back until Monday. I'm not sure what to do now because a lot could happen. 

My current boss could either match the offer I have or even offer a full time job. The new internship is not guaranteed to extend the intern position after the summer but my current employer wants to.

However, I sometimes feel that my current job is slow and I learn at a very very slow pace. That could change if I'm offered more hours and money, because right now I'm only limited to 20 hours/week.

What would you do in my position? Take the new internship? Take the current internship? If my boss offered a job (is that even possible? I could actually put in 35+ before I graduate) should I take the job and stability or seek new opportunities? "

Heading into my senior year, I'm now debating whether or not I should go for my masters degree or head straight into industry. My career aspirations is to become an entrepreneur either as a founder or as a C-level executive in an up and coming startup. (Silicon Valley, preferably)

I currently attend a state school in NJ that has a very strong reputation in the state (TCNJ), but is not really known outside of the tristate area. I've managed to secure two internships during my time as an undergrad. I've worked at a satellite company last summer, and this summer I'm interning as a software engineer at Bloomberg. I'm looking at the engineering management programs at schools like Stanford, Duke, Columbia, and Cornell. I've done very well in my undergrad program (~3.7 GPA), and I believe I can get very strong letters of rec. etc. My reason for wanting to get my masters degree is for the networking opportunities that would come with attending a school like the ones I mentioned. I'm not really concerned with finding a job, the problem is finding the right kind of job that I would enjoy. I'm in my early 20s, so I'm still formulating my ideas and understanding how the industry works which is why I'm not comfortable starting my own company right out of college. The question becomes is a masters degree and the connections that come with the institution worth the $100k+ that comes from foregone salary and the loans I would have to pull. 

My argument for going into industry is I still have a lot to learn. I'm a decent programmer, but I don't think I would be able to pass a coding interview at a company like Google. (Hell, I've applied 3 times and have yet to even get a phone interview). I'm thinking a couple of years in industry would do me good to really sharpen my technical skills before jumping into management. Only thing is it probably wouldn't be a company or job I'm interested in. Any advice would be appreciated! "

I wanted to initially get an internship, but it looks like its too late to make that happen. So my next thing I wanted to do was work in bartending. I have 0 experience in bartending or waiting tables for that matter.
Right now I have a probable offer from a local country club to be a wait on thursdays through sundays. I would be able to get another job to work around that, either working days M-F. The pay would be better, but I wouldn't enjoy the work nearly as much.
I also have a offer to bartend a local performance art center near my town. I'm coming as an outsider with no experience, whatsoever, so getting a foot in the door is an important thing if I want to have a future in bartending. The thing that gets me about this job is that I work whenever there's a show going on (which, is usually thursdays-sundays, so not an overly different schedule). I kind of want to get more into bartending, but i'm afraid that this erratic scheduling might make this job not worth it. The money isn't as good, so unless I get a lot of work in, I won't really get much but a line on a resume from this summer
As of now, I'm leaning bartending, but does anyone have any words of advice for choosing, i've got my first day bartending saturday, whereas the waiting job is still doing background checks and i have another interview this monday."

Not necessary to read all to understand, I'm sure you will get the grasp from just a few.

* Before the university I was full of dreams of a scientist career, a pHD in physics, was looking at the technology centre buildings and thinking I will work there after getting bachelors

* I was studying physics with a direction of computational modelling and electronics

* First 3.5 years were ~okay, some things were going better, some worse but I passed everything and had time to study for finals

* During the 1st year I had a part-time job from home with a fully flexible schedule, as long as I work 20 hours a week. This gave me the idea that job is in general not hardly manageable with studies

* ""However no matter how much I tried my average result would always be around 7/10 (in the classification my country uses: 5 is a minimum to pass, 6 is ""satisfying enough"", 7 is ""mediocore"", 8 is ""good"")

* Example: In the first year I'd study for the higher maths exam from 5 to 11 hours a day and I got a 6

* I only got 10 twice: both from programming where I didn't need to take any exam, just had to code some exercises

* Even from my favorite subjects I couldn't manage to get a 10

* Example: before every electronics lab assignment I would wake up 5:00, take a can of monster and go to the library to study. At 9:00 during the lab my performance was exceptional (not exaggerating, other people from my class found it very hard). Overall I got a 9 and a classmate who had problems with labs got a 10 because she wrote the exam well

* Except for the things that I had deep interest in and thus researched them after the lectures, most of the information would just pass through my ears and especially during the practical assignment tasks I felt really behind

* Especially when the mental block would kick in and I just sit and wait for this to end because I can't do anything

* I took the basic mechanics course twice - first semester with one group, other semester with my own

* I felt like I really learned it well. But I got an 8 after all

* Sometime at the second year I enlisted to one of the labs which start off with no pay but if a student keeps working, they start getting paid

* I was really excited about those labs, it's the start of the scientific career basically. Some people started in the first year, I was very jealous and glad that at the second year I managed to go and talk to these supervisors to accept me

* Once I went to the lab to get familiar with the environment, the tools, the work, the people. There's no schedule of when to go, one goes when they can

* I was recommended to read one book about optoelectronics, took it from the library at the same day

* I read like 10 pages and after a week I went to the lab again

* For like 30min I was looking at the block screen of some engine and went home

* Next week I sent an email that actually I won't be able to work at the lab anymore

* Never went to any lab again

* At the semester 6/8 I started an internship of 2.5 months. Even though managers would often let me go to the university and work after-hours, this fucked up with my studies big time. I have no idea how do others do internships and only go to tests/exams at the university and pass

* Many subjects from that semester was just a fog and some I just barely passed, probably because the professors didn't want to make a retake session for one person 

* In the middle of the 7/8 semester I got hired in a big serious company for fulltime with no option of part time

* This fucked my studies even more as the work takes a lot intellectually and after work I barely have energy to study

* At this time of the studies one should choose a supervisor and a topic for the midterm thesis (which is 90% the beginning of the final thesis)

* I found an interesting topic supervised by a cool professor

* Started working on it pretty early

* Ended working on it literally one hour before it needed to be done. I remember sitting at work on a night shift and running calculations on my crappy laptop, stressing and thinking will I make it

* Thesis turned out really short and weak but I got a 9 because everyone who did worse got a 9 and who did better got a 10

* ""I'll definitely allocate more time for the final thesis and use it wisely""

* For the first time, I didn't pass an exam. It's no problem though, I can retake it as many times as I want before graduation

* Semester 8/8: I attempted to retake the exam twice and I didn't pass

* Thesis doesn't go well but I try to concentrate on it

* Study subjects don't go well at all as I barely even go to the university

* Apparently the last semester's exams take place one month earlier. Fuck

* At this point I actually went to the doctor, a psychologist, to get re-diagnosed and treated for ADHD

* I took a 1 year break last year in may (end of semester 8/8)

* ""Next year I will definitely use the time more wisely and write a damn good thesis""

* Next year (semester 8/8 attempt 2) started this february: some may remember some whiny topics about studying and graduating in this sub - possibly posted by me

* My head is a lot clearer, I have more energy and motivation

* Energy discharges pretty fast but at least I show up to the university almost every time. I had a talk with my manager, etc, that I need to swap a bit of my shifts to be able to graduate because I can't study that at home

* 2 more attempts to pass the unpassed exam. Once I got 1, another I got 4

* I meet the thesis supervisor almost once a week and don't repeat the same mistake of not doing anything for 3 weeks

* Thesis still goes slow and sucks

* Out of 5 laboratory assignments I performed 2 and completed one for absolutely no reason, just had no energy

* Of another subjects laboratory assignments I completed 1 out of 5 because the subject was so difficult that I had no hope to complete more (everyone else did)

* The grades I got this semester: 5, 6, 7, 6 

* Like a week ago was a deadline to submit thesis. On the next day was its local defense and on the same day I had to retake the unpassed exam

* Improvement: after finishing the thesis this time I also could allow myself a night's sleep

* When the supervisor saw my conclusions he said he can't sign it and told me to reformulate them, reprint the paper with conclusions and to bring it with me to the defense

* Also my whole formatting is wrong, starting from lack of page numbers, ending with weird picture notation

* I finally passed the unpassed exam (got a 5)

* The defense went well, except I had to reprint the whole work with proper formatting

* Every time I go to these technology buildings to collect signatures, etc, I feel depression and the feeling of broken dreams

* The supervisor recommends 7 for my thesis if I defend it well during the real defense and the reviewer recommends 8

* The supervisor's rating is objective - I didn't achieve one of the work's purposes and the other purpose was only partially achieved

* I feel like the supervisor's review not only reflect my thesis but is also a good metaphor for my whole study experience. ""One of the purposes was partially achieved but just the basic stuff""

* Today was the day of the real defense. I went to defend first and I think I did it much better than with the mid term thesis except that I could barely answer to one of the questions and got a bit confused with another

* My final evaluation was 7 (let me remind: ""mediocore""). Yay I graduated

* If someone during the first semester told me that I would end up this way, I wouldn't have believed. It's not how I imagined everything

* I won't go for the masters degree now. It's impossible with work

* gg at least I got a degree and it took me 5, not 6 years. I'm not even feeling relieved. Tomorrow I'll go to Stockholm and try to forget everything

my main reason posting this is to mainly gain insight, people who were in similar situation, etc. what did the rest of you guys do when you  got your BA, before you went to/applied to graduate school ? i know it is absolutely  possible to get a graduate degree in a field completely different than  that of your BA, but i am confused as to how ? from doing research,  it looks like it is completely dependable on the program/school.

anyone have words of wisdom, advice, suggestions? im sure someone people have been in the same boat as me. pretty much, i am just confused.

I had my first job about a year ago as a server at a retirement/nursing home, stayed for 3 months, left due to abusive management that corporate eventually gutted (bonus: lawsuits &amp; fines), and haven't been able to work since. I've had to dedicate most of my time and effort to math (fuck math) and programming (love it). The times I've applied for jobs and failed are due to the numbers game (ex:50 people applied for one job), not having recent or ""relevant"" experience, going to school (even fast food chains), lack of a car I can use 24/7(public transport is shaky here) and even my major. My interviewing skills are probably a bit rusty since I've been focused on school for so long. I'm also not ready/skilled/know enough languages for internships in my field yet. I'm actively looking for real work, but my resume is still small. 

Long story short, I joined a faith based organization/club because I lost my high school friends from moving and needed to be involved in SOMETHING. I'm not at the uni yet, but will transfer there soon. My community college is hardcore commuter and doesn't have many clubs. I'm trying to dig out clubs there too AND at my future university, but figured why not network and sample my future university too. The club is actually not very religious/political/whatever, maybe it was before, but hardly anymore since people are more accepting of non-Christians and such now...usually. Assholes are everywhere. After being in it for 1.5 yrs, I got an executive board position as a ""Social Media/Historian"" director (volunteer position). I think my responsibilities will be relevant to entry level jobs in computers. My main tasks will involve Microsoft Office, Apple and Windows software, web design and running websites, social media, event coordinating and related, office type tasks, working on a team, and leadership stuff. 

As this will take a good amount of my time, I think it would be a waste not to include it on my resume. The religion isn't weird or anything, but it's a religion. I know people who volunteered or worked for faith based place, included it on their resume, and are doing great. My doctor has always been an atheist, but has and still volunteers at local churches and such to provide medical care for the poor. I need something to put on my resume to ""prove"" I'm not an antisocial bum or whatever until something less ""controversial"" comes along. I'll still be learning programming, doing side projects, looking for real work, and looking for less controversial clubs.

How should I include it and what should I say if someone asks about it? 

Any advice is appreciated. "

4mdxil,2,2016-06-03,What can I do with my degree outside of CS/CE?,audifanatic2510,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4mdxil/what_can_i_do_with_my_degree_outside_of_csce/,"After having gone through school and graduating at the top of my class with a computer engineering degree (double major in applied math), I'm finding myself very unsatisfied with industry. While I excelled in school, I'm finding industry to be an entirely different experience. While I know I'm not the first to feel this way (and certainly not the last), I don't think I can keep doing this. I go into work every day feeling less enthusiastic than the day before and I feel like I don't particularly feel happy with the job I'm doing. 

And I do understand that everybody has aspects of their job that they don't like, but that's usually not the whole job. My (current) co-workers are friendly, intelligent people, so there's no issue on that end. However, this is my thrid job (including internships). I started off at a very large, well-known tech company. I then went to a small, mom&amp;pop defense company. Now I'm at a medium-sized industrial machinery company. While at the small company, I had some issues with an abusive boss, which is why I left (in addition to boredom and low pay, but mostly abuse). 

This past summer, I went back to the daycamp I used to lifeguard at, just to detox and get away from engineering for a bit and clear my head. Unfortunately that made things worse (see below).

Now I'm making more than the average kid my age (24) and have awesome co-workers. But something's still not quite right. Since leaving school, I've been diagnosed with severe depression, among other mental illnesses. While the career path has a lot to do with it, it's not the whole story (the rest being sexuality-related; especially in regards to a straight-crush I had on a counselor at the camp -- which ultimately led to me accepting my sexuality more, but at the cost of a deeper depression)

So the question is, what now? I wasted 4 years in school for something I thought I liked until actually doing it for real. I kind of want to do a complete 180 and get out of engineering all together. I was thinking medical school, law, or teaching. Recently, the thought of becoming a veterinarian crossed my mind again (which is something I toyed around with as a boy). But to be honest, I'm really not sure. 

In an ideal world, I'd be lifeguarding still; maybe even on the beach instead of a pool. But western-society requires that I ""grow-up"" career-wise. I don't want to make another mistake, just by choosing something else simply because it's not engineering. I want to actually enjoy my job this time.

In college, I majored in computer engineering and applied math. So I'm working as a software engineer now, but I can also do electrical engineering. I toyed around with the idea of becoming an actuary with my math degree. But as I go through engineering, I'm finding it very hard to sit (rather, stand in my case) in a cubicle, working 9-5. It's just not something that resonates with me. I'm not a multi-tasker and I cannot deal with corporate politics whatsoever. I've always been pretty independent and pretty oppositional defiant. Deadlines are usually an issue for me because I'm extremely meticulous in nature. Finally, I do not like the idea of having to define where I live based on my job. The benefit I see to working being a doctor, lawyer, or teacher is that they're needed virtually everywhere. If I wanted to work for company X as an engineer and I take an interest in area Y, as an engineer, I'd have to move to where company X makes product Y, which does not thrill me at all. For instance, most of the good tech companies I'd be interested in are in Silicon Valley. But, being a surfer and with my intense love for the water and warm weatherm I'd much rather live in San Diego (I currently live on Long Island, NY).

Any suggestions?"

In the past year I came across this new world of Data Science and this subreddit. I'm currently finishing up my Bachelor's in Computer Science and I'm beginning to feel the push to ""do something with my life"" after graduating in a few months. I definitely don't see myself as a computer scientist my entire life and I really want to get into the data science field. 

I'm not too sure where to start. The way I see it, there are four options: 1. find a DS job 2. get a DS related master's 3. do DS related research at an institution 4. bootcamp. 
The more I look into it, the harder getting into options 1 and 2 seem since I don't have a solid data science or stats background. The only items I have to rely on are my computer science experience (SQL, python, C++, Java) and one engineering statistics course I'm currently taking. The only internship I have is also computer science related and not at a major tech company. Since I am also about to graduate, I feel as if finding a data science internship is also out of the window once I get my bachelor's. 

Reading this subreddit I noticed a lot of ""I know a guy who..."" or ""my cousin landed a job..."". I am not looking for examples of really bright individuals or one-time circumstances. Instead, I really would like your opinion as to how I, an average joe, can start my data science career. "

During college, my boss allowed me to remote desktop into our systems to work a minimum 10 hours a week (or more if I wanted to), and in the summer I work full time.

I am very thankful for the opportunity and the learning experience working there, however I'm a little worried about sticking to the one job. Basically, if I stay there throughout my time at college, I may be able to have 5 years experience right out of the gate. Which is huge. However, I see other people going to multiple jobs and getting varying experiences from them.

Does it look better, from an employer's view, that I stuck with one company for 5 years, or that I've had experience from a wider variety of companies?

How am I supposed to compete when I am nothing compared to these people?

I too want to intern and work at top companies some day, but it seems that it's too far fetched of a goal.

That is, doing just a 3 month summer internship will not earn you credits, but yea you will still gain experience.  

Anyway, I want the experience, but need credits too, so I already planned that 6 credits will go towards an ee and tech elec (as stated by SOE).  

My question is when would I do this co-op? Should I wait until my very last semester (and do co-op jan - june) and graduate during that time. I think this will make me very fresh for employment post-graduation. Along with that, I am thinking or hoping to get two internships (or one) in previous summer, which will give me amply experience to get the co-op. 

How is my planning ? Any advice ? also share what you did and experience or what you plan to do and why ?

Let me start this off with my background. I will be graduating this December with a CS degree from a decent school in the Bay Area with a 3.8+ Major GPA. I will also have 3 internships (1 big company, 1 startup, 1 @ Stanford) and a lab instructor position under my belt by then. 
Two being software test automation internships and one being a mainly data analysis internship.

I have a few questions
1) If I am graduating at the end of this year, when do I start applying for full time positions?
2) If my school schedule for next fall allows me to be free from 10am-6pm everyday, should I be considering a internship/co-op/fulltime position during the semester?
3) Will three internships and a lab instructor position give me any negotiating power for salary? Or am I still considered the lowest entry level? I'm hoping to make around 100k in the Bay Area starting.

Thing is, I've gotten rejected from every software and embedded company I've applied for.

I haven't taken a class involving microcontrollers yet, but have messed around with them in school clubs.

I really want to clean up my act and get a relevant position either as a full time job after I graduate, an internship next summer, or a co-op during the school term. 

Please give me your opinions: how do I become a programming and embedded systems stud over the summer, that companies would love to hire?

4mlmhk,4,2016-06-04,Unpaid Internships - Are They Worth It?,theyoungemployee,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/4mlmhk/unpaid_internships_are_they_worth_it/,"There are a lot of articles out there that simply hate on unpaid internships (at times in this post I will also take a dump on the concept). However, I want to explore both sides of the story to determine if unpaid internships are really worth it.

I have been an intern before. In fact I have been unpaid intern before. So I’m a pretty good judge to provide an overall perspective on the concept.

But before I take you on this journey I want to make one thing clear – I’m not an advocate for free work. Rather I want to help you decide if taking an unpaid internship is worth it given your own circumstances.

So let’s start by looking at the three main reasons why companies seek to engage unpaid interns:

1. They want to take advantage of the current job market (lack of entry level positions for young employees) to engage free labour. Essentially, the unpaid intern does the job of a paid employee but doesn’t get paid. This type is completely unfair and such internships should not exist. For the record, I have completed this type of internship before. It’s a disheartening experience.
2. They partner up with schools, Universities or other educational institutions to help students complete their study requirements and gain valuable industry experience.
3. They are seeking to provide the unpaid intern with some industry experience and training. In return, the unpaid intern will receive future job prospects with the employer (assuming you do a good job and there is a position available) or a professional reference you can use when applying for other entry level positions in the future.

I don’t think anyone could argue that reason 1 is anything but unethical, immoral, and probably illegal. But unfortunately, the Australian job market has gotten to the point where young students feel that they have to do whatever they can to gain industry experience – even if this means working for free. Organisations know this and some use it to their advantage. Wherever possible avoid getting yourself into these situations.

But how can you identify such internships? Look for the signs. These include:

- Required to work more than 3 days a week
- A lack of a formal training program
- The unpaid nature of the internship is not disclosed on the job advertisement (why is the organisation hiding this?)
- The duration of the internship exceeds 12 weeks
- The responsibilities of the intern appear to be equivalent to what a paid employee would be expected to complete

A legit unpaid internship program should always be designed to benefit the intern more than the organisation. If at any time you are tasked with work that a paid employee should be completing its likely your situation falls under reason 1. Unpaid internships should be designed around a solid and well planned training program that aims to enhance the interns skill set and industry knowledge.

Receiving training and development is key here. In fact, an unpaid internship program should look and feel more like a training program and less like work. At the end of the day, if you are completing work you should be getting rewarded for it.

So where does this leave us? My advice is to always look for paid experience first and an unpaid internship should be an absolute last resort. There are of course cases where your educational institute may require you to complete unpaid industry experience and this is fine. Learn as much as you can and then get out once it is done. If you do decide to give an unpaid internship a go make sure the organisation has you there for the right reasons.

Still trying to decide? Check out this table below:

The Good:

- Resume booster (work experience)
- Prospect of future employment at that organisation
- Professional reference that can be used when applying to entry level positions
- Upskill/ practical experience
- Increase professional network (increased LinkedIn connections)
- Make new friends

The Bad:

- You have to work for free!!!
- Can be disheartening and demotivating
- The organisation COULD be taking advantage of you
- Cost of time (Could be making $$ in another job instead of working for free)
- May have to juggle another form of paid employment to get by
- Less time to spend in other parts of your life: studying, paid employment, friends, and most importantly sleeping.

4mnm70,3,2016-06-05,[Advice] When/If to bail?,CodeMonkey25A,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4mnm70/advice_whenif_to_bail/,"I'm 2 years out of school with a CS degree from a decent college. During my time there, I did lots of side projects and internships in mobile development and had a blast. Really loved working in small teams with cool stacks to build awesome stuff, you know modern development. I loved the work I did (now I hate the work I do). Fast forward to my senior year of college in September I had a decent offer from a very large, non-software company for a selective 3 year IT rotational program. Salary was non-negotiable at 65k but promised aggressive increases. If I signed within 30 days I would receive a bonus. With all my friends in different majors running around panicking that they'd never get a job it was all to easy to sign and be done with it early (trap). 

&amp;nbsp;

Now after 2 years, I'm strongly questioning whether or not to stick around. To be brief, both years have been extremely lack luster. I've received very little mentorship or teamwork. I'm essentially 1 year of free labor for the teams I rotate to which results in me being assigned ad-hoc scripting work. I haven't really gotten to sink my teeth into a real project. I'm set to start my 3rd and final role in a few months. I've learned from the past two situations and called the manager to request a concrete project to work on. I was told I'll be doing Android Development on a new and up coming project and working with a team of 2-3 other developers. It sounds promising work wise, but the team is all outsourced. The technology they will be using alongside the application is old and I feel culturally it will be miserable. 

&amp;nbsp;

Basically, I feel like for the past 2 years I haven't really had anything I'm proud of to put on my resume. Year 3 might provide that, but I'm very concerned the reality once I arrive will not meet the expectations that have been set (for the 3rd time). Also, salary will be ~75k once I move into my final role with 10% yearly bonus. I'm being sent to an area with high cost of living.

&amp;nbsp;

My concern at this point is that my skills have rusted and I will struggle to get a real development role. On top of that, I'm awful at technical interviews, but purchased CTCI and have begun reviewing. I've sent out 30-40 resumes over the last 2 months to explore options and have only heard back a handful of times. Most of which, I fail the interviews before meeting in person. My current position is in Colorado which means I have access to the Denver/Boulder tech scene.

&amp;nbsp;

**The way I see it I have several options:**&amp;nbsp;

A) Stick around and finish the program and decide to bail or stay then, next position is in the NE, away from tech scene.&amp;nbsp;

B) Bail now, live off savings, brush up on algorithms, hope to land a dev job (Budgeted well, 1-2 years before I'm broke.)&amp;nbsp;

C) Soft reset, bail and do a coding bootcamp (not sure how these are perceived, but I think I could use a refresher, just cost)&amp;nbsp;

D) Hard reset, bail and go for a masters or 2nd Bachelor's degree (know a professor at my school, can hop in, but cost++) &amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;

**TL;DR** : Took a role in a 3 year IT rotation program in a big corporation, but want to do pure dev work. About to start final year, but first 2 years haven't been useful to my career. Concerned my skills have rusted. Very concerned about landing a new gig. Looking for advice on what to do.

I'm 29. I graduated with an English degree when I was 22 and I've been back in school for a few years for a Computer Science degree (another bachelor's). I have just one class left and anticipate graduating by the end of this year. I've been planning on trying to be a software developer but I've realized I'm probably not cut out for that and not really in love with the idea of programming every day for the rest of my life.

I haven't had any real trouble with my CS degree. I hate math a lot so that part was a chore but I got good grades and I'm generally pretty decent at actual programming. I just don't really want to write code every weekday for the rest of my life. I know impostor syndrome is a thing but I've never felt like a ""real"" CS major and I don't think I'm really wired for any sort of engineering-type job, if that makes sense. Basically, I feel like an English major who forced himself through a harder degree in some misguided attempt at making more money more than I feel like a CS major who found his calling a bit late. 

Even if I wanted to be a developer I feel like it's probably a bit late for that anyway. I had a perfect opportunity to invest fully in that and start working on personal projects and things like that when I went back to school. Instead, I did the bare minimum and never wrote a line of code I wasn't being graded on. I'm pushing 30 and I'm supposed to be competing with people like my 22 year old brother, who has had numerous internships in college, has multiple awesome projects on his Github, and been coding since he was 12? Not gonna happen.

So now I'm about 20k extra in the hole for a degree I don't even really want to use (even if I can) and I don't really know where to go from here. I'm not really worried just yet. I mean, surely there's some way to make this combination of degrees useful. 

I'm kind of at a loss and open to suggestions. I don't really have any real preferences or ideas right now other than some vague idea that I'd like to earn more money than I currently do as an admin assistant, which shouldn't be all that hard. I don't mind working in the software industry as long as I'm not actually writing much, if any, code. My people skills are kind of so-so, which can be improved but I'd prefer something that a kind of socially awkward guy could reasonably do.

Anyway, I'm feeling pretty lost and confused right now so any advice or suggestions would be really appreciated."

-Student Council 9th and 11th grade, helped plan two blood drives and various fundraisers, elected as Vice President(!!!) and am working with the president to set up a council of clubs to help enrich our schools clubs affiliations with one another!


-We have a PG17 committee where a group of students plan the trips and fundraisers for our graduating class, I am the Vice President of the group and primarily am in charge of talking to companies and organizing fundraisers and events such as a Black History Movie night or after school bake sales!


-I spent every Saturday for 9 months going to a Somali cultural center in my area and assisting a group of girls who had recently migrated to the US. The assistance composed of teaching them how to use Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, giving them the rundown of how to college application process in the US is like, and helping them with improving their grammar and basic school work.


-Learning about and planning how I am going to build my own gaming rig


-I had a one week internship at a local university, I helped in the IT department and assembled and cleaned computers.


-Lots of volunteer work at my Turkish cultural center; I taught a water marbling class and set up booths at various festivals.


200+ hours of Volunteer service that doesn't include my work at my cultural center.


SUMMER PROGRAMS:


both programs are for this summer!


-CreateatUT, a summer program at University of Texas- Austin for women in Engineering to meet with and get lectures from engineers in various fields, visit engineering companies in the area, and get hands on experience through projects!  


-Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program- a 7 week long program where Ill be learning how to code in Scratch,Python, HTML, Javascript, C, and CSS! Scratch for the basics(which I already know), Python for animation and game design, HTML JavaScript and CSS for web design, and C for robot programming! The program will have over 200 hours of instruction, 8-12 guest speakers, 4 field trips, a mentor ship, and 2 workshops! 


I think both of these summer programs will not only enrich my knowledge of computers, technology, and programming, I think they will provide means for me to make connections and get some hands on experience in my major!And hopefully some recommendation letters :D


Schools: Im going to apply to UT Austin, A&amp;M, UCLA, USC, UCB, UCSD, University of Michigan, Georgia Tech,UW, and Rochester Institute of Technology. Im applying for a few others, but these are the colleges that Im very hesitant about weather I would get in to! Any help, tips, or criticism are very welcome! Im super open to  recommendations for colleges I would be a match for, btw!


Thank you!! &lt;3

Since she's moved in, she rarely comes out of her room and watches Netflix for 10+ hours per day in bed. My mom has to prepare all of her meals for her and call her down to come eat, and after eating she goes directly back upstairs to her room. She rarely speaks or socializes with any of us, and basically just lives here for free doing nothing. 

Now she did manage to find a job about a month ago, and after she was hired my parents suggested that she move out to find her own place. She told them that she'd prefer to stay here because she didn't have to pay rent, do her laundry, cook, or clean. After 3 days of being hired, she was promptly fired for showing up late, and always texting/making calls during the work day. 

Now my family is Indian, and while my dad moved here to the US when he was in college and is pretty progressive, my cousin and her family remained in India throughout her life, and they're currently trying to set up an arranged marriage for her. At this point, we've figured out that she's just going to continue bumming around our house until she can get married because she has no interest in working any more (stopped looking for jobs).

My issue is that I think my parents should kick her out of our house at this point, since its been 6+ months since she's arrived. My mom and sister agree, but my mom won't say anything to my dad because he bullies, threatens and makes fun of my mom, essentially telling her to ""stop being so dramatic and suck it up"". I know this may seem really selfish, but I just feel like our home isn't our own anymore because of this stranger (should be noted that I've literally only seen this cousin a handful of times in my life, my dad isn't even close to her). I just want her out but I have no power because my parents have all the say in this situation. There's basically no point in asking my dad when she's going to leave - I've tried before and he just pretends not hear me or screams at me to shut up. 

Should be noted that I'm in college and just came back home for the summer to intern so I really only have to deal with this until the end of August, I just feel bad for my mom because she has to wait on her hand and foot, and for my younger sister because she can't use her ""study room"" anymore (have to go through the guest room to get to it, cousin lives in the guest room and always keep the door shut + locked) I've tried getting my mom to talk to my dad about it and reach a compromise, but at this point she's just started screaming at me as well, telling me to stop causing a fuss and just deal with it even though she continues to complain to my sister and I on a daily basis about how pissed off she is that our house has basically become a hotel. I just don't really know where/who to turn to."

I am at the end of my degree and just began a 16 month amazing internship. But I spend about 3 hours in transit a day from work to home (and this can't be changed). So I figured I'd ask here for suggestions on what books to pick up.

Right now I find security to be a major interest of mine. I also find software architecture really cool (Even though I am not on the architecture team in the internship...). I already have taken a 300-level honors-only course in security where we covered the basics of most systems in pretty solid detail. I also have a really strong understanding of operating systems, and actually really loved that course.

So if anyone has books to suggest I would really appreciate that. I want to keep improving myself :)

I'm about 3 hours away from them. They came up this weekend to drop some stuff off, and it was the best I had felt all week. They said that I'm always welcome to come home on the weekends, and I've been debating whether or not to come home every other weekend since they left.

When I'm at college, I don't miss them nearly this much and I'm always around other people. But being here I'm only around other people when I'm at work.

I haven't been talking to any of the other interns, and they haven't made an effort to talk to me (or each other as far as I know). We just go in, get our work done, and leave. I'm planning on asking some of them to lunch tomorrow and seeing where that gets me.

Is it a bad idea to go home this often? I'd like to adjust to being alone so it's not so hard after I graduate, but I also don't want to feel this bad every day until the end of the summer. Any advice on overcoming homesickness in general?"

With the stress of school and my internship constantly weighing on me, it's nice to get on the bike to let my mind relax for a while.

Since the temperatures have been decent at night, I've been experimenting with some night riding. It's been an amazing contrast to the bustling and busyness of the day time. Being in central Pennsylvania, or Pennsyltucky, as people like to joke, means it's easy to find a quiet back road with nothing but trees and farms. The peacefulness of the night, interrupted only by the growl of my exhaust, is like transcending to another world. I really started enjoying my night rides, it was my therapy. But after last night, I'll never be riding past dusk again. 

I keep a Go-Pro attached to one of my helmets that I use to record during trips, to review my riding, and for emergencies if they happen. Last night was no different. I geared up, started up the bike, and left my town for a peaceful ride through the country. I ride this particular road a lot. It's my favorite road because it has the perfect combination of scenery, some twists and curves, little traffic during the day, and non-existant traffic during the night. 

I turned onto this particular road in the dark Pennsylvania country and immediately feel like something is off. What's usually a time for me to let the world melt away started out as a bout of paranoia. 

""Something isn't right."" I said like someone was actually listening to me. I frequently talk, hum, or sing to myself in my helmet to stay entertained. But this wasn't entertaining right now. I verbally ran through a check list. Locked the door. Have my wallet, phone, and information. Bike is running smooth. I couldn't shake the feeling. I kept looking around like someone was watching me. Then I realized how irrational that was and I talked myself back to a state of neutrality. I wasn't freaking out anymore, but I wasn't in the state of mind I set out to be in. I was just there. 

A few more miles down the road, the already sparse houses were becoming farther and farther away. I was in Amish country surrounded by fields and livestock. The cows were still awake, either that or my loud exhaust had woken them; I could see the glow of their eyes fixed on me as I rode by. 

There wasn't a single cloud in the sky and the moon was barely visible; just the slightest crescent was out that night. That's when the former paranoia I had turned to sheer dread. My spine felt like it lit up as the tingles shot from my neck to my lower back. 

""Where are the fucking stars?"" 

Was that why I felt like that? The almost pure darkness was overwhelming as soon as I took notice. I looked around but couldn't find the usual beauty I loved to look at. Except for three. 

They were in a triangle and seemed...different. Somehow. I spent the next several miles switching my gaze between the road and those three stars. The more I looked the more mesmerized I became. My mind was flooding with thoughts, my body wasn't sure what emotion to experience. It felt like I kept switching between sheer dread and sheer joy. 

I pulled over. ""Wow."" That's the only word I could use to describe the pure darkness that was sprinkled with the three stars. I hit the kill switch on my bike, turned off the ignition, and watched them for a moment. Then I felt the sounds. I didn't hear them; they didn't seem to become from an outside source. I felt them. Like two hollow metal balls clanging against each other. 

Clong. Clong. Clong. It resonated through my mind. Slowly getting louder and slowly getting faster. CLONG. CLONG. CLONG. The feeling of dread came back. CLONGCLONGCLONG. I got on my bike that very second. I rode home faster than I safely should have. The threat of a deer in the road was very real but I chose to ignore it. I didn't look up I didn't look anywhere but the road. When I was safely under the street lights of my small Pennsylvania town I began to calm down. I got back to my house and went right to bed. It took what felt like an eternity to fall asleep but it came eventually. 

The worst part of my ride didn't happen that night. I wish it had ended when my head hit that pillow. But when I woke up, I realized my head never did hit that pillow. I never did cover up under my sheets, get warm, and lay there contemplating what happened. When I woke up I was sitting on my motorcycle, both feet firmly on the ground, both my hands resting on the tank, facing a patch of trees. I panicked and fell and dropped my bike in the process. I had no idea what was happening. 

I picked up my bike with its now broken left mirror and left turn signal and prayed to a god I don't even believe in that it would start. It did. This time I really did ride home. I parked my bike. I walked inside and I sat down. I didn't know what happened. 

I sat for over 20 minutes going over every possibility of what might have happened. That is, until I remembered my Go-Pro. I took out the memory card and uploaded the contents onto my computer. Things didn't happen as I remembered. I took my night ride onto my favorite road, that did happen. But I didn't go home that night. My ride consisted of me moving at a slower than normal pace, occasionally glancing at the sky, not muttering a single word. I pulled into a patch of trees a bit off the road and shut my bike off. I never even took out my phone. I just stopped and I just stared. The battery on my Go-Pro died after a while so I don't know if anything happened between then and the time I ""woke up."" 

All I know is that I will never be riding after dark again."

Here's some information on my situation:

- UK based, 22 years old
- First class honours degree in History from a London university
- Currently work as a production assistant at a legal publishers in London (we produce directories and legal magazines)
- Live in London, currently stuck with 5 months left on my lease

My concerns:

Although my job is just about tolerable, I put a lot of emphasis on vocation and this line of work simple isn't for me. I don't like: 

- working in an office 9-5
- sitting down all day because of chronic neck and back problems
- being on a computer all day
- close interpersonal contact with employees (I'm not a complete anti-social, I just prefer working alone)
- working on something that I don't find interesting or doesn't contribute much to society (in my opinion that is)
- the corporate way of life (I'm just talking about bureacracy and petty bullshit really)
- being mentally drained (both from stressful deadlines and then having zero work to do for days at a time!)

Skills/passions/hobbies/interests (don't necessarily have to be linked to a career, but they might give you a better idea of my character):

- I enjoy writing: I have written and published a small comedy-travelogue, am 10,000 words into a novel, write for a rapidly growing video games site, and write other film reviews and short fiction/poetry now and again for myself mostly. My long term goal at the moment is to write another book (this time a full length novel).
- I am obsessed with films - watching, reviewing, discussing, trivia, news etc (I make a film podcast with my friend, although it has lost some momentum unfortunately). I would love to write a script and see it turned into a feature film. 
- I thoroughly enjoy video games, although I don't play them anywhere near as much as I did when I was younger (perhaps an hour max in a day, if that). I would like to be involved in the creative side of video game creation, such as narrative design, but am not particularly interested in programming and other technical aspects. 
- In the last year or so I have been teaching myself how to carve wood, and I have done several small carvings that I think are getting better. Woodcarving has been one of the few things that really calms me down and destresses me. I like being able to switch off and just *do* something and have a finished product at the end that I can be proud of, and to express my artistic side that I haven't really been in touch with since school. I am also trying to dabble in prop-making. 

The big issue:

- I would like to make a living doing something that is very creative, but because my main skill is writing (and I don't enjoy commercial writing) I realise this isn't a very realistic goal. Suggestions on how I could make this more realistic would be appreciated. 
- Although most of my family are blue-collar workers, I am unique in that I have a degree level education and have been encouraged to not learn a trade and instead focus on white-collar industries. I'm starting to think this isn't for me, but I'm honestly a bit terrified by the idea of completely changing the direction of my life and ""starting from scratch"". I suppose I just need some encouragement in respect to this!
- A lot of industries that I would like to work in seem so impenetrable, especially when most of my skills are ""soft skills"", and building a portfolio in a professional environment is tricky because I would have to take an entry level job or internship that wouldn't pay enough to support me. In particular I am referencing the film and video game industries, of which I would like to be a part of. Advice on routes into these industries, or perhaps similar industries that I haven't thought of, would also be appreciated. 

I realise this post is a bit of a hodge-podge, but I'm writing this during lunch at work and I get a bit brain-dead in this office! I think I just really want someone to straight up *tell me what to do*. To many ideas in my head and not an inkling of what to do with them. Also I'm sorry if I sound like a bit of a prat, I didn't mean this to be a condemnation of office work and an ""I'm a creative spirit but no one will pay me to be *who I am*"" rant!

I am extremely frustrated right now and pretty much just need to vent and get some advice.

Right after I graduated I moved to another country, where I wasn't allowed to work for 1 year and a half due to immigration rules. I have finally acquired the ability to work a month ago and have since been applying non-stop. 

In this meantime, I did take a lot of online courses, and did a few personal projects. 

I have applied to about 50 jobs, and received 3 interviews so far, they were the first ones that just basically ask me my story, previous experience, etc, nothing technical. One of them I just got rejected from, the other two have been quite silent for the passed couple weeks, one of which I was told we were gonna do a part 2 the following week (it's been 3 weeks!).

I am also finding it increasingly frustrating to get an entry level job that I am able to do. Do people even know what junior or entry level means these days?? Or is my definition that one that is wrong? Most of them ask for 5+ completely different technologies of all ends and platforms with 5+ years of experience each. For just about everything I apply, I feel like I am bending the truth as far as my capabilities go and ask myself how many people around here actually know all of this. And here I am thinking that it means for someone fresh out of university trying to get their career started!

I have also been keeping an eye out for technical interview related stuff so that I can be ready, and to be completely honest, it's completely discouraging. I feel like I have to have ready everything about JavaScript &amp; it's 24873894723 frameworks and libraries, Algorithms that I haven't looked at since my 3rd semester in university and of course the ability to make an app while being watched. Meanwhile I am also trying to expand my experience with languages and frameworks so that I can actually add that to my resume and maybe and some interesting projects for my github profile. Speaking of Github, I am now starting to hear that I should contribute to Open Source projects on Github if I want a chance anywhere, I don't even know where to start with that! I've also been using websites with daily tasks to try to keep my programming skills acceptable, but I feel like I'm even failing at that. Oh and by the way, I learned hardly ANY of this in university, all my relevant job skills were learned either through my internships during university or on my free time while I couldn't work.

I feel so defeated.

I'm I really a failure at this? Is this really what I should expect in this field? I sometimes start to think of taking a job in retail, customer service or something and then take a 2 year college course which I could probably be inserted back into the field through an internship or something, that is how most of my colleagues from university landed their positions.

If possible, some words of encouragement would also be very nice. I want to cry right now.

**tl;dr:in a month, applied to dozens of jobs, got mostly rejections and a few initial interviews with no word back; feel like I am not qualified for anything, feel like I'll never pass a technical test, want to cry. Is this normal or am I really a failure at what I am doing?**"

They changed the terms again. It started off as $60,000 and full time, which was my expectation. Then after I passed the interview, they changed it to $17-$20 ($~35k and 3-months trial period). Now it's $18/hr and a contract-to-hire for 6 months.

On the bright side, I have a technical interview with a company that pays 2x that for their interns. I don't know how much for a junior software engineer, but come on... 2x intern rate  and you can see how much of a joke the $18/hr pay rate is. The area for both companies is the same, so CoL is not a factor."

4mtur7,0,2016-06-06,Politics and Internships,Battlefront228,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4mtur7/politics_and_internships/,"Edit: Hey all thanks for the advice so far. I just wanted to mention that I don't need help adjusting to a liberal workplace (I know when to shut my mouth). I'm only looking for advice on potential bias from coorporate hiring and ways to shield my politics from an employer for as long as possible. I also didn't want to bog down a career subreddit with controversial poltical opinions, so while I'll happily discuss any of the examples I write here or below, they were intended as examples and nothing more.

Hey, I'm a sophomore in Computer Science with an emphasis on Computational Astrophysics. This Fall I will be taking the main CS class in my program (Data Structures) and am ready to start looking for internships.

However, something has been weighing heavily on my mind in the current political climate, and that’s my political views and how they will affect my internship chances.

I am a conservative individual. My last political compass score was (5,0), which is fiscally conservative and socially neutral. I strongly believe in free speech, small government, personal liberty, and the second amendment. I actively participate in campus politics, and for the most part remain anonymous. However, I am worried about my Facebook and Twitter.

My Twitter is easy. I have only a few tweets on there that call out certain left-leaning politicians and publications on their bs. If need be I could easily delete it and not have a second thought. So I guess I should start with asking what I should do about that. 

My Facebook is a bit stickier. I list my party affiliation as Republican and have frequent debates with my Facebook friends. It’s a private Facebook page that requires you to be my friend to see it. My concern is my public comments on media outlets such as ABC, Yahoo, Fox and occasionally others that pop up (Huff Po occasionally, WSJ, etc.)

I subscribe to many various media outlets, both liberal and conservative. If I see an issue I feel I need to weigh in on, or I see blatant media bias I can’t ignore (i.e. Katie Couric and her “unbiased” documentary). Sometimes it turns into a debate, other times it devolves into a mess of people calling me stupid (and me calling them stupid back).

I’ve considered my options. I am unwilling to delete my Facebook as it 5 years of my life recorded on it. I’ve considered my name, but I don’t want to if I don’t have to. 

TLDR: Basically I am worried that in progressive America (and especially the progressive technology industry) my worldview will hamper my career chances. I want to know how to best conceal my social media activity from employers.

Related Topic: On LinkedIn, do I list “Political Organizations” under student activities, or should I omit it all together. I feel that putting it would demonstrate leadership/responsibility but that the ambiguousness of it would draw suspicions.

First Server (Mail): hosts Exchange 2003 and is AD. Second Server (Application): Runs SQL 2000 and has primary software (ERP software from Everest?) that ""runs best with XP clients"". They want to update Server 1 (hardware is like 18 y.o) and migrate to WS2008/r2 or WS2012/r2 as well as update Exchange to 2010. They have Hyper-V but want to update that as well. 

Problem/Question: 

1) Can you run AD with this mix of servers? I've read you can but need to switch the roles

2) Can the domain have this mix? I've read you can add a DC that runs WS2012 to an existing domain that has a 2003 domain function level; you just cant create a new domain at that level. 

3) By updating Exch Server from '03 to '10, how will this affect XP clients?

4) Should I suggest switching to AWS instead for the mail server?

5) They say they do not have the best back up plan, which you know.. terrifies the hell out of me. Suggestions on how to implement this new hardware/software into the network in the safest way possible?

6) I have seen lists of steps to take that relate to my problem in other threads, but recommendations/pointing me in the right direction would be a much appreciated as I am a new learner! 

Please help! I am trying to do my best in being an asset to their company and learn all I can (and not be such an entitled &amp; arrogant millennial)

I am just a college MIS/CS intern with minimal knowledge of any of this stuff. I am working for a small company and my boss seems to be one of the only IT Prof they have on-site. Little background: The company is a contract manufacturer. We host shopping cart websites for businesses and then manufacture what they buy. (Ex: Company employees can buy company apparel on the hosted website and we manufacture and send). The main software works best with XP clients which is my main concern for switching the Exchange Server/ WinServer OS.  I am realizing how detrimental this project could be to the company if I mess anything up, so I have been researching plenty of hours on how and what to do through articles and threads such as these. 

Thank you ahead of time :)"

I go through training today, I get delivered to the Devops team and shown my desk.

I got up to speed, and asked a co-worker what the job entails. He explained that we use Jira/Maven/other tools to support the development teams.

I've gotten my bachelors in computer science, and was hired as a software developer as well as told I would be working with Java.

I thought I got a job as a programmer, but apparently I'm in devops. I had a summer internship where I worked with Devops and QA automation and I hated every minute of it. I'm guessing they stuck me in with devops because I had that experience as an internship.

I'm just frustrated atm, but does anyone have any advice about what to do next? Should I ask to transfer on day 2? Stick with it and possibly dread going into work? Quit and find a new job??

Edit. I've been frantically googling devops definitions and apparently there's a chance that it's just a shitty development position and less of a Systems/QA position.... Still looking for any advice or similar stories.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
UPDATE: My manager said he'd pass any projects that involve dev work my way, but that I should apply to other roles internally if I don't feel the position is a good fit. Not the worst situation to be in, but not the best. Thanks to everyone who replied, definitely helped with perspective."

So I'm an EE student in my third year, hoping to work in embedded systems/where there are software, programming type of projects. For this summer, I've only received one offer at a power plant, where I'll be working on basic designs and other related projects.

Thing is, I've gotten rejected from every software and embedded company I've applied for. I've totally brought this on myself due to applying for internships so late in the year (started around March), and plain not having enough experience (I've taken through programming with data structures and algorithms, and have one small, personal project emulating the Enigma cipher). I haven't taken a class involving microcontrollers yet, but have messed around with them in school clubs.

I really want to clean up my act and get a relevant position either as a full time job after I graduate, an internship next summer, or a co-op during the school term.

Please give me your opinions: how do I become a programming and embedded systems stud over the summer, that companies would love to hire? I am working 40 hours a week, and will have pretty free weekends. Also, when are the ideal times to apply for full time jobs after graduation, summer internships, as well as during the term positions?

I'm looking for an online training course for c# (and maybe java) that is very well structured, requires time commitment but could potentially train me to be job ready for an entry level Unity or any programming job within six months if I really put an effort into it. (At the very least equipped me with enough knowledge to get a paid internship).  

Before I took a break from Uni, I subscribed myself to team tree house for a month and got acquainted with Java. I would be very shy to call myself intermediate but I believe I'm not a beginner either at this point.

I'm very determine to commit myself fully to programming for the summer, however, at the end of a certain period, I'd like to be able to do something useful with the programming language. 

Most online courses I've found do have good structure, but are not very focused on employability I feel. Most of the time I do learn something new but being a fresh man in this discipline I often find myself wondering what I can potentially do or how it could train me to be job ready. 

I'm really sorry if my expectations are being unreasonable and I wouldn't be offended if someone comes in and straight up says its impossible. I'm posting this with a little bit of hope that someone experienced could at least point me in the right direction. 

Teamtree house for example has a TechDegree program where they promises that you'll be job ready in six months and udacity has something similar but being a student, I really can't afford to sign up for those programs.

I would be very grateful for any pointer. 

Thank you

Edit: I'm very willing to pay a reasonable amount for a good course, maybe up to $100. "

If this happens to be the actual hourly pay, should I try to negotiate to at least $15-$20 an hour? While I certainly value the experience that I'll gain, I think it will be very difficult to live on $10 an hour.

4mwnk6,14,2016-06-06,Deep Sounds and Higher Dimensions - An Intro to the Horror of the Other Plane,DemiseofReality,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4mwnk6/deep_sounds_and_higher_dimensions_an_intro_to_the/,"Hey all, I found my way here from /r/all and read some of your accounts of...otherworldly fare...I was in a fairly upbeat mood, but as I delved deeper...well...some *memories* began to claw at a door in my brain which I thought was long since locked. 

Apparently not. 

To avoid a mental relapse, I will share a small portion of my experience from several years back. I might share more if my mind permits... 

It's a tale of youthful naivety, jaded apathy, and the brink of worldly destruction as we know it. I will only share a small portion as a means of catharsis, as I don't want to release anything more than I must...

Let us back up awhile, probably close to 7 or 8 years now. I was barely 20 at this point, not really accomplished in the real world but making my way. So I finally got a job... at least one that caters more towards my abilities: getting paid to help program, maintain and troubleshoot 3d printers! Life had been somewhat cruel to me as of that point in life. Not cruel in an absolute sense, rather, cruel in in the White-Anglo-Saxon-Pseudo-Bourgeoisie sense. We didn’t have quite as much money as every other family in the neighborhood. Dad was gone 75 percent of the time, trying to maintain a standard of living that wasn’t sustainable for a provider in his position; mom even gave the occasional piano or tennis lesson to augment the family budget. That being said, the family structure afforded copious amounts of unstructured time and unbridled freedom as a teenager. I had a tough time making friends, due to the combination of family situation and lack of interest in upper middle class social activities. 

My lack of social engagement naturally encouraged a mostly solitary existence. From a young age, dad always had computers around for his technology consulting company. Like a burgeoning surgeon, I would dissect the computers and analyze their parts, mesmerized at the concept of such an unfathomable amount of information able to pass through computer chips the size of my palm. As I got older, new toys like tablets and smartphones found a place in my technological menagerie. 

At the same time, the mecca of my childhood manifested itself in the form of three dimensional printing. I was completely fascinated at the concept of transforming data into a framework for use in a 3d printer. Little did I know, my dad was hard at work trying to capitalize on the technology. His biggest pursuit at the time was Medtronic, a large medical device manufacturer. If he could just convince the giant corporation to partner with him to integrate 3d printing into their diagnostics services division, we would be set for life. 

One thing lead to another, and soon I found myself with the opportunity to work as a lab tech for my dad. Medtronic wanted to pilot a program in which doctors could order high resolutions prints of matter within the body in a physical, three dimensional forms. My dad had noticed my attraction to the technology early on and my affinity for troubleshooting, which went a long way to convincing him to hire me.

He didn’t offer to pay me much, but essentially let me be a cowboy in the test lab. There were a number of full time scientists and technicians on the project, but by and large they only cared about QA/QC and I was pretty much free to experiment with the machines. The only catch was, I had to wait until after hours to have unbridled access and patient requests always took precedence.

The first day of work arrived and I was teeming with excitement. I was given an orientation by the lab manager, a mild mannered scientist from Germany. He was in charge of ensuring the smooth creating of usable data for the printers from standard diagnostics tools like X-ray and MRI. We were pleasant with each other, but didn’t really commiserate past standard pleasantries, and he was the only other person in the lab on a full time basis. 

My curiosity drew me to the printer queue, to see which departments had the most demand for the 3d printing services. Interestingly enough, the maternity ward had a significant number of projects queued, with neurology and oncology at the top of the list. That seemed somewhat odd to me. What would an expecting mother want with the plastic embodiment of her unborn child? Oh well, I’m not a woman, so I didn’t dwell on it too long. 

The next project in queue was a brain scan that had been done on a level 4 metastasis brain cancer patient. He was terminal with just weeks to live, and the project notes said that the man was interested in meeting his maker, so to speak. Now this was just a small job, printed at a 1:10 scale, and was on the fastest printer available. I sat there and watched in awe as the printer made a perfect, color scaled printout of this man’s brain. It almost looked like one of those incubation chambers found in a sci-fi film, as I observed the printer’s pin darting back and forth behind the enclosure’s glass. After a short 10 minutes had passed, the rendering was complete. I asked the technician on hand if I could hold it and he happily obliged. Sure enough, smack in the middle of the frontal lobe, was a pea sized protrusion, appearing almost as if the man was in the process of sprouting a horn. The figurine sized model had stunning detail, capturing his brain matter down to the smallest capillary. It was haunting, yet pulled at every string of curiosity of my being. I realized then that my understanding of the world was tiny, as the list of ‘what-ifs’ began to scrawl itself into my head. 

As great as this all sounds, my father delivered me a very stern and ominous warning when he offered me the job: “you must remember that this is bleeding edge technology. We don’t have the slightest understanding of the implications of our actions in the long term; the printers are somewhat autonomous and must be monitored closely.” Cryptic as it was, I mostly brushed it off as age and stress getting in to my dad’s head. 

What a horrible miscalculation. In hindsight, I should have paid closer attention to the signs. The technology wasn’t ready for that quick of a rollout, but retrospective insight is about as useful as the efforts we made to perform damage control after shit hit the fan. 

Now don’t get me wrong. This was not a 180 degree turn of events. The malevolent force at hand was calm and calculated in its intentions. Even to this day I wonder if I simply imagined all of it, and would probably believe it if the scars of the past weren’t permanent. 

For a good portion of the first month I was there, nothing seemed out of the ordinary at all. Some of the printing requests were getting odd, but what value is put on the opinion of a lanky, geeky teenager? All that mattered was the bills were getting paid and the new printing service was given rave review across all departments at the hospital. 

There was one particularly hot and still afternoon in late June that I can confidently call the event horizon. One of our best customers so far was a level 1 trauma center just a few miles away that made extensive use of the 3d printing for their maternity ward. Their gift shop offered new printing packages for $100 for new mothers and it quickly became their hottest selling item. This particular day, though, we received an expedited request for an emergency ultrasound printing for a mother who was experiencing intense pain and the traditional ultrasound was ineffective in determining the issue. The request noted that within the mother’s uterus, an extremely low frequency sound could be heard, with amplification, with one nurse’s comments likening it to a growl. When the doctors tried to bring the ultrasound up on the computer, the analysis software kept crashing. 

By this point, I had learned the interface pretty well for the printing software and put the data file at the front of the queue. I sent the request to the highest quality, full color printer to ensure the best rendering. Upon clicking the submit button, the regular prompt to finish the request popped up, except it had one peculiarity. At the bottom of the box, there are usually two options: Okay and Cancel, but this time, in the far right hand area, there was a box that simply said “Play?” I didn’t really think much of it at all at the time, mostly because the software engineers regularly made interface changes without notifying me anyways. My mouse passed over it in curiosity, but I hit the Okay button and the job was on its way. Since a high quality rendering like this takes up to several hours, I decided to go have myself a lunch break.

During lunch, I decided to mess around on my phone and found myself reading a news article about a nutcase, fundamentalist, doomsday preacher who was back in town, here to convince people that modern technology had sutured the connection between hell and the mortal world. His dire warning was that for thousands of years, the Lord’s self-sacrifice was enough to keep hell’s demons at bay, but the recent culmination of sin and heretical behavior had led to a weakness in the gate between the underworld and our plane of existence. Of course, among his self-accolades of sainthood, supposed communicator of the dead, and numerous doomsday predictions failing to materialize, this was just more fuel for the tabloid’s fire. Upon completion of the article, I noticed a quote that I had previously remised: “They will attack without remorse, pity; your soul will be consumed down to its last sinew. An eternity in the Daemon’s abattoir would be a desirable sentence compared to the agony awaiting the heretics of this realm… ” 

Being a Friday, most of the office staff were taking extended lunches or were out for the weekend. I returned to an oddly quiet lab. The lights were slightly dimmed, and it was clear that there had been a power flash in the time I was gone, but that wasn’t too uncommon in the summer, due to the large amount of power needed to keep the printers and the building cool. But, upon closing the interior door to the lab, I could hear the main printer moving at an unreasonable rate of speed. I quickly jogged over there, afraid that the half million dollar machine had somehow destroyed itself. I was shocked to find the front pane of glass left completely opaque by a thick layer of condensation. This was particularly odd because there wasn’t supposed to be any sort of moisture within the printing chamber during operation. I couldn’t see the printer’s pins, but I could hear it laboring immensely; as if fighting the hardware coercing it. I quickly slammed on the emergency stop button and the printer whirred to a stop. I clicked the latch on the printer door, to no avail. It had somehow jammed and I began to panic slightly; my dad was going to kill me if I destroyed his best printer. I darted around the office, looking for some sort of pin to unjam the lock and just as I found a tool in the maintenance kit, I heard a faint ‘click’ and the door popped open. I sprinted over there and was bewildered to see what seemed to be smoke (but didn’t have the smell and wasn’t steam) pouring from the opening. But air flow from inside was frigid; not lukewarm like you would expect it to be. I carefully grabbed the handle and pulled it open, to peek inside. 

What I saw shocked me; my stomach rose straight into my throat. Starting with its feet, nothing looked completely out of place; the toes were a bit long and pointed, but that didn’t draw my attention for long. Its legs, though, were bent inversely at the knees, with the tibia poking through what should have been the small of the knee. To my horror, the torso of the child had been abruptly cut off just below the nipple. The printer pin appeared to have stuttered there, almost as if unsure what to create. I put on a pair of gloves that were sitting nearby and lifted the creature slowly out of the chamber to examine it. Where the torso had cut off, I was utterly confused at what I saw. Where one would expect a spine with distinguishable vertebrae, there was a nub of fleshy material that had formed. I turned the body over and saw the outline of what appeared to be the supporting skeletal structure for a set of wings. After seeing that, I quickly threw it in the trash can and covered it up with some loose paper sitting nearby.

Following that strange incident, the printer fortunately started back up as normal, as if nothing had happened. The supporting technicians, doctors, the programmers, and even my father couldn’t explain what had happened. The mysterious condensation on the printer window disappeared before I could figure out what it was, and there was no error log from the printer. The technicians still in the lab spent the afternoon trying to figure out what went wrong, but to no avail. While it was usually my responsibility to empty the trash in the lab, I left straight away at closing that day. I didn’t want anything to do with whatever came out of that printer.

The thick afternoon air had given away to dark, foreboding skies as I made my way home. The lab wasn’t far from the apartment I had rented downtown in anticipation of the internship. My bike was in the shop, so I had to walk. Usually the 6 block walk wasn’t that bad, but luck would have it that the skies opened and drenched me to the bone. While running down the street, I inadvertently tripped over a short, portly man, whom I immediately recognized upon righting myself and helping the man to his feet, profusely apologizing. It was the crazed preacher from the news! I couldn’t believe I saw him in person. After the cobwebs had cleared, the expression on the preacher’s face went from gratefulness to deep fear. 

“You…You’ve been tainted. Look what you’ve done, the portal is open now. I thought we had at least 2 full astral cycles before the connection would be made!”

“Wait, what the fuck are you talking about?” I asked him, bewildered, still holding onto his arm. He backed up, but realized that he was being restrained. He ripped my fingers from his arms, never taking his beady eyes off of me. After backtracking several steps, I heard him mutter something to the effect of “no, no…nothing can be done now…it’s too late…” He turned away and sprinted faster than any man of his stature I’ve ever seen.

I tried to find my words, but just stared with my mouth half open, frozen in mid-sentence. My eyes followed him as he rounded the corner and what seemed like just a few seconds later, an extremely loud *POP* emanated from the alleyway. I immediately snapped out of my trance and ran to the entrance of the alleyway.

Lying there, with a gaping hole in the back of his head, was the preacher; he had executed himself, the apparent culmination of a desperate, yet failed attempt to reconcile humanity’s transgressions.

I sat there in stunned disbelief, the tormented sky illuminating the grisly scene and continuing to deluge my rigid frame. I looked down, expressionless, and finally realized what had happened. I faced away from the alley and ran...just ran...

That's all I can share for now, but I can guarantee you the evil forces at play have barely shown themselves yet..."

 I will do some light video/photo editing, and light gaming, but nothing too intense. It's going to be more of a general purpose machine.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 I would like a backlit keyboard, and good build quality. I prefer good ergonomics, but it's not a deal breaker if it's a good machine.

 I'm a huge multitasker, running multiple programs at times and using many web browser tabs, streaming video, audio, or both. So something that can handle a  lot of stuff at once would rock!"

This summer I want to focus on projects and a portfolio website along with learning more technologies (.Net, Ruby, etc). My father thinks finding an internship that is ""tech related"" (my assumption is excel spreadsheets) will be much more beneficial. Others have told me to get a summer job at a local grocery store to show I have experience working with people.

I did pretty well, got some great experience. 

I did an internship that developed into a software engineering job in Visual Basic 6 (that pissed me off, I was told I would be doing .net).

I since moved over to working at a hosting provider/data center. I'm doing basic system administration, basic networking, webhosting, basic virtualisation with ESXi, Hyper-V, KVM, Xen. So far this have been my favorite out of all 3. I'm studying the RHCSA material and hope to take it the beginning of July.

However, my main problem is I really don't see that many jobs out there for these things. Certainly not things I can jump up to from what is basically an entry level help desk position that I've had for a year and a half. I see a lot more jobs for softare development (C#, so damn hot right now), lots of vague sounding ""systems engineering"" stuff, lots of QA, lots of stuff that I went to school for but honestly don't like as much as the IT stuff I am doing now.

For example, when I went to a career fair this last semester, out of maybe 30 or so people I talked to, only 1 had a realistic devops (that was the only even remotely IT related thing there, everything else was analysis or programming) internship open. I applied, and of course never heard back (as an aside, I just find that terribly rude).

Am I just not looking in the right places? I'm primarily looking on craigslist, Dice, and LinkedIn. I'm kind of freaking out because I feel like I've trained in almost 3 separate disciplines (system analysis/design, software dev, IT), and the one I really like seems to be going nowhere.

Can someone correct how I'm seeing things if I'm wrong somewhere along the line?"

4myho6,14,2016-06-07,The Disappearance Of Mr. Mathews,StrangeAccounts,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4myho6/the_disappearance_of_mr_mathews/,"Mr. Mathews; British World Literature, class of 2015.


I wish there was more to remember him by.  


I used to intern as a teacher’s assistant in a small high school near where I went to college. The school I apprenticed at had a bad habit of bouncing me back and forth from class to class under the guise that I needed to obtain a wide range of experiences; the truth was they were poorly staffed and needed a spare body. As annoying as all the extra work was it did help me out in the long run, I learned what types of teaching was receptive to students and what wasn’t. 


I learned the most from Mr. Mathews though.


Now it’s hard saying a teacher is matter-of-factly perfect, I mean every student likes to be taught differently, but Mr. Mathews sure came close. I was only with him for a few weeks and in that short amount of time he inspired me to be an unconventional teacher just like himself. Every step I took was in an attempt to replicate him.


So what made him different? I guess it was his demeanor. He commanded the attention of everyone in the classroom, not by authority or force, but by a sense of endurance and endearment. He treated his students like colleagues, like individuals, and they respected him for it.


To say Mr. Mathews’ style of teaching was unique is an understatement. For example every once and a while he’d purposely forget a word in a sentence and have someone in the class fill in the blank. Once someone would answer with the ‘correct’ word, he’d flash them a smile and say that they inferred an answer using the other words as a reference point. He’d then make the challenge to the class to come up with an answer to the missing word without any references in mind, this led to random words being spit out at him. In the end he’d tell them that they were all still using a reference point, sadly he’d never expand on that, rather he’d tell the students to think about it for themselves.


 I’ll admit he definitely thought differently than most people. In his mind critical thinking was more than just a series of words, it was the access point to everything imaginable and things beyond. If there was one thing he wanted to instill in his students it was the ability to think deeply about things.


If a student could use their critical thinking skills in the classroom they would be rewarded by the room itself. If something involved a date or time on a test, something Mr. Mathews detested, he would tell the students to find his name and ask for help. That meant the answer would be hidden inside his name on the whiteboard. For an example a question could be “what year did Shakespeare die?” and on the whiteboard you’d see his name spelt like [this](http://imgur.com/KhF13hb). He wouldn’t explain to the class exactly what it meant, as according to him that’d be cheating, but with some critical thinking you might be able to see a 1 and 6 repeating in relation to the amount of letters and the lines used, 1616. He always said if you looked in between the lines there was always something to find.


I was lucky enough to see this in person and I was also unfortunate enough to see his last class be taught.


My time with Mr. Mathews began partway into the spring semester of 2015. I remember him welcoming me into his class with open arms and how he told me not to worry about doing anything work related besides just listening. He explained he wanted me to learn from him, not for him. He was by far the nicest teacher I ever met in that school.


For the rest of spring he showed me the ropes on the importance of student comprehension and how there’s more to it than just passing grades or tests. Once summer hit it was almost a letdown, I’d have to leave the school until fall classes started back up and that meant there was a possibility I wouldn’t be in Mr. Mathews class during the fall semester. I fought back my disappointment and tried to enjoy my summer. As classes started to appear at the dusk of summer I got some mail with a teacher’s assistant itinerary and it said for the rest of fall classes I’d be back in Mr. Mathews’ class. I was ecstatic. I accepted the apprenticeship program again and once the first day of classes hit, I was in my chair eagerly awaiting Mr. Mathews return.


To be honest the first day back I should have known something was wrong. Usually he was the first one in the classroom, greeting the students who walked in with his own sense of bravado. This year he seemed absent. The only sign of his existence before the classes started was his notebook lying on his desk. I could see several yellow sticky notes jutting out of it. It wasn’t until the bell ring and everyone was in their seats that he stepped in. He looked disheveled, as if he had a busy morning, and as he passed me he apologized. I thought I heard him murmur something about being held up by something. As he walked behind his desk I noticed him open up his notebook and push some notecards into it from his pocket. The rest of the day went by normally, whatever upset him in the morning seemed out of his mind by the end of the day. 


Things continued like this for the rest of September; the mornings seemed sluggish, arrival time was sporadic and by the end of the day he’d be back to his normal self. It wasn’t until October that I started to worry about him. To be honest I happen to love the mood in October, especially closer to Halloween, and from the talks I had around school so did Mr. Mathews, or at least he used to. Leading up to the Holiday was a little underwhelming in his classroom. Around the rest of the school during the weeks moving up to Halloween you saw paper bats pop up in corridors, teachers filling up jars of candy and ghosts and ghouls cut out into signs, yet in Mr. Mathews classroom I saw nothing. The atmosphere inside the classroom could almost be classified as clinical.


 Now color me surprised when I walked into his classroom the day before Halloween and saw pumpkins sitting on windowsills, rubber bats hanging from the ceilings and ghostly images plastered to the windows and walls. I couldn’t help but break into a smile. I could even hear a faint hum of Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor emanating from a radio hidden under Mr. Mathews desk. As I looked over at all the cheesy Halloween decorations I noticed he was nowhere to be found. The overcast skies coated a grey coloring over the room creating a very eerie appeal to it. The only signs of color were coming from some battery operated candles spread across the room, most laying on the floor. They seemed to make some sort of spiral on the ground, even going under student’s desks to complete the image.


I remember that day, I took my seat in the corner of the room while students began slowly coming in from their passing period. I could hear the muttering of excitement coming from each of them. They all had sense of wonder as they avoided the candles on the ground. Some laughed with childish excitement while others commented on how lame the whole set up was. Typical responses from typical students. 


I thought to myself how rare it is now-a-days to have teachers decorate their classes like this. The fall of Halloween hit mid 2000’s hard and fast. You’d be lucky to find a good horror movie on cable TV these days even during Halloween. In this moment however, it seemed like you were connected to the old days during the prime years of the Holiday. You could sense the magic in the air and it felt refreshing. 


Once the students took their seats the bell for classes began to ring. For a few moments it was quiet in the room except for the radio that continued with its symphony. You could see the students looking at each other expecting something to happen. Some even looked over at me and I shrugged, I had no idea what was going on. Then, from the back of the room, the door slowly and dramatically opened. Stepping inside was Frederik Nietzsche, or rather Mr. Mathews dressed as him. His whole outfit and demeanor shifted to that of the man he was representing; he stood tall and proud with his hands grabbing his black and grey overcoat, his mustache was exaggeratedly plastered above his upper lip and his nose held up some small wired glasses going over his eyes. He seamlessly strode down the alley of desks and chairs towards his desk while his students snickered or rolled their eyes in his direction, though he seemed to pay them no mind. Once he reached his desk he looked over each student before glancing over his shoulder at me, I could see under that big fake mustache of his he was hiding a grin.


“Velcome class. My name today ist Frederik Nietzsche, zee great philosopher of Germany. Today I will be teaching you the truth of existence, and that is “there are no facts, only interpretations”. Now who can tell me vhat that means?” His cheesy accent made the room giggle with laughter before a hand went up. “Ah, yes, Jacobi, please explain to zee class.” Mr. Mathews exaggerated a turn of his hands to the classroom while looking at Jacob. Jacob smiled nervously before he began to speak.


“Well, it’s like, we can’t fully understand what’s out there so how do we know anything is right?” Mr. Mathews gave a smile under his mustache making it bounce slightly off his lip. 


“Absolutely! You vill do good in this life if you live by that thought. Mathematicians might try to put you down, but their math is incorrect.” Everyone looked at each other with strange glances. Mr. Mathews put his hand up to dismiss their criticism. 


“Now, now, now, In order to understand this universe and all others, you have to understand the limits of human understanding.” His accent dissipated along with his smile. “Pardon me for this, but humanity is limited to its own pride. We look through lenses of what we can perceive instead of trying to discover what really is reality. Our truth is just a distraction, a hindrance.” He began to pace alongside the classroom, circling the students like a predatory shadow. 


“We’re pests in this universe, parasites that devour without knowledge or understanding. We have infinite potential if we’d only go beyond what we’ve already learned.” He stopped in his tracks after making a perfectly circular lap around the class. I could see him take in a deep breath while he closed his eyes. For a moment everything was quiet, no one else in the room spoke. Then he cut through the silence like a light through fog.


 “Our society is based on the here and now, but what is here? Better than that, what’s out there?” He points up at the ceiling signaling to the sky or the worlds beyond. “Or even better,” he took a pause and opened his eyes, “what’s right there?” He points to an empty spot in the center of the classroom before walking up to It.


“This spot is empty right?” The class mumbled in agreement while they watched him move around to the center of the room. “I can tell you that’s not right, but that’s what’s taught.” I caught a glimpse of his eyes at this point, they seemed wrong, different than before. They were colder and darker than normal but shined with such intelligence it took me back. “Infinity is in this one spot here, but this infinity isn’t everything.” Mr. Mathews slowly arched down to the students, maintaining eye level contact with them and looking as if he had a hunched back. Once more I saw the coldness of his eyes pierce through the room. “If somethings possible, then it is, has been and will always be. So let me ask you this, is it possible were not alone in this room right now?” 


Slowly I felt an oppressive force start creeping its way into the room with us. It felt suffocating, like a parent angry at their child. I questioned whether it had always been there, it felt too seamless of an atmospheric transition yet carried an abruptness with it. I felt as if something, or many somethings, began to notice us as we began to notice them. As I glanced around the room I could see other students feel it as well, their heads were glancing around the room while others focused their gazes on the desks in front of them as if to hide. Had this just been a Halloween prank, it would have made a good one.


Then Mr. Mathews continued, “Is it possible somethings watching us right now? I’m sure you can feel it, does that make it real? What if that something decided to lose the binds of humanity a long time ago? Something or someone who has transcended the human version of natural law?” He stands up and sighs before walking back to his desk knocking over a candle with his foot. With each step towards his desk the feeling of oppression slowly leaves. “That’s just something for everyone to think about. Maybe there’s more of everything then we think.” Hearing the conclusion of his speech made me shudder. This speech wasn’t abnormal for him to make, but it was how he asked the questions that startled me. He seemed as if he knew the answers to them. Besides that, his cold enlightened eyes led me to believe there was more to this story than just a thought game. 


The rest of the class proceeded pretty much as normal, granted things tended to be a little more festive, which to be honest, was much needed after the uneasy atmosphere the class started with. Afterwards he had the students read up on Poe’s work for the Holiday and encouraged people to find something out of nothing in their lives. After the class finished up he sat down at his desk and opened up his notebook, this time he didn’t grab his pen to write in it he just stared and read. I made the decision to myself to ask him more about the speech he gave. I stood up and walked over to his desk.


Once I approached him he looked up at me with his newly calculating eyes. “Yes?” he asked, it wasn’t rude, just distant, as if he wasn’t really here in the moment. 


“I was just curious about that story you told at the beginning of class…” My voice pattered off as he stared into my eyes. Mr. Mathews’ iris made me feel as if I was staring into a mirror in the vastness of an empty space, my image being the only thing reflected off of them.


“I’ve been convinced the average person is incapable of understanding anything, that everything we’ve learned up to this point is regressive to the betterment of humanity. We’ve trapped ourselves.” His voice got softer as his eyes drifted down to his paper. “There are things out there, like us, that didn’t go the same way we did. That’s all I want to say about it. You’re a good kid,” His voice broke slightly before he whispered “I’m sorry.” I couldn’t tell if that was meant for me or himself. I did happen to glance down at the pages in his book and they were a scrambling of words and formulas I couldn’t understand. It made me worried about Mr. Mathews. He was such a kind hearted man, at that moment I didn’t think anyone ever look after him when he needed it, he always looked after others. I remember turning my back on him as I walked towards the classroom door. I had decided I wouldn’t push my luck.


The next day he never showed up for work. The day after that he was reported missing.


It didn’t take long for the Authorities to find his car, it was parked some distance away from Dudleytown, Connecticut on the edge of a forest. This was several hours away from our town. The Police reported nothing of interest inside his vehicle apart from his car keys on the passenger side seat. 


Whatever Mr. Mathews did, whatever happened to him, he didn’t leave us any answers. 


The faculty was questioned about him and so was a few of his students from his classes. No one knew what happened to him or had any clues about his disappearance. From what I heard everyone pretty much had the same experience I did with him, we all agreed he was a great guy who adored teaching. There was rumors going around that when the cops entered his home it was completely empty on the inside, though there were signs that he had still been living in it during that time. Eventually the Authorities collaborated with the rumor.


 As far as the Police could tell he ran away with all his valuables and dumped his car to avoid being followed. They let us know that they would keep the investigation going on a day to day operation. They never found his body in the woods nor any camping gear left behind. This story just didn’t sit right with me, it wasn’t like him.


For a while after his disappearance I was devastated. It was only about a week after Mr. Mathews disappeared that the school gave me the keys to his office and asked if I could clean it out for a new teacher to substitute in. I did what they wanted but I won’t lie, I had others goals. I spent more time in that office than I should have, I just needed answers. The only things I managed to find was a piece of paper and a few sticky notes that have his strange scribblings on them. I think they’re the same that were in his notebook except these seem more like rough drafts of whatever was in his journal.


I know they seem insane but I think there’s some sort of answer in these notes. He didn’t think like we do, he could connect things in his mind that normal people couldn’t see but they’d always work out in the end. I feel like posting these notes here might find someone else who thinks like he did. Also, to be honest, his last speech still scares me. I still haven’t fully shaken the feeling of being watched, it creeps in and out sometimes.  I just want to know if there’s anything useful in his notes that might help out with his disappearance or what he was trying to discover. He was a good man and deserves more than to be forgotten. If anyone can help me, please do. Thank you.

I am currently studying for my bachelor's in Computer Science and will graduate by the end of April 2017.

I have had 4 internships during this time (one in progress) at 2 different companies.


My first 2 internships were at a large bank (company1) in the BI sector. I found the work rather boring, as in being very repetitive and not challenging, just frustrating. But, the salary and conditions were exceptional for my area.


My last 2 internships were at a smaller company (company2) which provides many different IT services and solutions (corporate desktops, servers, mainframes, BCDR, and more). I really prefer the work I am doing there and there is a greater diversity of tasks to do.



I have had the opportunity to talk with my boss at company2 and he (seemingly) was very upfront about things. He said that he thinks working there would be much better for me in the long term because of diversity of work BUT, he was very explicit that the salary was going to be well under the norm. I have seen how they run things, and although this might be a negotiation tactic, I think it is true because this company thrives by cutting costs, even if it means doing somewhat shady stuff (ie. sharing licenses for software).


I was very excited at the prospect of working there, but seeing as there is somewhat of a guarantee of lower pay I've been considering other options. Should I be taking interviews at different places just to test the waters and have ground for comparison?


What are you're best tools as a recent graduate to negotiate a salary?


TLDR: Considering working at current internship after studies, but not sure how I can negotiate a decent salary."

I've failed a lot of classes, taken time off to pursue running a restaurant (that went nowhere), and have changed my major multiple times. I used to think that there were no jobs in IT, but I realized recently that this was a lie, as programming jobs may be outsourced to India nowadays but there are a lot of domestic jobs that aren't. Computers have always been interesting to me, so I've recently decided to major in CIS at Wayne State University in Michigan (I am not good at math so I'm staying away from CS). 

I have about 50 credits under my belt, so I mainly just have a few more pre-requisites and then core classes. My issue is that I just closed on a house, I work full-time to afford my mortgage and other debts (credit cards, etc) making $16.50 in a non-IT field, and I've been told that I'll have to work a flexible schedule to complete school (my job is a 9-5 job and not flexible).

At this juncture, I can't work less because I have to afford my mortgage/bills, I have no certs or IT experience to get my foot in the door in IT making at least what I make now ($16.50), and I can't seem to think of a way that I would be able to do an internship or get that experience needed to get a job once I get my B.A. in CIS. What should I do at this point? Should I just take the classes for my major that are offered at night and get some certs to hopefully get a job making at least what I make now? It seems that I'm very disadvantaged over younger kids that don't have to work full-time and can do internships, part-time jobs, etc.

I did, however, receive the highest performance evaluations from my supervisor at the conclusion of the term. Upon the completion of the internship, I returned to my home state and completed my final semester at the university and decided that I would not work this last semester so that I could focus on applying for jobs. A couple weeks after my graduation, I did receive an offer for a position based in a large city a couple hours away from my hometown. I accepted the offer, despite that the pay was far below what the median salary is for this type of position as I mostly wanted the experience.

That job turned out to be disastrous. Although I enjoyed the work, I had a nightmarish boss. It was a small department and I was one of two people reporting to her. After a month, I was told I was performing very well but after this, things seemed to take a turn for the worst. As a side note, I am an extremely anxious person and my boss made this much worse. She constantly contradicted herself and seemed to be extremely impatient with me. In the process of learning the positions, I made a few mistakes that I don’t believe were large mistakes. I think they were things that anyone new to the field would make because you can’t teach the solutions to every problem in college or in any formal job training. Eventually, she had a talk with me that I needed to decide if I was a fit for the company/job or not. She even told me that I am not mature (no idea where she got this from) and that I need to be more approachable if I want to work in HR. I am a pretty friendly person and I knew that before even taking this position and did my best to appear approachable. Anyway, my anxiety at the time was through the roof and I was extremely depressed because I missed my friends and family. I decided that it was not a fit and that I would move back home (with one of my parents) and start from scratch at home.

Fast forward to now. A month later I took a job at a local grocery store and this is where I am now. I was hired with the expectation that I would be trained to be a shift manager. However, I just feel stuck. My boss is very demanding (although a million times better than my previous one) but I find myself stressing over my job and my current position in life all the time. I don’t enjoy my days off because I’m stressing about my performance at my current job all the time, in addition to what I will be doing with my life. I really do not think I want to be on this managerial track here because I do not feel that I am performing well enough. Again, I’m 30 years old and I don’t have much time to get my life back in order. I’m currently in the process of fixing up my car so that I can drive for Uber as a second job.

I’ve been toying with the idea of returning to my former community college to get a second Associates Degree in Computer Programming/Database Development. This has always been something that I’ve been interested in. In fact, I posted to /r/adviceanimals a couple years ago about a spreadsheet I designed in which I rate my life in various areas and compare certain factors in my life, almost like a journal with numbers. I’m too lazy right now to go find the link, but I am definitely a big number cruncher and Excel geek, so I thought that it may be a good path to take. However, I’m not sure if that would be a wise investment as I would be competing with individuals with Bachelor’s Degrees in similar fields. I’d have to pay for the tuition and all that myself, but also toyed with the idea of doing Uber full time while studying that curriculum. I’ve also simply thought about toughing it out at the grocery store and giving the managerial track a shot but I know that’s not what I want to do with my life. In addition, I’ve been keeping my eye out for entry level HR positions around here, but my experience at my last position almost has me believing that I am not smart enough to take on such a role.

So here I am, posting here to see if anyone else around my age has experienced a long streak of misery and confusion about life. It’s been almost a year since I’ve felt myself and I am so confused and lost about what to do with my life. Again, I’m 30 and I really want to get back to the level of consistency I seemed to be at when I was in my early 20s. All I really want to do is be happy and not wake up every single morning stressed and anxious about my job and the direction of my life. I also don’t want to live at home forever as I already feel like such a loser.

I would love someone to talk to about this or get some good career/education advice as the title suggests. Thank you for reading my long rant.

I was lucky enough to get my manager to give me a custom schedule so for the next 3 months I will be working full time at the internship and part time at my customer service job

How concerned should I be with this?

4n1zf4,3,2016-06-07,internship vs. student teaching (out of an alternative certification program),lolajean88,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/4n1zf4/internship_vs_student_teaching_out_of_an/,"Hi! I have a few questions for y'all!
First a little background on me :
I just recently graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Biology, and am currently enrolled in an alternative certification program through my university. This program is highly respected in the area, and many schools have hired the alternative students from my University. (I hear some alt.cert. programs aren't very good, this isn't one of them.) I have NO teaching experience at all. My past occupations have all been along the lines of zoo keeper or such. My resume is interesting I'll say, but it has zero experience as far as teaching goes. I do have a very high GPA (for my degree as well as current classes) and scored well on my content test.


My certification will be in the life sciences 7-12 and I have already passed my content test. My classes for the program continue throughout the summer and this fall/spring I need to do my student teaching or internship.
I would prefer to secure a full year, paid internship as opposed to a half year student teaching position. I still have to pay tuition at my school during my internship/student teaching, and due to credit hours financial aid may not be possible.
So, for obvious reasons, i've been applying for internships.
I live in a more rural area, so I'm mainly applying to smaller, rural schools (not necessarily low income though). I know my state has a shortage of science teachers, but I'm having trouble getting a call back.

My questions!
- Has anyone out there secured an internship instead of student teaching, how difficult was it? What did you do to look desirable without any prior teaching experience? 

- What are the pros/cons of an internship over student teaching? (minus being paid for the internship) 

- How difficult was it to go straight into teaching with zero prior experience? Did you feel the alternative certification program adequately prepared you or were you often lost and struggling?

- How did the interview go? (in general for any teachers)
I've never interviewed for such a formal position before! I'm nervous about 1) not being able to secure an internship and 2) being totally awkward and unprepared during an interview!

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"
4n218v,9,2016-06-07,[EE] Should I get a PhD or just an MEng?,EccentricWyvern,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/4n218v/ee_should_i_get_a_phd_or_just_an_meng/,"About me:  Currently spending my summer here at MIT in between my Sophomore and Junior years.  I'm a research assistant at a lab, and next year I'll be doing full-year research as part of the SuperUROP program.

My goals:  I want to do cool things in micro/nano silicon-based processing, and that's sort of what my current and next-year research will be on.  Ultimately I wish to work for a big semiconductor business (Intel, TI, etc.) doing R&amp;D or design.

Originally I really wanted to PhD, but after spending a little while in my lab, I'm seeing all these ~~zombies~~ grad students that work 12+ hour shifts in the lab.  I don't want 5-6 years of something like that, to be honest.

Even more pointing towards the MEng, MIT has an accelerated one where I could complete it in just a year and a half.  I can TA during the 3 semesters I'd be doing my Master's so my tuition and health insurance would be paid for, in addition to receiving a $2500/month salary while having the summer and winter off (spend that time in internships maybe?).  In addition, since I've gotten straight-As in all my technical courses, even if I get nothing but Cs for the rest of undergrad, I'm basically guaranteed admission into the MEng program.  This is not the case for the PhD program, however.

For the EE industry, doing R&amp;D or Design, is a PhD THAT much more worth it compared to just a MEng?  Will there be that significant a pay bump between the two to make it worth the extra years out of the workforce?  Should the fact that I'm already doing undergrad research influence that?

Also with the MEng, I'd be getting out of school with my MEng during winter of the 2019-2020 school year.  Does entering the workforce in the winter hurt my chances of getting a nice job?"
4n33rt,2,2016-06-07,Improving my programming skills as a full time graduate student.,epicboar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4n33rt/improving_my_programming_skills_as_a_full_time/,"Ill be joining graduate school ( USC ) soon this August ( International Student ). Graduate school coursework is supposed to be hectic, but I do not mind going through it. What I am concerned is about improving my own skills.

I have been told to concentrate well on Algorithms and Data Structures ( I consider myself decent at that ), and solve 3 - 5 coding problems a day.

I do not hate coding at all, in fact I am enamored by it, but I feel like I have hit a wall somewhere and its difficult to break through it. Some problems at topcoder, hackerrank etc. feel very overwhelming. My seniors tell me that this is common and you look at the problem one step at a time without being discouraged.

My question is, how do i keep myself motivated as a graduate student. where coursework is a bitch ( its a positive thing ) and where people will be miles better than me. I would be applying for internships during November - December.

I am a decent Java programmer and a decent C programmer ( not a pro ), I do not have any internships under my belt ( will try to compensate doing self projects ), but I have done 3 projects for the I.T. department of my college.

I need an honest opinion on this and If i have missed out on anything, please let me know. I believe I just need some guidance. Getting internship during graduate school is critical for me."
4n3hdz,8,2016-06-08,Feeling sort of hopeless; my childhood self is dead,lesbiansymmetra,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4n3hdz/feeling_sort_of_hopeless_my_childhood_self_is_dead/,"To be entirely honest, I don't know that I would ever DO it. I don't even have a method in mind that doesn't scare me to death, and I would never want to SURVIVE an attempt. That sounds like the worst thing that could ever happen to be honest, all the bills and physical damage, and awkward conversations. Possible/probable yelling, also. It just crosses my mind way too often to be normal. I mean, THESE days it's sometimes multiple times a day. My hands start shaking and I start thinking about it. It's like how my intrusive thoughts sometimes are, but without the repulsion that comes with them normally. It's the repulsion that makes me feel better, like its not ACTUALLY my thoughts... But these sound more like the things I truly want to do, like ""Hey, I should get a drink before work so I won't be tired"" or ""Hey maybe I'll visit the bookstore after class"". ""Hey, maybe I'm wasting my time being alive, since it's never going to end up the way I want. I should probably die, before I waste anymore effort.""

To begin with, I pretty much abandoned all the dreams and wishes I had from when I was little. Not because I found something I want more, but because I really just don't see the point. I'm a realist. I don't see the point in wanting to write if I don't have the talent or mental ability to string words together. Even then, I don't have the time or energy to write much, so what ability I had has gotten rusty since I've been in college. That's not a thing I see happening at any point, and it makes me sad, but I can deal with it normally. It's not the sort of thing I think about until I get like this. I will probably never be the sort of life-impacting author that I prayed I'd be when I was small.

I always used to imagine that I'd fall in love. I still think about it, but the chances of that are slim too. I'm gay, and beyond that, I'm neurodivergent and don't approach romantic relationships in the standard way. It makes it hard to connect with NT people, and it seems like when I meet people I can really be myself around, there's a circumstance that keeps any of them from being romantically viable. Between these, I don't really have much in the way of a dating pool. Things never seem to work out. They just aren't interested in me, and that's on ME not them.

Personality-wise I don't know that I'm entirely repulsive. A standard person, I guess. I'm socially acceptable, I don't hold any hateful views or treat others badly. I'd say I'm, like, a solid 7 physically. It's just that I'm pretty much a loser? I don't and can't own my own house or pay my own bills. I only recently got my first job, FULL STOP, at 21. Not first Real Job, first RETAIL job. You know. The things kids can and do get. I wasn't able to drive on my own until last year. I don't do internships, and CAN'T do internships. All of my younger cousins are working, in school, living alone, have had multiple jobs. They seem OLDER than me, always have. Even when we were kids, I was playing with dolls at 13 when they were babysitting at 10. All of my friends are graduating, moving away, getting married, getting Real Jobs, or some combination. I will get left behind. Don't tell me I won't. It's not about them not caring, it's just a thing that happens. If you can't keep up, you get left behind, and it's on you, not the people moving on.

I just feel like there's nothing for me. I feel like I died when I left high school, and that I've been nothing but deadbeat trash since. There's nothing about me to be proud of and there's very little chance of me impacting the world in any way. The only regret I would have if I died is that it would just keep on going the same as if I'd lived. I'm not who I always wanted to be. I'm not who I STILL want to be, and the odds of it ever happening are slim. I don't know what I'd say to my past self, and honestly, I'd be ashamed to meet her. "

I am currently finishing my 5th year and am in a situation where I have to appeal for continued financial aid beyond 15 quarters. I basically switched majors from econ to computer science, knowing that CS would lead to many more opportunities than what I felt with econ. I have an upcoming internship at a big tech company, and I am proud of what I have accomplished both in and out of the classroom. 

However, because I switched my major pretty recently (~1.5 years ago) and I have been dropping some courses (~4-5) with a W, I will definitely need another year to complete all my courses. The school doesn't normally give out financial aid to a 6th year student and hence, the appeal I need to write. 

Part of the appeal process includes writing a one page statement explaining circumstances for Undergraduate attendance beyond 15 quarters. I am looking to write about my major and career shift and the success I am having in my new major, but I was wondering if anybody has any experience with such an appeal letter and/or if anybody knows any other details I should include that would make a convincing letter.

Please feel free to PM me. Thanks in advance!"

So... let me tell you my story before I tell you about my CV. I am a Portuguese guy with a BEng degree in Telecommunications and Informatics Engineer. My BEng covered a lot of topics, regarding programming and networks.

I am gonna finish my degree in July and I want to move to London. Why? I have lived in Portugal for 22 years. Its time for a change.

What do you think about my CV?

What do you think about my chances of landing a job in London, knowing that I have almost no experience (only did a month-long internship in the IT area, for which I have a recommendation letter)?

As you can see, I have an good portfolio of projects, made in team and solo.

I dont know about you guys (or lads, if is suitable) here in the UK, but the MEng/BEng degree in the UK seem very theoretical... I had 6 modules/semestre with projects (about ~2000 lines of code each) in 3 of those 6 modules. A year has 2 semesters.

Another thing... I just notice that a 2.1 degree is equivalent to a really good grade in Portugal (like 16/20). In my university everyone (except like ~2% of my fellow classmates) has like 12/20 or 13/20 as final note of the degree lol. I can't compete in the same way... A lot of people in studentroom says a 2.1 grade is fairly easy to achieve lool... i don't know how really.

Thanks in advance!

I'm a master's student in a public health program that just completed my first year.  I plan on applying to PhD programs in epidemiology and nutrition in the fall and I know the graduate student stipends for these programs is pretty low so I'm trying to save money right now by working a few side jobs on top of my summer internship/practicum.

It's really common in my program at least for students to work several jobs, especially during the summer months but I'm having a little trouble getting in the swing of things.  I'm prone to anxiety and get overwhelmed pretty easily so now that I'm working 60+ hours a week, I'm starting to feel the pressure.  

I'm working one internship that I love which is focused on nutrition &amp; access (32+ hours/wk), one part-time position writing wellness programs for a primary care practice (10 hours/wk), and waiting tables (~18-25 hours/wk).  It's definitely hard to keep my head wrapped around all the moving parts and I feel like I just haven't gotten into the swing of it yet. 


 I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone who's been here and found strategies that help them manage anxiety and keep their head above water!

I am a rising third year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science. This past fall semester I derped and did not realize that most of the big companies (Uber Facebook etc.) finish recruiting for their Summer internship programs by the end of the fall semester, and I only started applying at the beginning of the spring semester. At the very last minute I was able to land a internship for this summer at a smaller company, but I want to make sure that I am prepared for this fall semester. Aside from working on side projects and plowing through interview questions, is there anything else I can do to prepare?

Also as sort of a side, I think companies such as Google have software engineering internships specifically for sophomores, but are there similar programs for juniors?

I am in a situation where I need to buy a car. I travel a lot for my job (to go to clients). I've been borrowing the family car but it is no longer an option since my siblings need it for their co-op placements in between school (also has a lot of traveling). I accumulated up about 60,000km in mileage in the past 2 years traveling for work, and some of the places I go to are remote (up to an hour drive away), just to emphasize that the car is a need and not a want.

My finances are currently as follows:
- Monthly take-home pay: $3,000 per month
- Current Savings: $10K (thinking of putting down at $5K max)
- Expenses: About $500 a month (live at home but pay for bills)
- Debt: None (just paid off $20K in student debt in 16 months back in March)

I'm looking for something reliable and that won't break down and I've been looking at Civic/Corolla used or new. I'm willing to spend $25K max after tax on a new Civic/Corolla, since I can't have a car break down while working and I might not have time to take it into a shop (60-70 hr on some weeks). I'm located in SWO (Southwestern Ontario).

Is there a rule of thumb that I can use to calculate the total car price I can afford? Any ideas or suggestions are also welcome. Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Just to add, the sooner I get the car, the better so I can pass it off to my sibling on internship. I would like to get it within 1-2 week time frame if possible."

My problem is I am not getting many calls or emails back about my resume.  I apply to 5-6 places per day and try to tailor my resume keywords to each one.  My resume has been reviewed by multiple people with hiring experience, including IT hiring experience, and they helped me improve it.  I don't code in my free time or have many side projects, but I did have 2 internships in which I learned a lot (everything from front end to back end).  I am also in a pretty darned good city for IT/software/big data right now, as well.  Overall I feel that I am definitely capable to do the work, although I am not a super talented coding machine, I can code.

How long should it take me to find that first job?  I'm getting scared that I wasted 6 years at university and will have nothing to show for it.  I know it's only been a month since graduating, but I've literally only gotten one phone interview and a handful of emails back at this point, after 50+ applications, running out of places to apply to.  I'm not even being picky in terms of salary or the ""prestige level"" of the company, I'm applying to anywhere and everywhere that is within a few hours of my location (willing to commute 1.5-2 hours), plenty of small and middle sized companies.

I'm starting to think this field and life path wasn't right for me and won't result in a job or a fulfilling lifestyle, but I was too young/naive/uncaring and coerced into it by parents to do otherwise... performing good in school and doing my best there is not actually giving results, while those that misbehaved in school and slacked off but still worked are now already 6+ years into their career and making real money now... a very strange twist of fate.

My BBA program had a business core followed by a CIS core. I did horrible in my business core classes and a lot of it had to do with not being interested at all (under 3.0 gpa). I then did my CIS core and found my courses very fun and was very motivated. The CIS core did have some business related classes (IT project management etc) but I found those to be the least interesting parts. I took courses in database management, SQL, Object oriented programming, web design( HTML, CSS and another in javascript). I actually enjoyed all of those courses and was extremely motivated, and ended with a 3.8/4 major GPA (4/4 if you exclude the 2 project management-related courses)

I have a job and around a year experience with system administration, but I do not enjoy it at all.

My question: How should I proceed?

Is it possible to get into a Masters computer science program with my BBA? - I did some research online and there are some that say no, others that say it depends, what about in my situation?

If not, is it worth getting another bachelors but in computer science? - I also can't find out much on this either, if I was to - would it be 4 years or would credits from similar courses from my BBA shrink this significantly?

Is it better to do one of the 2 above or should I go for a self-teaching approach? My biggest concern with this is the jobs that I stumble upon when doing job-research require a bcs or a bs for the position. I also think a developer internship would be a good way to transition me into a full time development position and most internship positions are limited to enrolled students. (For example: I have done enough self-teaching to the point that I would be comfortable with a java developer internship position, but being a student has been a requirement, and not enough self teaching to be comfortable with a full-pledged job )"

Last year I graduated from UC Berkeley in Political Science with good grades. But this is part of my biggest regret-- majoring in political science. I can't seem to get my foot in the door anywhere and a career in law isn't something that sounds particularly interesting to me.

So why did I do choose this major? I had issues settling on a major and the PS Classes did interest me. Plus, everyone told me it doesn't really matter what you major in, your job will teach you what you need to know. I thought getting good grades from a great University would have people flocking to me; I was dead wrong.

So for the past 4 months, I have been applying to things seemingly in my reach and that interest me: marketing, copywriting, journalism, even law firms (seemingly need to be Law school to get an internship), and other areas of work. I have gotten a couple interviews but nothing has stick; even when I apply to internships.

So now I am looking for advice. I am on the verge of a meltdown since I felt like I wasted 4 years of my life at a top tier school. Does anyone have any suggestions for job titles I should search for? Is portfolio school worth the money? How about a coding boot camp? Is there a master's I could get to make me more valuable?

All this has been doable, but required a lot of discipline to make it work. So I'm upset because I put in all this work, and I see my classmates blatantly cheating during the exams.  They have the high GPAs, the high profile internships, and I'm sure the eventual high profile job. It's so rampant that there's no way I can concretely bust everyone and show my professors. It's reached a boiling point with me internally - so I came here to blow off some steam. I just can't compete, and my modest grades (a 3.1) just aren't up to the benchmark for the top-tier employers looking for entry level engineers. The thing is, how can they tell the difference between the high GPA achievers who actually deserve it and those who have inflated grades because they cheat their way through?

You hope that cheaters eventually get found out or change their ways, but honestly, it just -seems like- sometimes engineering is a fake it till you make it kind of thing.

I want to stick to my guns and keep things honest and put in the work, but it's so freakin frustrating to be surrounded by so many cheaters at a school with such a good reputation for engineering."

I don't want to work in an office all day, i like working with my hands. I've thought of the trades(welding, hvac etc) but they're not as good as they're painted out to be for the first few years. Not saying i'm lazy and wouldnt bust my ass to make it to the point where i earn decent, but im just not set on it.

i really like cars, but i once took an internship at a local mechanic and i was disgusted by how nasty some people's car can be. I really like older classic cars(owned 3, still have 1) and i seriously enjoy Drifting(anything to do with it honestly). 
I honestly would love to do anything that has to do with older cars(like a restoration shop) or motorsports(Not nascar, more like drag racing, drifting, auto x) But i'm not sure what i should do in order to be able to do any of this. I was just thinking about getting into upholstery classes, learn welding for sheet metal, do some mechnical school for certifications(since now a days you're useless without a piece of paper tellin you that you're worth something. I know a lot about cars, had a 69 mustang that i removed the heads on, redid the brakes etc) and then some college for business or economics and open up my own shop where i could do it all, but for that i need to start somewhere. I just don't want to start somewhere ill hate and regret spending the money on(I'm Shit poor as of now).

I'm taking a year break from everything and i'm going overseas to work with my dad for a bit(material moving) to see if i could find myself and come back to the states knowing atleast somewhat as to what i should do.

If you guys have any suggestions as to what to do or if i didn't make myself clear then please ask away

Everybody tells me i'm a smart kid and that i could do much more but i just cant see myself being a lawyer or doctor. I wouldnt want to do some back breaking work for 10 an hour because i know i can do better, but i want to do better and be happy at the same time. I'm not asking for much, just enough money for a nice little humble house, a nice garage and some spare money to fuck with cars. I don't have many needs other than basic human ones, i barely even buy stuff for myself since i see it as un-need

I started an internship in this past spring and am expected to continue until I graduate (Fall). I am interning at a non-technical department in a non-technical company. My boss created and currently maintains a MS Access Desktop app that also uses MS Access as a backend as a database that other people in the department use. The pay is less than average for most tech internships in my area ($17 an hour in NYC), but I don't mind it, I just wanted experience to prepare myself for a full time job.

My job is to create an iOS app that basically replicates what her Access desktop application does so current users of the desktop app can use it outside on their iOS devices. I decided to make a hybrid app (more specifically using the Ionic Framework), as I am interested in web development and knew HTML, CSS and Javascript  beforehand. Also, I wouldn't have to spend time learning Swift or Objective-C. My boss was the one who suggested it.

Other than my boss, I am the only ""developer"" in my department. My boss only knows how to use the MS Access GUI and a little VBA. I sit everyday for 6-8 hours by myself, only talking to my boss occasionally asking questions about how she wants to mobile app to be like. 

Yesterday, my boss asked to upload my code on the company server and PRINT everything to show her. Afterwards, she drops a bomb on me. She tells me that I'll have to teach her everything I used to create the app. Commenting the code it not enough, I'll will have to teach her that languages and frameworks I used. This means I have to teach her HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, Ionic and a lot more technical things. She wanted me to tell her what platform I used to build the app. I tell her I write the code in Sublime Text, build it with Ionic using the command line, and then XCode to emulate on a device. She asks me what is a command line? She tries to open the README.md file but can't because she has no text editor other than Microsoft Word installed. She tries opening an HTML file but doesn't see anything when it loads on a browser. I try to explain that you have to compile and run the code from a server for it to work. Afterwards, she tells me she doesn't believe that I uploaded everything, and that I'm holding back code because of job security(??? I still dont understand what she means). She says if I finish the app (which I'm having trouble doing, since she keeps redesigning what she wants and how she wants the app to work) and she doesn't know what the code does, she will scrap the entire thing. 

Is it wrong that for me to feel frustrated that I have to teach my boss web development and how to use a CLI? I went into the internship knowing I wouldn't learn from my boss in a technical sense, but I did not expect to have to teach my boss instead. Should I quit my internship and spend the summer focusing on my Capstone course and personal projects?"

Recently we had two hard drives die on us, wouldn't read, and even worse wouldn't write.  I decided the best way to keep the data on it confidential was to destroy the hard-drives, after all that is what we did at a hospital I worked an internship for in the past, we drilled them out.  Well we don't have a drill that will drill through metal.  So I told my director I had equipment at home that would render the disks unusable.

She naturally then asked what the piece of equipment was, and if it was something we should consider purchasing in the future.  I replied saying we should think about getting a decent drill, but as for the equipment I am going to use I don't think the cops would approve of us using in town.  

Confused she asked, ""What the hell are you going to do?""

With confidence I replied, ""7.62x54mm Steel-core light armor piercing rounds should do the trick.""

She laughed and then said, ""Yeah that should do it, maybe a little overkill, but that should do it.""

I usually handle my own problems and never make excuses, but now I can't find the strength to.

I'm entering my second year, but my health has plummeted. I'm a computer science student, interning (unpaid) for the experience (it's the only thing I could get), and want to start building a portfolio for the future. I've always had a big dream of being in tech, but my mom is always complaining about everything and is fine with me not working, then completely against it the next minute. My sister is older, and works and goes to school, but she still has a hell of a lot of free time, doesn't do shit around the house and actually creates mess, and blows her money on clothes and beauty products. Yet my mom doesn't say shit to her and throws the load on me. I started off keeping the house clean, but after landing this internship, I now use the time I spent cleaning to work. So my mom huffs and puffs under her breath and gets pissed when I don't do something.

But that's not my problem. 

My problem is my endless health issues: I'm always tired, my movements are getting slower, I stay with a headache, I now have a rapid heart beat and feel winded after small tasks like fixing up my bed, I have a few painful joints, I'm starting to forget a lot of things, and my brain mixes things up from time to time. I can't even find the mental and physical strength to do what I love, which is code, study, and read, and my grades have slipped from straight As to only one A and the rest Bs and Cs. I rarely eat because I'm either not hungry or, mostly, there's nothing to eat except processed or hormonal foods, which only makes me feel 10x worse after eating it. I think I'm anemic (idk if it's hereditary from my mom) or have some sort of disease. I haven't been to the doctor nor dentist in years. I couldn't control my mom's religious anti-doctor, pro-Jesus-healing views as a minor, and now I won't be able to pay the hefty bills for the check up, X-Ray (I now have uneven rib cages, too), and blood work, and my mom wouldn't help either. I know I'm too young to be having so many health problems, but I feel so old.

I know if I only adjust my lifestyle, maybe I'd feel better, but I can't afford to buy even the foods because I don't have a job.

But now I'm just tired of being broke, tired of my mom's antagonizing behavior, and tired of being blamed for not cleaning up the house even though I never contribute to the mess. I'm always tired, and having to hear yapping every night and morning is even more exhausting.

I just want to forget about my dreams, get a regular job at a retail store or wherever, save up, move out, and go to a fucking doctor.

Should I just drop out of college for the sake of my health? Or do you have a better solution? because I'm so distraught and drained that I can't even think."

I worked in the medical field for a couple years and had significant internships or projects with Caterpillar, a nuclear power plant, a lug nut manufacturer, and an aerospace company.  I kind of want to say that because of those experiences I'll likely be able to draw to give 'real life' applications across a lot of different fields.

I know they'll want to hear about my teaching experiences (basically I was a tutor and TA during college, but that's it), and because the school is a rather diverse school, I'm sure they'll want to know about what kind of experience I have with that (none - I'm super white, lived in a super white neighborhood, went to a very asian/white college).

Basically, if you were selecting a student teacher, what would you want to know about them?"

Part of this is setting up a NAS to do RAID storage for our files. The problem is I cannot get the NAS to communicate with our computers. I'm assuming that the firewall is blocking this and I can't access it, as we technically aren't supposed to be using our own storage, but rather the shared storage provided by the university; however my boss is concerned about how secure that is. We are running two computers with Ubuntu 14.04 on a mac and a Dell Optiflex 9020, and the NAS is a QNAP TS-431. I haven't been able to find anything online but was wonder if it is possible to use one of the computers to host a local network that I could use as the server to have the NAS communicate with the other computer, or if we would be better off trying to acquire something like a network switch or hub.

I'll be a sophomore with a lengthy summer internship at a startup, decent projects, and a good GPA, from a top ~30 CS school. Honestly, I'm not sure what my response-rate will be, since I didn't really apply anywhere this year (this one startup was pretty much my only application).

I did not manage to secure a job whilst studying so my plan was to hopefully get an internship and then apply for jobs this winter when graduate placements open for the following year.

My friend who done an internship last year told me that the company was looking for someone for this year so he handed my CV in to them. I had assume it was an internship like he did.

However, I asked the employer to clarify and it is in fact a full time position. At first I was really excited, however, currently the company only comprises of three employees. The owner, his wife doing finance, and one other employee. The company was formed 17 years ago.

My worry is that if I accept this role then there would be no way to progress due to the low number of employees. On the plus side, working at a small company would have its benefits. I would be doing work that was productive from the start and would be able to see my results in action.

My only worry is that this niche job will lead to nowhere as obviously a small company can't give the training that a larger company would do. Especially when considering developing to chartership.

Does anyone have any opinions on this?

tl;dr: Recent graduate offered a job at company of three people. Worried about career progression."

I'm a student currently on a 4month internship in the south of France. Living in the north of France and having no choice but taking my bike to do the trip I had to find a way to bring my PC with me. Being pretty much broke I couldn't afford DHL or any kind of ""high-end"" transporter and has to stick with ""Laposte"" (The company which takes care of pretty much all the mail in France). I spent a day prepping a nice box full of bubble wrap and other stuff to keep my PC safe.

Last week I arrived in the south of France and my package was already there. After unpacking everything it seemed fine except for a few front panels which were bent or destroyed (I have CM Stormtrooper, those front panels cover spaces where you are supposed to put your CD/DVD reader/writer) but that's only cosmetic. After booting my computer I noticed that two of my SSD's were absent, they moved during the trip and were disconnected so, once again, no big deal.

But today I launched Witcher 3 and realized that I couldn't run the game anymore, no matter what the graphic settings are. So I tried a bunch of other games that ran fine before and the result was the same : 10-15 fps max, completely unplayable.

I reinstalled my drivers, opened the case once more, cleaned everything, switched the card port and tried again. But the result is still the same. It's like my GTX670 just lost 80% of it's capacity...

I don't really know what to do right now, I won't be able to afford any card before christmas and it's my working tool (I study game design and thus play a ton of games) that I'm supposed to use for those 4 months during my internship. I thought about running 3D mark to see if my score is what it should be for a GTX670 but it's 2GB to download and where I am actually there's no way I'm going to be able to download all of this in time (In the middle of the mountains, really unstable and slow connection).

So you guys are my last resort, is there anything that could create this kind of problem other than ""Your card is dead, enjoy Minesweeper until Christmas"" ? (Since, from the exterior the card has no visible damage).

**tl;dr**: Am in 4 month internship far away, sent my PC in a package, graphics card can't run games at more than 15fps anymore nor can I run stuff like UE4, is card dead or do I play minesweeper until christmas ?

Thanks !

EDIT: On request of Lonxu I ran MSI afterburner, here are the results :

&gt;In Idle state (not playing, just chrome running) I get :

&gt;**GPU temp**: 47°C
&gt;**CPU temp**: 37 to 40°C

&gt;**Clock speed (core)**: 324 Mhz (But it has irregular jumps to 700-900)

I am currently a sophomore in college (20 y/o) majoring in Computer Information Systems. I have not taken any major classes yet, but this upcoming semester I will be getting into more computer based classes. I am fairly new to the IT field and am very interested and eager to learn more, but do not have anything specific I want to go in to yet. I've done some very basic Beta Testing and Desktop Hardware Support.

I recently landed an awesome IT Intern opportunity with a rapidly growing and successful company because their other intern left to pursue other interests. I am basically the ""inhouse IT guy"" here at the office now and it's a bit overwhelming but I am using this experience to learn a lot and grow in the field. They told me they wanted to hire someone to learn and grow with the company rather than hiring a more experienced person that’s sort of a “know it all already”… that’s not what they wanted. The company is also serviced by a good outsourced IT company that overlooks all our servers/switches and what not, so all the pressure is not on me all the time and I can always ask them questions over the phone and they can remote in and show me how to do things (this is how I Learn A LOT). This opportunity is an excellent way to expose me to a variety of things. I am learning how to use the Active Directory, Server Permissions, managing a Domain, how the phone system works basic to advance troubleshooting, business related IT… A whole bunch of things. All on Windows 7 Professional workstations and a Windows SBS Server 2011.

Here is what draws me in so much.. this company is small but VERY successful and we are rapidly growing. We are in a wealthy retirement part of Florida, and being a Wealth Management company, there’s a ton of high roller clients that come in to the office. I meet a ton of great people and it is really teaching me how to act and be a professional in the business world. Learning new things everyday gets me excited to work and eager to do my best and excel in my role. Our office has about 15 people in it and it’s honestly very enjoyable to work with everyone here, it’s like family. What I am trying to get at is I see potential in this company and can see myself sticking around for a while, or at least as long as I can throughout college. I have really impressed them in the short amount of time I’ve been there so far, so much that I am getting my own brand new office in our new space we are moving in to soon. The new space is twice as big as our office now and I get to work with the professional IT team setting up our server room, learning about setting up networks, how the cabling works, setting up work stations, etc. Another amazing opportunity to learn and grow.

My main concern is that I feel as if I don’t know as much as I am supposed to. My job here is very Help Desk role. In most cases to obtain a help desk job you need your CompTia A+ certification, and I feel as if I am missing a lot of that information. DON’T GET ME WRONG, I personally believe I am doing a great job helping people out in the office and everyone is very happy with me, but still feel as if I am sort of missing the nitty gritty tech stuff about computers. Granted, I haven’t really taken any computer related classes which I will probably learn about the general knowledge things on the A+. I don’t know if I am just thinking prematurely or just being hard on myself (I am fairly new to IT but have been using computers my whole life).

I wanted to ask you more experience guys, what would you do in my situation? Would it be beneficial for me to study and obtain the A+ even if I don’t plan on leaving for another “entry-level” job, and just for the information? From what I read, it seems like your A+ is good for entry level than anything beyond that it is kind of pointless. I landed a dream entry level position without the A+ (at least I think) and was wondering what I should do? Should I go for the A+ to learn the basic stuff, or just study that on my own and maybe go for other certifications? My main goal is to get a jump start into something that will help me out in the future. Is it even worth going for certs, or just focus on my classes (obviously I am going to try my best in school and do my cert studies on the side) I feel as if the more I know and the more I can prove myself to this company, the higher up (and more pay) I can receive. EVEN IF I leave after all, they would be an absolute amazing reference to have and would help me out finding a new position elsewhere (lets say for example when I graduate). What would be the most beneficial for me right now?

So my friends, what do you think?﻿﻿﻿"
4nc682,3,2016-06-09,How can I tell if a job training offer is trustworthy?,UndKhtOfShorpe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4nc682/how_can_i_tell_if_a_job_training_offer_is/,"So a little background about me: I graduated with a BS in Computer Science with mediocre grades, no internship, and have been working lesser jobs in the past 2 years. But lately I've been applying to whatever entry level jobs I can find, despite the lack of confidence in having success.

However, one company has reached out to me. They say that they are looking for Java developers for their training program. I would be spending 1-2 months training then placing me in position afterwards (est. $50k salary). The training's completely free and they'll pay me during the training time, and may even be able to offer temporary housing at a discount. My interview is tomorrow.

This should sound great for someone who really needs experience (and a full-time job very soon), but I have doubts on how legitimate it is. I googled the company for reviews and turns out they are an India-based company (or at least most of the company is run by Indians), but most of the negative reviews seems to be regarding the India branch. The US branch (including the one I'm going to) seems to generally be positive. Also, the recruiting process seems almost a little too fast. If I do get accepted, then I would have to be there next Wednesday, but I could always chalk that up as coincidence, since summer vacation started recently.

So how can I make sure that this isn't just a scam and that I am getting a legitimate offer? I would be traveling halfway across the state on a pretty short notice if I did, and if it turns out that I was getting scammed, then I would be pretty boned. It's better to be safe and sorry, right?

My interview is tomorrow, so what are some questions I should be asking? Anything about legitimacy (or otherwise) without sounding direct would help. Also, the company's name is SummitWorks Technologies if anyone's curious."

So I’m in my early thirties and just graduated with a Diploma in Advertising (focus on Copywriting). I'm trying like hell to land a Copywriting internship without much success, and have recently quit my job in order to finish up my final semester; which means I’ve been spending the last month sending out resumes and applying for jobs with a good amount of free time in between. 

Problem is that I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket, considering I’m sort of panicking about my future (career-wise) and I’m sort of in a rush to get to a place where I’m making good money with some semblance of career stability. I’m intrigued by the ability in this field to learn a lot on your own (without going to school) and doing well career wise. Therefore, I would like to spend whatever free time I have learning what I can to not only expand my skill set (and perhaps be seen as a more valuable potential employee) but also perhaps build a skill set which allows me to get right into a stable career if the Advertising thing doesn’t work out for whatever reason. I want to be as proactive as I can as I’m not at an age/mindset where I’m some young 20 year old with the time to wait for an agency to throw me a bone via some minimum-wage internship. I absolutely killed it in my program, picked up a few awards, earned a very high GPA (which doesn’t matter in Advertising) did lots of networking (the people kind), yadda yadda yadda – but I’m sitting here wondering how much longer my meager savings will keep my head above water until I’m completely broke. I understand that computers are a great field to get into/a valuable skill so this is why I’m here.

*Buddy, I’ve got code to write and NSFW subreddits to browse; get to the question already* 

(Possibly) Influential factors:

- as mentioned above: Marketing/Advertising background
- strong writer, creative/tons of ideas, great presenter, leadership skills, great with people, strategic thinker
- complete noob; so I don’t have ANY sort of deep computer background (i.e. coding/programming etc.) but totally willing to put the time in
- your recommendation DOES NOT need to mesh with Marketing/Advertising 
- time is somewhat of a factor in the sense that I would like to know what skills you think are the best to learn the to get to a stable, well-paying job without having to spend a ton of time in school

So, keeping the above in mind, where is a better place to start? I see all these different titles like: Software Developer, Programmer, Web Developer, Networking, IT Security, Software Engineer etc., but I’m not sure if some of them are essentially the same thing (i.e. Software Developer/Engineer?) Also, considering that making your own websites are becoming easier and easier, is the Web Developer role on its way out? I’m also concerned about roles that are going to be affected by automation so which field is somewhat “futureproof-ish” (I know it’s probably hard to guess and no one knows how things are going to play out but again, I’m just here for your opinion). I’m not going to beat around the bush here: I want something that pays well, I can learn relatively on my own and will be valuable in the future (bonus points for allowing room for creativity).

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ideally I really would like to learn about these technologies, but jumping right in seems like its out of my league.

I get paid decently, bad for a tech job, but considering its my first real job I'm good with it. My other concern is references. I would like some people here for references, but if I don't succeed should I just throw that possibility out the window?

Should I start looking for another?,Xx9VOLTxX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ncyn7/first_job_out_of_college_isnt_really_what_i/,"I graduated last December and had a few offers within a couple of weeks.  Most of the companies I talked to were wanting front-end developers, which I had done an internship on last summer, but wanted to move away from it to focus more on the back-end as I just enjoyed it more.  The company I finally accepted an offer from was to be back-end java development, which I have the most experience in and felt like it could help me with my goals of doing more machine learning eventually, which I had done a couple of projects on and taken classes about.  On the second day of work, which started in February, I found out that the project that I was put on to start with was going to be completely shut down at the end of march.  So my one project partner and I realized that there was no real point in continuing to work on it since everything would be thrown out in a month's time.  So for my first month of work, I had nothing meaningful to do except ask about what we'll be moved to next.  

Once the project was shut down it took another couple of days before someone came and told us what we'd be working on.  I was told it would be a big data project, which after asking a bit it sounded like exactly what I wanted for my career goals.  Another couple of days later I found out there was nothing big data related at all in the project and I'd essentially be working on an admin tool to send notifications to a few hundred people in very special instances.  I wasn't really happy with this, but I thought I would wait for the project to start before I made a judgement on that.  Little did I know that it would be another two months before I was actually able to start programming something.  When the time finally came to start working, the only thing I was doing was a spring RestApi and Angular, which I had already done both and like I said, didn't want to do more.  I felt like maybe I could soldier through it and get a bit interested and when the first release happened 5 months later I could move to something else.  

Well 3 weeks later, which was just a couple of days ago I have been having an incredibly hard time motivating myself because the overall project isn't interesting at all, I'm not learning anything new or really being challenged at all, and most of the time I'm just messing with the CSS of one part of it, which I absolutely can't stand to do anymore.  They noticed the lack of performance and when they brought it up to me I gave a much briefer version of what I said above essentially saying that doing front-end wasn't what I was initially hired for, and it's not what I had really wanted to do.  They responded by saying I was just hired as a software engineer and that since I was put on the project 3 months ago, this was my project now.

So this is sort of where I'm at now.  I don't particularly like or care for my job, and now it's just causing me massive anxiety cause I'm not interested but I know that I have to do it to keep it, and there really doesn't seem to be an option to move to something else, especially with it being a two person team on this.  Do you guys think think I need to start looking outside for something, or really just suck it up and work?  If you read this wall, thanks so much for working through my rant about this!"

4nd9of,0,2016-06-09,"Old friend just contacted me again, I have very mixed feelings about our friendship and his value of character. Warning: very long back story",suberdoo,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4nd9of/old_friend_just_contacted_me_again_i_have_very/,"I met a dude in college in my engineering classes. We were both extremely active sports wise, and also loved to drink a ton on weekends, for different reasons I think. I recently had just cut ties with a very close friend/ex and my buddy had some drinking problems that I liken to the whole higher IQ, mental instability stereotype. He was super cool guy though. We got close throwing parties for others and entertaining at them. At the end of those nights we would look at each other and drunkenly exclaim, ""we did it again buddy"". Then proceed to drink more.

He invited this girl to a party. She was cute. I spoke to her for a bit, and found out she was a math major, minoring in computer science. ""What a coincidence!! I""m a computer engineering Major who programs"" We hit it off pretty well. I found she smoked weed, too. ""Oh my gawd, this couldn't get any better""

Anyway, that night ends. Same story as usual.

So fast forward a few months and it's summer. I was living at home with my parents during an internship in hometown about 2 hours away. I hang out with said girl above every weekend, staying with her. My buddy would often tag along as he verbalized the reason was to help hook us up. I dont think what he was doing was helping. I realize he probably felt left out which was strange because he hung out with her a bit when I was in hometown.

Here's an example we all hang out Friday night during that summer, bake 10 firecracker edibles, eat a few that night. You know, fun young people shit. It was around 345am or so and my buddy fell asleep on a bean bag chair on the floor. She sat right next to me on the couch and we're just chilling watching a movie. I'm super awkward, suck at talking to girls I think are cute like a lot of people. So I straight up just say to her in a joking manner, ""wanna have a cuddle party?"" My buddy wakes up immediately and yells, ""wooohooo cuddle party!"" She kind of looks at me awkwardly with a face like, ""ehh, I dont know."" She didn't really give an answer. (I spoke to her later and found out she did want to with me, just not with him). So the next day, my buddy was supposed to leave as A and I were supposed to go hike the Konza prairie (we had made plans prior to the weekend to do so). My buddy never left, and he tagged along. We were both too nice to say anything so we just went with it. (At the time I didn't realize, this pattern of behavior would be the reason our friendship begins dissolving).

So this happened a few more times for about a month. So, I kinda gave up on trying to date this girl and instead looked local to dating and making more friends around me instead of focusing energies in a place that would have me feeling either jealous, or annoyed often,(as I said before because my buddy and that girl both lived in the college town for the summer, and I was at home 2 hours away). We stayed friends.

We go back to school in the fall and I'm having hard time one day. I go out for a walk, and end up walking pretty close to A's place. So I give her a call, and ask if she wants to hang out for a bit, catch up, whatever. (we were still friends, hung out loosely, went to warped tour in a platonic-nature). I chill at her place with her talking about random stuff: all of the summer plans we had made and about our buddy who seemed to butt in to stuff and I learned that she felt very similar. We were on the same wavelength apparently the whole time. We hit it off again. It was nice. It got late, around 330am. And I said I should probably head back. And she says ""well I mean you can stay here if you like. I know you're still injured so I don't want to make you walk more than you already have today"" (I was nursing a groin injury very poorly). I say yeah I'll stay. We end up sleeping in the same bed, cuddling, sex, all the fun stuff. It was nice to have that connection with someone. We begin seeing each other more often and hanging out every other day or so. Doing whatever, tagging along on each others' errands or school club activities. We were growing closer again.

Well, then one night we all go to this party at my friends place a few hours away. And we're all getting behemothly wasted. (so cool, ino rite?) A got drunk enough that she fell down the stairs 2x, she didn't remember doing that. Nor did she get any of the bruises or whatever the next day. But here's where things start to get weird, everyone slept in the same room. That's not the weird part. I slept on the floor because I went outside to smoke pretty late that night after a few others had gone to bed. I wake up the next morning, with an ""oh shit, where the fuck am I"" feeling. I sit up slowly and look over to my left to see my buddy and A sleeping on the couch pretty close to each other. ""Huuuuh, that's weird."" I had this uncomfortable feeling in my gut. ""Why do I feel so weird about this right now? Did they...? NOooooo. He wouldn't do that to me. She wouldn't do that to me either."" He knows I like her and want her to be my gf, and she hasn't been seeing anyone else since we started talking. In fact, she was seeing someone loosely on tinder as a sort of fuck buddy deal, and when we started talking again she let me know and said that she stopped seeing him. I also had been seeing someone loosely back home, and let her know I had cut it off when things started getting more serious. So we were on the same page.. I think?

Anyway, I woke up that morning confused, a tiny bit hurt, but then immediately pushed the idea aside as my other friends offered me some bacon and a few scrambles of eggs. I was super uncomfortable that morning, I really just wanted to leave and get the fuck out of that cramped room/kitchen.

We leave and I take A to where her mom is staying in the town, and we get back on the same wavelength again and are having a good time. I pretty much pushed those initial feelings away because, I""m just being crazy right?

Well, fast forward another month and we're all having a social beer and begin talking about that night about what we do and don't remember, in a lighthearded fun way. ""OMG I can't remember any of it. LOLOLOL"" etc. My buddy says ""well all I remember is making out with someone.. and maybe some other stuff, too"" and A says she remembers making out with someone and that she didnt want like it but that she can't really remember very clearly anything. And then I started to get a little uncomfortable, like, wait.. what. Why now.. is this coming up? My buddy notices my face, I think. (I tend to show everything on my face whether I want to or not). Immediately throws in that, ""Oh you were a part of it too, remember?"" - kind of nudging me like expecting me to agree in a manipulative way. A responds ""hahaha oh my god"". I feel confused, still, but push it to the back of my mind.

What sucks is that I don't think I blacked out that night. I was very drunk yes but I can recall everything that night, even going upstairs to get to bed. I distinctly remember going to bed, and waking up in the same spot I fell asleep at. But I believed him very quickly, because I didn't want to have to confront him about his potential lie or about his character, I think. A believed him as well.

Shortly after I asked her to be my gf. When issues arose, we seemed to conquer those issues very easily, and smoothly. Had a ton of fun together, taught each other random shit. Fun shit. (she said yes if that wasn't clear)

I was doing shrooms a month after that, and came back to me during the trip. I recalled everything. I put the pieces together for myself. The story they told me, er.. the story he told me. (She had a tendency to completely black out when she binge drank, and gave me no further reason to believe that she might be lying knowingly at that point. She stopped binge drinking as we started dating.) It just didn't sit right with me. Again I pushed it to the back of my mind. ""Why would a super close friend of mine lie to me. no no no. He wouldn't do that. This is stupid""

Maybe a week after, A and I go get sushi. We get to talking about something dumb-funny that my buddy did. I don't remember what comment I made but it caused reaction, ""Why do you listen to him and hang around with him so much."" This next part is pretty foggy in my head, so these aren't the exact words, ""he lies to you pretty often"".

I asked what do you mean, and she said, oh about whatever. Just be careful.

I confront him a week later after letting it mull over some about the incident a few months back at the party giving him the chance to tell his story. I give him one last chance to come clean, and then I pick apart his story with my version. And well, he somehow got me thinking that it wasn't a big deal and that he really didn't know what happened. As he had said otherwise on multiple occasions (When he was so sure that I was involved). I felt manipulated.

This forever changed my perception of him as a person. And just yesterday, he snapchats me, ""Hey we should hang"".

But it's just got me thinking. The way he acted about it all. I can't trust this dude. Sure he may have been trying to protect me and my feelings from something that might have been innocent But combining that night with his seeming manipulations of me, and all the times he forced himself into plans, and it really makes me reconsider our friendship and the value of his character.

I spoke to him about this once a year ago after that first time I mentioned above, and he did apologize, not about anything specific but just about the whole situation. It didn't sound sincere though. 

Maybe 6 months after that, I had a dream about the whole situation. I decided to speak with him one more time about it. He seemed more sincere this time. Basically something along the lines of ""I've been a shitty friend and I'm sorry. I love you man""

I would say he's an overall good dude, but I still don't feel like I can trust him. And I'm not sure how to handle it. I kind of don't want him around me at all because well, he manipulated so much. And it wasn't until he started losing more friends that he became more apologetic. I don't know what to do. I'm supposed to grab some lunch with him on Saturday but I can't seem to let the past go. Any advice would be appreciated. 


Edit: I want to add that, he's done a lot for me in the past. given me rides when car was broken down, helped me out with stressful situations, been support through some really shitty times. 
Except for recently, I've been going through some really tough times in the past 6 months, and he has not been around at all, he's been in town many times and never hit me up. I understand people are busy, but when someone tells you theyll hit you up in the next weekend and they don't.. for 6 months, it's kinda shitty.  

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the long post.

My university has this program where you choose 20 internship offers from multiple companies. After that, these companies choose their candidate to interview and give a mark on students (1 to 5, one being you're their first choice, or 0 if they absolutely don't want you).

I had an interview which I thought I completely failed, but the employer called me and told me he gave me a 1 mark (the best).

At this point, would it be ok to call him to ask how much he pays? He seemed really curious to know for what reasons I would choose another company over theirs.


TL;DR : First internship (computer engineering), employers wants me, is it ok to call him and ask how much he pays?"
4ndfyt,1,2016-06-09,[CA] Misleading situation with landlord,wushuhimexx,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4ndfyt/ca_misleading_situation_with_landlord/,"Hi everyone! I am an intern in SF this summer and I moved into my apartment two days ago along with another intern. However, the apartment is not quite as I expected it would be. When we found the site for the apartment it was advertised essentially as a tech co-op for extremely affordable pricing. The website looked quite legitimate and under the specific apartment it even listed the names and pictures of the tenants residing there, which reassured us at the time. The entire thing was basically advertised as a social experience and a way to make friends in an unfamiliar city. The pictures of the rooms looked acceptable, if tiny, so we signed individual leases for 3 months.

Upon moving in I discovered many things about the room were not as the landlord had described to me through email. I was supposed to be put into a room close to my fellow intern but I was placed into another room instead. The room I was given was missing a dresser that I was told the room came furnished with and the bed was a twin size instead of full. The mini-fridge was also half the size of the ones shown in photographs. All of these are minor things, but the fact that I had been plainly told one thing and was presented with another made me feel uneasy. Moreover, the place is definitely not the tech co-op it had been advertised as. There are no common spaces at all, only individual rooms down a hallway like a tiny dorm and the place is much more run-down than it seemed in photographs. The place definitely houses people that were not listed on the website and their behavior thus far makes both my co-intern and I feel unsafe to the point that we've essentially locked ourselves in our rooms and feel afraid to leave to use the bathroom (I believe we are also the only two girls in the building). My bed frame straight up broke on the first night and my co-intern's window will not lock. I feel deceived by the way this apartment was presented and now feel like I'm locked into a living situation that makes me feel really unsafe. All other things held equal, I could deal with the issues with furniture and broken bed frames and such, but the unmentioned strangers living in the same building is what really frightens me. I'm just wondering whether I have any options here. I also apologize if I'm kind of vague- we're also unsure of whether we're just being paranoid or if we genuinely should be worried about what's going on. If I need to elaborate on anything please let me know.

My position is a front-end developer at a startup company with sub 10 people everyday. I feel like things are getting really difficult for me, I need some help.

I had basic/intermediate knowledge of HTML and CSS, and basic Javascript and Jquery. I was never assigned a mentor or supervisor, the first 2 days of work I was just told to learn and practice WordPress.

Recently I was assigned as task, where I am suppose to work with a wordpress plugin called woocommerce. He spoke about having to work with APIs, Json files, some Node.js, and more stuff with the plugin. To be honest this stuff really went over my head because I only recently started learning HTML/CSS/JS/JQuery on my own, and what I was assigned really went over my head. I didn't even know what to start googling to learn.

I must also point out that I am shy so I don't really like asking for help. Mostly it is because I don't want to bother them. I don't like being that noob intern that always asks for help, and ending up being more of a nuisance than contributing to the company. I'm not yet comfortable around all the staff so its hard for me to speak up for help.

This is my first internship and because i'm interested in front-end development, this is a great opportunity. Am I just being a little bitch? I really need some tips because I don't want to lose this opportunity to learn."

But some articles I read say I shouldn't care too much on the technology used because having the programming knowledge is more important. But I also have seen post of people have trouble adjusting to places with newer technology. And it seems like a candidate is pretty valuable if he/she has knowledge of latest technology. I remember a few years back when a friend of mine got hired because he knew AngularJS when it wasn't as popular. He was a strong candidate because he knew that framework when it was still very new.

I want to know if this sounds like a reasonable plan and I am also hoping for some advice on how to go about doing it.



Details:

-My sister is moving to Portland and I could stay with her, my cost of living would be relatively low.

-I already have an internship with a small but highly specialized and respected company in my area.

-At my current internship I do about 70% programming and 30% general IT support. So far I have been doing a lot of work with jde, sql, and java.

-I have a solid general work history.

-By the time of this next internship I will have all together taken java programming, data structures and advanced java, database systems, computer systems, web programming along with classes like calc, discrete math, and other B.S. generals. I am currently double majoring in CS and psychology.

-Decent grades (3.4 gpa) along with working full time.

-I have worked as a social media specialist 

-I am a very easy going and motivated person, I think this is evident on my resume.



So my plan is to start looking for internships now in the Portland area. I am hoping to find an internship for next summer. My first question is how would you suggest I go about doing this? 
Second based on these limited qualities of my self does it seem reasonable that some place there would want me?
Lastly I am open to any advice on my CS careers.
If you have any questions please ask.

Thank you for your time and I appreciate any help.

In the next 1 week my mentor wants me to make a prototype to show what the tool can do to determine if building an application around it and using it in the company's products is viable.

The problem I have is that the tool is really extensive, but has poor resources; it has lots of features but the documentation is admittedly out of date. I found a book on it and am going through that but there is just way too much to memorize (it involves concepts with distributed systems, load balancing, and has its own query language). 

My boss, while helpful, just left me to my own devices. After the first meeting the job was basically ""just google the tool"" since no one in the company knows how to use it (except a few people in another country). 

The deadline I have to build this prototype is a bit too soon because there are just too many fundamental things to go through before actually getting to the relevant features. I don't know how to bring this up to my mentor without giving a bad impression of myself. I'd really like a job here or at the very least a good recommendation because either would be huge for my resume. I'll be applying to full-time positions this fall."

Offer A:  3 month internship over the summer, get to travel a bit, will just about break even financially, but the company culture is just really awesome, the product is popular and the company is quite popular too

Offer B: £38'000, £5'000 shares, nice run-of-the-mill company, only a small team though 

The cost of taking A over B is about £7'600 at the end of the same 3 month period. This is almost a full year of tuition at University, it is also the cost of renting a room in Thailand for a year and learning code by myself. 

Yet, I find that I still really want to take offer A. I will meet tons of cool people, learn Java, and learn innovate software development methodologies. I will also most likely have the possibility of joining company B after the internship, and maybe company A, if I am lucky.

I DO need to learn JS syntax and features at least on a basic level to where I stand a chance of getting through a MEAN stack tutorial.

What would be a good bet? Obviously I'm not going to learn all the ins and out over the weekend but gotta start somewhere. Codeacademy? CodeSchool? Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks. "

My last build that I put together January 2014, which is a GTX 770/FX 8350 build just sits at home while I'm living in Virginia (Navy).  My brother is about to start an internship with a commercial construction company and could really use the desktop for work (gaming on the side if he chooses), and I don't want to have it shipped to me.  I'm giving him that one and will make a new one more myself.

I won't be building this until more towards the end of the year, so this is just kinda thinking out loud.  I'm thinking something like this at the moment, though I have heard about that new RX 480 that's coming out, so that may be the winner if it holds up.

If there's any way I could lower the price without sacrificing too much potential, then I'm all ears.

I appreciate any input!"
4nix2y,2,2016-06-10,What to do when your internship doesn't pan out as far as learning goes,notherthroawa,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4nix2y/what_to_do_when_your_internship_doesnt_pan_out_as/,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm interning in a major city at a big name bank for software development. Wasn't my first choice but it pays well and seemed to have a decent program at the time, almost certainly better than the other companies I got offers for. Though it's been only 2 weeks, I'm beginning to worry though that my experience won't be any good in practice. Everyone on my team seems washed up and disinterested, and (as is the case with many banks) I'm using a fairly out of date technology stack with tons of legacy code. Sure, the experience might be something to other companies on a resume, but I'm beginning to be very concerned that I'm not going to get valuable experience from the position. 

With all of this said does anyone have suggestions for how to spend maximize my summer experience to go for bigger name companies in tech for full time in the recruiting season this fall? I'm already trying to take advantage of some of the opportunities in the area like Meetups, and since the workday is pretty chill I've been studying algorithms and doing leetcode problems. I'm kind of having a realization that I haven't worked hard enough outside of class on projects (since my school's department isn't great) to really be deserving of a position at a top company with a culture I would enjoy, and it seems that this kind of company is what's going to be in my future if I don't change my habits outside of work and class. I'm sure I can't be the only one who has experienced something like this, so I was wondering if anyone has had a relatively poor intern experience and gone on to change their habits, etc, to get a position at a company they enjoy. Basically, this company isn't why I got into tech. It feels like if I got the full time offer from this position for next year and took it I'd be stuck in a job that wouldn't carry valuable experience for other companies. "

While I don't mind the 8-5 schedule, I can't seem to program much outside of work. I've tried to force myself to practice, but it's always a half-hearted effort since I lack motivation. After sitting at a computer all day, I like to do other things after work. In my opinion, keeping my life balanced will prevent burnout and pay off over the long run.

However, this sub really pushes personal projects and coding outside of work. Do I still have a shot at top companies and solid career advancement if I don't like to program in my free time?"

TBD... Based on practice probably close to ~690-720 

Internship Experience: 
-1 summer in Fortune 100 CPG company IT department working as a business analyst in SAP (Supply Chain)
-1 summer at regional marketing firm doing digital analytics 
-various other marketing/journalistic experiences 

Extracurricular: 
-1 year in Army ROTC
-ambassador for liberal arts college 

Race/Sex: White male

Goal of MBA: Long term development. I'm not gonna lie and say I have my life planned out at 21. But as for the story I'd tell, I want to be a business leader who embraces technology and seeks to understand it instead of avoiding it. I don't want to be an IT technical specialist long term, but rather someone senior level who can actually understand more of the technical and functional issues associated with IT. 

I understand the program targets kids who probably aren't typical MBA candidates in the long term. So that's probably not me. But I wonder if being more IT focused gives me any sort of edge over typical ""business"" students. 

I won't take anything personally, just looking for some legitimate feedback as I study for GMAT and consider putting together an application. HBS would be a dream come true, but it's not the end of the world, and I think I'm fairly realistic about where I stand as of now. 

If you have any other suggestions as to what you think I should do (I'm thinking of sticking in big industry IT or shifting to consulting for the beginning of my career and I know I want an MBA, hopefully sooner rather than later) I also welcome those too. Thanks in advance! "

And I don't have a portfolio of anything regarding programming.

This is my first post on reddit. Here it goes: I am a PhD student at UC Davis and I will be developing an app for a parenting program called Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT). The app will be for parents and clinicians. So far, the project is just a fetus. I presented the idea at the PCIT conference last year and the clinicians were practically salivating. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to devote much, if any, time yet because I have been finishing up another project and my thesis. I am pretty much at square one, but will be diving in full time in a few months.
I am pretty clueless when it comes to technology and have no idea what will go into this project. I haven't started to read up on it yet either, so I am quite naive about what this sort of project will entail. Although I don't have the knowledge yet, luckily I do have the funds, volunteer undergraduate psychology research assistants and access to the computer science department at UC Davis if need be. I am thinking about either hiring programmers(s) or having undergraduate computer science majors intern to help with programming. Can someone give me an idea of what the heck goes into a big project like this? If it would be helpful, I can explain some details about what I want the app to involve - to sum it up, I think it's going to be quite complex, and not a simple app, especially since there will be two versions - one for clinicians, and one for parents. I also will need it to run on multiple platforms. I feel silly posting this before doing my own basic research, but hey, why not. I would be very grateful for the guidance, and I think there are a lot of knowledgeable people on here!  My apologies if I posted in the wrong place.  "

Monday thru Wednesday were on-boarding and training days, to be expected. 

Thursday and Friday are when things started to fall apart. Thursday was spent setting up or laptops in the proper environment. For me, it was cloning team repos, doing maven installs, and setting up eclipse and tomcat. This isn't a very hard task.

Of course, we had errors on the very last package. My other teammates (interns) are in the same position as me in the setup process, and we were all just sitting around Thursday waiting for our team coordinator (not intern manager) to help us. He didn't even take the time to sit down with us until this afternoon, and we spent the last half of the day pretty much just redoing all of the setup and it still didn't work on our machines. Of course his did, he pretty much just told us to figure it out. 

So, I'm trying to stay positive. I know it's the beginning and we have to get everything set up but I was just really hoping to be doing some actual changes and commits by next week, and we haven't even got the basic local application up and running. 

Do I tell the intern manager things don't seem coordinated and I'm itching to get started? Do I wait it out because it's what we're told to expect? I just feel like I wasted 10% of my time and I don't want next week to be a repeat.

Bit of a backstory... I completed a year long degree related internship over 3 years ago with a company in which I did not perform very well. There were some unfortunate personal events but in reality it was my own immaturity and laziness. I did improve over the last few months but I don't think it was enough to offset the beginning. Anyway fast forward to the present and I recently completed my masters degree. I've just been offered a great job with a company and I am currently providing them with references. I have not included a reference from this  internship as I know it would not be wholely positive. I have provided other references from my part time job and volunteering activities in which I performed much better. Unfortunately these are not related the line of work I am looking to get into. Will this appear obvious to the company that I am avoiding giving them a reference? The internship was quite a while ago and I know I am not the same person I was then. This has been a major regret for me over the last couple of years and I'm worried it will effect the rest of my life.

[Hey Dr Pimple Popper, I'm a huge fan from Ireland! I love your videos - not only are they informative but they're so good to watch. My question is, what do your colleagues/family/friends think of your fame? Are they confused as to why people like your videos? Keep up the great videos :\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45f466?context=5)|First time I told my dad (a retired dermatologist) was last March 2015 when Buzzfeed made a video about my pimple popping on youtube.  I told him that I had this youtube channel and that I had been posting videos on it and that one of them went viral.  He asked me what type of vids was I posting.  I said.. uhhh, well, they are blackhead extractions.  He just looked at me and said, ""well, that's just ridiculous"".  Next day, he happened to have an appointment at the Apple store to learn about his computer.  He asked the teacher to show him how to post videos on youtube and the teacher said something like ""oh my gosh, speaking of youtube you HAVE to see this amazing channel"".  Yes, it was my channel.  That night, I had all kinds of respect from my dad! haha He pulled me close and said: ""Sandra, I think if you go to the Apple Store, I don't think you will ever have to stand in line!! ""  ;) 
[What has been your worst procedure to date? Also, did you ever think this many people would be watching you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d4ew?context=5)|I never imagined that this many people would be so interested in what I do, or that it would grow this quickly.. but I do enjoy ""feeding the fire"", I imagine everytime i post a vid it's like throwing another log on the fire.  My worst procedure?  I'm not sure, but to me, my ""worst procedures"" are ones that don't turn out as well as I hoped.  I always under promise, because it's much better for patients to be pleased at the outcome that is better than they expected then for you to promise them the world and they are left disappointed.  If you mean ""worst"" to mean grossest.. well abscesses are pretty gross in general, not gonna lie. 
[At what age did you know you wanted to become a dermatologist ? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d49s?context=5)|Honestly, I don't know.  My dad's a dermatologist and I guess I've just been exposed to derm all my life... I remember opening my dad's huge textbooks at home and being grossed out.  One picture I will always remember was of this kid probably under 10 years old lying down with tapeworms coming out of the ""other end"".. I can still see that pic if I close my eyes.. eeks.  Anyway, when I got into med school, I found out derm was one of the most competitive specialties - very difficult to get.. it think that's when I decided I wanted to try to go for it.  And it wasn't easy.. big failures before any success.. 
[Out of all the popping you've done, which one has been your favorite? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45dgcg?context=5)|I like the ones that tell a story. I think there is no one favorite over time but there are always favorites of the moment.  Like The Masked Man, Mr &amp; Mrs Gold, Mr Wilson, Pops... one of the most gratifying things about what I do that I didn't expect before becoming a dermatologist, is the wonderful relationships you develop with some of your patients.  You get to meet and speak to at length, and really get to know someone that you may have never spoken to or been associated with in your own personal like.  Like Humans of New York, I like to call it Humans of Dermatology or Humans of Popping. 
[I love your videos, not only are they mesmerizing but they are also very informative. You seem to be very resistant to the ""grossness"" of your work, but has there been any situation where you could not contain your disgust?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d54f?context=5)|I'm not resistant.. or ok, maybe I AM resistant compared to the average person, but certainly there are times that I may feel surprise or disgust... but the key is NOT to show this.  The patient is the MOST important to me, and I never treat anyone under general anesthesia so patients can hear everything we say.  We never say ""oops"" or ""oh my god what is that?!"" etc, nor will you hear us gasp or scream... even if something takes us by surprise.. I don't want to alarm or frighten my patients.  Later, amongst ourselves, we may comment on what happened but we never do when the patient is present. 
[Oh my gosh, what a coincidence, I just discovered your channel a few days ago!  Two questions if that's okay? First, why does the nose seem so rich in terms of blackheads to extract? And second, the procedures on your channel look so awesome, but I always wonder if the extractions smell bad or do you just get used to the smell?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45ea0e?context=5)|The nose is rich in sebaceous glands  / oil glands which produce sebum / oil.  Fertile ground for blackheads.  Blackheads don't really smell but in all honesty, I don't smell them, do I wouldn't really know.  Sometimes cysts have an odor, sort of the kind of smell that they look like they should have I guess?  Sometimes they don't though.  When you have a particularly ugly looking extraction you kind of brace yourself waiting for there to be an odor, but I'm wearing a mask and I don't breathe in deeply and they don't always smell from afar.  I don't go looking for it I guess I should say. 
[Do you ever get asked to 'take a quick look at this' in social situations? Like, a friend takes you to the restaurant bathroom cause she just noticed a weird mole or bump. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d8rq?context=5)|Yes, and in general, it's pretty annoying, unless of course it's a good friend of mine, then of course I don't care and am happy to help.   It's annoying because when I'm not working, I don't really want to talk about work, just like any other person in any profession.  The worst situation for me was when I was playing golf one weekend and in my backswing I could hear someone driving up behind me in their golf cart.  It was a young woman who's father was playing on another hole and told her to ask me to look at a mole on her back...
[Are you having to ""fix"" many failed attempts at DIY procedures (specifically, people trying to remove cysts or large blackheads\) as these have increased in popularity over sites like YouTube? If so, any stories you can share?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45dj7v?context=5)|I don't really see people who have really damaged themselves from trying to remove a cyst themselves.  Many people squeeze their own cysts and try to get rid of them, but not many attack themselves with a box cutter.. I think those are the crazy ones who will video tape it! I can't think of any stories that include a failed attempt at home. And personally I prefer the ""virginal"" cysts and blackheads.  Much easier to remove/ no scar tissue that makes for a much prettier, cleaner video with less blood, difficulty in removal.  
[We only ever see your 'popping' videos on YouTube. What other aspects of dermatology do you enjoy? Are the bulk of your patients now those looking for cyst treatment? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45ezt7?context=5)|I try to put other things in there every now and then but yes the bread and butter of my youtube channel is the popping.  I consider myself to be a dermatologic surgeon, so I most enjoy procedures.. two days a week I do Mohs skin cancer surgery, which involved repairing skin cancer defects on the face with flaps and grafts - creativity is involved and this is very rewarding.  I also like to do some cosmetic surgery procedures such as liposuction, eye lifts, laser treatments...  
[Dr. Lee!! Love your videos. I have what I think is a pilar cyst. My derm says to remove it they have to shave the area on my scalp. Why is that?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d6iw?context=5)|Well, most docs will shave an area of the head.. in fact I will clip the hair short in an area of the scalp if I'm removing a skin cancer.  However, I don't do this when I remove pilar cysts.  It makes it a little more of a hassle but I think it's worth it to the patients.. no one wants a bald patch when they're trying to have a bump removed that they're already embarrassed about!  I've found it's not necessary to shave / clip and area but I can't speak for all physicians 
[What was your experience going through college/medical school? Did you have any doubts about becoming an MD?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45eg5f?context=5)|I didn't know what I wanted to do, it took me a couple years to get into med school ( I did the 5 year plan at ucla) and I was the kinda person who didn't go thru undergrad or med school with this drive towards a certain end goal.  I just went with the flow and enjoyed myself in med school.  But I studied or course when I had to.  I guess I got that drive when I actually became a dermatologist and realized I really liked what I do.
[How has the recent phenomenon of 'Pimple Popping' changed your life, career, or dermatology in general? Also  have you ever gotten pus into your mouth? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45d6m4?context=5)|Don't even SAY such a thing!  NEVER had pus.  In the mouth.  Never had and NEVER will!  I have been in practice for over 10 years and in the last year and a half I have done more blackhead extractions, cyst and lipoma removals than I have in my whole career times TEN. And now, I get recognized as DrPP in the real world, usually when I'm wearing mismatched pajamas to run errands with no makeup on, of course. But it's all in good fun! 
[Hi doc! I'm brazilian and in love with your work! I'm studying medicine and hope to become a dermatologist! I admire you for you're always so clean and correct in your procedures! Do you ever accepted interns for a few weeks? I'm a candidate! :D &lt;3.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45e2co?context=5)|I get requests often for people to shadow me, and unfortunately I can't accept the requests.  I don't want my patients to feel they are on display, and it can really slow me down at work.  I reserve shadowing positions for people who are already dermatology residents or applying to dermatology residency positions, but I really don't like to do it not because I don't want to, but it can really slow down my day.  So, I don't do it often.  Thank you for being such a wonderful fan!  Love you fans in Brazil!! 
[Hi Dr. Lee! Medical student here currently studying for Step 1. Any tips for avoiding burnout/going bonkers? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45essd?context=5)|Oh gosh, I don't know, we all have our own ways of dealing with stress.  But it is important to make sure you have an outlet so that you are not so consumed with all the stressful stuff.  You can do it, and i think this is part of your training.  As a physician you will have to deal with many stressful situations, and in fact, your current situation is helping you to learn how to do this! Take breaks then study hard!  Good luck!
[Can skin ointment and creams really go bad? do they become unhealthy or do they just not work as good anymore?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4nnjzy/iama_dermatologist_dr_sandra_lee_aka/d45dn7b?context=5)|Some ingredients can spoil but I think all products have to have an expiration date no matter what and this doesn't mean that the effectiveness expires.  If something has turned a different color or smells bad I would certainly throw it away.  If it has expired via date, there is more of a chance it has lost its effectiveness but this can't be proven.

I have quite some free time and wish to learn something. So far, I am proficient with python(+flask)and C++ so far. And know my way around Java.

4npmr9,2,2016-06-12,[First-Build] Portable 800 USD budget build after nearly 15 years of no gaming,CogInTheWheel,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/4npmr9/firstbuild_portable_800_usd_budget_build_after/,"###Build Help/Ready:

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

* Portable enough to put it in my carry-on bag since I am relatively sure I'll be moving around.
* Gaming on Windows 7 or 10.
* Good OpenGL support on Linux for Computer Graphics graduate coursework (minimum OpenGL 3.2 and GLSL 1.50)
* Software development on Linux maybe including running VMs.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

1080p smooth gaming on Windows 7 or 10 without stutters (30-60 FPS) at Ultra settings preferably, don't mind turning off a few options or turning down a bit. I haven't been keeping up with games for nearly the last 15 years. My most memorable games are DOOM 1993, Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, Max Payne 1 &amp; 2, NFS HP2, Red Alert 2, Commandos 2, Age of Empires series on PC; Shadow of Colossus, Okami, Burnout on PS2. Off the top of my head, I would like to play DOOM 2016 and GTA 5 for sure, and other recent good games. In fact, I am building this for the most part just because of DOOM.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

800-900 USD (as low as possible) from the money I'll be earning from my internship next semester. Don't want to spend much since I have to buy a car as well and save up for future semesters.

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

* Will be buying the parts and building in September 2016 when I get my first biweekly paycheck.
* Will most likely upgrade to AM4 socket and Zen CPUs in mid-end 2017, so I want to keep the CPU+Mobo+RAM combo as cheap and valuable as possible. I'm counting on Zen delivering, else I'll have to upgrade to i5 or i7.
* Ruled out AM3+ socket and the FX CPUs since there is no mini ITX board available.
* Ruled out G3258 since I read it causes stutters sometimes even though it outperforms X4 860K on average, and it's not overclockable on non-Z boards anymore. Ruled out G4400 since Intel blocked its overclocking capability.
* Really confused between the X4 860K and the i3-6100. As far as I have researched, the X4 860K overclocked to 4.3-4.4 GHz will be close to i3-6100? Is it worth spending the extra $60 on i3?? I really don't want to since I want to support AMD. If I go for the i3 config, I will definitely have to upgrade to i5 or i7.
* Parts other than the CPU+Mobo+RAM should be fairly future proof. Will upgrade GPU maybe 2 years later.
* Also contemplating buying the RX 480 instead of the R9 380, based on how the reviews turn out. What do you think?

Please give suggestions. Thanks in advance! This is my first reddit thread :)"

Finding a path.

---

Made a promise for new (or better) lifestyle, this includes getting a new job.

Tired of the job I got since starting college. $14 hourly as clerical support, no advancement besides a yearly dollar increase, only positive is getting the chance to study when there's nothing to do.

Wanted to practice interviewing, sent a resume to a job opening for a photographer. Had experience as an admin. assistant for an auto detail co. before, also had light experience in media work, adobe cc.

Got the interview, but was surprised I got hired. But field just didn't seem right for me, though it was something very new with actual opportunities. Just being part-time had its benefits, quite flexible hours, be around luxury cars and work at the rich part of the city. I even thought it had potential for making new connections, coworker was a filmmaker and I’ve imagined doing something similar. Downsides are having to drive the vehicles *in* tight parking spaces and booth, actual manual labor, outdoors in the heat and a wide range of difficult people to deal with (salesmen). 

And, zero room for error.... Happened to fancy with that error and crashed a luxury car into another of its own. A month later, I'm still harking about it. Really had a tough time, still dealing with a leg injury, was taking meds for my mental health, and insecurities bit me right back over there. I actually had little experience driving larger autos, but I picked up practicing only to forget to make it habitual. I was also brand new to a customer service oriented co. I didn’t have that much support or advice from anyone. Had another side-gig incase this one didn't work out. Also got courses which included mathematics, my kryptonite. You can imagine how literally packed my schedule was, and I screwed up with time mgmt. big time, but I remembered feeling miserable, and who wouldn't with this schedule? But I just wanted to start something new.... I got the photography part handled, though it was the easiest to learn. Supervisor was cool too. After that mistake, I didn't decide to come-in for judgment day, I was well overwhelmed with emotions of the incident, and stress. So they fired me, I also dropped the math course and things went stale.

I had this one chance to change everything for the better, and I was going to show my current co-workers that at last, I’m not only about to move-on but I’ve got a very cool gig you guys can only dream of! Not *sure* if any replacement can top this lucky strike. I *really-royally* did fuck it up, and just feels surreal right now. I dreamed driving nice cars, and showing off pictures of it in Facebook, and this actually had it come true, and I figured it would be a good excuse to get back into being social again especially with me old mates. But I seem to be anchoring this as a reason for ""what if”. What if I took a little bit more care of myself and my time during this stage of my life? What if I still had the job, would it have been enough to show friends, family and coworkers that I’ve still got the spark? 

I get worst when I see job postings incomparable to this experience. The worst feeling is that it felt like a lucky strike, and that I just put everyone down at that job. I wasted my supervisor’s time, he gave me his patience in introducing me to the company. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed that I’m probably the talk of the company for years to come. This is the worst feeling, and it’s just painful.

---

Realization.

---

That gig paid $15 an hour, but during the interview I opted for $14, making the excuse of being inexperienced. What shitty decisions I have made, now I know why people say to write a higher rate. 

My network is fundamentally dead, so I tell this story to everyone which makes me feel shittier. I'm now a bit motivated again to say the least, however, I'm finding myself getting angry at *people* like interviewers, because it feels like they're scamming millennials like me. I say I have a pretty solid employment history with the exception of this flub, I worked since getting out highschool, so why are they looking for an entry level internship of no-pay, BA degree, who must work at least 40 hours. I might be a little sarcastic, and I understand why companies are very picky, but this is just demoralizing. Things got even funnier because I slightly expressed anger during an interview, guy was asking for help in starting his new company from an intern. Sadly, I need pay in order to live, I can’t move in with any family, I’m on my own. Bachelor’s degree is a goal but that'll take 2-3 years. I’m still harking about this job loss, it felt like I was sniped from a far, my supervisor walked me in the conference room only to tell me that we’re letting you go.

Looking back maybe that job is actually just really horrible. I had a chat with someone who was a former employee there, his advice was to look for something better, though he was an employee a year ago and there were a lot of changes since then, so things might just be very different, he still said it was not a good place to be in, maybe he’s actually right. But I need to move on, I can feel and sense the seniorities at my current day job. If I do leave, I’m going to the down-times. The third gig I picked up as a backup plan is for a middle-class retiree wanting to start his business, I kept it because I want the entrepreneur “spirit”, I'm assisting for advertisements and online exposure, $16 an hour but in freelance, and a very far drive to his place up the hills. Only would get potentially paid for 100-200 a month. I’m ridiculous, since he's not getting new clients it's stifling. This would have been a pretty cool combo with the former gig, both had flexible hours so I can work with this one. I ask for advice, some say start a business but give me a break…. I really hate my brain for this, leaving a potentially good job by dreaming about entrepreneurship with this retiree. Now I'm having to pay with the embarrassing memory, the salesmen and former employees coming out and judging my mistake, it’s a scratch in my resume and I thought I was punctual at best. I’m still not sure why I didn’t take it seriously, it had cool cars, flexible hours and the only company in the city. I took it way worse than I expected, sometimes I couldn’t even sleep when I start thinking about it. Would it have been worth it if things turned out differently?

---

Half-time

---

What can be my path from this point on? I’ve got no degree, and zero connections. To think about it now I like administrative tasks, and I have a growing familiarity with info. tech (not the computer technical type) but these jobs require a BA in marketing. I’m trying to trade skills via craigslist but most ask expensive rates, for example, learning how manage social media—a manager asked for 200 per hour session. Should I just quit my current job, live on savings and then use that time to find a better job?

Edit: When I was looking for an internship this summer, there was very little offering for physic student but a lot more for elec/mech/computer engineering. I started learning C# and am planning to learn python as well this summer as it seems many employers are looking for that (C++ also). I was first thinking doing a master in computer science but I don't picture myself as a programmer."

Completed a year long internship where I developed a small web based application using apache tomcat, JSP, XML, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, JSON, RESTful Web Services, AJAX, JSON, Java, and wrote small batch files to run perl scripts and also used a PostgreSQL database extensively. I also did debugging using bugzilla and SVN. 

I was also told that a normal work week would consist of around 45 hours and training for this position would most likely run about four months.

So,  I recently graduated from a four year college and have gotten my first job offer. The issue is, is that I don't like the type of work I am doing for them, and it would seem that its the only work I will be doing for them. Which is, opening up the bug tracker finding bugs to fix, and then moving onto the next bug. 

The thing is, is that I have had an internship prior to graduating, and in this internship I was taught how to write code using Test Driven Development (TDD), agile/scrum, and unit testing, none of which I see at my current job.

I have been working for this company for two weeks, so perhaps I have judged them too soon, however, I am likely going to be seeking for new jobs soon.

What are your thoughts? I am debating on staying because being at a company for two weeks looks really bad, on any resume, however, I don't see myself only fixing bugs that are reported in the bug tracking system. Or, should I seek out new jobs.

Please let me know, Thanks!"

4nsivz,0,2016-06-12,Need a job? Stop wasting hours blindly submitting your resume to job boards and company websites. I'll show you a strategy that is 10x more effective and efficient.,adfjets,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4nsivz/need_a_job_stop_wasting_hours_blindly_submitting/,"Hey Reddit,

I'm frustrated with all of the posts about people mindlessly applying for jobs without success.

I'm frustrated because I used to be that person, and I know how painful it is. I spent literally hundreds of hours in college submitting my resume to job engines like indeed and monster only to get a response from maybe 1 in 50 companies. I went to a great school, had an extremely marketable degree (engineering), and had years of internships. No matter how hard I tried, it didn't seem to matter, and that made me depressed.

A few years ago, I decided to change my application approach, and it changed the direction of my career. Today, I help young graduates in engineering related fields land interviews with companies like Tesla Motors, Ford Motor Company, Mercedes Benz, Epic Systems, UPS, and many more. 

I run a website (www.resumechief.com) where I craft killer resumes and offer clients a job search strategy that saves them literally hundreds of hours in their job search. I know you all hate promotional material, so I'm just going to give you the strategy right here. 

Tired of submitting your resume to job posting after job posting with no success? Here's what you need to do:


1. Make a list of the top 10 companies you want to work for. If you can't come up with a list of 10, include several cities that you'd love to work in. If you have more specific criteria for your future company, such as company size, feel free to include it as well.

2. Instead of submitting your resume to company websites or to job boards, go to LinkedIn.com. Use the search function to filter for alumni of your school who work for company number one on your list. If you chose a city, or a company size, filter for these and look for alumni who work at the companies that match your criteria. Then, message one of them and tell him/her that you are a fellow student/graduate of XYZ school who is super interested in working for his company. Nicely ask if he would pass your resume on to a recruiter, or to someone in the department you want to work for. People LOVE helping others, especially people they feel connected to. Showing that you are a student or alumni from the same school as a person is one of the best ways to secure that feeling of connection. After you do this, continue down the list, and follow this strategy for all 10 of your companies. If you are ambitious, try messaging two or three alumni from each company. It can't hurt. When you submit your resume to engines like Indeed.com, or to company websites, you are competing with thousands of other people who are just as qualified as you. To make matters worse, you'll first need to pass through a non-human, automated system before your resume even lands in the hands of a recruiter. By connecting with alumni, and giving your resume to a person who matters within the company, you're giving yourself a significant advantage over everyone else.

3. That's it. This strategy seems incredibly simple, but so few people go out and actually do it. After giving a similar strategy to one of my first clients, Emily, she landed her dream job at a small start-up in Detroit. It's incredible what can happen when you get in contact with the right people.

This is a strategy I usually only offer to my paying clients, but today you get the abbreviated version for free.  Use this job search strategy to get your resume in the door of ANY company in the world. Happy job hunting.

Cheers

This fall, I will be interning at NASA johnson space center. The reason I am posting this is because last summer, I had an industry internship that I felt was extremely slow and (not to sound unthankful) boring. My manager did not have much work for me (despite asking for a second project), and the work involved running computer analyses that took several hours to run. My work day consisted of running an analysis and staring at the clock while sitting in my cubicle. It was soul-crushing as an engineering student. 

A lot of the defense contractors, and especially the government, are stereotyped for being too bureaucratic, slow, and covered with red tape. Also, I read an AMA of a student who interned for SpaceX-- his description sounded like an amazing experience. He was doing hands on work all the time, and was really being pushed. He was truly being worked. 

How is the work culture at NASA? Are interns kept busy? All I want is to do is work hard and have every work hour count. 

Also, if you have questions about applying to NASA, I can try to help. "

So I just finished my first year at college, and coming back has really made me think a lot about my personal identity and what it means to be ""me."" I suppose I should explain what I mean by that. I feel right now like I'm stuck between three different worlds, where I have my own different ways of processing and reacting to situations. 
* At home, I've been a military brat who moves every couple years. Unlike my siblings, I reacted to this by closing off and not really taking the opportunity to learning how to deal with people, making friends, or learning social norms. This, combined with the fact that I have a set technical skills and interests that nobody else in my home can really understand, makes me feel like I don't belong. 
* For the last several summers I have gone away to be summer staff at a Boy Scout summer camp. This was the first real experience I had where I could break away from literally everybody who thought they knew who I was and I could really start again knowing that it mattered that I got it right. I really enjoyed everything about that job, but the council lost the camp this year and I can't go back. I really consider the self improvement I made over the course of working there to be a huge part of who I am, but it's really frustrating because nobody seems to understand any of my experiences, especially at home.
* My first year at college was amazing. It allowed me to meet people with the same technical interests and gave me opportunities to really engage with my interests and explore what I thought about things without pressure from my parents to fit into my family's idea of what is normal. I was able to actually break away from having to go sit in church every week and actually identify as not being Catholic. So many different things like that allowed me to be comfortable with where I was, but now I'm back home for the summer, and it presents a problem.

I've come home for the summer, and for the first time have to stay home for the entire time. I can't practice who I think I am from all the time that I'm away because it doesn't fit with what the norm is in my house (one really good example would be how horrific an idea it would be to say I'm not Catholic to them).

I don't share with anybody, I have *zero* friends from high school, and while I've got a really amazing NASA internship for the summer, when I come home every day I just end up sitting at home alone on my computer with the lights turned off untill I go to bed and start over the next day. I know that I can function without any kind of support from other people, but after a couple of decades of that, I'm kind of getting tired of feeling like I'm not understood in my house, where I feel like people should understand me the most.

Honestly I think that just being able to see other people's perspectives on this would probably help, but if anybody has some advice, I'd sure appreciate it."

But I just want to give a bit of background before I get into my question. At my school, the Science National Honor Society and National Honor Society are both organizations that are mainly focused on community service. I applied and got into both during my Junior year. However, to remain in both for Senior year, you have to fulfill the club requirements by the deadline. However, due to a mixture of reasons which I will elaborate on, I was unable to meet them. 
    

One of the reasons why I couldn't was my inability to find tutoring hours although I am willing to admit that I might not have searched hard enough. Also, a lot of the reminders in terms of upcoming volunteering events was given out through notices sent out by text along with being placed on the website calendar. However, due to my family's financial situation, I do not have a phone plan so I couldn't receive the texts and I also did not find out about the website calendar until it was too late. Another large part of the reason why I couldn't fulfill the requirements was my focus on other extracurricular activities. Some of them include: engineering club, Science Olympiad, quiz team, Junior Science and Humanities Symposium, American Legion Oratorical Contest, school county business competition, doing research on making a VR application, applying for a research internship (I was accepted), using my business idea to start my own non-profit about educational technology, and other hobbies (such are writing). I guess that since I was really involved with these activities, SNHS and NHS just got placed on the backburner


Basically, my question is: will colleges know about my dismissal and will it negatively affect me during college admissions? Will my ECs be able to compensate for my dismissals?


Sorry about the length, but I'm just a bit anxious about the whole thing and I just want to make sure it won't hurt me. I have the ability to reapply to both next year but I've decided that I really don't want to since I want to focus on other things. In the whole scheme of things, I know it doesn't matter but I'm still a bit worried. Honestly, when I found out about my dismissal, it really disappointed me. I tried appealing, but it didn't work out. However, I've already accepted my dismissal from SNHS and the possible one from NHS and moved on. Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'm a student and I've been working part-time (~20 hrs / month) for a company for 1 year, working on the development of an IT-project (web application + another program to import data) for a non-technical company.

The project is quite complex, involves working and talking with several people from several companies, and I'm the only tech people on it.

The initial deadline was in January. Given certain circonstances, it was extended to May, then to end of June (my contract expired in late May)
I'll be honest: it will *not* be finished on time, at all, the main reasons being:

- I underestimated the amount of work needed to complete this project
- I didn't spend enough time working on it during the past year
- The project is not technically interesting and I have trouble motivating myself to efficiently work on it

Now, the company plans using the project quite soon and they don't intend to hire someone else to work on it anymore. I don't have much time left to work on it, because:

- I have exams coming up
- I will be mainly abroad in July
- I will start a full time 6 months internship in August

What should I do? 

I feel like crap because the job was quite well paid and the person who managed me really nice and understanding. I don't want to deliver something that is half done / buggy. I should also mention that the project I am working on *is* important for them.

The only thing I'm pretty sure I should do is to tell them they should hire someone else when I leave: in my opinion, an important IT project can *not* be just ""delivered"" without anyone working on it afterwards to provide support, enhancements, modifications, etc.

Thanks for your advice

4ny98d,5,2016-06-13,"Counter offer situation, advice?",Vampir1c,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4ny98d/counter_offer_situation_advice/,"Hey all, so recently I've been dealing with a personal situation. While I had planned to move by the end of the year, the news of my parents moving has kind of put me in a spot where I would feel it's better for everyone if I moved before they did (so they wouldn't have to worry about me and such).

 My dilemma is that I've been at a company officially as a paid intern for the past 3 years, but was promised a FT job when I finished school. I finished the past Dec, and spoke to my boss in April about starting, and said he'll get back to me with something in a few weeks. End of May I still haven't heard anything, and when I explained the parents moving situation, he said that because they recently merged with another company who will be handling their finances, there's a temporary freeze on big spending until the new company can organize everything, but will accelerate the process due to my situation. I was okay with being patient with this, but I've recently felt under valued when another intern (different position) came back from a month after graduation and started his full time contract last week. 

I had an interview today that went really well and basically unofficially confirmed that I'll be receiving an offer in a few days. Now I'm sure when I bring this up/hand in my notice, my current employer will counter (I'm their only IT specialist), and I'm not sure what to do. Everyone including my boss at my current job is awesome, and I'm extremely happy at the place and would love to stay there, but I'm still feeling a bit hurt over the delay for a FT contract. 

Should I just discuss this with him and bring up the current status of the contract again? Do I mention ""oh I saw X employee start, and wondering if everything has been cleared financially now?"" I don't want to just give my notice and leave as I really am happy at my current employer.

Thanks in advance guys.

Have a few Questions.,691337420,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4nylde/need_help_getting_started_in_the_field_have_a_few/,"As far as the only experience I have goes, I've recently passed the 800 series A+ exam and I have built my own computer but otherwise I have no real experience in the field.  I was curious about a few things though.

1.  I was thinking of pursuing a CCNA R&amp;S next.  However I've heard most people who obtain a CCNA off the bat in their career don't get to utilize the knowledge it provides as much as they accumulate experience and move up in their career.  Can anyone weigh the truth to this?  And furthermore are there any better certifications I can be getting to supplement the A+ right now?  I was thinking MCSA for windows 10 but that exam is still in beta and Windows Server 2016 but that still has yet to be fleshed out as well.

2.  Do local computer stores (smaller businesses in particular) generally offer apprenticeships of any sort?  There are a few stores I've found nearby and prefer trying my luck with them instead of a local call center, however I'm open to ideas if it means I get experience in the field.

3.  I've also noticed an internship posted from the IT department of a much larger company (simplot) and noticed it required me to currently be in college, which I am not.  If I were to meet every other requirement for the role, is it occasional that certain companies like HP, Simplot, and so on are lenient on current enrollment?  Or is this rule generally set in stone?"

I don't usually post, but I'm looking for a bit of guidance on careers and I'm not really sure what to do right now.

So I'm currently about 1.5 years away from completing a BS/MS accelerated degree in Computer Science. I've had work experience in this field, not going to mention where each place was, but I had a government internship previously and currently I'm working as software engineering for a  large company that put me in their government office. I noticed last semester I'm really starting to loathe programming and technical work, but I don't know what else to do. I'm mediocre at best in my opinion at coding, but I'm a straight-A student with a well written resume, project experience, and leadership experience. 

I'm having a really hard time coming to terms with the fact I don't care for technical work. I've seen for a while my interests fade away from critical thinking in general: I find no joy in problem solving, technical puzzles, and an early loss was any interest in strategy type games. I've stuck with this track because I'm currently on a full-ride for undergrad/half-price for graduate as I complete both in only 5 years and I've found I don't really enjoy the idea of making less than 70k starting. (I make a ~65k salary as an intern where I am now.) I'm starting to think I may need to give up the high salary for my mental health in a career though.

What my ideal career involves I believe is something where I will be able to speak frequently with new people and present ideas. I enjoy public speaking and presenting as well as technical writing like documentation or reports. I would love to be able to travel, but that's not required. I just don't want to sit any more days spending ~8 hours working on programs and being forced to quickly learn dozens of tools and implement ""high quality software"" with them. I would be more okay with this if it was more like a friend who works at an IT call center where he goofs off for hours a day and only does a 2-3 hours of real work a day when needed, but that's not this industry.

Any recommendations or suggestions of fields to look into or just advice in general how to deal with an internship where you can't stand your work or even just life advice on how to find what a career that doesn't make you insane would be awesome!

So I'm going to be a junior studying CS and I was studying at the university of Florida.

However, I find that people are having trouble understanding or are looking down on the fact I'm doing online like I'm lazy or something. 

I've already had two internships going into my 3rd year because of the flexibility of online and I guess I'm getting worried that applying for internships or even jobs long term that people will wonder how I was had time to do all of this and still graduate on time and then I have to explain the online thing. I mean, it's still a very real degree, but is it not viewed that way? Do I have explain myself or am I being paranoid?

4o0qt1,26,2016-06-14,AMA- My personal take on INSEAD as an American,mba_ama_insead,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/4o0qt1/ama_my_personal_take_on_insead_as_an_american/,"When applying to business school, I got accepted to a number of U.S. schools and INSEAD. The latter always fascinated me because of the travel aspect and the one-year opportunity cost of finishing your MBA in a year vs. two years. I ended up choosing INSEAD and now several months after graduating wanted to give an account of my experience and some advice for others possibly facing similar choice. 
First a bit more about my background, I was previously working in finance and had the opportunity to work in 4 countries outside of U.S. including long-term assignments, so I was pretty versed in traveling around Europe and Asia. Also my background and undergraduate degrees were in business &amp; economics from a top U.S. university. 
Let me start with the positives - the diversity, the international classroom, the opportunity to live in Singapore and France are unique. If you have lived in U.S. for majority of your life, this is definitely a worthy opportunity to explore the world. Almost every weekend there are trips being planned and in my first 5 months, I visited 11 countries which isn’t to be discounted as a life experience. Many of the professors are awesome and are comparable to U.S. top MBA schools. 
Now on the things I wish I had known ahead of time: 

•	The recruiting season for INSEAD (at least the July batch) completely misses all of the U.S. firms. If you are looking to work for a top American consulting firm, investment bank or even corporates, most firms do hiring in the fall while INSEAD’s recruiting season is in the spring. When applying to most firms the answer I got was “sorry out of cycle” or “we are full for U.S. for this cycle”. This is probably the key downside for Americans applying as INSEAD isn’t a target school for many Fortune 500’s looking to hire in U.S. primarily due to the off cycle schedule.

•	The classes are less intense and in many of the cases were an easier version of my undergraduate courses. While about half of the coursework especially on organizational behavior, entrepreneurship and the more difficult finance courses were very interesting. Overall the MBA courses were underwhelming. 

•	The career support is also lagging behind the top U.S. MBAs including holding employers accountable to interview date schedules &amp; responses. Through my campus recruiting, I have had several examples where the employer would email me the evening before to come in for an interview the following morning – thus on a few occasions I ended up interviewing with 4 different companies on the same day. The U.S. schools often have a schedule up front when the companies have to respond by on whether you receive the interview / second round / etc… but there is no such thing yet at INSEAD.

•	Difficult to change careers in one year without the internship. The consulting numbers (INSEAD feeds in most students into MBB firms) are rather inflated – there are many students who switch from firm to firm within consulting and many sponsored students to begin with. 

Overall I have mixed feelings about my experience and I might still make the same choice if I had a do-over but only time will tell. I now have a job that I am relatively happy with yet I still feel like I could have achieved it without my MBA. 

Don't get me wrong, whether I recommend it or not all depends on your goals. If you are looking to become an entrepreneur or have the opportunity to work outside of U.S., this is a great *if not the best) school.  If you are targeting U.S. for corporates/finance or consulting, well... weigh your personal pros and cons. 

Can gladly answer questions if anyone has specific questions!

So for background I was hired as a research intern, but I went to school for computers before switching to science.

The current way its done is the machine exports it in its own format, converted to .tsv, from .tsv imported into an excel macro, from the macro converted into another format before finally uploading it. 

She wanted a program that could take the data, clean it, format it correctly and put it in the final format to be uploaded. That sounds easy enough I thought, sure I'll do it. I go down to get the exact details and what the progam needs to do exactly, then the conversation went like this: M - Me LM - Lab Manager

&gt; M: Ok, well I can easily write this in any language. Java, C++, ect.

&gt; LM: Well if it's written in that, no one in the lab can support it. Can you write it as an excel macro?

&gt; M: ಠ_ಠ 

Still to this day she forces everyone in her lab, like 10-20 people, that run tons of samples everyday to still use the ancient way of getting data and uploading it. She didn't seem to understand that the reason the process had so many steps was because she was using an excel macro."

Hello everyone! I've mod for r/UCSC for a couple of months (this is my new account tho) and I just completed my first year as a UC Santa Cruz student. I love UC Santa Cruz so much and I am currently studying Computer Engineering, but have yet to finish up the qualifications. My back up plan is Cognitive Science. On the weekends I intern in San Mateo County for a really great company. 

So why am I thinking about transferring? During spring quarter, I was talking to a guy that I did not intend on meeting until the end of the quarter (this was around week 9 and 10). Anyways, it ended up that guy started stalking me, finding me in person, and then sexually assaulted me and is now under the investigation with Title IX. 

While I do have evidence of him coming unexpectedly and my word is against his, I do not feel comfortable on campus. He had called me that he lost his job due to the Title IX investigation. It was so serious that I asked for a no-contact directive (meaning that we cannot sit in the same libraries, buses, dining halls, etc without at least 50 ft of distance, no eye contact, no speaking on social media or with a third party). I did not take any finals this quarter because he assaulted me the weekend before finals and ended up failing all my classes (none of my teachers had allowed for incomplete) and am working to get withdrawals at the moment. If this investigation were to be extended or that Student Conduct does not believe that he stalked or assaulted me, he will continue to be on campus until I graduate. With his current academic plan, he will be here for the entirety of my undergrad. 

Some girls warned me after I decided to pursue an investigation that his personality is a bit weird and this isn't the first time girls have reported him for assault, but have yet to be found guilty for it. I am assuming that he's really good with speaking with authorities because this something normal to him. And he's also in a student leadership positon, so he knows exactly what to do in these situations. I feel hopeless that no is going to believe me, and I know it happened and I know what he did was wrong. And I've only told the truth with the investigators and I have evidence for that. 

I was accepted to Berkeley during my freshman year if that means anything, but I doubt it does. I was thinking about Berkeley because of my internship and I wanted to stay up in the Bay. I feel like I have better connections in Silicon Valley and really enjoy the networks I've made through organizations around the area. I do not want to compromise these connections I've made and I was hoping to move to another UC campus like Berkeley to make sure that I can still do the things while I was still at UC Santa Cruz. 

So how hard is it? Is it feasible? How should I go about applying? Will this hurt my reasons to be able to transfer? 

I'll probably speak to some advisors just to make sure, but any advice is helpful! Thank you! "

I've just finished my second year on an IT course at uni and we are supposed to use the (technically optional) gap year for searching for internships.

Thing is, I've been applying for sys admin and network tech type roles at places for months and getting nowhere, I'm assuming I'm getting my CV in at the wrong times and places or generally better people get them before me, but I digress.

There is an option to go straight into the final year but it is not something I would like to do, as I'd like some serious revision and hopefully experience before then, so my question to you lot is, would it be WISE to start up my own little project for offering domestic IT services for my local area (swish looking website, services such as repairs and upgrades to IT gear and the like) and using spare time and homelab to obtain a CCNA qualification and hopefully some Microsoft ones pertaining to windows server.

Come the time for applying for a graduate job, would this year gap on my CV doing this idea look good, like someone who took an initiative and ran with it, or would it just look like I was some scrub who couldn't get a placement so fucked about for a year? This is a question for all you recruiters out there.

Thanks in advance, I obviously haven't given up placement hunting yet, I have some applications I'm waiting to hear back from, but this is just something that's been playing at the back of my mind, don't be shy, if my idea sucks just tell me reasons why.

I started university in 2009. Right from the beginning I struggled with keeping up on my work, going to classes, and passing courses. Up until the end of last year, I only maintained my grades just high enough to avoid being suspended, and was on academic warning for 3 years.

Beginning in January of this year, I got my life back together, passed all of my courses, and have started to turn things around. I now have a summer paid internship in my field (computer science), and plans to return to school in the fall. I am 24 years old.

So my question, should I just skip going back to school to get my degree and just keep working? It would take me 2-3 years to complete my degree at this point. The company I work for has expressed interest in keeping me on board this fall (part time) and also hiring me as a full time employee when I graduate. I have also received offers from other companies in the area.

I'm a fairly good learner, and I've excelled thus far at solving the problems they've thrown at me. I could probably continue my education online in my spare time, minus the degree.

Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

TL;DR: 2-3 years left in school, already have a good job, should I just drop out?

EDIT: I should probably mention that money is not really an issue, university is not overwhelmingly expensive in my country."

I got my B.S. in CS back in 2013. No internships, no cs-related jobs while in school. This was because (unbeknownst to me at the time) I have ADHD and school was very stressful for me. Any summer breaks and free time that I should have spent getting experience, looking for work, and learning new things I instead spent dealing with my depression and trying not have panic attacks from the mountain of anxiety that got bigger and bigger as I went through school. 

After I graduated and things didn't get better I started trying to find out what was going on and eventually figured out I wasn't just an idiot that couldn't handle school and saw a dr. However, all that stress had become associated with programming and after I graduated I couldn't stomach the thought of dealing with that anymore, so I haven't done any programming in 3 years. 

I want to change that. I need to get my life back in order.

I'm looking for advice on what languages/areas of focus I should put my energy into reviewing/learning, or what some good projects are that I can do by myself that will look good to employers and help me get back in the saddle. I did most of my college work in Java &amp; C++. I've had a little experience with a handful of other languages but nothing major (Smalltalk, SQL mostly, plus a little Prolog &amp; Scheme). I understand there are many different areas of focus and it depends on what type of developer I want to be... but I don't really know at this point in time.  Right now my main focus is to get a job as soon as possible.

On Monday I got an e-mail reply asking for an online Hangouts interview for a position as a virtual data entry position that worked at home. I looked at the e-mail I noticed some spelling errors this got me suspicious. But didn't think it was a big deal. I went through with the interview making sure I didn't give out any crucial information such as SSN. The interview was done through messages on Hangouts. I only gave the recruiting officer my name and address but that was already on my resume. I answered a couple of questions. And the officer said I was hired and paid $35.00 an hour. This got me so suspicious $35.00 an hour that's crazy for an beginning internship. Then he sent a list of programs that I needed to purchase but he will send me a check via mail so I can purchase the products. He said to purchase it after I get the check. He also asked what bank provider I have. I replied to him ""Chase"" I didn't give him my bank number or anything. And he that training and orientation started tomorrow, not in-person interview or anything.

Then later today I got another e-mail for another online internship. It was the same e-mail I got before but with a different company name and a different recruitment officer. The same typos even occurred. This further confirms that these internships are fake. I am not sure what to do now. They have some of my personal information such as name, phone and address. What should I do? I was supposed to report online tomorrow morning. Should I just ignore and block him? Thanks for everyone that replies.

I have been working for roughly 5 weeks at a tech company as a software dev intern. I spend most of my time writing testing codes and run the codes to test the stability of existing projects. Since my CS background is not strong, I spent most of my time debugging or asking other senior developers for help. It is not unusual to have a day when I spent half of it debugging or trying to configure the IDE so that the it would not throw me an error. I talked about this with other experienced interns or developers, and they told me my situation is very ordinary, especially to a novice like me. But I still hope to improve my work efficiency. I wonder if there is anything I could do to improve myself? I tried watching tutorials at the same time, but I have not found it very helpful because few of them were related to the actual work I am doing.

Also, I've noticed that I have a very bad habit, which is I often check my phones or text my friends during the work. I think the reason is that my office is quite relaxing, and I am a bit too relaxed. It is hard for me to stay very focused for a long time under such a relaxing environment.

I got an offer for 900 per month internship in SF a week ago by an early stage startup for front-end work. I'm interested in working for them, but I'm wondering if I should ask for more or not.

Points to consider:

- The start up is very early stage (&lt;40 employees, &lt;4 million funds raised)
- My main experience is Python backend, so this is a new field for me.
- This is my first internship

In this case, I'm not confident that I have enough skill to justify my increase in pay except that fact that it is below minimum wage (12.25 in SF). As this is my first one, I'm not expecting more than $13/hr rate. I'm thankful that they offered me a position after what seemed like a barely-pass-interview. Does it make sense for me to ask for ~1.2k with my limited experience?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: I applied initially for back-end role, but I have a feeling front-end position as a mercy offer. Would this play a role in this negotiation?"

The manager for the network abruptly quit yesterday, no notice, for some unspecified reason. All managers called in to a meeting with the VP. 

&gt;VP: So... guys, we have a problem. Networks is in shambles, the employees need someone to step in and help out. Any takers?

Nobody puts their hands up. Nobody says a word. I look at the VP, he locks eyes with me. I put up my hand.

&gt;VP: Oh, Kaz? How's the development branch going anyways?

&gt;Me: As I reported in my latest email sir, we're on track to be out of testing and into launch by the 20th. My employees can handle that mostly and my office days are pretty unoccupied. I'd be GLAD to step in to the network office. 

&gt;VP: But don't you not have a degree or certification in network administration? 

&gt;Me: No sir, but as you can clearly see by my handling of my department, I'm an effective leader, and I have experience with networking, enough to keep it straight until you hire someone. 

&gt;VP: Okay, can you head over now and get started then?

I leave the office. Email Alexandra and Khalid, my two right hand interns, to let them know I'm on-call from this point onward - they're in charge unless they need me for something.

Get to the NOC:

&gt;Me: Hey guys, its Kaz from Development. I am stepping in until they hire someone new. 

The senior Tier 2 network tech introduces himself:

&gt;Hey Kaz, I'm Roberto. Our boss couldn't have picked a worse time to bail. We need to finish migration of the 5 last systems out of the old server room and into the new one. 

&gt;Me: Okay, and what are those services?

&gt;Roberto: Exchange, Sharepoint,  backup for SQL, backup for user profiles, and the auxillary domain controller. We need to file work windows but we're out of time. What should we do?

&gt;Me: I've got an idea.

Broadcast an email out to all departments. 

&gt; ""The Exchange server requires an emergency security upgrade - and will be going down in 15 mins for update. Timeframe is expected to be no more than an hour - but do not call or file tickets in Footprints."" was the gist of the email.  

I call the VP:

&gt;Me: Hey VP, we've got to change the passwords and security keys attached to Exchange. We may have been compromised. We'll get the system back online ASAP and investigate. 

&gt;VP: Alright, I'll cover for you. Take as long as you need. 

Me and Roberto tear into the spaghetti and pull the server out. Carry it quickly to the next room, setup the new router it connects into and ensure it will get the same IP. 

Manage to get it done within 45 mins - less than a half an hour of downtime. One down, 4 to go. Get back to the desk, get a call at the desk.

&gt;Me: Hello, Networks this is Kaz.

&gt;SalesRep: WHY IS THE EMAIL DOWN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK DAY?

&gt;Me: Did you get the memo?

&gt;SalesRep: WELL, NOW I DID YOU JERK!

&gt;Me: Its back up now, so no matter. It HAD to be done. Sorry about it. -CLICK-

Backups next. 

&gt;Me: Roberto, is the backup schedule clear for the next 2 hours? Is the auxillary domain controller in use?

&gt;Roberto: All clear sir. Are you ready?

&gt;Me: Roll up your sleeves. Lets get to work. 

Move all the backup servers out on a cart to the new room. 

Now the tricky one. Sharepoint. 

Broadcast to support:

&gt;Guys, do us a favor and disconnect your phones until we give the all clear. It'll save your ears. 

They wisely did so, and I had Networks do it in kind. 

Shut down Sharepoint server, disconnect it and the two iSCSI arrays. Wheel it out. People are already banging on the NOC and its been less than 20 mins. Quickly plug it in, get the network in there setup. Less than 30 mins, everything was nice, neat and the old server room, old routers and old cables were ready for clean up. 

I unlocked the NOC door and greeted the 5 or so people standing irate.

&gt;Me: Yes? 

&gt;Crowd: SHAREPOINT IS DOWN.

&gt;Me: We knew it was down without you banging down our door. Our phone server went down too. We've had a tumultuous day. Sorry for the downtime. 

&gt;Crowd: BUT BUT MUH DEADLINES! YOU NEED TO SEE OUR MANAGERS!

&gt;Me: Well, you knew about those weeks in advance. Not my problem. You are responsible. Not me. Less than 30 mins of downtime to fix a critical problem and you're treating me like hell? Tell your managers you didn't manage your time properly. 

Shuts door. Gives all clear. Sweep up dusty old server room and get Roberto to finish clean up. 

Look at inbox. 242 emails. About downtime. 124 tickets. And we still got 40 calls bitching about it between us and tech support. 

Look, I get what I did was unorthodox, probably pretty painful - but it had to be done. And this department I'm responsible for now, along with my other team I have to worry about, I am not going to sugarcoat it. People should take their ""Muh deadlines"" excuse and shove it. If you know 2 weeks in advance you need to do something, don't wait til the last minute to finish it. Have it finished 48 hours before with multiple backups. "

But I'm having a lot of trouble translating this to more advanced projects that are actually useful in the real world. As part of my internship this summer I have to work with a python/pygame script written by the intern before me, and trying to sort of learn as I go has had mixed results. Every time I try to figure out how to do something I don't know how to do, the answer usually involves like 5 other things I don't know. I keep running into all this stuff that requires using terminal/cmd, and terms unfamiliar to me like ""bash"", ""directory"", ""path"", ""PYTHONPATH"", ""module"", etc. and I find myself getting more and more confused.

I'd love to have some sort of book that gives like a general overview of all this stuff, so I can establish a base of knowledge before tackling these issues.

After much trouble, I have finally gotten pygame installed and ""working"" (i.e. it at least imports without error) and figured out how to run the script from Terminal, using the correct command line arguments, and so on. 

But when I run the script, the pygame window opens for a split-second before crashing. 

If it matters I'm using OS X, Python 2.7.11 32bit, and the corresponding version of pygame.

I doubt this is a problem with the code because I know the previous intern has run it successfully in the past, and I didn't change it at all, and the game is very basic so I highly doubt it's crashing because my system can't handle it.

I know I have the correct version of pygame installed, and I just did the basic install of the download from pygame.org so I don't see how I could have fucked that up, but who knows. Originally, I had 64bit Python 2 installed so I tried using Python3 and installing pygame using homebrew and a bunch of other command line nonsense I barely understood so that I wouldn't have to uninstall 64bit Python 2, but that ended up not working so I settled on replacing 64bit Python 2 with the 32bit version and then installing the corresponding version of pygame. I tried uninstalling the other stuff after, but I honestly don't even know how to fully uninstall ""normal"" programs on OS X (why the hell is there not just an ""Uninstall Application"" tool like there is on Windows?) nevermind shit installed through command line that is almost impossible to even find on my machine, so there could be something still there that's fucking pygame up.

I also get two warnings in Terminal when I run the script about how I'm using the ""deprecated Carbon Component Manager for hosting Audio Units"" and ""NSQuickDrawView, which has been deprecated"" and saying I should instead use the ""API's in AudioComponent.h"" and ""Quartz"", respectively. I have no idea what any of those things are, but they could easily be the problem as well."

I'm currently rewriting a website that is currently in pure PHP, as the needs have changed since the start of the project.

I've started with the RESTful API, written in Go. No problem on this point, I am experimented with the language and the development is going smoothly.

Where I am struggling, though, is with the client side, and more specifically the routing of my application. I tried to do something with AngularJS, but that gives me many problems:

* The website must have a social-rich experience, and many social crawlers don't interpret Javascript. This problem could be fixed with server-side rendering with a tool like PhantomJS.
* The website must have simple and readable URLs, that can be linked from anywhere. This can be dealed with by using a JavaScript router and the HTML5 History API.
* The project must be correctly architectured as other developers (and even interns) will potentially work on this codebase. This can be fixed only partially (as this solution leaves out the ""lazy-loading"" approach of a server-side logic) with a Grunt task merging each JavaScript controller into a enormous file.

Soooo, I have fixed all my problems but some of the solutions definitely look a bit hacky. So that made me think, and I don't think that the SPA approach of modern JavaScript frameworks is really adapted for this particular project.

So then I thought of adding a new layer to my stack for routing and a few other minor things (loading OpenGraph metadata from the database, for example), so instead of doing something like this:

&gt; JavaScript Client -&gt; Go RESTful API -&gt; MySQL Database

I would do something like this:

&gt; (PHP?) Router, server-side -&gt; JavaScript Client -&gt; Go RESTful API -&gt; MySQL Database

So, is this a viable solution? Wont adding so many layers hurt performance? If not, is there any PHP and JavaScript libraries that are suitable to this kind of usage? I thought of going with Slim Framework 3 (I used Slim 2 a few years ago and it was a quite pleasing experience) and simple jQuery on the front, or maybe AngularJS."

Because of my love for Physics there are certain maths courses I need to take to self teach particle and quantum theory that a joint CS course wouldn't allow me to do. So I'm going to do a straight maths degree with the explicit intent of working in Software development. I need holes poked in my plan.

This summer I am reading Linear algebra and Real analysis books as prep for next year. However, I am also working through a book on Data Structures and Algorithmic Analysis (by Jul 20 happy birthday to me :/ ), a book on UML (general) and then the UML for Java book (by august 20). Then I'm reading a book on Game dev and software while finishing the Java language book I didn't get a chance to finish last Summer. 

Because of my prereading for maths, the first month of Algebra and Real analysis will be a breeze allowing me to focus on building a Java game (something dumb and easy but broadcasting knowledge). The rest of my second year CS study will be spent increasing my Java knowledge before my Second Year summer internship.

In second year summer I plan to Learn DBMA and SQL, while transitioning from Java to C++ (**I need to know if this is smart, worth it, and what industries prefer either OOP lang**) while bumming some sweet, sweet Classical Mechanics. 

Third year: Unkown; I don't know what do learn during third year. If I start learning C++, that would be good to keep going but if not, what other stuff should I learn? By this point I'll be proficient with Algorithms, UML and general good SD practice, and Java.

So, I've been studying Management Information Systems after switching out of Computer Engineering, and come this winter, I plan on graduating with a BS in MIS, with certificates in Systems Development and Data Management as well as a math minor. During this time, I've been employed as an IT intern for just over 3 years at my company, but my responsibilities have been relatively basic and at times, leaves me feeling that I don't really have many well developed skills outside of what I use in my classes and work.

The skills and experience I do have doesn't seem to me like it would particularly stand out, but it includes a good amount of experience building ad hoc excel reports from scratch using data on our systems ODBC server for customers, using MS project and MS Access to schedule and create a database system for a capstone course, 2 semesters in java, some self-learned SQL and VBA knowledge - basically some experience in several areas but not proficient in any.  

So, since I'm gonna be graduating in the next 6 months or so, I've been getting ready to freshen up my resume and to start looking for work in either my home city or (more preferably) in the city where my SO lives. However, I'm not really sure which avenues I will be able/want to go down career-wise. 

I'm currently finishing up some summer classes by the end of the month, and until late August, will have some extra time on my hands that I would like to use to build skills that both look good to potential employers and that will be practical and useful down the line in my career.

So my question is, what types of jobs would be good to seek out as an MIS major/Math minor with Data Mgmt and Sys Dev certificates (not certifications), and what are some accompanying skills that go hand in hand with these that I could work on building? 

I'm also really interested in hearing from other recent MIS grads and what they were able to find with the skills they had, and what kind of starting pay they were able to get.

Thanks!"

I'm a third year EE student who's current career goal is to get into CPU/chip/digital (or maybe analog) design. This is a bit broad, but generally, my interests are in computer architecture, EM, and semiconductors. I also enjoy C/assembly programming (but not algorithmic, CS-like programming). Ultimately, my hope is to enter the hardware design field.

I potentially have some competing internship offers at a large bay-area company. The first is an embedded software role dealing with device drivers and writing functional tests for SoCs that this company makes. This requires C programming knowledge and understanding of computer architecture. The second potential offer is for a hardware verification role in a separate team that writes HDL test benches and other verification-related work.

The difficulty in my decision is that the first potential offer involves me working closer to chips (SoCs) and involves comp. arch. and low-level programming knowledge, which I enjoy. On the other hand, it's embedded software, which isn't the career I'd ultimately want. As for the second potential offer, it's more closely related to hardware work since it involves HDL and digital design practices, but it is mostly verification and doesn't seem to be as close to the chip as the first one.

Could anyone here provide some suggestions on which would be a better for my general interests? Would having an embedded software role related to SoCs pigeonhole me into software-related work only?

as the title says, I wrote a little script in Python that does something useful for me.
It gets data from Excel-files, does some calculations and plots the results. At the end it writes everything to a new Excel file. It was the very first script I wrote on my own and which I realy could use at my current internship.

I can imagine that this is as far away from actual software development as possible. I am aware that a job in CS is a lot more than that.
But just the process of learning about the required libraries (something new), writing something that doesn't work (being frustrated) and then fixing it on my own(and with Google) was such a satisfying experience! I created something from almost nothing and it helps me, awesome!
I thought it would be amazing to get paid for having such a feeling.

So now I am looking for advice from people who know it better than me. Is changing career plans based on such an experience a childish idea or something you could relate to?
My background should be mentioned:

I am 24 years old and will finish my masters degree in Lasers and Photonics within the next year. I did my B.Sc. in mechanical engineering. So I have a technical education.
Currently I am doing an internship in a company related to Optoelectronics. I planned to to something with lasers in my future job (which won't be in said company, as it is an temporary internship in another country. I originally live in Germany).

I just now started thinking about the options I have to get a job in software development.
I am pretty unexperienced in Computer Science. I did and still do online tutorials in Python and I enjoy it very much.
There is something called the Odin Project which is a web development online course aiming to get you employable - that attracted me even more to the idea of changing career directions.

Should try to do an additional Master Degree in Computer Science?
Or should I keep my original plans and carry on developping my programming skills in my spare time - maybe for a job after my first job?
Or is it smarter to stick to my major and hope/look for jobs in this field where I could possibly learn more programming?

Or am I just high from my very small success in code writing? Would working as a software / web developer be something completely different than this little success story?

We sell hair products, wigs, braiding hair, hair accessories, etc.  All that good stuff.  I only work at this place during the summer because I am normally at university.
When I first started working, I admit, I didn't really know what to do.  My boss doesn't speak english well and it was hard for me to follow his instructions initially, and when I asked him questions he only seemed annoyed.  During my training period, my coworker (who I knew before working there, but had been working there much longer) would tell me about my bosses snide comments.  He'd ask her if I was stupid and all that.  I knew he was an ass (from the stories I heard) so I sort of brushed it off.

Sometimes during work he'd pull me aside to give me long lectures for no reason.  He tells me that I should be glad that he hired me because I'm black and fat, and that he was surprised to find 'a black girl that actually cares about her future'.  He tells me that I need to look nicer so that more people come into the store, but when I do dress nicely, he asks me why I am trying so hard.  He also finds ways to scold me even when it's not about work.  He likes to ask about my personal life and I try to keep the answers very minimum, but I once told him I had a summer internship making a video game.  Although I told him it was just a one time thing, he twisted it around on me, saying that they didn't hire me full time because I must not be any good.

He also is mean to customers.  I find myself apologizing to them, though sometimes they let their anger out on me as well.  He says that it's a fact that black people are thieves and that we are always trying to steal something.  He'll be rude to customers for no reason, and they get really confused and shout at him back.

He also tells me way too much about his personal life and degrades his wife (right in front of her, to me).  He tells me how he married just to get it over with, though he still 'somehow managed to marry the ugliest woman in all Korea'.  One day she came in for something and it was the first time I actually saw her in person, and he asks me, 'She's ugly, right?'.  It really put me on the spot and she already looked upset and left in a hurry.
He tells my ex-coworker, who is Christian, about how stupid her religion is and that it doesn't make sense.  She's very devoted to her faith and sort of argues back to him, but he's the type to always want to get in the last word, so it really hurts her feelings.

He's also said degrading things to men who try on wigs.  There are times that teenagers come in to try on the wigs just to mess around (who end up messing them up), but there are men who try them on seriously as well.  I literally do not care who is trying on the wigs as long as they follow the rules for trying on the wigs (I also know people who do drag who come in frequently).

I can't quit because I need the money.  I've looked for other places to work without much luck.  He's very nice to me sometimes, but all the rest of the times he's just a complete assssssssssss."

On the GPA: I could go back to school for a certificate or MA to boost my GPA, but I have no idea how to go about doing this. Any advice on this front would be really helpful.

Going back for a masters could also help with LoRs as well, but I also may be able to get some from my current and former coworkers and supervisors. Somehow I doubt this would be adequate though.

* Graduated from a fairly prestigious school with a dual degree in Computer Science and Cognitive Science. I plan to study similar things for my PhD.
* Worked as a Software Engineer for about 3 years after graduating.
* Very little relevant research experience
  * Had an internship at a software company that also did some cogsci research
  * Worked as a programmer for a research project at my school in Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering over one summer. (it wasn't really a research position, more of a programming job. I was writing a web app)

UPDATE: To anyone who commented, thank you. This post didn't receive a lot of traffic but I appreciate the feedback I received.

I will continue to work where I am working, and apply and interview until I get a much better job. After talking through it with my Mom I realized that I wasn't confident in myself and didn't think I would get the job, so my anxiety about this came out in my interview. She told me to believe in myself and that I didn't graduate college for nothing. I do think that I can do way better than where I am working now, since what I'm doing now is similar to other jobs I had done before I graduated. I shouldn't settle for less and sell myself short, and need to think about my future and growing my resume.

So I just graduated college, I now have a four year degree from a really great school in my area. The whole time I'd been working while going to school at night. 
I have worked retail for about three years,  two internships that have both lasted about five months, and worked a full time job as a receptionist for one year. I got let go of that job for performance, which is fine because I hated working there and it stressed me out because of the drama and I was still going to school at the time. After that I got the second internship and then a contract position that lasted five months as well. 

I have been unemployed since May and have been using the services of yet another contracting firm And have gone on several interviews. Also, I applied to a position in a very notable company, and got the interview and actually went on the first interview today. I went on an interview yesterday and got offered the position immediately. They said they would wait if the other job made a decision on whether to hire me since it is a bigger and better company, and that if it didn't work out I get the job. The interview that I was at today with the better company made me very uncomfortable and I don't even know if They want me on for the second interview.

So I'm guaranteed one position, and I'm waiting to hear back from another but it isn't guaranteed…

My mom is a tiger mom in the sense that she's always telling me to apply to these companies and positions that I know I'm not eligible for. I know she wants the best for me, but she doesn't seem to understand that I can't afford to be waiting around for a job, I need one now, I pay for my own bills and I'm helping my boyfriend with our rent , I moved in with him three months ago.

For that reason I accepted the job that offered me the position, because they are 10 minutes away from my house, and the pay is decent but not great.  However it's enough for me to get by.

She says that if I go from front desk position to front desk position it looks worse than if I were to get the job at the better company. The problem is I don't even know if I'm getting that job. I would rather stay at the company that I was accepted to, stay there for a couple years and then apply to a nice big company where I at least have the stability of a job there in case I get rejected. I'm thinking about survival, not reputation.

This is also the first permanent position I have been offered in a while. I've been pretty much working internships and contract jobs since about a year ago. I've worked a lot of HR and I know that people like to see stability on a resume. 

I'm only 24 and I feel like I do have time to grow my career but right now I'm just trying to pay my bills and figure out how I'm going to pay off my school loans. I get occasional help from my dad and my mom too. 

Should I have accepted the position with the lesser company? I haven't heard back from the bigger company yet and it's been a month since I've had a job. I start the new job tomorrow I'm actually excited. I understand what my mom's trying to say, but is she right about my work  history so far? She said she is thinking long-term but I am thinking about survival right now.

Tldr: my mom wants me to apply and get jobs at big companies, when I don't feel like I have the experience to even get those kinds of jobs. I've been offered a position at a company that's not super well known but it will pay the bills. I'm questioning if I made the right decision."

I just graduated college in May and am currently unemployed.

I've applied to almost 60 jobs so far and have gotten a few rejection emails but mostly radio silence. I have yet to even land an interview. 

I try to apply to at least a couple jobs every day and write a cover letter tailored to each job description. I've had my resume reviewed by my school's career advisors and was told that it looked great. I have created a website to show off the different projects that I've worked on as a student.

My experience: I have had one art internship during the semester between my sophomore and junior year. My thesis however was a 16 month long project creating my own animated short film, and said film has gone on to be accepted into several exhibitions and film festivals and has won a few awards already and is in the running for several more.

I know that I'm a talented artist and a fast learner and believe that I could do any job I've applied for if I got the chance. I'm trying to keep my head up and hope every day will be the day that I finally get invited to an interview, but I can feel myself giving into despair that I'm just doing something fundamentally wrong and can't see it. I am currently living at home as I continue my job search and am planning on taking on some freelance work to build up a little money, but as of right now I just don't have the funds to move to a city with a bigger creative industry presence and I don't have any connections within the industry.

Now that the kids have grown up, she is trying to get back to work for the last 6 months but without any success. She basically has experience in C, Ada and software testing. Initially, she was getting calls from recruiters but could not make any progress because of the 5 year break. Now the calls have pretty much dried up. Since she doesnt want to travel out of town, her options seem to be pretty limited.

She researched on taking web designing courses in local community colleges but feels they are very basic and not enough to get a job.

She is ready to study courses locally or online but doesn’t know what to take. She has good analytical skills and is good at coding.

For the past several years I've worked as an intern with a machine learning research group that consists mainly of CS PhDs with backgrounds in math/CS/physics/EE. I liked the work, the people, and the environment. They would employ me after I finish my studies, even if I don't decide to pursue PhD right away.

However, this is a government research institution and the salaries are very meager. I will be needing money now to move into a decent apartment and would also like to start to save some money. I have two competing offers from industry, and I am seriously considering one of them. The company employs around 30 engineers with backgrounds in CS and physics (plus a few mathematicians) and works on interesting problems.

What alarms me is lack of code reviews and seemingly poor testing practices, as well as working hours: there is no schedule, and they don't log in and out of work, relying on the integrity of their employees, but that also means that overtime isn't paid (and this scares me). They explained that sure, sometimes, especially when there's a delivery, people put in extra hours, but this is compensated because they leave earlier at other times, so it is all supposed to average out.

The salary is better than the one I'd be getting in academia, and they said there's increases soon after one starts being truly useful (the number cited is 150% of what I'd be getting at the other job).

Since whatever I decide to accept will be my first ""true"" job, I'm not so much concerned with the salary as I'm with what I'll learn on the job. I have very strong background in ML and theoretical CS, but I'm weak in classical software engineering topics (design patterns, testing practices, code reviews, continuous integration etc. etc.; I'm also a bit rusty in networking :-).

That was until today, when the same problem reared its ugly head yet again. It turns off abruptly yet again when tilted, and still works fine on AC power. 

I would insanely appreciate any help with this, as not only is this problem screwing me up on a daily basis, but i'm expected to start my internship in the coming weeks, and it'd be potentially disastrous if i can't fix this by then. 


There is another problem that may or may not be related to this. For the sake of brevity and to avoid confusion, I dedicated a whole other post to it, and will link it as soon as it is up.


Additional information: 

* The battery itself is completely healthy, no problems with voltages or anything
* Laptop isn't overheating when it shuts down
* On an Acer online support forum, [\(link\)](http://community.acer.com/t5/S-and-R-Series-Laptops/Acer-Aspire-R7-Randomly-Shuts-Itself-Off-A-Power-Shortage-Issue/td-p/130757)
, it was suggested that it was an issue with the screws on the back not being tight enough. I think that's not an issue though, because it's hardly been a week since i got my back cover changed
* Battery is non-removable
* Before the cover was replaced, I took the laptop apart myself and didn't discover anything out of the ordinary as far as i could see.
* The other problem i mentioned started happening exclusively after i upgraded to Windows 10, so that might be a thing to consider  
* I updated the BIOS and reset it to defaults, didn't help
* All drivers are up to date according to Device Manager
* I can twist and turn the laptop to my heart's content when it's connected to the charger and there's no problem, which might mean there's no problems with the HDD casing or anything.
* Virus scans and MBAM don't give any red flags.

4oeqbq,21,2016-06-16,Doubting my interest in Data Science,noinoeso,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/4oeqbq/doubting_my_interest_in_data_science/,"Hello data scientists of the world! 

Currently I am facing a though choice of what I want to do with my computer science career. I am one year away from graduation, and was seeing data science as an interesting option. After taking an artificial intelligence class, I got really interested in using algorithms to solve complex problems, and became attracted to the idea of getting into machine learning and data science. A new data science class was offered in my university, so I enrolled immediately.

This wasn't a good choice. The class terribly put together, and taught us almost nothing for 4 months (only basic statistics, like mode and median, and simple web scrapping and data visualization). The course definitely was not a good way to know if I like the field, but the few interactions with statistics felt kind of boring to me. 

Now I am in an internship at a big company, and by the hand of destiny, I was placed inside a data science team. The team is composed of computer scientists, statisticians and mathematicians, almost all of them with PhDs. The work here is focused on finding patterns in the usage data of the different products of the company. At first, the idea seemed amazing to me: being surrounded by very intelligent people that can teach me a lot of new things. However, I have been feeling very on and off while working here. My project is very open ended, and I lack most of the statistics and machine learning background required to take an initiative to do something useful with the data (my university mostly teaches software engineering and development). I have been working based on my problem solving skills, intuition and understanding of the real world problem, but have barely programmed in the 4 weeks I've been here (only a couple of queries to filter the data).

My mentor is very happy with my work. Even though I don't know much, I have drawn conclusions on what I have been seeing in the data, and documented my use of the newly setup Spark cluster, for other employees to ramp up quicker on its use. What has been complicated for me is that most of the time I feel very unproductive and lost, just staring at my screen thinking of what could I do with the data. There is a lot of learning opportunities available to me, but I feel that my lack of background hinders my ability to understand some of the stuff I have learned here. And I definitely miss programming, and seeing the results of my code come to life. Maybe I have approached the field in the wrong way, but right know I am feeling this is not my cup of tea. I still feel very interested on machine learning and artificial intelligence, but these kind of open ended, statistic projects have been feeling unfulfilling to me.

What do you think? Do I need to approach this way of working in a different way? Are all data science projects open ended, or are there other ways of working with data and machine learning?

It seems 901 and 902 are just a bit more difficult if I'm not mistaken. Also is it 200$ for each exam (901 &amp; 902) so 400$ total or $200 for both exams.

4of2k5,1,2016-06-16,Planning on leaving college to pay off loans. Smart choice or worse decision ever? Input welcomed,kungfunub,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4of2k5/planning_on_leaving_college_to_pay_off_loans/,"Greetings reddit. first off I don't make many posts on reddit so I apologize if I'm doing something taboo. 

So I'm 21 and enrolled at a major university with about one year left to my degree in Computer Science. Sounds good except I have two major things CONSTANTLY on my mind. 

1)  Paying for this college requires a lot of loans. To the point where I had to take out some private loans which are CONSTANTLY stressing me out. More so than ANY coursework. Also I don't really have money to be taking many extra classes so if something happens (I.e. I have a bad semester, sheet happens and fail things) I'm SOL. 

2) I have a part time job as a web developer (for the school) and... don't tell my boss but I absolutely despise it! I hate staring at a computer screens all day every day! I feel so dehumanized! (no offense to all the SE's and Developers out there). This really has me worried for my future since... staring at computer screens is in theory going to be my life. I went in to computer science because I liked problem solving (and making video games) but now I just don't see it as fun anymore. 

My plan: I can use my money saved up for next year and completely eliminate my private loans (and some public). That will seriously make me feel so much more confident in myself. meanwhile I'm attempting to find some freelance web dev. job that wouldn't mind hiring me. Or maybe find an internship? I don't need some 6-digit bay area job, just something that can pay the bills and afford snowboarding a few times a year, and maybe a dog. I don't want much. Meanwhile I'll save enough money to go back to college without too many loans. Problem is I'm not sure how long that will take. 

Lastly: before you write your post saying ""Finish up your degree you whining, ungrateful millennial"" please please please consider this; 
I know I know I know I have a good thing going for me with this C.S. degree. but I would give it ALL up to be in a position where I'm actually happy with my life. Where I don't feel part of some neo-slavery disguised in the form of a 9-5 work week.  I feel like I'm going to college in order to get a good job that pays for me going to college. Call me Yossarian but if that's not a Catch-22 I don't know what the hell is!

Thank you for your time. All Thoughts and opinions are welcomed. If you've gone through something similar I highly encourage you to share your experience. "
4og4ts,1,2016-06-16,I'm terrible at my first internship and I don't know what to do!,cyber_harpie_brother,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4og4ts/im_terrible_at_my_first_internship_and_i_dont/,"I'm a rising senior, but I've only been coding for about a year. I'm at my first CS internship and I honestly feel like crap because I've never been in an environment like this. My boss and coworkers are very understanding that I'm playing catch up right now and that I don't know anything, but I'm afraid that I'm taking too long to get the hang of things. It's been about three weeks  and I've been installing software and familiarizing myself with their ongoing projects. I'm also working on another project for them that doesn't have much coding that's going well, but my primary role is supposed to be coding. 

Just when I was getting comfortable enough to start doing work, my coworker started quizzing me and I do not work that well under pressure. I've never used SQL (background in Java) and briefly expressed my interest in learning it during this internship, which my manager and other coworkers are very supportive of, but then she asked me about backend development, maven, ant, and several other things I didn't have a firm grasp of. I was so flustered at this point that when she asked me a basic question about former packages I've used, I couldn't really respond. She didn't intend for me to completely lose confidence; she says she just wanted to know how to guide me better. I know I should learn from this because I never want to feel like such an idiot again, but I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar position or could pass down words of wisdom?"

4ogqhg,2,2016-06-16,Should I leave my job - and is it possible to leave with short notice &amp; not burn any bridges?,BadBalloons,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ogqhg/should_i_leave_my_job_and_is_it_possible_to_leave/,"So I graduated from a well-known west coast university in December 2014. Couldn't get a job right away. I've been working at a dead-end low-pay part-time customer service job for about nine months now. The company is in the industry I studied, but the job is not. I'm living at home with my parents. I've been itching to quit since month three because I really disliked the work, and I feel lost and utterly unfulfilled on every level with my work, but a friend of mine told me to stick it out until six months. Over the last four months, I've interviewed for two opportunities higher up the company's food chain, and didn't get either for various reasons (bombed the first position's interview, the second position was eliminated after I interviewed). As far as I can tell, there are no somewhat entry-level jobs left in the company that I can realistically move up into with my background (administrative, not production/technical).

Then, a couple of days ago, I got an offer for a *full-time* job as a production assistant/executive assistant from an old contact from my university. It's not in my industry at all, nor in my dream industry, but it's dream-industry adjacent and it's the chance to develop some real skills and at the very least do something different. Also technically the pay rate is higher.

The catches are: 

1) they want me immediately, and they've explicitly told me that if I want to get trained on some of the technical work, I need to be there full-time starting June 27, 

2) it's a tiny five-person company so they W-9'ed me in, even though I'd technically be functioning as an employee under California law (so I don't get benefits, I'm taxed at a higher rate, and I'm getting paid a 'day rate' (rather than hourly) that works out to $15/hr pre-tax as long as they don't make me work longer than the 10 hours per day they outlined in the work order)

3) It's in a different city, so I'm going to lose a massive amount of my income to rent each month and only just break exactly even financially, and

4) the biggie! **The position is only until August 1**, although they of course said that if they get one of the contracts they're working, the job could be for much longer, they'll just ""have to see"". So I'm not counting on an extension.

Anyway, I really want to leave my current job and try something different, and I *really* liked the people when I worked two days for them earlier this week - they also really seemed to like me so far. Plus the job description might give me some more transferable skills for my dream industry than my current job, and *might* give me a better chance of making connections in my dream industyr, since I can't afford to intern anymore. Maybe I'm grasping at straws, though.

What I'm wondering is, knowing all that, and especially knowing that I have an out date, is it totally foolhardy to leave this current job? And is it possible to leave with less than two weeks' notice without burning all of my bridges? My current department is completely shorthanded, they've been hemorrhaging a person a month since February, and I'd be leaving during the busiest season. I technically have some paid sick leave accrued, which I don't even know how to use, and I'd be willing to work the weekends at this current job until July 3. But I also don't want to burn everything to the ground because there's a chance I might have to slink back to them and ask for my job back in August. Help?

Edit: I'm planning on giving notice tomorrow (Friday), when I work next. I'll tell them I'll continue to work weekends I'm scheduled for, tell them it's a big opportunity to grow professionally, tell them when the new job wants me, and mention that I know they can't hold my job for me, because it's so busy, but if there's a position available when I come back, I'd love to apply for it."
4ogr48,0,2016-06-16,Comp Eng: Standard Protocol resource for verilog/VHDL? How bad is it to use flags in microprocessor design?,immelbatoast,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/4ogr48/comp_eng_standard_protocol_resource_for/,"I'm getting very into microprocessor/FPGA design, and start an internship in a few months involving the same.  When using assembly languages, I've found specific guides as to how people prefer things to be done (anything from the register guidelines to 'when something should be in a subroutine').  Are there any good guidelines for verilog/VHDL that I'm not aware of?  I'm learning behavioral off of Vivado/Basys3, and I know I can do everything in one continuous file, but I'm not sure if there's some resource that can tell me when I should be splitting into separate files/modules?

Also, I have had a tendency to use flags a fair amount in code, mainly for time-sensitive school projects.  Is it bad to use flags in industry? (example: should a seven-seg be on or off?  Should this code run?  Basic if true -&gt; this, else -&gt; this)  It feels pretty simple to set a flag register &amp; check, and almost like a cheat when you can't quite get something working out correctly, and I'm not sure if it messes with efficiency or is frowned upon within the field, especially with the limited resources associated with FPGAs/microprocessors.  If it's in good practice, great, but if it's bad practice I'd rather change my way of thinking.

Background: Applied to an internship in March, interviewed and was made an offer in April. Accepted and advised recruiter that I did have a felony conviction. Because it didn't involve money, theft, fraud, forgery, or computers, I did not think it would affect the offer. She said ""that's fine, just make sure you disclose on our formal application"" and so I did. It showed up on the background check, sure enough. Internship was to start next week. Last week, I got an email requesting court documents (I provided in turn), and today I got a letter stating that the offer had been revoked.

I feel stupid as I had quit my full-time, non CS job to pursue this internship. The internship did involve financial information, so I feel slightly stupider for not thinking the job was too good to be true. I've got a year left in my grad program, so I now have a free summer with no job or courses. I need to formulate a plan to maximize my time to learn, produce projects, and apply to jobs.

I think I have a decent handle on Java, Algos, Data Structures, C/Systems, and other core concepts. Minimal front-end experience. Looking at most job postings, I think I would be best off learning front-end skills, or diving further into Android, SQL, or Python. Some of the books I have bought but haven't opened much: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, Big Nerd Ranch Android Programming, O'Reilly's Learning SQL. I don't have many front-end books, but have been looking at the Odin Project as a means to learn. I also have a copy Cracking the Coding Interview and had most recently been working out of that, reviewing concepts just in case a situation like this arose.

So my questions are these:
1) How should I prioritize my time? Obviously my new job is finding one. I have an emergency fund that should last me about 6 months before I start getting nervous. I feel like applying to every job in sight, but I know it'll be a waste of my time if I'm not prepared for an interview. I'm thinking 30% build projects for gitHub/portfolio, 30% learn new stuff, 40% apply to jobs, but I could have my priorities off. 

2) Do any of the skills/books above seem to take priority over the other? I'm thinking front-end, followed by Python, followed by SQL, and then Android. But I could be wrong. 

3) Are there projects in any of these that would be worth pursuing? I am thinking of making a few websites, a python application combined with a framework (web scraper?), or another Android app. 

Other than that, I know I'm going to have to apply everywhere and send out 50x more applications than the average bear. But any guidance on a plan that maximizes my learning and employability would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance. "

I am a high school student who started a paid internship with the local Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP) two months ago.

Around the time I came aboard, the owners rolled out a new soft phone system at our office. I was instructed not to answer any of the phones that day because they would be testing them from their iPhones. Moving forward, nothing more was said about the phones as somebody else was always present to answer calls.

Yesterday, the owner (also my boss) and another intern left the office early to work in the field. He told me to hold down the office while they were gone and lock up if they did not return by the end of my shift. Cool. I proceeded on with my computer work for the afternoon.

Suddenly, the soft phone at my desk rings. It's a local number with no contact name in our system (not another employee). Naturally, I picked it up. Proceeded to assist a potential customer in determining service availability at her new home. This entailed me sending her a confirmation email (CC'd to the owners) and adding her name, address, and contact information into our work queue. I locked up the office at the end of the day and left feeling fairly accomplished.

Fast forward to this morning: my boss calls me into his office first thing and asks me about the phone call. I explain the gist of the call and he becomes upset with me answering the phone ""against direct orders not to"". I reiterated that he asked me to ""hold down the office"" and last spoke of telephones on testing day. Nope. Something about ""insubordination"" and ""a big red flag"" and I was terminated on the spot.

That, my fellow Redditors, is the story of how I got fired from my first ""job"". Fuck *me* for taking initiative.

*****

**tl;dr:** answered the phone at work while ""holding down the office"". Was reprimanded for defying orders and promptly terminated."

My GPA tanked this past year because I was dealing with some personal stuff.

I've been applying to research positions for a while and I've applied to ~65 internships in the past 3 months (including personalized cover letters, emailing recruiters, going to local companies in person) and nothing has worked out. I gave up recently after spending so many hours and never even getting an interview. So I pretty much have 0 work experience related to engineering.
 
Recently, a recruiter from one of the big companies I applied to contacted me and I have a second interview with them soon. I'm very surprised because I don't think they usually hire people with no experience. I know I could use the experience I would gain from this co-op to get a pretty good job in the future or even apply to more internships later on. This co-op would require me to take off one semester and graduate even later.

But my parents disagree and think it's a waste of time. They think the best course of action is to graduate asap and try to get my master's right away. 
The way I see it is that if I can get this co-op this semester and an internship during the summers until I graduate, my degree would start paying off right away. I would be in a really good position to get a job as soon as I graduated. 

So my question is, what is the likelihood that I would get into a decent master's program with a low GPA and no experience? Is it worth graduating pursuing a master's when I have no experience? "

My parents disowned me when I was 20. Apparently I was getting way too out of hand for them. Why don't they understand that your 20s are the time to just completely ball out; it's your last chance to be irresponsible and maybe fall of the wagon once or twice? If you're entering your 20s, or even are currently in them right now, you'd get what I was saying. Well, either way, I think I was just a bit too mischievous for their liking. So I put them out of their misery and left. 

My boyfriend was always using his phone. And when I mean always, I can't remember a moment when he wasn't looking at Instagram model's profiles, or adding random girls on Snapchat. Is that what I want from a relationship? A disloyal, arrogant misogynist who doesn't understand what it means to be in a relationship? No way, Jose. I have far too much pride to be that girl who sits around waiting for him to finish off on his virtual boner. 

My friends were bitchy little pricks. Their life revolved around bitching, gossiping or hating on a yet another member of our clique. Please - aren't you grown up enough to know that that high school petty shit doesn't work in real life? I'm sorry, but I couldn't do that anymore. Talk shit, get hit. Besides, I didn't want to be their next victim of a real life ""Pretty Little Liars"" session.

Although I'm just an intern at work, my colleagues give me the hardest time. They pile so much work onto me, and they're always playing fucking loud pop music for the whole damn world to hear. NOT EVERYONE LIKES KATY PERRY. I'm sick of it. I hated it. But they broke the camel's back when they made me stay 10 minutes late after work last week. I had to catch the bus on time - don't they have any sort of empathy? Needless to say I'm not working with them anymore. 

My professors at college - jeez, they were always marking me down a grade for some dumbass reason. ""You handed in an unfinished assignment"" ""You drew some disturbing drawings on your final paper"" ""Three students dropped out of college because of you."" They keep trying to kick me out, but I'll make sure to use my tactics before they do. 

Now I think I'm in real trouble this time, though. It was a tad unnecessary - but I can't help it. She made my vein pop. And when my vein pops ... well, you don't want to know what happens at that time. The woman at Subway messed up my order. She put in the Italian bread when I clearly. Fucking. Asked. For. The 9 Grain Wheat Bread. How difficult is it to follow orders?! You have fucking one literal job. 

I waited for her to go back to the employee room during lunch break. I was watching from outside the store, sitting in my car. She didn't know I was still there. As soon as she disappeared from the sandwich making station, I made my way through the empty restaurant, black duffel bag swung over my shoulder. I opened the unlocked employee room - so foolish of her - and, let's just say, she never got to finish her lunch break. There's good news, though. There's a new meat being served at Subway. I replaced the Steak and Cheese with her kidneys. 

It was all fun and games until some eager beaver reported her disappearance and a strange, black clothed stranger was seen going into the employee's room on the surveillance footage. They're looking for me now.

""Thank God her remains are inside the fellow Steak and Cheese sandwich lovers out there,"" I say to myself, cheerily, as I drive down to the Lake area where I toss the rest of her into the murky waters. I stand there for a moment, pondering on whether all the other bodies of the so-called ""close"" people in my life have reached the bottom of the lake, or not."

It was mostly an accident - I tend to speak my mind pretty quickly and openly, so I spoke up a lot about what we should work on first and where to start once we learned what our project would be and a bit about the tech stack, and they just kind of followed me. I always try to ask for input but they almost always just say ""yeah that sounds good"". I've also definitely contributed much more in terms of what we've built so far (both design and implementation) - it's all ""collaborative"", but in the sense that we brainstorm briefly on issues then I say ""okay I think I have a solution that should work"", or (for example) I jump right in to writing down what methods and such I think a class should contain while they're (I guess?) still thinking about it. 

I feel like I'm taking away a bit of the internship experience for them, but I don't know how to get them to talk and contribute more. When it's just us, if I don't start talking it seems like everyone just sits there and browses the code base (or just their phones) absentmindedly. I had a meeting today so I was gone for a bit over an hour and when I came back I'm almost certain nothing was accomplished. 

All that leads to me being the one who knows the most about what we've done, how we've done it, and what we have left to do, so in meetings they both just look at me to start talking about what we've done so far and what we need help with. I'm also concerned that my manager might think badly of me for over talking when I kind of slipped into my role and now I'm stuck here. He's always asking if we're all getting the opportunity to work on the code, and often seems to indirectly point out that I'm talking much more than the others. 

Am I overthinking this whole situation? Is there something I can try to get them to talk more, be more involved, and make more decisions? I often have a solution to the problem at hand pretty quickly and I don't want to waste much time trying to let them figure something out for themselves, but I'm beginning to think that's the only option if I want them to really have more input.

I started young but recently I realized I was just messing around and not seeing the bigger picture. Now I'm 20 and I'm expected by my friends and family to get an internship/job. My friends think I'm hot stuff but honestly I'm such a train wreck right now. I honestly have no idea what I want to code. And about internship, I think I'm a bit late for the party seeing as there aren't any offers right now for summer internships. Most of those are already out and I still have 2 finals to prep and take. Don't get me wrong coding IS the thing I want to do for the rest of my life. I love writing code but we all know it's not all fun and games. There are troublesome tasks just like every job out there. And this is what made me think... I need to find something that will keep me happy.
&amp;nbsp;

I also have a wider view right now than before. I can't have the luxury of choosing my path in this industry. I mean I'm still with the mindset of a kid and creating games would be pretty cool in my head. But the things I've heard about the game industry just doesn't let me think about searching for a job in it. They say the work/reward ratio is horrible, tons of overwork and many more but still it sounds like most developer jobs out there. Creating sites sounds like a cool job too. I haven't even touched webdev before though.
&amp;nbsp;

The post starting turning to a rant so I'm going to try and summarize it in this paragraph. I am confused. I have no idea what I want to code, I only know that I want to code. How did you find the thing you loved most to create? Or did you? Are you happy the way you are right now? If I don't find what I love to do I'll most likely choose by salary and cope with things from there. Sorry for the long post and have a nice day!"

What I'm actually pretty sure about is that I want to be a software developer, don't know what kind though. Let's say I do in internship and my first job as a web developer, would it be hard to switch to mobile (android) an year later?
What if I start out as a backend java developer, could I still become an ios developer later on?

Started an internship two weeks ago, which will last two months. 
I (21y) came to the company because I met the CEO. He is not the typical suit guy. He has not a lot of social skills, but a net worth of 50 million. I'm also not exactly the person that is good at bragging about my achievements in life.

When I started the internship - which was with the intention to follow him around, which he agreed to - I didn't know that there would be two other interns. The first one I met was very nice and we agreed to split the time with the CEO equally and  also the busywork we had to do. 

Then the third intern showed up. 19 years old, your typical pretty boy with thousands of instagram followers, rich parents and nothing else achieved in life. Showed up at 3 o'clock the first day and went straight home after he heard the CEO wasn't there.

Second day, he came at 2 and we invited him to lunch. He seemed very nice, but with a tad too much self-esteem. He basically knew **everything** about **anything**.

*Stocks?* No problem, he is Warren Buffet himself, trying to teach me how to invest my money better, because he made 40% a year with ETF's he couldn't remember since he was 16. Sure.

Reading? He reads a book every week.

*Fitness?* Sure, he made the ""official navy seals"" training plan for 3 years and also scored acceptance for a special forces job in my country, because, well... Quote: ""I destroyed the application tests and they basically begged me to work for them.""

*Real Estate?* He also wants to be a real estate investor, because he read so many books about it and is a total pro. Even lectured me how my real estate investment was total shit. After I told him it brought me 12-18% a year, he said ""Yeah that's quite good, but I would get like 30-40% a year"". Sure - again.

He is also a self proclaimed dog professional right in the second a co-worker has a problem with her dog. Or he knows everything about Job Requirements even when you don't ask him - which in the end turn out to be total BS.

**HOWEVER,** now comes the part which actually makes my (and the other interns) life really hard here: He is devious as f'. 
He doesn't do ANY busywork here and just shows up when he wants to, yet nobody cares, because the one thing he is really great at is: APPEARING nice and like he really knows something.

Everybody loves him, but as I said, he is devious as f'. He passively tries to get us both out of the sight of the CEO, by sneaking his name onto all appointments with him. He even said to the CEOs assistant that he ""discussed everything with us"", when sniping pretty much 90% of the appointments for him. When telling him openly a few days ago, there was nobody in the office: He then proceeded telling us that he is not an intern like us. He is not here to do this kind of sh't work. We are. He was a total d'ckwad about it and I snapped a little bit and told him to sit the f'ck down and do his share of his work and that everybody will get an equal part of everything and that I won't be his personal worker, while he goes out with the CEO and has fun.

He then continued by personally attacking me of how stupid I was. I then proceeded to tell him to just stop arguing and do his work and stop being a lazy and smugly idiot. After this, he FINALLY did like a tenth of his work and since then actively sabotages us. He IS good in one thing: Convincing people that everything is alright and that he is so nice and cute, smiling all the time and being totally nice to everybody else, while in the background, backstabbing both of us.

I know there is a certain kind of competition in being one of three interns, but this is not bold, it's shameless and devious.

I was never good at deviously plotting plans to sabotage people. I was always more the ""planning to make the best out of the situation and work together""-guy. I never saw the sense in working against each other when you could also work with each other.

I go to an art school where a lot of things have to be applied for. Like if you want to take an upper level class, you have to submit your portfolio and get in. I can't get into anything, and I've watched my friends get accepted right and left. 
I want to change my major and just give up, but I shouldn't because it'd be easier to just finish this up than to change and be in school even longer.

I'm insanely jealous of one of my friends because she has EVERYTHING. I know that's not true, I know she has flaws, but I can't help feeling so jealous of her. And the final tipping scale into my lack of self worth is that I think my crush likes her instead of me. I don't know this for a fact but I feel like I have enough evidence and of course he would because EVERYBODY likes her more than me because she's friendly and doesn't suffer from depression or anxiety or fucking autism like I do so she can be more likable and successful.

I hate watching all my friends go on to do great things in life, hearing about them getting internships and making things, while I have done nothing except sit here and breath and make them feel better about themselves for talking me out of killing myself.

Even typing this, I realise how dumb and juvenile I sound. But that just further supports why I think I should kill myself. I'm a waste to everyone and they would feel better after seeing they wouldn't have to put up with my shit anymore. And more importantly, I'd be free and the suffering would stop.

I've been suicidal off and on since I was 13.

When does it become ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem""?"

By that I mean the full glorious breadth of mathematics, not just very applied discrete math which is only useful to computer science. I want to get into a good graduate school, I'd like it the most to do it in the US or England (I like living abroad) so I think this might help with getting into a better school than I could have.

I'm at a uni that doesn't have a mathematics department so I would have to take it at another university, for me it's not a problem, it just means a bit more travel (about an hour by train)

The financial part is no problem, in my country you don't have to pay extra for double, triple nor quadruple (although that would be pretty ridiculous) enrolling in universities so I'm just paying my standard tuition and there's absolutely no risk for that.

I've just done my first year of a 4 year degree and am starting a 3 year degree in Mathematics coming year (at universities they take 3 years)

I've talked to a tutor at that University (and the person in charge of the placement etc) and he told me that I don't have to be physically present at a lot of the courses, I can follow them online whenever I want and he told me there's no problem going up to teachers during outside of office hours etc if I get stuck somewhere.
not that I hope I will have to skip lectures, just to give you an idea. This year I've been at school from ~9 to ~5 every day studying so I'm not gonna take the freedom to not take lectures and throw it away.

I'm a student doing a 4 year compsci/software engineering degree and the 2nd year of that degree I'm starting a 3 year university bachelor's at another school a little while away. I'm looking for tips in general from people who have done/are doing this and do's/dont's**

I believe I have a relatively strong resume coming out of school: multiple profressional and internship experiences in software engineering,  a specialization in data sciences, a minor in statistics, and a solid gpa at a strong university. I am not worried about finding a job here in the U.S, but I don't have much insight on looking abroad.

As I mentioned before I do not have too much international knowledge, but my first thought would be that qualified U.S employees are a hot commodity (strong education, native english speaking).

I thought about switching my major but didn't know what else to change, plus it would've taken more time to graduate and more money, so I just stuck with it. That said, the numerical GPA doesn't tell the whole story. I've failed and withdrew from multiple CS classes since I struggled a lot. 

My resume + cover letters are pretty good since I've had those well reviewed by my university career services multiple times. I've gotten phone interviews and in person interviews just fine. 

I've studied Cracking the Coding interview pretty extensively. Along with practicing a bunch of problems from CareerRide, CareerCup, etc..
I've done plenty of mock interviews from school career services for both technical and behavioral, so I'm fairly confident I'm at a good spot. But I didn't get to point until 4 months ago. 

My side projects are pretty decent. But I mostly highlight my 2 popular ones on Github. One of these 2 actually received an API prize at a hackathon. Both of these I still develop weekly.

At some point during every consideration process, they've always asked for transcripts. Usually, they want me to bring it to the interview or send it after the in person interview. But when they ask for it in the beginning before interviews, I get dropped from consideration. I've applied to all types of companies and industries: large, small, west coast, east coast, etc.. But I mostly apply to midwest since that's where I'm currently at and it gives me the best chance for a face interview. I've been applying to mostly iOS and WebDev positions where I've done previous projects in, but I've been pretty flexible and sometimes apply to IT and quality assurance too positions too. 

I've only gotten 1 offer so far but it was 49k for a small company in rural place with little mentorship. My salary requirements isn't too high or too little, I usually ask for a bit lower than the average according to the company's glassdoor at that position. 

I only ever had 1 internship throughout college and it was also at a small company, but they only converted 2 interns into full-time last summer.

Bachelor in Information Technology
CompTIA A+

I am currently working on network+(failed once with score of 700) and I am guessing I will be able to get network+ pretty soon. Anyway, I have been applying for IT job for past 5 months. At first, I didn't know what to do so applied for anything that says IT intern, got zero replies. Since nobody was telling me what to do or no one I know work in IT field, I couldn't get a good advice. I was surfing web aimless and then decided to get some certs since I was getting no offers whatsoever. So I got my CompTIA A+ 2 months ago and now working on Network+ and started to apply for help desk position for past 3 months. So far I've applied to about 50 places or so around my area and got 5 phone interviews and 1 in person interview. I got qualified for one night shift job at $16 an hour 2 months ago but back then I thought it was bad deal but since then, I realized how stupid I was to turn it down. All other places I had interview with only pays $13.25 and even at that low salary, I didn't get ""Yes"" from them. 

Here are my concerns. When I look for my job on online job site such as careerbuilder, indeed, monster, every single entry level position post has like 300+ applicant and more than 50+ of them have like master degrees with 5-9 years experience. Not sure that's real or bs but if that's true, what chance do I have to land that entry level job? I have zero experience in corporate environment. 

So.. here are my problems and questions.
1. I speak 2 languages and while my English speaking is decent, it's not native level and my choice of words aren't the best. While I don't have accent, I can't pronounce certain words very well. I am afraid this would deter me to get help desk position since help desk is heavily focused on talking on the phone.

2. If my goal is becoming network admin or network engineer, what kind of jobs should I be looking for? I don't even see any posting that they would train and take entry level guy into network admin or network engineer or even as an assistant. Does help desk job even considered as required experience to apply for network admin or engineer in the future?

3. Where can I look for job besides online job board? I am starting to think it's only small part of job searching because I don't really see that many different job posting coming up. It just seems like same only selected few companies are posting same job post over and over again.

4. I have 10+ experience in retail sales and customer support. Would it be better for me to just go to sales position than IT field? I am getting like 5+ phone calls everyday talking about sales position but I just tell them I am not interested and hang up. From what I've seen, level 1 help desk in my area only pays $13.25 so I am starting to think sales position may pay more than this.

Sorry for a long wall of texts. I wrote this whole thing mindlessly, so I am not planning to re-read it and fix my mistakes."
4ong9l,5,2016-06-18,Recent Graduate Problems - Need Encouragement,jkweiler74,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4ong9l/recent_graduate_problems_need_encouragement/,"Hi r/jobs, 

I am a recent environmental engineering graduate from Michigan Tech. My boyfriend and I had a month-long backpacking trip that started in Yosemite planned for this month, but it was cut short (should have gotten a GPS to keep the trail in the mountain snow - our fault). But for that reason, I hadn't been applying to that many positions before graduation. Now, I feel really behind, and we are stuck living in an uncomfortable household (bf's mom's house). Not to us but around other people, they will joke that we have to find part time jobs in this town to help pay bills. We originally decided to drive out here (southern CA) and do that backpacking trip because they it wasn't a problem to stay with them before we got on our feet.

Now for a couple of weeks, I've been looking for full-time positions with companies all over the country, applying to positions that are less than entry-level engineering or internships and co-ops (ex: Technician 1 who needs a high school diploma). I think I'm on the right track, but haven't gotten any positive responses yet. 

Coming this fall, we are going to have student loan repayments starting up (probably about $1000 between both of us), and I'm wondering if we have been doing the right thing. I've applied for relevant positions locally and nationally, and now we have been applying for seasonal jobs at national parks and resorts (partially to get out of this house). We don't have money to move somewhere else without solid job prospects. 

I have just been really down on myself because we would be doing so much better if we wouldn't have been planning that backpacking trip since November. We could have kept living in Upper Michigan and kept the part time jobs we had there until we had better jobs locked down. The general price of living is also a fraction of what it is here. We are looking for full-time, seasonal positions though, where we could save up a fair amount while paying loans until one of us finds something better. It has just been very stressful, and I need some encouragement that will be okay. "

I've tried formatting this to be easy on the eyes, but in any case apologize for the amount of text.

**For a bit of context:**

1. Finance Major Entering into 4th Year of Undergrad 
1. Finishing 16 Months of Co-op doing primarily Financial Analysis, but outside of the industry
1. Competencies in Python/VBA &amp; semi-regular use of them at my Internship
1. Not the top program in my region, though definitely above average 
1. 1 Semester on International Exchange in 3rd year
1. 1 Semester of domestic 3rd year Grades, which are Excellent
1. Poor Grades across my first two years (no sob story, I was immature)

**Pros Moving Forward:**

Bearing that in mind, I interview well and will write the L1 CFA exam this December. I also plan on continuing in the vein of my Third year Academic Performance, and as such will be in a better position come the end of this calendar year.

**Cons Moving Forward:**

Being that I only have 1 year of high academic performance, am not from the defacto #1 program in my Area, and haven't Interned within the Industry yet - I understand that I've pretty well ruled out IB for the next few years. Further, I'm a difficult sell to any firms which will hire competitively this summer or throughout first semester.


**My Question is this:**

Should I put off a full application blitz until I have more of a ""proven"" background come December? If so, what competitive roles in the Industry hire grads throughout second semester? I'm very much a serious candidate, but feel as though I've shot myself in the foot - while I've done a lot to remedy poor earlier decisions, a time machine would be ideal.

Any and all context would be appreciated, I didn't grow up anywhere near the Industry and am figuring things out as I go.

**Thank you.**"

Just finished my third week and although I have learned about some very interesting new things to me, I haven't actually delivered any work yet. There are around 7 other interns and majority have shown some of their work already to their respective teams.

I know asking for help is a big thing I need to work on. The people on the team I am working with are not familiar with the tools I am using for my project so they normally point me towards someone else, but when I go looking for that someone, they are almost always busy and they forward me to someone that isn't able to fully help me out (they do try though). What do I do then?

I feel like I am concentrating too much on learning everything about the language/tools I need to use instead of starting some work I could complete and learn along the way. I guess that is one thing I can start doing. I have about 6-8 weeks left (they said I could stay until I go back to school), I don't know if that's enough time to turn my situation around but I really like this company and my co-workers and want to obviously leave a good impression before summer ends.

[Rant?],Degrade1405,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/4opmyk/feeling_discouraged_is_omscs_for_me_rant/,"So, I recently finished my undergraduate in pure Mathematics, and it was a bit of a bumpy road. I graduated with a clutch 3.04 GPA with a major I'm not really interested in going to graduate school for, but topics of advance computer science really interest me. However, I feel like my opportunities in the CS field for me at this point are front-end web development, and those opportunities don't seem very interested in me, either, due to lack of internships and minimal CS coursework (I essentially completed *most* of a CS Minor, missing Assembly Language and a couple electives). I started out majoring in Physics for 3 years, deciding I wanted to just graduate in Mathematics, and then later tried picking up remaining CS courses because I felt the Physics and Math weren't applying to real-world situations directly enough for me. But I ended up just graduating with a degree in Mathematics.

I've been researching this program, and it seems to be geared for mid-career professionals looking to get to the next level. I've worked full time waiting tables throughout University, so I have a lot of experience working, just nothing relevant to my degree. I'm also skeptical because I just fumbled my way through a 4 year degree as a first generation student all by myself, and I'm trying to feel proud of that, but I can't help but feel that I have no clue what I'm doing professionally. I should have been looking for internships this whole time, and I'm trying to do that now but I'm not satisfied with the positions I'm applying for. I want to do more.

So, I guess my question/TL;DR is:
as someone with a weaker undergraduate experience with zero internships, am I going to be able to be successful in this? I feel confident I can glue myself to a textbook and work through the material, but I guess my impostor's syndrome is coming out. Are there mentor-ship opportunities that will help me?

From a professional standpoint, the company is not a very large company, but we do cater to a lot of users (roughly a million, if not more).

Given that this is my first internship after just two terms of University education, when do you all think it's the right time to start aiming for bigger companies, the likes of Ubisoft, Snapchat, FB, Adobe, Yahoo, Cisco, Microsoft, Google or basically SF companies?

Does one progressively aim higher with each co-op term or are you one of the people who just made the jump to these bigger companies? Do you believe that you need to be at a certain caliber before applying or do you just wing it and apply anyway and see what happens?

Also, when the going is so good with my current workplace, would it make sense to come back here for another work term?"

I'd really love any advice anyone has. I'm currently finishing a bioinformatics PhD with some machine learning, but first degree was biochem. I've also taught some ML and written tutorials, led a seminar group in deep learning, etc.

Anyway, over the last year I've decided I'd really like to transition into eventually doing deep learning research. I've been offered a deep learning internship immediately after submitting my thesis at a great lab in industry, but it's going to be very difficult to accept from a personal point of view (housing, partner arriving back to the UK, etc.). 

I should be okay for getting data science jobs, but doubt I'd get into doing deep learning immediately without the internship. 

What do you guys think? Is the internship indispensable? Or should I relax a bit after submitting the thesis, see people who are important to me, and not rush from PhD -&gt; internship -&gt; job in a super short time?

Deep learning just seems like a very difficult field to get into unless you've specifically studied degrees in it, which is why I'm considering accepting despite the utter chaos it would cause.

Thanks :)

4or83o,2,2016-06-18,Recent grad in need of advice on next steps. Please help!,recentgradprobs,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4or83o/recent_grad_in_need_of_advice_on_next_steps/,"Hi there - recent grad here looking for some advice. I apologize in advance if this turns out to be a bit lengthy. Bear with me, I'll try to articulate my situation as best I can. Also not sure if this is the best subreddit for this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, I just finished college a little over a month ago and I'm at a crossroads in terms of what I should do next. I spent almost the entirety of my senior year freaking out about getting a job and having plans for post-grad; as my friends and peers secured jobs in New York, Chicago, San Fran, etc. I felt an immense amount of pressure to do the same (although in retrospect, I'm not sure why - perhaps just to have something to tell people? I don't know...)

The truth is, I had - and still have - almost no idea what I want to do. But of course that didn't stop me from applying to somewhat random jobs. Fast forward to one month before graduation, I am making headway on the job front; I landed some interviews and was feeling pretty confident, but I quickly realized that some of these jobs were NOT for me (example: business development associate at a software company, which I now know is a fancy term for sales - yuck. I didn't even go through with the second round of interviews)

I was thinking, why would I, an international studies/anthropology major, enjoy selling software? Even if it meant being around other recent grads and moving to a cool city, I don't think I'd have a very good time.

So I graduated without a job. It was exactly how I thought it would turn out even before starting college. I'm not naive - I have a liberal arts degree with very little professional experience, no doubt I'm not gonna land my dream job straight out of college. And I don't even know what my dream job is.

But inevitably I was still freaking out, and I just wanted *something*. However, I wanted that something to be in DC. After having an internship there last summer, I am certain it is the only place I want to live - at least for the first couple years after graduation. I'm really not a fan of NY/Chicago/LA, all of which I have visited multiple times. DC is just the right size, plus I already know people there.

Anyway, about a week after graduation I was contacted by a company with whom I'd applied for position about a month prior. Their headquarters are in DC, so I was pretty excited. The interviews went well and they offered me the job, so I took it. (note: this was the first and only job offer I'd received)

And now, I was pretty happy. I thought, ""hey, I guess everything worked out; got a job just a week after graduating and now I can spend the next two months enjoying summer, living carefree, before starting work.""

So that's just what I have been doing, and it's been awesome. A little background on my current situation: I'm still living in my college town (which is amazing, probably one of the best college towns in the country - tons to do) because my mom actually moved here during my junior year.

I thought all of my friends would be gone after graduation and it would be the loneliest place ever and I'd be dying to leave and start my new life, but it's been exactly the opposite. I still have a handful of friends here, one of which I met during my senior year and we've since become super close. We hang out almost every day, but she's leaving for med school around the same time I'd be leaving for DC.

I also met this guy at a party a couple days after graduation, and we've been hanging out and I've started to really like him. He's leaving next week to study abroad for a month, though. Then he's coming back here. If I go to DC I'm not sure if we will stay in touch, which I am feeling depressed about.

It has also been nice living at home, but still being in my college town. One of my brothers is still in school, so he is here. Another one of my brothers is also at home right now. We're quite close, and it saddens me to think about leaving, unsure of when my next opportunity to come home will be.

That leads me to today. As you may have gathered, I am having conflicting thoughts about leaving. I am wishing that I had taken more time to consider different options and apply for jobs that would perhaps be a better fit for me, rather than just picking a city to move to and taking a random job. Granted, this job I've taken is with a solid company with a fairly good reputation, so it would likely look pretty good on my resume. But if you told freshman me that this is the job I would have upon graduation, I'd be very confused.

My internship last summer was with a nonprofit, and I loved it. I could see the impact I was making. This job I've taken is in the corporate sector. Not sure how I feel about it.

Part of me is saying that I should just go. I do frequently have these kinds of feelings before doing anything major (e.g. study abroad, moving to a new city for an internship) but the thing is, those were all temporary. I knew I was coming back after it. Now, it's permanent. I'm just leaving. I don't know if I'm ready for that.
But at the same time, my future in DC looks pretty good, despite the fact that I don't know if I will like my job. I managed to find an apartment within *walking distance* of my job, a roommate who is also a recent grad that seems incredibly sweet, and I already know people in the city.

If I give this up now, I don't know if I'll find myself in such an ideal situation. But the other part of me really wants to stay where I am, perhaps find a job working in development for the university (my internship last summer was in fundraising) and stay for another year or two. Then I'm fairly certain I'll be ready to leave. I'm just thinking, I'm only 22, I don't want to start the rest of my life in a new city just yet... I still have time...

Should I just go and see how I like it? My mom told me not to view it as something permanent. I suppose I could move there - I don't see it as being a huge hassle, considering the place I'm moving into is fully furnished so essentially all I'm bringing is clothes - and then move back if I find a job here that I think I'd like better.

I just don't know anymore. I think I've included all of the relevant details, but I would appreciate any advice! Thanks in advance - especially for taking the time to read all of this."

Need to complete an internship for my uni for my next semester, however I have been rejected from all the places I've applied to since March. I live in a fairly small town 2 hours away from the city with my university, and I can't afford to stay there over the summer hoping to just find there, so I had to move back home for the summer, and there's hardly any opportunities for me here. I managed to find a service shop that would accept me for however long I need to get my mandatory quota, but I want to learn something over that time not to be a complete mook. I'm also waiting to hear back from a big phone company stationed in the capital for an internship offer, but considering my skills I'm not having that much hope. 

I would like to know if it isn't too late to get all that done. After the next (last)  semester begins, I want to find a job at some software development company in the city, since I assume nobody is going to be looking for interns at that point, however I don't know if I could find even some small position with my skills. I'm really just at a loss, wondering if I ruined all my opportunities already by not getting as good as I could due to laziness. How possible is that? What are the places I should look? What can I do to improve my chances, what should I be learning and practicing? 

Thank you in advance for any advice. It is completely depressing for me. Some people in my year got internships even last year or 2 years ago, and the big majority got something for this year. I just know I'm not as good as them and I don't know what I can do to close that gap."

4otf71,1,2016-06-19,Can't seem to figure out what I want to do. Help me?,sweetcarolina110,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/4otf71/cant_seem_to_figure_out_what_i_want_to_do_help_me/,"I am 25 years old and about to finish my second bachelor's degree. My first bachelor's is in history, where I focused mainly on early American history. I also really enjoy learning about Victorian England, but they didn't offer classes on that. Once I graduated, I had no idea how to go about finding a job or what one would even do in the real world with a history degree. I didn't think I had really obtained any marketable skills from my degree, and decided I needed something that I could really sell to a potential employer. 

I decided to go back to school for computer science. I enjoy coding, but I am not one of those people who spends their spare time writing programs or whatever. I view it as a work skill, nothing more. It's not a passion or a hobby. Now I have just one semester to go and I have managed to obtain an internship at a small company. This internship is okay, I certainly don't hate it, but it is not at all exciting or entertaining to me. It's just work. I am not doing any coding (part of the problem I am sure) but it does involve working on their program. I basically test the program's functionality by pretending to be a client and just using the system. They say they will start teaching me more of the developer side of things eventually, but I am not sure that it'll be any more fun. Basically, I am starting to think this isn't something I'd enjoy doing long term, either. But now that I will have 2 degrees, I certainly can't do any more schooling. At least, not for a while. 

The reason I am posting here is that after 2 degrees I still don't really know what I want to do. I enjoyed learning about history, but sometimes trying to write those long essays was painful. Perhaps it was because I usually had several on my plate with tight deadlines and I didn't always get to choose the topic, because give me the right topic and I am happy to research and write about it. Up until recently my part time college student jobs all involved dogs: dog rescue, dog daycares, dog grooming, etc. I loved working with dogs, but I hated the hours and the pay (8 hour shifts were brutally exhausting, I was always filthy, the dogs could sometimes frustrate the hell out of me, I got bitten several times, and I always had to work holidays for minimum wage). I did briefly work with a local woman who was an antiques dealer. She had a house full of random antique documents and she needed help going through them and writing up descriptions and posting them to her website. I loved going through the stacks and reading bits of history. That job was short-lived because one day she just stopped giving me work. I really enjoyed it, though it was also shitty pay. 

Part of the reason I decided to go back to school for computer science is that I hear everywhere that non-STEM jobs will not pay the bills or, if they do happen to pay enough, they're nearly impossible to find because they're rare and there is a lot of competition. I am starting to think I may have been misled. I think what would make me happy is something that uses some technical knowledge but not as much as, say, a developer job, but that also uses the skills I gained from my history degree. I've considered library jobs but that's definitely an area that I hear there is a LOT of competition in and I cannot afford to get an MLS. I've considered digital history as another field, but master's degrees or higher are usually required, plus there is nothing in my area and I cannot move (we just bought a house and intend to stay here in the Charlotte, NC area). I've seen some people with history degrees go into law as legal assistants. Maybe I could do that? Basically, any and all ideas are welcome! Please, help me figure out what I can do.

TL;DR: Have bachelors in history and computer science, still not sure what I want to do."

I have bagged an internship in a one of the leading cloud security company. And a full-time job as a technical support engineer in a networking company. Both of them are in Bay area. I have hard time in choosing one of those. Both the companies and roles are weighing same to me at this point. My specialization is in computer networking.

Internship role is kind of DevOps and manager mentioned that he's trying to build a new team, he has considered me for that role. And he also said that he's willing to turn it into full-time after 3 months if the performance is good. The risk involved here is what if I don't get it after 3 months, I have to again start the job hunt, will the market be good after 3 months?

Full-time role with the networking(storage) company as a Tech support engineer are giving me a decent package, H1 B sponsorship(since I'm an international student, sponsorship is important) and a few more benefits. Should I play safe by taking full-time role or take a leap of faith and risk for the internship role, considering job market after 3 months? 
Or do I have to consider any more factors? 
Any suggestions would be appreciated. 
I have until next week to decide!

4oucyc,3,2016-06-19,Here is my plan for the next two years of undergrad. Any advice from you guys?,Bat_002,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4oucyc/here_is_my_plan_for_the_next_two_years_of/,"This might be a little long but it makes me feel better to have someone else hear it besides myself. Also, I need some advice.

I'm currently still at community college for this summer and the next two semesters. I'm enrolled at my university, but I'm trying to save money by staying at CC for as long as I can.

Because I didn't do well in high school and the way my CC is set up, I've been taking mostly pre-reqs for the last 3 semesters (I took one semester off). Starting this next Fall I will finally take my intro to programming class.

My goal is to graduate with my bachelors after Fall of 2018. I'm taking 15+ credit hours a semester and 3 courses over each summer.

Before I graduate, I want to get an internship at a highly regarded facility called Sandia Labs. My girlfriend's dad has a Ph.D. and happens to work there as well, so I have a reference. My concern with this is that I have very little hands-on coding experience at the moment, and I don't know what I need to know for this internship. I would like to get it as soon as possible, but seeing as I haven't taken any programming classes yet, I don't know how soon that will be.

I just started taking an intro to computer science course called ""HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science"" online for free thinking it might help me with an internship and to get a head start.

After I graduate I am not 100% on what I want to do yet. Part of me wants to get a Ph.D., for the prestige, the idea that I'll be an expert in my area and have more knowledge, and the higher pay that comes with that. I would like to go to graduate school at an ivy league if that is possible, or the much cheaper graduate school here locally.

I also have a strong passion for video games and think it would be enjoyable to go into that field. I have an interest in virtual reality and possibly AI.

If I don't go into the video game industry, I could always make them in my spare time. I would then like to get a job at a place like Google or one of the big successful companies.

So, in conclusion, I have a plan up until I graduate, and I'm still a bit split after that. Until then, I need to know what I should study to get an internship, and also if there is anything else that I am forgetting about. If you read this thank you I really appreciate it.

**TL;DR** What do I need to know before I interview for an internship? Is a Ph.D. worth it? And if so, is an ivy league's tuition worth it?"

I'll eventually leave with at least an A+ cert and a bachelor's of applied technology. Degrees vs certs, I was told the degree is more important.

The stuff I currently do is pretty much a bit of everything, helpdesk, desktop technician, network technician. But I haven't gotten to touch server stuff.

Also, if this is in the wrong place, I'm sorry. Please feel free to move it to the right spot.

So I graduated in 2013 with dual Bachelor's Degrees (Communications &amp; English), and since then, I've been looking for a job - ideally in strategic/risk communications. I haven't been able to find anything, and took the only jobs that I heard back from. 

The first as the host of a family friendly restaurant chain that paid a whopping $5/hour plus 1/3 of server tipshare. I spent roughly two years there whilst also looking for a ""grown up"" job. (Or, you know, one that paid a solid living wage). 

No dice. 

Out of well over a hundred applications, I only received interviews from pyramid schemes and MLM crap that promised six-figure salaries within months, for the low, low price of the contact information of my family and friends. 

Then, kind of out of the blue, I get offered an internship - a family member is the VP of the organization, though I was working for the company's president. Unpaid, but learning communications (and later some event planning) for a small trade association. It lasted 5 months, and I was not offered a position at the end of the internship because ""we're not bringing in enough revenue to support a new position."" (They've since brought three new people on staff. I still help out my family member with association issues when they ask, though, even though I'm essentially volunteering to do some of the things the place is now paying someone 1500/month to supposedly do. The president is hiring his friends and old coworkers, sometimes in spite of the fact that they're not necessarily the most qualified for the job.)

I'd continued working at the restaurant through the internship, and was still looking for something that paid more. 

Last year, after over a year of looking (and not finding) a job that would allow me to use at least part of my education, I was hopeless. Management decisions (and the lack thereof) in the restaurant were quickly sending things on a downward spiral - toxic environment was an understatement, so my family member (VP again) heard that there were openings in the dog walking company she uses. I applied, got an interview within a week, and started two weeks later. 

Since then, I've been there, but I'm still looking for a solid job. (This one pays entirely in cash, I'm responsible for paying all of my taxes. Essentially I'm a 1099 employee, but the employers never provided a 1099 form.) 

Still no dice on the other jobs, and I'm still applying. 

Here's the thing: 
I'm starting grad school in the fall (all night classes) to go for my Master's in Communication. I've been applying to jobs and paid internships closer to campus, but haven't heard back from any of them. Out of desperation, I applied for a job at a restaurant. It's near the campus, but I don't like who I was at my last restaurant gig - the toxic environment infected me, I suppose. I was miserable about my lack of any progress and I, regrettably, let it affect my family life. 

I got a call from the restaurant earlier. They'd like to schedule an interview with me sometime this week. I've got mixed feelings about this. 

Do I schedule the interview and try for the job, even though it's still not a job in the field I want? 

I mean, I've got a job now, and it kind of pays all my bills, but I don't feel 100% confident that my boss actually has my back. (I've been in a handful of potentially dangerous situations with dogs that do not listen to me, and it's taken me almost getting bit before getting them reassigned. At this point, it's just a matter of time before I seriously get hurt, and I don't know how much support I'd get from my employers.)

I guess the long and short of it - do I take the restaurant interview and try for that job given my past experience in a restaurant, or do I stick with the job I've got, knowing that I've got a certain amount of leeway since I've been there for over a year? 

Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks."

4owp1s,1,2016-06-19,"Where should I study: uWaterloo, TUM? (Kind of first options).",toospace,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4owp1s/where_should_i_study_uwaterloo_tum_kind_of_first/,"Quick Summary:

- Decided to make a career switch and start pursuing CS. I want to do it, I'm convinced of it, I've done my research too.

- 25 years old, 2+- years of working experience in Banking (yes, Banking). Absolutely no significant experience on CS-related jobs. Only have a short time undergraduate internship with very few responsibilities.

- Already have an unrelated Bachelor's Engineering Degree, from a South American country. My intention is to get accepted into the CS Master's Programs of these schools.

- Have an ''alright'' highschool and undergraduate record. Not the best of grades and not an impressive set of activities either. Lived a pretty carefree academic life (as 99.5% of the people in my circle) in comparisson to what people much younger than me do in order to achieve Ivy League standards. HUUUUUUGE difference, and completely separate worlds. It sucks that I just took notice of this :/, but I still want to reach it!

I'm interested in Waterloo (UToronto is my 2nd Canadian choice) because of its extremely high reputation and success of their undergraduate co-op program. I also have relatives in Canada and would love to move there. The problem is, their application requirements seem pretty TOUGH. At a glance I certainly don't meet half of the requirements, specially my average undergraduate grade, and I guess they do a full 100% review of life achievements. And of course their tuition is pretty expensive for someone like me. I currently pay 3.3 units of my currency for every $USD!

I'm interested in TUM because education is cheap in Germany, and because it's like the overall best German University, the highest ranked German CS program and it's god damned Munich!! Requirements are MUCH more lenient, but I don't know much about their Master's Programs and can't seem to find many reviews on it, so I'm not quite sure what would I be getting myself into. I do however, have a close friend of mine currently working in Stuttgart who talks wonders about Germany's ecnomy and she's convinced I would have plenty of opportunities in tech-related jobs. Of course it's no ''Silicon Valley'', so I guess that's why I know so little about their tech industry?

You could just say I should take the ''friendlier'' approach to things because it's better than nothing, but I feel the need to know if I could get a better education somewhere else.

Thanks!"

I met my best friend two years ago when we rented two rooms in the same four-bedroom apartment. I was moving out of my residence and I wanted to live with other people because I completely failed to socialize during my first year of university. I had missed the first few days of mingling and partying because of a visa issue and when I finally arrived everybody seemed to know each other. I am an introvert, or at least I used to be, and it took me a lot of energy to interact with others so I ended up almost alone for a whole year. It wasn’t the same with Gale though, it’s like she knew me before we even met, she welcomed me like nobody ever had before her, and I immediately felt comfortable around her. On my first night there, she came to ask me if I wanted to order pizza, play video games and get to know each other, and we have been friends ever since. It always surprised me because if you think about it, we are very different. When I met her she was this outspoken and opinionated pink haired American girl with more piercings than any of my other friends combined, and I was this sweet and shy little wide-eyed French girl who blushed at the thought of holding someone’s hand. Her dad once belonged to a gang of bikers (supposedly the Vagos or something) while mine was a published geologist. We were nothing alike, but we both had a lot of emotional baggage, and I think that’s what brought us together. At least that’s what I used to think until later on when things started to happen, but let me get there.  

After a few months, we ended up having problems with our other roommates and moved into our own apartment. We lived together until I left for my exchange, which I will come back to shortly.  

I forgot to mention that Gale is a few years older than me, and she dropped out of high school when she was seventeen. Years later, she decided that she wanted to go to university to study History and she was admitted after getting good grades during a semester as an independent student. She was diagnosed with a few mental disorders while she was a teenager, and even if she could live a somewhat normal life if she took her medication, she had a hard time dealing with them when she was under a lot of stress and it made her more sensitive. She had frequent mood swings due to her bipolar disorder, among other ones I do not feel qualified to talk about, but I got used to them quickly, which is why I never really thought twice about her behaviour, I just put it off as normal symptoms. She would sometimes forget to take her medication which never helped in these situations. The first time I realized that there was something more to her than her disorders was a few months ago, during finals. She was a wreck, working part-time, missing classes, submitting assignements days after the deadline, staying all night to cram before exams…I had my own finals to deal with, and suffering myself from anxiety, I avoided our apartment as much as I possibly could. There was this one night though, I only had one exam left in a few days but Gale was trying to catch up on the assignements she had not submitted yet. I was lying on the couch, watching the TV with subtitles and the sound turned off while Gale was on the other side of the room, sitting at the table, her head resting in her hands, desesperately trying to finish an essay she had been working on all day. She seemed frustrated and I almost headed for my bedroom – thinking that the TV was distracting her – when she interrupted me. 

« Leave me alone ! » she whispered, her eyes still fixed on the screen. I first thought she was talking on the phone with someone, but she did  not even have her earphones on. Then I thought that the TV was bothering her, and that she was talking to me. 

« Me ? » I asked, surprised. 

« No, him. » She answered while pointing at the empty hallway leading to our bedrooms. 
 
I didn’t remember her bringing anybody back home, she always asked me first, knowing how uncomfortable I was around strangers. I tilted my head to try to see farther into the hallway, but it was definitely empty. 

« There’s nobody there, Gale. »

« You just can’t see him, Audrey. » She answered in a demeaning tone, as if it was obvious.

I remember bursting out laughing, thinking that she just wanted to mess with me before going back to her assignment, but she seemed even more frustrated. 

« Do you ever listen to me ? I told you about it before, remember ? »

« Remember what ? » I asked reluctantly, my smile slowly fading, feeling more uncomfortable than ever. 

« The spirits, Audrey, the spirits I can see. »

She said that she had told me about it once, even though I only had a very faint memory of us talking about ghosts on Halloween, but I’m sure I would have remembered it if she ever said she could SEE them. She did get me drunk on that night and I had my first hangover the next morning, so she could definitely have chosen a better time to reveal her best kept secret to me. She sighed and joined me on the couch, facing away from the hallway as if she was purposely ignoring whatever she thought was standing there. She proceeded to tell me that she could see dead people, that she always had, and that she mentioned it before. She looked sincerely hurt that I forgot about it and I apologized, even though I knew I would have certainly remembered something like that. I won’t lie, for a minute I thought the stress was getting to her and that she was suffering from some form of hallucination, or that she had developed a new disorder close to schizophrenia or dementia, but she really seemed to have been living with that weight on her shoulders for a long time.

« Who is there ? » I asked her, glancing at the hallway. 

« I don’t know, I’m not looking at him, it usually makes them go away. »  

« Do you see them often ? »

« They’re always around, everywhere, but they usually leave me alone if I want them to. This one, though, he’s here to stay. »

« Why ? » I asked, startled at the thought that there was someone or something in our apartment. 

« Because he has something to say. » 

« Why don’t you just listen to what he has to say, then ? » 

« Because it’s the kind of thing you can’t unhear. » she simply added before standing up, grabbing her computer and retreating to her room after a quick « Good Night ». 

I sat there, wondering if there was any chance left that she was messing with me, until I dragged my eyes toward the hallway, realizing that if she could indeed see the dead, there was probably something or someone watching me. I shrugged it off, thinking that tomorrow she’d wake up and ask me if I managed to sleep with a grin on her face, revealing this was just a sick joke to scare me, but that never happened. 

The following days and weeks ended up making me doubt her sanity and my own, and I was relieved to leave a month later for my exchange a few states away. She stayed in the apartment and started to work full-time after dropping out of university. Something changed her during these months, something I only had a glimpse of at the time. I don’t know why I’m writing about it now. That’s not completely true, I know. I know I’m going back to our apartment in a week to get all the random things I left there so I can bring them back to California where I’ve been doing an internship for the past month or so. The truth is that I did not want to go back home after my exchange so I just applied for various internships until a start-up accepted me in Los Angeles. What was even weirder was that she did not want me back home either. She even said she would send me everything to try to dissuade me from coming, the whole 40 lbs of clothes and books I left in her closet. I refused, she is currently paying our apartment alone – she did not want to bring in a new roommate – and I couldn’t ask her to do that. Not to mention that her voice seemed so weak the last time I called, she barely had the strength to argue with me and just settled with a « Whatever, do what you want. ». She didn’t sound like the opinionated and outspoken pink-haired girl I knew so well. I miss her, she is the one who helped me get my own voice, who supported me when I needed it the most, who made me see my worth. She changed me, it’s like she absorbed all the negative and made it positive. I don’t want to lose her to whatever she is fighting. I guess I don’t want to go through this alone, I never talked about it to anybody, I usually don’t like to show how vulnerable I can be.

Although I was told that I wouldn't be programming directly, I was told I would help develop a new version of my company's in house software product through testing and debugging.

The problem is I haven't done any of that. I know it's my fault for not speaking up sooner (Started 5th week of 12), but my manager talked with me about my knowledge in Java and the project in my first week and said we'd work on it.

Despite this all I've done is, Excel spreadsheets and some tech certifications. My manager is putting me on to 3D modeling as well since he said it's important to try a range of things during an internship, but I'm just wondering when I'll try what I came for.

How do I approach this? Mind you my roles and tasks were never written in stone on my offer letter and I knew that going in (I didn't have other offers, so I took what I could get)."

What to do next for my final year?,chargers80,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4oyp1u/300_applications_for_internships_no_luck_what_to/,"I'm looking for advice on how I am going to approach this summer and my final year of school. 
Some background, I was offered an internship  at some startup and I kinda liked what they would like me to do but one problem, there was no software dev guy working there. They basically wanted to bring me in and make their MAIN product from scratch and I thought that it was suspicious. Moreover, it was UNPAID. So I decided not to take the internship offer and I hope this will not bite me in the end. It's really mainly that I wanted to learn under an experience software dev and it wasn't going to happen at this company.

I applied to 300+ places since January and I only probably got 2-3 callbacks which is ridiculous to me because I thought my GPA was pretty good and I had some projects. 

I'm kinda at a loss on what to do this summer because I don't have an internship + no work experience. Also, I have the option to graduate early (March 2017) but I don't know if it is smart to leave college without any experience. Is it worth it to stay in school longer and find an internship or should I start just applying to full-time positions? (Also when should I be applying to full-time and will I even have a shot at these?)

Sorry all, I've been just frustrated bc I see a lot of people get their stuff through connections and they tell me, they don't even like CS they do it for the money. I am happy for them and I understand thats how the world works and all but I really love this field and I want to improve. I want to get better and I really want some mentorship (hence thats why I'm frustrated about not getting a good internship for 300+ applications). 

Any advice is welcome. My resume is here for critique: http://imgur.com/0Yl4iHT

I'm pretty sure it could be my lack of work experience. My friends say I should take some retail job bc its good for my resume but idk how much that will help at this point since I'm graduating in March. 

thanks, everyone for reading my long post. i've been just super frustrated lately but hopefully my hardwork pays off. "

Both of these companies were located in the same city, and I had the software internship earlier on in my college career, yet it paid $10 an hour more. 

My worry is that working at a hardware company might lead to a lower quality of life and standard of living. I know money isn't everything, but being able to save and spend $x more per year can help with long term goals for travel, children, life, etc.

Is there a lower cap on pay for hardware jobs in general that can't be ascribed to job location (e.g. high paying software jobs in silicon valley due to a high cost of living)? Is it that I need to go to grad school to get a Master's or PhD in order to reach my career goals in hardware, or is software really unbeatable in terms of quality of life?"

I solved that coding problem in java at the time, and then I sent my solution in javascript after the interview (which they allowed, after I learnt a bit of JS).

4p0bqm,3,2016-06-20,Should I Go Back To School For Six Years At Age 30?,MoonBoots69,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/4p0bqm/should_i_go_back_to_school_for_six_years_at_age_30/,"I dropped out of University when I was 20 because a summer internship turned into a full-time job offer.  I had only completed 1.5 years worth of credits, but the job I was offered was good money and had an important-enough sounding title that my parents were happy for me.

Now it's 10 years later, I'm 30, and I want to go get my masters in psychology so I can become a psychotherapist.

Here's the good stuff:
I've spoken to my former university and they have lifted my decade-old suspension for leaving like I did, so I am free to enrol in courses.

I've spoken to my employer and they have agreed to let my current contract lapse next month and hire me back part-time in an office closer to my school doing the same work (which is in the mental health field).

I want this.  I think I am good at it, I enjoy working in mental health, all my experience and references are in mental health and I think I could make a good living at it.

My partner is extremely supportive, and I have enough savings to get me through school with minimal debt, especially if I'm working part time.

Here's where my doubt comes in:
My savings could be used to buy a house.  I have a full time job which I do not hate which is more than some people can say, and even though my partner is very supportive, I feel like putting buying a house on hold for what could be 10 years is letting her down.

This is made worse by how disapproving my partner's mother is of all this.  She rolls her eyes and makes snide remarks and says it's a waste.  Her mother's boyfriend is very wealthy and made his own way in life and offered me $10,000 towards my education if I went back... until her mother intervened and told my partner and I that we were absolutely not allowed to accept that offer.  He has stopped bringing it up, also, so I assume she told him off for it too.  She thinks we should get married, buy a house and have kids ASAP.

My sister and uncle are also extremely negative about it.  My uncle thinks I'm being a coward and going back to school to not begin a real life.  My sister didn't go to school and got a really really good job (which she hates) by getting hired after a temp contract and thinks education is completely overrated.  She calls me stupid and says I'm an idiot for thinking of spending the time and money on it when I can just work hard and get a job based on my current work experience and references.

One thing about my uncle, sister and mother in law:  None of them went to college or university, and all of them are extremely unhappy people in their lives.

These were the doubts I had myself, but hearing three people whom I speak to semi-regularly tell me outright how dumb it is to be starting out all over again at 36 has begun to shake my resolve.  Maybe the best thing to do would be just to work my decent job for now, buy a house in the next couple of years and apply elsewhere in the hopes that I can find a better paying job that I love?  At least in that scenario I'm making money the whole time, rather than spending it.

I'm open to all takes, negative or positive.  I just want some advice from people who I'm not close with."

I couldnt be happier with the switch, and am very excited to continue on with the degree.

So far, I have taken an Intro to CS and a networking class towards my degree. For the summer, I am currently in a Computer Organization and a Java Programming class (very similar to the intro class I already took but they didnt accept it as a transfer, I think its more in depth). Right now I feel like Im at ~freshman level in CS classes, but since I have all gen eds/electives done, all I need to take are CS classes. 

I probably had the time to be doing an internship this summer, but I didnt feel like I had anywhere near enough classes under my belt to stand a chance. No projects yet either but I have been planning to start something simple soon. All I really have is my part time work experience as a waitress and a math/science tutor for high school students. 

Here is my issue: I want to graduate in a timely manner, which at this point is looking like ~a year late. I would be totally fine with that, but that would mean I would need to be taking classes pretty much full time until then, next summer included. Im afraid that, depending on classes, this isnt going to leave me time to have an internship which I really wanted to do. Should I just risk not having an internship and just try to finish all my classes in 5 years? Or should I just plan to take even more semesters to finish the degree? Are any internships open to working with students who may have classes a few days a week? 

Also, I see on job sites there are very very limited internship positions still being posted (Chicago). Should I try to send resumes to these even though I barely have anything under my belt than basic knowledge of Java, C++, Javascript, HTML. "

Really need some life advice right now.,aggressiveplayer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4p27q6/took_a_break_and_have_been_looking_for_a_job_for/,"So I graduated from university last year with a degree in computer science. I decided to take a break for a few months or so, and I guess I screwed up and got lazy and ended up taking a break for 6 months. After that, I started searching and I've been getting a lot of phone screens and calls, but I seem to get rejected at the stages of the phone interview or after the coding challenge. I'll admit I don't see myself as a very good programmer, I seem to always look stupid and make simple careless mistakes.

After months of this I started to realize maybe programming isn't for me. If had found a software job two or three months into my search I probably would have just stuck with it. But since I haven't I've come to learn that this type of job requires you to be passionate about coding to be successful. A lot of people who landed jobs probably code on their free time. I don't code on my free time. I'm just not passionate about it.  I started looking into IT jobs instead as I usually solve all the tech problems for my family anyway. There aren't too many in the market, and I probably don't have the full qualifications so I didn't find success in that either. If I were to land a software job right now, I'd still take it up and I'd probably be a bit more motivated about software engineering, but I probably wouldn't go above and beyond like many people in this field do.

This is a desperate time in my life and I feel like my life has been going downhill in general because I haven't found a job yet. I'm embarrassed about how long I've been unemployed. The only thing I sort of have going for me right now is a recruiting agency almost hooked me up with an interview for Autodesk, but Autodesk has put the position on hold, and the recruiting agency will contact me if it opens up. I honestly don't know what to do at this point, but I'm willing to pick up my slack and determined to succeed. I've had two summer internships as a software engineer at Rackspace and Amazon and worked on a couple projects at school. I live in San Francisco, and the tech sector seems extremely competitive here. Where do I go from here and what should I do to pick myself up and finally find a job?

At this point I think I'm mainly just looking for a job in general.. even if temporary, contracting, or internship, particularly in the tech sector. The job market is looking very bleak for entry/intern level positions and I feel like I could easily be jobless for another 3 months.. It seems like I'm in a hole that just keeps getting deeper and deeper.

UPDATE: Thank you for all the replies everyone! This has motivated me a lot more. In fact, I've already started my personal project today which is to build a image scraper in Python that downloads all the images on a web page for you. I have plans to keep expanding on it, and I think I can make it fit in with experiences that a lot of companies want these days (RESTFUL APIs?, Databases, Web servers, scraping, etc). I'm also going to continue applying to jobs, and try to improve my interview skills. Hopefully I'll find something soon! I'll be sure to update you guys when I do."

Granted, we don't do as much coding as Computer science or CE, but I should definitely have a good grasp of coding. Especially with my co-op these next 7 months with a hard drive company as a lab intern. 

I have been learning powershell for the past 4 weeks or so and I have a decent grasp on it. It is very different than working in C as it is very object-oriented and I have been working on using pipelines and such to maximize efficiency. My code can get a bit weird with the linux/unix aliases I have some experience with.

However, no matter what language I am coding in, I never feel like I have an extensive background with any language. That is to say, I never feel like I have learned enough to be proficient. I feel like I get by by doing a lot of googling and working out of articles and tutorials to find good solutions and get the job done, but I never really feel like I could do any substantial programming task by my self, you know?

Such as in my powershell test report parse that I made over the past week and a half, I just looked up how to do most of the stuff I wanted to do and only came up with totally my own solutions on a few points. 

As the title says, It seems like I only learn either just enough of the language or code in order to get the job done for whatever specific task I'm doing, but it doesn't leave me with a great understanding of the concepts or the language. This is my experience with Powershell. On the other hand, as with C, I have done tons of small exercises, and when I took my class in C, I learned a bunch of small labs. I definitely learned all of the basics, but it would by no means be enough for me to be called proficient in the language in the professional world. 

For another example, I want to learn linux bash in order to solve problems on my Mint machine (I'm beta testing Mint 18) and create my own workarounds. In order to be able to get enough basic understanding for that, I would have to spend countless hours doing small meaningless exercises that eventually I give up on because I don't feel like I am getting anywhere and they aren't useful.

I'm sorry for the wall of text. 

**tl;dr** I feel like I am stuck between these two types of learning. I can either solve specific problems few and far between or I can do a bunch of pointless small problems that don't really make me feel like I am accomplishing anything anyway.. Does anyone else feel like this? How can I move past this?"

I am a CS major and I was accepted as a transfer student at CMU for their Computer Science program. 
Over the course of the past year, my priorities have shifted a bit. I was deadset on being an officer in the military, but I've been pretty disillusioned and disappointed by the quality of the academics and inefficiencies of the bureaucracy. I do enjoy the camaraderie, spirit, and patriotism the institution embodies and I recognize the prestige of an academy degree. I just don't want to be a slave to the bureaucratic system as an officer, just doing paperwork and putting up with bs that does not actually involve me protecting my country (since our national security is not in imminent danger/not in war). And I also don't want my CS knowledge/degree to become outdated during my 5 years of required active duty service after graduation. But don't get me wrong - I want to serve in the military. I just don't know if the academies are the best route (cs education is not great, lots of bs, cadets w/ terribly inflated egos). 
Anyhow, I am strongly considering leaving because I think a career in software engineering with a strong undergraduate degree in CS while signing up for ROTC/going to OCS after graduation (or reserves so that I can serve when our nation is actually at war) would be better suited for someone like me. CMU is expensive, but I am receiving enough financial aid that money will most likely not be a significant enough issue.

* Question for those with military background is: is it worth sticking the academy out? Am I completely wrong in my complaints with my experience (albeit little) and interactions with the military? I love the academy as a place to be and the environment will be a big change going to a more ""scholarly"" school like CMU. Will I still be competitive after service to launch a CS career at a reputable and renowned tech company?
* General questions: I've looked at the scs employment charts and such, but will being a year behind put me significantly at a disadvantage for internships, jobs, etc.? (I'll have to grind to graduate on time anyway....) Will being in the military put me at a disadvantage for these jobs? (I don't want to work for a federal contractor after service.)

Please feel free to give any advice/critiques/guidance - I am definitely still conflicted about whether or not transferring to CMU is the right decision. Sorry this was so long!

**TL;DR service academy cadet a little disillusioned w/ military and worried about potential future in cs careers. transferring to cmu scs worth it?**"

**Background :**  
I've done my BE in Computer Engineering from a college in Mumbai. I had a backlog that I didnt manage to clear before the end of Semester 8, so I had to give my exam six months after I was supposed to finish my engineering (which I cleared eventually). I did not get any job during campus placement, and with exams on the horizon, I partly studied, and partly whiled away the six months after my final semester. After attempting the backlog, I took up an internship that involved Software Development. This internship was work from home, and I worked for about 6 months. The internship will conclude in about few weeks, and thus I will be looking for jobs. This is where I need guidance from you people.  

**Profile :**  
Admittedly, my engineering grades are lacklustre (a little below 60%). During engineering, I had decent programming skills, and mainly picked up Java and database basics. For my BE project I picked up some PHP/MySQL, and during the aforementioned internship, I worked mainly with PHP.   

From what I gather,software engineering is more than just about knowing a language and grades. I'm a fairly quick learner,so I'm confident about picking up skills on the job, but still :  

**Question :**  
Should I stop and take a break, learn some language/platforms, before hitting the job market? I find my CV quite lacklustre, and I cant help but feel its not something that will open up opportunities. On the other hand, this industry is quite versatile and the language/platform I learn may not be as markateable,so again, learning something may not really make a difference.   

Also, any tips on finding a suitable jobs? Yes I know job search is something I gotta do myself, and I'm not looking for someone to spoon feed me. But I'd love to hear people's experiences searching for jobs: How did you decide what you'd like to do? What prompted to chose x job over y? All I have are questions, and I'd appreciate some answers,especially if your experiences are in the same field(if you aren't from the same field,but still have something to share, please do!).

However since the time i'm available is just two months, so it would take some convincing for him to take me on for such a short time.

We have scheduled a skype session on this coming friday to talk about this. I am also very interested in applying to the PI's uni or even apply to him specifically. If I can score this internship, It would help my application immensely.

What do you guys suggest that I can do now? Should I read all of his papers?

These bullets aren't necessarily what I plan to put down, it's just a long description. I'd like to keep it concise and professional.  
* (For reference) We work with ~15% HANA systems, ~25% Solaris systems, and ~60% RHEL.  
* Rotation 1: I worked with the compliance people where I created audit reports using Python scripts and an in-house application on current production vulnerabilities and took my findings and researched how to fix them and then would create a resulting report for the sysadmins to save them time. Also did risk analysis and how to plan for/minimize it. Don't know how to expand, seemed like the average good 'ol compliance stuff that everyone complains about.  
* Rotation 2: I'm working with the systems patching guys who perform the actual updates and system maintenance, can't fully explain everything I'll be doing since I just started but think jr level task hand-offs.  
* Rotation 3: I'll be working with the system build guys. They are responsible for configuring the servers or other components and deploying them into production. Again think jr level hand-offs but I've been told that I'll get to actually configure a few servers since I have some experience.  
* Rotation 4: choose another team or go back to one that I enjoyed.

I know I didn't give full information because I haven't started everything yet but try to imagine the tasks you would give an intern in a similar situation. Hearing your thoughts and interpretations will help me if I need to change it later. 

Edit: I'm applying for some jr level sysadmins positions and similar internships. I can't stay on with the company, only once I finish school which is next spring. I'm already extending the internship to the max time, I'm an online student so working full time isn't an issue.

GPU: MSI GTX 970 

So my question is simple, to help ""future proof"" my computer at 1080p (and eventually but not in the near future 1440) gaming, should I upgrade the CPU or get a new card?

I know that I have some relatively new technology and that I don't necessarily need an upgrade, but I am making solid money this summer at my internship so I don't mind spending.

You may have seen my posts on the other computer related reddits. Anyway, I have just graduated with an AAS in Computer Information Systems. Took me much longer than it should have due to a lot of personal things. I have done internships from programming (which I REALLY HATE) to help-desk (which I am doing now, and believe it or not, I really like it). I have done a lot of customer service type jobs to make ends meat for my family. Anyway, I am 22 now and I have always wanted to be a Sys Admin, until now. The job sounds extremely stressful and it's commitment to someone needing to always be learning and playing with their own lab at home is something my life does not permit. And the sheer negativity from other Admins has turned me off so much from the position. 

And now I am a little lost. I don't know what I want to do in IT. I love technology and I like helping people fix the issues they have with it. I am fantastic at customer service due to the fact people love me and I have no problem dealing with people. I don't have a niche when it comes to IT, and it scares me for my future. My degree has taught me only the basics, and I feel like an imposter all the time, even when I fully help clients perfectly. 

I want to go back to school to get my bachelors, but I need to work to make money to pay rent, so I would only be able to go back part time taking less than two classes a semester. And then there are different tracks to learn from (Security, Networking, Sys Admin, Programming) I don't know which one would fit the lifestyle of someone that just wants to do a job, help people, and go home and take care of a family, without having to do too much in the way of making IT a hobby. I like learning about new computer hardware and advances in IT, but doing things like making home labs and that other stuff is not something my life currently supports.

tldr- I hate programming and I am beginning to hate going into System Administration. What kind of careers in IT support someone just working without having to do too much away from work while still making a liveable wage? (50k-60k) 

I can provide details on anything that might sound confusing! Thanks!"

     **Non AP’s** C++, Physiology, Ceramics, school’s religion requirement. 
     Some of those can be done during the summer
     **JC** Linear Algebra, Differential Equations
   

**Extracurriculars:** 
THIS IS MY BIG WEAKNESS!
I’ve spent a lot of time playing **competitive soccer** but am definitely not good enough to play in college. As such I have not had much time for other extracurricular activities. This summer and fall I want to patch this, I am going to work a college internship this year at our local utility. 

I will also be part of the **Engineering Club** at my community college for a second year. I anticipate having a title, hopefully VP. The club is composed largely of my friends from Math classes. 

I’ve **never** participated in a **math contest**, a big mistake…
My only Academic contests have been a Mindstorms programming class once and the National Geographic Bee where I placed in CA finals. 

I can also work on a **farm** this year, it’s owned by somewhat distant family. I’ve done some very fun things there for example using drones to monitor irrigation in orchards. 

I have some volunteering at a food bank and in special needs classrooms.  

**Colleges:**
My number one is **Stanford**. By far. It’s the perfect distance, weather, culture, the classes I want. I’ve been to the colleges and 

I don’t really want to go to a super technical college; I don’t fit in too well with that kid of people but I really wish I did. Still some for the top from that category do interest MIT, Calpoly. 

Pomona colleges interest me as well as Duke, UWash, Princeton, Cornell, Miami, Chicago, Harvard (prob not possible).

My guardian is a disabled military veteran so tuition for me is waived at UC’s and CSU’s and at publics in a few other states (I think).

**Family:** Divorced very educated parents, fairly high income. I live exclusively with one. 

**Summary:** Vey good course work, tests, but few good extracurricular activities and no real “spike”.

**Questions:**

**ACT:** June ACT just back, should I retake? My superscore is now 35. During the math portion **I had to move desks**… twice; this probably hurt me some but a lot of the stuff on the test was difficult. Science also dropped.
(Note: not at all cheating related) 

**Senior Classes:** The course load I’m looking at is challenging but similar to 15-16. How valuable are senior classes? My school is very good at letting people scale back and if I can work senior year I might. 

**Extracurriculars:** How much is this going to hurt me? How much should I focus on these? 

** Letters of recommendation:** These will be good, even great, except math will be hard to get. I could do AP Stats for senior year or get a **community college professor** to right me one. They don’t really know me too well but they do know me and like me. 
   
 **Chances**, please Stanford, UC’s, other listed ones maybe.

I now find myself wishing I would of pursued this. When I'm doing the lessons, time flies by. I look forward to learning. I enjoy it and find it stimulating. I just have this feeling that I would be happier working with computers. 

My biggest fear is that if I decide to spend 3-4 years getting a degree, I'll be 28 when I get out. I fear I wont be able to make enough to save up for a decent house, or save up for a pension. But then again, it's not like I can afford one now. I can also try applying for Social Science jobs, which pretty much only means winning the lottery and working in government where I live (Canada). 

I'm finding myself wanting to go back, and I can afford to do it with no debt. But I'm loosing out on potential income by doing it. It's a risk. On one side I personally think I would be happier. On the other, I would be 28 with no house, no pension or anything. Has anybody ever gone through this or something similar. Did you manage to build a pension and save up? 

All I keep thinking about now is that I screwed up my 20s. I spent it doing a degree I din't enjoy. I spent most of my money travelling when I did have some. I have like 7k saved up in a TFSA at 25. I just want to turn this around. I know a degree won't turn it around, and that there's lots of hard work involved, but I feel like it will make me happier. I'm scared I'm going to hit 60, have no pension, and not even have a small 300k condo. I'm going to be on the street, dying of old age. 

At this point, all I think about is how much I screwed up.

4p6f49,1,2016-06-21,ArcMap Configuration File Location?,Teradoc,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/4p6f49/arcmap_configuration_file_location/,"I have recently downloaded an official ESRI add-on to ArcMap, the Water Utility Network Editing and Analysis (http://solutions.arcgis.com/utilities/water/help/network-editing/) for help during an internship with a local Water &amp; Sewer Department.

I am attempting to execute the usage of the 'Create over/under jumps on selected line' so that a line does not intersect another and instead jumps over/under it. The button executes properly, but the actual imagery is absolutely tiny,[ EXAMPLE HERE](https://imgur.com/t7wne9p), though if you hover over the tool, it helpfully states the radius of the jump can easily be increased by 'The radius of the circle is controlled by the CreateJumps_Distance tag in the configuration file'.

My problem is, I cannot find this aforementioned configuration file. I have spent approx. 3 hours googling over a few days without luck and looked through both the ESRI directory that the program creates when installed and even the hidden files of appdata and cannot come across this configuration file or I am not recognizing it and glossing over it.

To make matters worse, I contact ESRI and they at first refuse to help until I mention I have a 1-year student edition, at that point they pawn me off to another university's IT dept that my state apparently has assigned as the tech support for the colleges. I ask this person, and they don't even bother helping, instead they seem to start accusing me of misuse of the student license because I shouldn't be using this for an internship and only academic....what is the internship then? I'm only doing this FOR the degree...which is academic!

I'm sorry for the rant near the end...but its getting really frustrating that a simple question of 'Where do I find X?' keeps getting pushed aside or ignored. I have sent my own professor a question about where to find this aforementioned configuration file, but thought I'd ask you fellows in the meantime."

I kept this bottled up and I need to let it loose.

I graduated from a 4 year college with an Economics degree and decided that I wanted to go into programming instead. I took a six month internship doing SEO and then a three month bootcamp at General Assembly hoping I could find a job in six months. 

Over a year passed and I currently don't have a full time job. I'm doing some freelance work and I just did a lot of work for a non-profit but I currently don't have a living wage and I have to rely on my parents while looking for a job. My morale is waning with the other bootcamp graduates finding full-time jobs except for myself and I beat myself up about it that I'm not good enough.

I keep getting turned down from employers saying that I'm too green and not experienced enough. I didn't do a full-time job related to my college degree before I went to GA and my peers who had experience already transitioned to new careers.

I tried boosting my LinkedIn, showcasing new projects I did, I'm currently working on a new App together with a graphic designer, and I'm working on getting certifications to make up for not having years of experience. I try applying to as many jobs I can and I still feel stuck. I hide my emotions so potential employers won't see me be upset. I'm frustrated and sad because I want to work in this field and I keep being told the same advice from staffing firms and other companies to gain more experience. I feel worthless and that I suck. 

I just want to work as a developer and code. Is that too much to ask!?! What can I do?"

Any similar stories out there?,redyellowgreenbirds,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4p6x3l/how_feasible_in_a_career_switch_away_from_cs_any/,"So, I feel like I'm probably doing the opposite of what a bunch of people are doing, but it happens. I have a degree in CS, with double minor in math, started a small company during university, and have been working making decent money for about two years. The problem is, I've killed my interest in programming almost completely. I loved it back in school, published a paper in a research journal, did internships, all that, but for the past year, I'm pretty much done with it.

I've moved into a slightly more managerial role with my company, and given its small size, I've had my hand in a little bit of everything, sales, and design in particular. I love the flexible nature of my work, but the development doesn't interest me.

I have a couple ideas in mind about future careers, but I'm not going to jump the gun until I'm for sure. Luckily I'm married to a teacher, and don't plan on having kids anytime soon, so any change in income wouldn't kill me. 

I guess what my question is, is there anyone here who worked in tech, then got out to do something different? What was it like? I'd like to hear some stories. I'm still pretty young, so I don't want to entrench myself in a career I don't enjoy and look back 10 years from now and regret not making a move. I'm also moving overseas(Taiwan) in the next few weeks for a working honeymoon of sorts, so I'll begin making changes there.  Thanks!

Edit: I'm also curious what self employment looks like on a resume. I guess if the company was moderately successful, it wouldn't matter right? Besides internships and such, I haven't worked for anyone else except for busy work during university or whatever. I would feel odd listing a reference for a company I founded, but maybe I'm thinking into it too much."
4p75l2,4,2016-06-21,I have an interview at a library as an IT intern. How should I prepare for the interview/position? Does this seem like a good choice for my career?,InfoTechGod,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/4p75l2/i_have_an_interview_at_a_library_as_an_it_intern/,"Hey everyone,

I'm working 2 jobs to put myself through school for Information Technology and have been job hunting for an entry level job because 1) I'd like to begin my professional career while I'm in school, 2) I **hate** having to work nights and weekends and 3) I haven't gotten a raise from my main job in the 4 years that I've been here (I've asked, always told that ""they're coming""). 

Having no certifications (currently studying for my CompTIA trifecta on top of college), no diploma and no experience have been my achilles heel when it comes to getting into the field. I'm stuck in that endless circle of needing experience to get a job, but no job that will give me experience will hire me due to my lack of experience etc. And I'm in a situation where I *need* to work to support myself...I have no other option but to work. Even though it sucks, I have excellent work ethic because of this... which I think in the long run will help me achieve my goal of becoming an IT Director or a CIO.

I just nailed a phone interview with the director of a local library nearby. She loved me (I'm very personable) and pretty much offered me the job on the phone. I'm going in later in the week to meet with the Library Director. The job is a Technology Intern.

So as a Technology Intern, a few things I will be responsible for will be:

Social Media and Marketing

3D Printing

Technology Assistance for Staff and Patrons

Crowdsharing and Crowdfunding Platforms

etc, etc.

Pretty much, I will be the go-to IT guy. They have 3D printers but have no idea how to use them. Hell, I don't even know how to use one (because they're so damn expensive) but I think I'd be able to figure it out. They want to start doing STEM workshops for kids, like 3D printing workshops and I told her about an idea I recently had about doing a ""Build-your-own Raspberry Pi Workshop"" where I'd assist kids putting together and programming whatever they'd like to make a Pi for, like a game emulator, a micro computer or something automated. She absolutely loved it. 

They are looking to make the library a hub where kids go after school and during the summer to learn and hang out. I already have a few other ideas, like having a monthly Videogame Tournament, assisting kids in creating their own websites, teaching kids about how to safely use the internet (i.e nothing is deleted forever) and starting a comic book review blog.

The only downfall: it's an unpaid internship. I'm already working 2 jobs (all nights and weekends) to make ends meet and I was kinda hoping to trade both of my current shitty jobs for a helpdesk position. However, this seems like a great way to get my feet wet. Is this a dumb career move for someone aspiring to work in Corporate/Upper management IT? Does working at a public library in a suburban town look good on a resume? I don't know if gaining experience here would be better than starting out doing helpdesk.

Also, what should I be prepared for? For the interview and the job? I don't have any experience and this would be my first step into the world of IT.

Thanks in advance!"

4p7fnv,170,2016-06-21,A Different Kind of Ghost,alackofcoasters,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4p7fnv/a_different_kind_of_ghost/,"It all started when we were kids.  Charlie was five years younger than me, my kid brother that meant just about everything to me.  I wasn’t afraid to admit it; that kid was my world.  Ever since our dad passed him to me, ruffled my hair, said, “He’s yours now, Sammy,” I knew that I would do anything to protect him.  

That didn’t mean I wasn’t a typical older brother.  Yeah, I played my pranks and hid under his bed to scare the shit out of him, put itching powder in his underwear drawer, but nobody was allowed to mess with him but me.  And nobody messed with me but him.

“Did you hear that?” he asked one night when he was eleven.  He was sitting up straight in bed, staring at the window.  I rubbed my eyes, annoyed.  I wish I didn’t have to share a room with him, I was sixteen and so ready to live out on my own.  

He got up and checked the window, looking around with wide eyes.  “I see him.  I see it.”

“Dude, there’s nothing out there,” I muttered, pulling the pillow over my head.  It was just another prank.  I would go to the window, look around, get spooked by our creepy backyard in the middle of the night, and Charlie would grab me from behind and make me piss myself.  Not that that’s ever happened.  Ever.

“No, I see him.”

“Your ghost?  Again?”  Charlie’s been claiming to see this ghost every since he was six and saw Poltergeist.  He kept describing it has an old man.  The description got more detailed as he got older.  He was wearing robes, was all white except for black, black eyes.  He had chains around his ankles, no now his wrists, wait now there were chains around his throat.  He was bleeding, sometimes he wasn’t.  I was the only one Charlie told this to.  I felt kind of special, being the only one who knew, but not now in the middle of the night.  “Dude, I am in no mood to see your ghost.”

It wasn’t that I didn’t believe him.  I believe in the paranormal, I always have.  I’ve had little brushes here and there, creepy things that I didn’t quite understand, that there weren’t clear answers to.  Our mom always said we had a lot of empathy; we could pick things out in the dark that others couldn’t. 

Charlie looked out the window for a little bit longer, then went back to bed.  “Think that ghost will ever talk to me?” he whispered. 

“Maybe.  He’ll just say that you’re a fag.”

“Goodnight, Fat-ass.”

“Goodnight, you piece of shit.”

-

The internship was killing me.  No, for real, it was killing me.  I moved out on my own into a shitty little apartment, infested with roaches and a toilet that backs up at least twice a week, to make no money doing bitch work for a company that probably won’t even hire me after it’s all over.  

My girlfriend was over and made some quick spaghetti, listening to me rant and rave about why the universe is clearly against me, when I got a phone call from Charlie.

“Hey, what’s up?”  There was silence on the other line.  “Hello?  Charlie?”

There was a crackle.  “Hey, Sammy.”  He sounded tired.

“What’s up, dude?  Something wrong?”

“No… why can’t I just call my big brother?”  Charlie was eighteen.  He hadn’t called me his Big Brother for five years.  

“… Okay?” I said testily.  I glanced at my girlfriend, who shrugged and turned her attention back to the spaghetti.  “How’s it going, man?”

“Did Dad ever hit Mom?”

I gripped the phone.  “Charlie, what the hell are you talking about?”  Yeah, Mom and Dad were never especially happy with each other, but they made it work for us.  Dad would never hit her.  “No, that never happened.”

“Are you sure?”  It sounded like he knew something I didn’t.  I always tried to shield Charlie from the harsh realities of growing up, carefully wording to make sure he never knew this or that, that Aunt Carol was killed in a drunk driving accident, or just how poor we were, so there wouldn’t be anything he knew that I didn’t.  

Or maybe I didn’t do such a good job protecting my kid brother after all.

“Yeah, I’m positive.”  I paused.  “Hey, you idiot, are you high?”  He was still a kid to me, but I partied in high school too.  It wasn’t completely outside the realm of reality.  “Where are you?  Do I need to pick you up?”

“No, no, not high.  Thinking clearly for what feels like the first time in my life.  Listen, Sammy, I gotta go.  I’ll… I’ll talk to you later.”

-

I decided to visit home that weekend.  The kid’s words had been eating me alive this past week, there was no way I could focus.  I got home and of course Mom nearly cried of happiness and Dad grunted a hello.  Charlie was upstairs in our old room. 

I went upstairs and opened the door, and there he was, standing at the window and staring into our backyard.  “Hey, buddy, looking for your ghost?”  Charlie didn’t turn around, frozen in place, fingerprints smudged all over the glass of the window like he had been there for a while.  “Charlie?”  He remained still, perfectly still.  I reached out to touch his shoulder.  “Charlie—”

He jumped a mile high and spun around, pupils constricted and eyes red, like he hadn’t slept in a while.  “Sam!”

“Jesus Christ, Charlie,” I said, stepping back, spooked out.  “What’s happening with you?  You okay?”  He didn’t respond, eyes darting around the room as if he was looking for something.  I stepped forward again, feeling bad for being afraid of him.  I grabbed his shoulders.  “What’s going on?”

“You’re home,” he sighed, relieved.  He wrapped me up in a bear hug.  I resisted the urge to push him away and call him a fag.  He clearly needed the hug.  I squeezed him back.  “Sammy, I’m so glad you’re home.”

“Hey, man…” I wasn’t sure what to say.  It wasn’t like him to act this way.  “What’s going on?  You gotta let me know, you gotta let me in on it.  You’re freaking me out.”

He led me to my old bed, stripped of its sheets and pillows, a bare mattress, and made me sit, like he was about to give me bad news.  I had no idea what was happening.  Did he knock some chick up?  Hard drugs?  Dealing drugs?  What the hell was he about to say to me?

Charlie rubbed his eyes furiously until his lids were scrubbed raw.  “Sammy, I know it, I know it’s happening… Dad’s beating Mom every night.”

I tried to stand up, but Charlie pushed me down, surprisingly strong.  He looks wiry and thin, thinner than usual.  Dad and I are husky, bigger guys, but Charlie’s always been a skinny thing.  “What the hell, Charlie?”  Had our Dad, always stoic, always uncompromising, really started to beat our Mom?  “Did you hear him?”

Charlie shook his head.  “No… No, I don’t hear it, I don’t see it, he’s too careful, he knows what will happen if I catch him… No, I just know.”

“How?”

He looked around again, our childhood bedroom, nervous.  “I just know.”

“Charlie, that’s nuts.”  I couldn’t help the little seed of doubt from planting in my brain.  I had been away, maybe away for too long… maybe things went south when I moved away.  I tamped down that guilt rising up in me like stomach acid and looked back at my kid brother.  He had dark circles around his eyes.  “Charlie, when’s the last time you slept?”

“Don’t change the subject!” he snapped.  

“Listen, I don’t think Dad’s hurting Mom.  But I’ll talk to them.”

Charlie drove off somewhere that evening to be alone, and I confronted our mom.  I asked her gently, then seriously, if someone’s been hurting her.  There was a bruise on her arm.  

“Don’t be silly, Sammy, you know I bruise easy.”  Mom was always kind of a klutz.  I wilted in relief.  “Where is this coming from?  Your dad’s never laid a finger on me.”  

“I don’t know,” I lied, embarrassed.  I wasn’t Dad’s biggest fan, but that was a pretty serious thing to accuse him of.  I really hoped Mom had the tact never to tell him.

-

Everything was normal for a while.  Well, normal enough.  Work was horrible, my girlfriend Steph and I fought and made up, and we just went about life.  I checked Charlie’s facebook.  Gone.  Instagram.  Gone.  Everything gone, even his old myspace.

Lots of people go through that phase after turning eighteen.  They like a fresh start.  I tried to avoid getting worried or thinking about it.  

Until the phone call.

I woke up to Steph shoving me in bed.  “Pick up your phone,” she grumbled.  I had slept through three missed calls and she had enough.  

I tried calling back the unknown number, but the call wouldn’t go through.  “Probably a telemarketer,” I groaned, putting my phone down.  I was about to fall back asleep when it rang again.  With a sleepy sort of annoyance, I picked up the phone.

“You have a call from an Los Angeles County Jail from—” there was a pause, and Charlie’s shaky voice, “—Charlie Dawes.”  The computer voice again, “To pick up this call, press 1.  To reject this call, press—”  I nearly dropped the phone trying to press 1.

“Charlie?  Charlie!”  The other line was crackly, weak.  “Charlie, say something.”

“Sammy?”  My heart plummeted.  He sounded eleven years old, scared as hell.  “Sammy, can you come get me please?  Can you please get me?”

I got up and put on some pants, grabbing my keys.  “I’m on my way, where are you?”

I left Steph behind and drove over to the police station.  I called a bail bonds guy and paid $5,000, maxing out all my credit cards.  Charlie emerged from the back of the station, looking tinier, thinner, paler than the last time I saw him.  He looked up at me and smiled weakly.  

“Hey, Sammy.”

I wanted to sock him in the face.  “What the fuck Charlie.”  I gripped my brother.  “The cops, they said that you’re doing drugs in a park, said that you resisted arrest.”  I looked at my kid brother’s worn out face.  “What’s happening with you?”

He surged forward and hugged me again, tight.  “I’m okay, Sammy.  Thanks for bailing me out.”

-

I couldn’t stop thinking about Charlie, couldn’t stop wondering what the hell was going on.  It was clear that he was having some kind of mental break.  He didn’t have insurance and couldn’t afford to see a shrink, even if he wanted to.  I decided to leave my internship, get a real job, maybe try to convince him to see someone, pay for the sessions.  Every time I went home, which was more often than ever, he would look out the window in our bedroom, stare out into the backyard.  The glass was opaque with smudgy fingerprints.  The dark rings around his eyes were getting permanent, my little brother wasting away into whatever he was going through, not telling me about.

I was watching Netflix with Steph when I got the phone call.  It was from Mom.  She was sobbing hysterically and I couldn’t make out what she was saying.  Steph and I drove home, and when I walked through the door, Charlie was holding a knife.

“What the hell, Charlie?” I breathed, holding out my hands.  He was brandishing it towards Dad.  Mom was standing between them, weeping until she couldn’t breathe.  Dad was standing perfectly still.  He was terrified.  So was I.  

“No!” Steph yelled when I pushed her out the door, locking it behind me.  I wouldn’t let her get hurt in whatever was happening. 

“Sammy…” Charlie’s eyes were huge and freaked out, big as saucers.  He looked so thin.  “Sammy, you’re here!  I’m glad you’re here, Dad… I’m not letting him hurt anyone anymore.  No more.”

I stepped in between them, my parents behind me and Charlie in front, still holding that big kitchen knife.  “Charlie, Dad is not hurting Mom.  You’re hurting them, look at them, look at what you’re doing.”  I tried to stay calm.  “You’re the one standing there with the knife.”

“He’s been hurting her,” is all he kept saying.  “I know, I know, they told me, they told me that he was hurting her.”

I glanced back at my parents, then back to my brother.  “Who told you, Charlie?  Who told you?”

“The ghost.”  He pleaded with me with his eyes.  “That ghost, you know the one I mean, Sammy, that same one.”

I froze.  That same ghost that’s been following my kid brother his whole life.  I put down my hands.  “Charlie, that’s what’s been happening?  That ghost?”

“It keeps talking to me…”

“When did it start talking to you?”

“When it told me about that bastard!” Charlie shouted, pointing the knife at our Dad.  Dad closed his eyes, taking steadying breaths.

“Son, Son, I would never—”

“Shut up!” Charlie screamed.  He lunged forward and I stopped him, avoiding the blade.  “Shut up, don’t you lie to me, I know the truth!”

We heard sirens outside.  Steph must have called the cops.  We saw blue and red lights flickering through the windows into the living room.  

Charlie dropped the knife.  “No, no, no, no, no!” he cried, crashing to his knees.  “Who called them?  Why is this happening?”  He scratched at his scalp until his fingernails came back bloody.  “No…”  He looked up at me.  “You can’t let them take me.”

“Charlie—”

“You can’t let them take me!” he screamed.  That’s when the cops kicked down the door, guns drawn.  Charlie was on the floor with his hands up, so they tucked their weapons away and pulled him up, handcuffing him.

“Please, no,” Mom cried, running forward.  I pushed her back.  I saw enough TV to know that the cops weren’t above shoving my mom around.  

They led him out of the house.  Steph was talking to a cop, streaks of mascara running down her face, sniffling.  Neighbors were outside on their lawns, whispering to each other as they watched the cops lead my kid brother down the driveway and to the squad car. 

Charlie struggled and looked back at me, trying to run towards me.  “Sam… Sammy!”  He was sobbing now.  I was too, my face wet with tears.  “Sammy, please don’t let them take me… they’ll kill me in there, I know too much, the ghost… he told me too much, and now they’re going to kill me.”  When I didn’t move, he started shouting at the frightened neighbors.  “They’re going to kill me!  They’re going to kill me!  You’re never seeing me again, because they’re going to torture and kill me, I know too much!”

They opened up the squad car and was about to put him in.  He struggled one more time.  He looked straight at me.  “You did this to me,” he said.  “You’re the one who killed me, Sammy.”

-

After I got off the phone with the mental health facility he was admitted into, I went up to our bedroom and started digging around.  It didn’t feel like an invasion of space or privacy.  I needed to know what was going on.  

I pulled out a box from under his bed, and inside was a backpack with a lock.  I took a screwdriver and broke it open, and dumped the contents onto his bed.  

Notebook after notebook, filled up with notes and sketches and little drawings of the ghost.  The chains were now wrapped all around his body, his fat squeezing through the links, bloody and raw, mouth open and screaming.  There was so much in those notebooks, descriptions of people I’ve never seen or met before, celebrities, and even us.  He wrote that Steph was a whore, sleeping around with everyone, taking advantage of me. 

There was a folded up piece of paper and I smoothed it out on the bed.  It was a pen ink drawing of a spiral, little notes scribbled in the corners.  I couldn’t make heads or tails of it.  I caught one word.  Time portal.

Steph knocked on the door.  Her face was clean and makeup free, and she sat by my side.  She squeezed my arm.  “I love you,” she said quiet.  She squeezed harder.  “Don’t you ever leave me outside ever again.”

“Okay,” I whispered.  

“What is all this?” she asked, looking at the papers on the bed.  “God, what’s going on with your brother?”

I shook my head.  “I don’t… I don’t know.”  

At that moment, my cell phone rang.  I picked up.  “Hello?”

“Sammy?”

My heart jumped up into my throat.  “Charlie?”

“Sammy, I’m in the director’s office… I’m using their phone.  Sammy, how could you do this to me?”  He sniffled hard, choking back a sob.  “Don’t you know I’m going to die now?  Don’t you know that I’m done for?  They’re coming for me.”

“Who’s coming for your, Charlie?  The ghost?”  Steph gave me a weird look.  I ignored it.  

“No, no, not the ghost… No, it’s them.  THEM.  Don’t you get it?  They’re coming for me.”

I dug around in his papers, looking for any mention of them.  He drew hooded figures in a circle, symbols all over the sheet of lined paper.  Shadows.  “Them… Are they the ones in your notebooks, Charlie?”

The line was silent, expect for his heavy breathing.  “Oh, no.  Sam.  Sammy, no, no, you didn’t… You know now, now they’re gonna come for you too!  Listen, Stephanie works for them, don’t trust her, don’t trust anyone.  Stephanie, and Dad, all of them, they’re all working together!  The ghost is out there, it’s the only one looking out for me, and they want to get rid of it!”  I heard a faint voice in the back.  

“Hey, you’re not supposed to be using the phone!”

“No!” I held the phone away from my ear when Charlie shrieked.  “NO!  Don’t touch me!  Sammy!”  I heard a struggle.  “Sammy, please believe me, you believe me, you always have, just look at a pin hole camera, you’ll see what I mean, you’ll see what I mean—No!  Let me go!”  The line went dead.

I dropped the phone on the floor, put my head in my hands, and cried.  Steph stayed with me the whole night.  

-

I started seeing ghosts everywhere.  Out of the corner of my eye, feeling them behind me when I brush my teeth, hiding in corners at work.  I knew they were out there.  We always had strong empathy, and now that it’s affected Sam, I knew it affected me too.  No, I never really saw a ghost, but I believed Charlie.  

Steph was losing her mind with me, but she stuck by my side.  I was suspicious, all the time, wondering what Charlie meant.  I pushed her away once and she hit her head on the kitchen cupboard door, left open by accident.  With a bruise on her cheek, she screamed at me.  “You fucking asshole.”

Remorse washed over me and I felt weak.  “Steph, I’m sorry, I’m so fucking sorry, this thing with Charlie’s got me all fucked up.”

“Yeah, you fucking think?”  She pressed a bag of frozen peas to her face, wincing.  “You realize my friends and family and boss are gonna thing you hit me, right?”

“I basically did,” I muttered.  “I’m sorry.”

Charlie kept on calling, every night when he got access to a phone.  The 5150 would keep him in the mental health facility until he was better, but he wasn’t getting any better.  He wasn’t getting better.  He would just call me every night, telling me that he was going to die and it was all my fault.  I started losing weight, a lot of it.  I was turning into Charlie, getting all fucked up.

I finally pulled myself together enough to tell Steph about the pinhole camera.  She agreed to help me, called up a friend who was a camera enthusiast.  Jeff came by on a Saturday night to help us in exchange for a couple of beers and the whole story.

“Heavy, man, fucking heavy.”

I finished my beer.  “You can say that again.”

I sent Mom and Dad on a date night (or really, Steph did, I was still paying back credit card debt from bailing Charlie out of jail), and Jeff, Steph, and I set up the camera in my old bedroom.  “I want it a few different places.  One of Charlie’s bed, another of just the window, and one looking out the window into the backyard.”

“Specific,” Jeff remarked, setting it all up.  I didn’t quite get how pinhole cameras worked.  I was more of an iphone point and shoot guy, but if Steph trusted him then I did too.

While Jeff did his thing, Steph and I sat in the living room.  Her bruise was a gross greenish color, and every time I looked at it, I was filled with immeasurable guilt.  She held my hand, rubbing her thumb back and forth.  

“I was…” I swallowed hard.  “I was supposed to take care of him.”

“You did.”

“I didn’t,” I said.  “I should have picked up on it sooner.  I should have known that there was something up with him.”

“Sam, you couldn’t have picked up on him becoming sick.”

I looked up at her.  “No, he’s not sick, he’s right.”  Steph stopped rubbing my hand.  “I know about the ghost.  He’s been talking about it his whole life, our whole lives.  I… believe him.”  I did.  I really did.

Steph blinked hard twice and clutched my hand.  “Okay, Sammy.”  She inhaled through her nose and closed her eyes, then exhaled slowly.  When she opened her eyes, they were teary.  “Okay.”

Jeff poked his head out from upstairs.  “Hey.  You’re gonna wanna see this.”

Jeff had taken over the bathroom and made it his own darkroom.  The pictures he had taken were drying on the sink.  I took a deep breath, knowing that I was finally going to see what my brother had seen, what he had been seeing his whole life.  I could return to him and tell him, I know now, I see what you see now.

I finally looked at the pictures.  And there was nothing.

-

“Bi-polar disorder with psychosis,” the doctor explained.  She was very nice about it, didn’t look pitying, which I think my parents appreciated.  We sat together in the tiny office that was too cheery for its own good while she explained it to us.

“Charlie is at the right age to be diagnosed.  It happens late teens, early twenties usually.  Is there a history of mental illness in the family?”  Mom always said we were a family of empaths.  I nodded.   

“Yeah.”

“And… He’s been talking about how he needs to smoke marijuana.  Did you know that he had a med card?”  I didn’t, but I thought back to the first arrest.  I thought he was just being a kid, smoking a little pot in the park.  Turns out it’s absurdly easy for anyone to get a medical marijuana card; go to a shitty doctor on Venice beach and say that you have anxiety.  “It turns out that he used wax and a lot of it.”

“Wax?” Mom asked, wringing her hands.

“Yes.  It’s a very potent drug, a highly concentrated form of marijuana.  Too much of that and it can actually alter the chemistry of your brain.  This kind of paranoia, the fear, the hallucinations… People with a history of mental illness in their families are more susceptible to it.”  She sighed.  “It won’t happen to everyone, but whether anyone likes it or not, marijuana is a drug, and when used in great excess, it’s not good for you.”

“And it’s permanent?” Dad asked.  He was keeping it together like he always had, stoic in the face of anything.  “My boy… this is permanent?”

“There’s really no telling,” she admitted.  “Maybe someday he’ll be fine.  The thing is that we don’t know if he’s bi-polar on his own, or if it’s the drugs.  If it’s just the drugs, there’s a chance that his brain will repair itself in a few years.  But if it’s not… well, we can’t take the risk of taking him off his meds quite yet.

“Well, he’s in great hands,” she assured us.  She smiled disarmingly.  “We’re taking good care of him.  As soon as he’s no longer a danger to himself or to others, he’ll be released.”  She clicked her pen.  “Do you have any questions for me?  Anything I should know?”

“Yeah, actually.”  I cleared my throat.  “He’s… he’s been talking about a ghost ever since he was a kid.  I, uh.  I always believed him.  Is that… is he…” I swallowed.  “Was that an early sign?”

The doctor sighed.  “It could have been.  Or it could have been an overactive imagination.  Or maybe it really was a ghost?”  The joke fell flat and she shifted around, uncomfortable.  “There’s no telling.  Most of the time, there aren’t really any warning signs.  It just… happens.”  She gave me a meaningful look.  “You shouldn’t blame yourself.”

But I did.  Charlie was given meds to control his psychosis three times a day, and when they discovered that he was hiding them under his tongue and spitting them out, they started him on a different med that dissolved as soon as it was in his mouth.  Sometimes he was strapped down.  On good days he would get to go into the rec room and watch TV.  Some thug punched him in the nose and in that one day he missed one of his meds, he lost it again.  He’s still in there.

He calls me at night still, crying softly on the phone, whispering about how I did this to him, about how it’s my fault.  I don’t believe in the ghost anymore, the one that Charlie said was outside our window our whole lives.  I don’t believe in being an empath anymore, don’t believe in ghosts or God or really anything.  But I do believe Charlie, and I believe he’s right.  It is my fault. 

I should have seen all the signs, but I was too busy believing in ghosts.  I should have told him to stop smoking so much pot, should have told him that the ghost wasn’t real, should have gone back home when the signs were there, forced him to go see a shrink and stopped this all before it was too late.  I was so stupid.

“Sammy, Sammy, Sammy,” he cried on the phone.  “Sammy, I’m dead now.”

I see it all the time, when Dad first handed me baby Charlie, said, “This is your kid brother, you take care of him now, he’s yours now.”  It haunts me every night, every waking moment, like a phone call at night, like a ghost in the yard. 

When I visit him, he’s behind a window, not safe to him to be so close to others yet even though he’s heavily medicated, blank eyes staring back at me. We sit in silence, behind smudged glass, and I finally see it, what Charlie’s been seeing for so long.  It’s just a different kind of ghost.

4p872m,1,2016-06-21,Behind in CS classes as an incoming junior in college. What to do right now in the summer to catch up and get an internship next summer?,reddismycolor,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4p872m/behind_in_cs_classes_as_an_incoming_junior_in/,"So past 2-3 years hasn't been great for me. I have been changing myself as my old self was not working. I was lazy and didn't know what I wanted to do in life. I just smoked weed and had bad habits. I am working on healthy habits and its good now. I am more motivated and want to learn. I am finally in a better place. 

ANYWAYS TO GET TO THE POINT... I failed my 2nd CS java/object oriented class bc of bad place and stuff. Also, I THINK (correct me if I'm wrong) that most or at least a lot of internships and jobs use java and require good java skills. So I am thinking of practicing java to get an internship for next summer and to do well in class. I was learning swift to create an iphone app bc I have an iphone and creating apps seem a fun way to be creative and learn and to have side projects (good for resume and maybe an internship? idk). But now I may want to switch to java, but sadly I don't have an android. So are there other development creative type java stuff i can practice on. Also, is this the right choice to learn java to get an internship? What else should I work on to get an internship for next summer? I really want one so i will work hard to get one, but i def prefer to learn in a fun way and a way to be creative.  Last summer I worked on some java database/spring with my dad, but he explained most of it and I barely remember it. Thanks!

TL;DR: To get an internship next summer... Should I practice my java (only took 2 CS java classes) or learn something new like swift and have fun with it and learn? If I should practice Java, what should I do to practice? Preferably, something fun and creative like creating apps for android except I don't have android.

EDIT: why did this get downvoted :l I just wanted some advice."

This is not the first time I actually interviewed at this place either.

* The first time I interviewed there was for an internship for undergraduate. I was denied an offer because of my lack of experience.

* The second time was for a full-time operations coordinator position at the same fitness center. Because the location was 4 hours from where I was living at the time, I was interviewed by 3 people on the same day. I was well-prepared and confident in my interview. They said I had a great interview and should hear back in a week or two. In the meantime, they asked for 5 references, which was not hard for me. I had 2 references from school, 2 from my internship, and 1 from my current job. They all put in good word for me and the gym actually checked the references. After a week, I sent them an email asking about my candidacy, and they said they were still interviewing. After another week, I sent another email and they called me back saying they found another candidate better suited for the position. I was really confident I had the job this time, but looking back at the time, I understood their decision.

* The third time was for a entry-level position that they were hiring for the summer. I actually had applied for the position about 2 weeks after I was declined an offer for the operations coordinator position. I didn't really expect to hear back from them. The manager actually said they were looking to hire 3-4 more people, 1 full-time and 3 part-time. Again, I went to the interview even more prepared as I knew what type of questions to expect. I had a solid interview and was told I should hear back by the end of the week. He told me I seemed like a reliable and hard worker. At the end of the week, I received the email mentioned above. 

At this point, I'm just thinking about all the reasons I was not given an offer. I thought maybe it was because I wanted to be full-time. If offered the job, I would have to relocate so full-time was practically necessary for me. I called my interviewer to thank him for taking the time to consider me but he didn't answer, so I left him a voicemail. I was hoping for him to call back so I could get some advice on what I could do to improve my candidacy the next time around.

Oh well, as my job search continues on, I will actually apply to this place again. Hopefully, 4th time's a charm?"

I completed a year long internship at a different company so I have some knowledge on what to expect. I've noted the differences I could come up with in the table below.

Factor| Larger Company| Smaller Company
---|---|----
Size| 2k techies local and 15k worldwide|~500 techies
Technology| A little bland, using their own frameworks for most of the development pipeline. I'd probably end up working on the same project for a year or more.| The tech is very diverse and the tech exposure can be considered a lot better. Project cycles are a lot smaller.
Facilities| Awesome infrastructure, free food, etc| Mediocre at best, inside looks a little dated, no extra facilities
Culture/Work-Life | Relaxed from what I hear | Very hectic and a lot of work
Salary | Good starting, fast increments based on performance | Good starting, slower increments
Interview Process | Checked my technical skills to a moderate extent but focused a lot on my interpersonal skills | Mostly focused on my tech

Personally I think working at the smaller company would be better for my career as I'm just starting and the more I learn, the more my value will increase and I feel like working at the smaller company will make that happen exponentially. The larger one is more like a 'settle down' company and might make finding another job a little more challenging if I end up leaving after working there for a few years.

So I just finished my first year as a cs major and have been programming pretty often in my free time over the past few years but have definitely felt the effects of distractions, such as computer games, social media,  ect, while trying to focus on my code that I just find very hard to ignore, especially when I've hit a wall in my projects.

I am now a rising sophomore with a summer internship that involves some programming, and really want to get serious about learning on my own at home with little distraction as possible.

Does anyone have what they'd consider generic good methods/tips of keeping yourself focused/motivated to programming on your own projects and keeping distractions out of your head? I'd prefer not to use /r/getmotivated's memes for this.

I'll try to make the story brief:

I graduated 5 years ago with a BA in CS from a reputable liberal arts college in the local area. I had also minored in multiple sciences, and some internship opportunities found me ultimately employed with a local research institute as a research assistant. A small part of this job is managing users and studies for a data collection software, but beyond that and the occasional IT help as the ""computer guy"" in the office, I wouldn't say I'm doing much of anything with my degree here.

It's been 5 years since I've done much coding at all other than an occasional batch file (so basically none), but at this point I'm starting to look at better paying jobs where I can take advantage of that degree and get back to doing some of the things that made me choose the degree in the first place. I was inspired by a friend who sent me a job opening doing database management. I don't meet the criteria for that one, but it really got me thinking that I could be doing something I enjoy more and that took better advantage of my degree.

So I want to start preparing to apply for jobs more like that. In the past (many years ago at this point) I did just a bit of software development for Android, and a bit of web development for the college where I did work just a small amount with some databases and SQL.

It's honestly been so long that I need to start by refreshing the basics and then, ideally, get to a point where I really understand the material. Learning about Database management would be a good point to start, but I've also wanted to familiarize myself with C# for a long time (learned Java and C++ along with a bevy of others in school).

So, for those who stuck around - where should I begin? Are there any online or offline materials I can use to help myself get back to being able to use my CS degree in the workplace? What should I do to really prepare myself to enter this job market?

Thanks so much!"

I have 2 questions. 

I know my company is going to offer me a job after the summer to start after I graduate. I do not want to work for this company. There's a list of reasons,  the main reason why I am still here is because they let me work part time during the school year. Also it pays more than I could get anywhere else. That is until now... I just got a call from a recruiter from a major company that wants me to come in for an interview. They are asking me to bring a list of references. 

I want to ask my supervisors at my current company for a reference, but I'm not really sure how. They have expressed hiring me on but bc of technicalities they can't offer me anything. 

Lastly if I figure out the first part how do I straight up leave my current place? The other company would have me start ASAP.

I am Computer science masters student in USA. Honestly, I didn't learn much in my undergrad but always loved programming so decided to do masters. I am still unclear about my specialization and kind of job to do after masters.

When I started my masters, I was interested in AI/ML so I took relevant courses but as I dived deeper into it, I didn't like it. Same happened for Computer Security, Database and Game development. So far in masters, I loved functional programming, algorithms, computer systems related courses.

During my undergrad, I worked on machine learning and image processing as an intern, it was okay but I didn't love it. During my masters, I had an internship offer from a ""big 4"" company for software developer intern but I decided to work as a Systems Engineering Intern at a robotics company because I like ""systems"". Although I like the job, I don't enjoy it. The systems internship feels more ""technology"" oriented rather than what I have studied because for any given problem, I already know how to solve it and all I have to do is to find out how to implement the solution using the given technology stack/API

So I am looking for a kind of job that involves utilizing what I have studied and where efficiency/algorithms/ds matters because that would keep things interesting/challenging for me. Also, will master specialization matter while looking for such job? 

PS: I am planning to take Computer Networks/cloud computing related course for my final semester. I don't know whether it matters but my current GPA is 3.4

I've heard back from a few companies so far but have not received any offers after the interviews. Additionally, I've been getting fewer and fewer interviews in the recent weeks which is beginning to worry me.

I don't have any internships or previous work experience but I do have multiple projects and 1 team project from a capstone course, all of which are listed on my resume. I enjoy making games during my spare time so the majority of my projects are games. I also include my github link and my portfolio link.

Will be a 20 year old Junior in the fall at Arizona State University majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in Networking and Computer Systems Security. Currently have a 3.26 gpa (was originally computer science but math/programming classes wrecked me). In this major I take 7 networking classes, 6 security classes, and a few UNIX courses and some other IT classes (all heavy project based)

Link to major map here: https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/roadmaps/ASU00/TSIFTBS/null/ALL/2016

My school (ASU) also has a 4+1 plan where I can get my master’s degree in Information Technology a year after I graduate (classes senior year count for dual credit) and I just need a 3.2 gpa to quality. 

I also have an internship where I currently work with networking and managing servers and windows active directory. Additionally, I want to get into information security or network security and will be studying for the security+ cert in my own time. Plan on getting my SSCP, then CISSP when I can.


Basically, I plan on getting my master’s in IT after my bachelors with the 4+1 program, already have internship, and getting the security+ as an undergrad and more certs as time goes on.


Is there anything I can improve on to maximize my chances in IT? Should I play with a homelab or read more books in my free time for networking/security? I would like to do that, however these classes take up a plethora of time and I’d rather spend my free time on other things."

I had an internship in data science at a pittsburgh startup, worked on little projects and did a couple hackathons and all that. I had an *excellent* job offer from a pittsburgh company. However, I turned it down in order to start to find a career in the UK for personal reasons, thinking that, even though the pay is lower and i might not be able to find as high-quality work, *somebody* would want to hire me.

Well, in the last few months, I've faced non-stop rejection and silence from every company I've applied to in Scotland and England, I got diagnosed with a chronic disability, and other family drama has been going on. I've fallen out of practice, and am in a massive rut. The company that made me the great offer already filled the position.

I'm now much more open to finding work here in the US until I'm able to make my UK dream happen, but have no clue where to start. At school, I just had to go to events and meet people to work my way into an interview, but now I'm miles away from any city.

My questions are, 

1. how do I find companies looking for entry-level/junior software engineers this late in the game, when I'm not really near any city?

2. (for anybody who knows) Is there anything I'm possibly doing wrong with applications in the UK? I read that your best bet is to move there and then find a job, but that would be financially difficult for me. So, with some help from a student there, I've been applying to lots of openings on job boards and from company websites, but getting nothing back.

I know I'm not going to be able to find a great job without networking into it, but I'm having a lot of trouble finding much of anything at all on job boards in the US... "

As of now I am going into second year in the fall and am currently doing a small internship at a local website development company. I'm not doing anything really huge at the internship besides using WordPress and skimming through the PHP and trying to fix problems or create new functionality.

The courses biggest problem for me is the lack of algorithms or data structures.

I am just wondering what would be the best things for me to learn on my own to give me the best chance at getting a job at somewhere decent in southern Ontario. Right now I think I am going to learn Python and some more web development tools like node or angular.

I landed an internship through my school at a finance place, which I was ecstatic about. Also, there was a mention about possible payment down the line, which intrigued me even more. However, one of my classmates told me that the internship wasn't that good and they basically would use you to enter data into spreadsheets and other ""boring"" stuff. How should I approach the internship knowing this, and how could I get the most out of my experience. Also, do you think they would pay me if I continue for 1-2 years?"

I'm due to graduate next fall when I'll be turning 27. I spent 4 years in the USAF doing IT networking and support and now I'm in the Guard doing the same jobs. I have the opportunity to take a great paying, flexible job for the Guard while I'm in college that will allow me to do homework at the job, etc. 

The downside if I choose to apply for this job is that I won't have any time to juggle an internship, college, and this job all at once. The upside is that it will help my financial situation by a lot while also offering a flexible schedule and IT networking experience.

So my question is, should I pursue software development internships that won't be as financially stable as this job or will my 8 years of IT networking/experience help me in any way find a job without an internship after I graduate?

**TL;DR:** How important is software development experience in comparison to 8 years of general IT experience when applying for entry level dev jobs?

I'm going to graduate next spring (May '17). I have a few options, and I would like to see what you guys would do in my situation.

**Quick Facts:**

* Country:     USA
* School:       Public Flagship University in the Southeast
* Major:        Mechanical Engineering
* Minor:        Computer Science
* GPA:          3.6 (4.0 over my last 3 semesters)
* GRE:          TBD this Fall
* Currently a co-op at a small engineering firm. I am in the middle of my third rotation right now.
* Formerly a drafting/design intern at one of the largest private manufacturers in my state.
* I will be a mechatronics undergrad research assistant this fall. I don't have any details on the project yet.

**Interests:**
I love diving into complex problems and trying to solve them. My favorite classes so far are: machine design, programming, and controls. Since I like these areas so much, I'm looking into the automation/mechatronics/robotics field. I'm playing around with an Arduino Uno, an autonomous robot kit, and the Unreal Game Engine during my free time.

**Career Options:**

* Stay with my current firm
   * Pros: I could not ask for better coworkers, I would be eligible to sit for the PE in 2020, and the fields that we service are very stable.
   * Cons: There is absolutely no upward mobility here. It would take a decade to get above a ~$70k salary, if I ever did.  The benefits are not good.  We have a very high turnover rate. Few people make it more than a couple of years. There is no support for a higher degree. Most of my time is spent doing sales, accounts payable, and general business work. I have done very little engineering in the past few weeks. I appreciate the systems we design, but I like other fields better.

* Move to a larger firm after graduation, if any positions are available
   * Pros: I hope that with experience, possibly a PE, and maybe even a higher degree will command a higher salary after a few years. I would hopefully be more involved in actual engineering, and I would have more fields to choose for specialization.
   * Cons: I don't want to get lost in the crowd or pigeonholed into doing the same calculations over and over again. 

* Go back to school for my Master's
   * Pros: I love learning! During my undergrad experience, I learned to enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to solve complex problems. I talked to a few of my TAs last semester, and they told me that their Master's degree opened doors for them that they never would have had with just a bachelor's. 
   * Cons: I might lose money in the long run. Also, 3 AM study sessions are getting really old. I *have* learned to manage my time a lot better, so I only had a couple of these last semester.


Now that you know my situation, what would you do if you were in my shoes? Do you have any advice? Thanks in advance for commenting!"

- I graduated from college a couple years ago and got an internship at a small company, which I'll call X. It lasted about 4 mos and they made me a (low-ball) full time offer. I turned them down despite wanting to work there to take a much higher paying job


- The much higher paying job turned out to be awful and 6 weeks later company X offered me significantly more. I took their offer and stayed with the company another 8 months, for a total of about 1 year at the firm.


- I left company X because they coerced me into signing a document which would have given them access to my savings accounts, starting at a new company last August (no gap in employment).


At my new job, I have discovered what I want to do for a career: software development. Right now I am sort of an auxiliary developer who gets a little overflow work along with my other work. I recently received an offer to become a full software dev and am not sure if I should take it because I will have only been at the new job from last August until now. Knowing my work history, how long do you think I need to stay in my current role to make it look good for a resume?"
4pexys,1,2016-06-23,Which grad school plan has a better outlook and outcome: Finish MPH (with MA) - or - Grad. Certificate in Public Health (with MA) plus Nanodegree in ML ?,Flintblood,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/4pexys/which_grad_school_plan_has_a_better_outlook_and/,"MPH  - vs -  Grad Cert. in public health + ML Nanodegree 
(SHORT VERSION)  

  

  
I completed a Master's degree in Anthropology degree in 2013, and at that time I was about  
half-way through my MPH coursework. I expected to finish the MPH in 2015, but it did not happen.  

  
My funding ended the summer of 2014 and I did not get a new funding package for that fall.  
So I stalled my progress, life got more complex due to a wonderful new baby, and more.    

    

Here is what remained in 2014:  
1. Practicum experience  
2. Two upper level courses   
3. Writing and defending my thesis  

  
  
I finished my practicum course in 2015, and completed the analysis and beginning of results  
reporting for my thesis in late 2015. I also worked in an additional internship, applied for PhD  
programs and full time jobs, and became lead parent more or less for domestic baby duties   
including wellness visits and sick care.  

  
There are two ways I can salvage my time in the MPH program.   
  

  
Plan A - Take the two final MPH courses, and thesis course credit to defend my thesis. The total  
cost is estimated to be at least $5500 if not more for the three courses (9 credit hrs.). Balancing  
life and doing this, 2017 is a more realistic completion date. I could apply for funding, but getting  
it is unlikely now since I’ve been out of the program for a year.  

  

  
Plan B - Roll my existing coursework into a Graduate Certificate in Public Health; and start a  
Nanodegree in one of the Data Science related programs (Data Analyst, Machine Learning).  
Total cost will be ~ $2990 for the Nanodegree Plus if I can finish in 10 months (next April).  
That also comes with a job guarantee or tuition refund.  

  

  
Current experience:  
R programming for 2 years  
Over three years of practiced quantitative analysis  
Python - self-taught w/ Coursera and other sources; 1 year  
Front End Dev work; 2-3 years  

  

  
FWIW, I am leaning towards Plan B. If I can break into Data Analyst then Data Scientist work,  
then I think I will have more choices and options for less $$.  


  
Finishing the MPH will require taking 2 on campus courses, which I would have to coordinate  
with the new job I plan to find any day now.  

  
I have more to add about the pros and cons as I see them, but I would rather wait and read  
the redditizen responses first.

During the second semester I battled with health and mental health issues. Nonetheless, I managed to score an internship with a bank in technology division which I am happy with.

There are issues that cloud my every day happiness though. Starting in my 2nd year, I took a QA(manual testing) role to pay for living expenses and also gain some experience. I played with some automation there that I proudly have on my CV. I have not thought much about it but now see a dangerous trend emerging: as an experiment I uploaded my CV on JobSite. I received calls and emails from recruiters who offered me QA and QA automation roles only. Even then I thought, ""oh well, those guys want to fill a role for QA"". Yesterday, I was assigned to an operations division of the bank. Yes, operations. Note that UK banks do not have projects planned for incoming interns and I asked multiple times during interviews what I would be working on and technologies used. The interview involved a little bit of coding, oop questions, databases but nothing difficult. I am not against learning something like DevOps for a couple of months but...

This is my last opportunity to have an internship and if it is not a fully-fledged software engineering internship, I see myself being pigeonholed into automation/devops roles just as it happened before. I have to come out clean though: I am not the most passionate coder, the kind of guy who went with CS because I am interested and have nothing else that hooks my interest, maybe biological sciences. I struggle with coding assignments at school, they were not easy though. I have a couple of school assignments and a mini-compiler project on Github but looking at GitHub stats I could see that all those recruiters never registered as visitors, i.e. no one cared that I want to code in the future. They only saw experience as QA and went with that.

I understand that any technical internship is better than nothing but I feel trapped in impure dev roles and cannot bail out from this internship for money, lease arrangements and just plain experience to be gained. I admit that this sub is a goldmine and people frequently tell you as it is: internships are vital but then I see guys posting threads being pigeonholed and unable to get graduate dev role. I could not sleep whole night having found out my role starting next week. Not because of new stuff to learn but fear of ending up not where I'd ideally want to start a career.

It seems to me that projects that are not live, i.e. app on AppStore that could be downloaded and played with does not count because no one even cared to inspect code I had. Including non-pure dev roles on CV seem to yield calls for roles I don't want.

What can I do to mitigate situation or is it too late?"

--I am a newly graduated highschool student working as a summer IT intern at a relatively large business. My recently assigned project is to map out the Ethernet jacks (using their already established labels, D1-D106) on the floor plan, also noting their corresponding switch and switchport. 


--I went throughout the office, recording each subsequent ethernet jack and it's label. I found that while some labels go in order (D21,D22,D23), some number seem out of place and I assume they were additions to the original layout. 


--After finding all of the ethernet jacks I could, I found their switch and switchport numbers by looking at the switch itself. I have put these into an excel document and have started to create the floor plan accordingly.

--My issue is that I am missing some ethernet jacks. I can view all a-active connections because the switch is a managed switch, and the connections are labeled by switch&gt;switchport by default in the virtual switch manager. I have added names/locations to all connections I identified, but there are active connections that I have obviously missed during my ethernet port search.

--So now, I know how many ethernet jacks I should have, but I don't know how to locate them. The only things I can think of is that there are extra ports behind desks that I obviously missed, but going throughout the entire office and moving each piece of furniture in hopes of finding ethernet jacks seems pretty unrealistic. I also believe that some of these connections may be printers.

--I talked to the engineering department, and they believe that there used to be a drawing of the floor plan with ethernet jacks labeled, but it seems to be missing. You can see why that drawing would've been extremely beneficial to me and why I am now lost as to how I should approach this.

--I was thinking about gathering the MAC and IP addresses of all connections, but I am unable to do this through the switch manager. The software simply doesn't support it. I believe my superior may be able to find a way to do this though, as he's gathered lists of MAC and IP addresses connected to switches in the past for other buildings. 

--Does anyone have any ideas as to how I should approach this?

4ph119,7,2016-06-23,Am I in the wrong field or am I just lazy/undisciplined?,wrongfield1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4ph119/am_i_in_the_wrong_field_or_am_i_just/,"I recently completed a BSc in CS with 2.7 GPA. I did two short internships in summers. I didn't code anything complex in my free time but I built some apps to make money. I enjoy building something but I didn't enjoy school. I didn't enjoy learning CS either. I feel like I learned most of the things at school to pass exams. Then I forgot what I learned because I wasn't interested anymore. My feelings toward CS is bad. It is because it is too complex and understanding things requires me to not be lazy. I don't like to think hard. But I enjoy building something with the knowledge I have and with some googling. 

Now I gotta find a job. To pass interviews, I need to learn some algorithms and data structures. I need to learn fundementals of a language because I don't remember what I learned at school. I can't just start studying. When I start, everything seem so hard and there is like a ton of stuff I need to learn. How the hell am I gonna learn these tons of stuff let alone learning them well and remembering them well? I also need to practice. I need to write a lot more code, regularly. It is just so much. So I give up or get bored. The point where I wanna reach seems so far that studying seems pointless.

I've been a lazy and impatient person whole my life. Except a few years where I was quite discliplined. Nowadays, I sometimes sleep at 2am, sometimes 5am. I eat random stuff at random times. I take shower every other day. I'm at home all the time. I sleep 7hrs to 10hrs a day. My friends are all busy and not available so I'm a bit lonely too. I gained some weight. No SO. I play games and watch shows because I have nothing else to do. So I'm living a random life at the moment. Some days, I wake up early, tidy up my room, exercise, eat good, sit down to study but I give up again.

Is my problem being lazy and undisciplined or am I in the wrong field? Is there a way to figure this out by myself in a week by doing some sort of experiment? Any advice?"

However, I can't imagine ever working full time for the company I'm at right now.  I'm a super social guy and the vibes are so anti social. People are very nice and willing to help with work related things; I ask a lot of questions and people always take time to help me but other than that I have no interaction with anyone.

The thing is, they got me using CheckPoint Smart Event Logs and I'm having a hard time grasping how to get around and try to find the source IP of the infection or device that is causing malicious requests.

Does anyone have experience with the software, or can provide tips on how to track malicious traffic, malicious DNS Requests, etc?

This past Wednesday was my first day of summer and I was definitely itching to go out with friends and unwind. I got a hold of one of my long time friends, let's call her Sara, and asked if she wanted to get together for a drink. She said she was down so we decided to meet at her work which was right across the street from the bar we were going to. Let me preface by saying that, Sara was not my first choice of friends to hang out with. Although Sara has done nice things for me as a friend, she neglected to come to my graduation dinner or my birthday dinner. I didn't really care about the events that were being celebrated, it was just the principle of the thing. I even made sure to schedule the dinners after her work hours so she could come. Without explanation, Sara just said she wouldn't be making it out. 
This really bummed me out because I quiet literally only have three close friends. One of them moved to Texas recently, one of them is a single mom of infant twins, and the other one is Sara. So when it comes to parties or get togethers, it's noticeable if someone doesn't show up, especially being that one of the three doesn't live in the same state. Anyway, Sara told me that she would, ""take me out"" at some point to make up for not being there for me. That happened over 4 weeks ago and I hadn't heard from her until I hit her up Wednesday night to go get a drink. I felt resentful but maybe she had stuff going on, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. 

Alright, so I meet Sara at her work and it's closing time so some of her coworkers are still in the office. Sara decides to invite them out to get a drink with us, and they accept. Now, I usually don't mind that kind of thing, but I was already feeling uneasy, and then being the only one who didn't know everybody made me feel equally uncomfortable. Sara also didn't ask if it was ok  with me, so it made our interactions feel much more impersonal and superficial. One of her coworkers, let's call her Tanya, dominated the conversation. Tanya is an advertising marketer at the company and her repertoire was fierce and intense. She kept talking about how to increase profit for the company they worked for and increase her dollar signs (she raised her pointed fingers dramatically in the air while saying this). Upon asking her more about what her job entailed, she talked down to me like I was just another ""gullible sucker,"" (her words) who could be manipulated into buying some garbage by using key google phrases and psychological manipulation. Among other snarky and demeaning conversations, I had to tune out the conversation that continued between Sara and Tanya. While they were talking about work place drama with a previous employee, I kept looking at this group of people that were hanging outside of the bar. They looked like they were having a good conversation so I tried to pretend I was in their shoes. Being together with them felt like eternity and all I wanted was to leave.

I left the bar feeling like all the energy and happiness had been drained out of me. I felt like, one of my only friends was someone I was really starting to despise. I'd already been questioning my friendship with her and whether or not I even cared if we talked anymore, but last night made that feeling so much more real. I came home and vented to my boyfriend about how I felt and he tried to make me feel better, but it's the next day and I still feel empty inside. 

Here's the real kicker, the company that Sara and Tanya work for is the company that I'll be starting an internship with on Monday. I'm taking this internship because I'd like to learn about graphic design and open up some more doors for myself but I'm getting to a point where I already am over it. I don't feel like I can talk to Sara about any of this because I don't want to be part of an office drama or stir things up the week before I am scheduled to start at this job. I guess what it all honestly comes down to is that I feel an emptiness inside because I feel like that friendship I once had with Sara is, and has been, over for a long time, and coping with that has been hard. I don't know if I am looking for advice or just to vent, but I needed to get this out.

I'd also like  to mention I'm keeping some details intentionally vague, as I don't want people to figure out it's me.

So recently I've been looking for a new job, with a bit less than two years of experience in the IT field this shouldn't be a problem. I send out resumes, and eventually I get a response from someone in a field I'd love to get into. We talk for a bit, I mention how I'm still a student and that I need to do an internship as a requirement for my school, but I've been working almost two years in the field already, he then tells me how some people working for him doing basic stuff get about 8k/month (about 3k/month more than I was getting before I quit), so I start thinking ""I get to learn AND get payed to enter a field I've been wanting to break into for ages! This is AWESOME!""

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I've already quit my former job, and have been at it a couple days when I realize... I haven't asked my new employer how much I'm gonna get payed, fuck!
So I talk to him:
-""Hey, how much am I going to get payed?""
-""800 a month""
-""As a trial?""
-""Well, we'll see how much I can get from your work once I sell it""
-""Emmm... ok?""

And now I'm feeling like a fucking moron. I got a job offer from a bank I sent out a resume to this morning, unfortunately this is the last week to put in the paperwork for my mandatory internship. FML.

TLDR; Ask how much you're getting payed before you accept, even if they should pay you more or everybody in the company gets more."

Getting a BS in CS, good idea for an experienced developer?",rebootquestion,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4pj6os/considering_going_back_to_school_for_a_2nd/,"Hi, I have worked three jobs at three different companies, two of those startups. In between those jobs I spent some time unemployed. Startups had financial hardships, laid me off. I never have looked for work while employed, and I never received more than one offer at once.

I have a Bachelor's in Fine Arts and most of what I know about programming was self taught. I might be reaching a plateau in my career in my 7th year since graduation. The reason I say that is that I am no longer able to close deals with companies in getting job offers. It's probably because the expectations for a programmer as they approach senior status is probably rising at a higher rate than the skill sets I have to meet those expectations.

So I am considering getting a 2nd Bachelors, in CS so I can finally *do it right*. Learn data structures and algorithms, all the other core classes, get an internship at a good company (maybe Intel) and then get a cushy corporate job that has all the benefits and all that jazz. Hit the ol' reset button and rewind back the career clock (I'm past 30 now but ageism doesn't faze me- I still look like a young soul).

Since education is the only thing that I *know* how to build on that's why I'm asking about education. Should I go back to school? I know that financial aid won't come as easy as last time, but I'd go through it if it puts me as a legit developer on the map. While pursuing my second Bachelors can I skip gen eds since I already did them last time? Also can I still get a good job while attending school, one that lets me afford an apartment?"

As such, I'm working for a local big name here.

My question is, do I mention something about these, and why I didn't take a job with them? I just feel that looking at my resume gives the indication that I didn't perform as well, and that's why they didn't want me.

- The much higher paying job turned out to be awful and 6 weeks later company X offered me significantly more. I took their offer and stayed with the company another 8 months, for a total of about 1 year at the firm.


- I left company X because they coerced me into signing some legally questionable documents, starting at a new company last August (no gap in employment).

I have an incredible interest and am already somewhat into my CS minor (2 classes of 7) and am still in the realm of potentially expanding that minor to a major within my four years of school. If I were to go the major it would increase my workload by about 50-75%, but would it be worth it for pursuing the career I want? I am not very familiar with the recruiting process for a software dev internship (especially in the finance space) for someone with a CS minor.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: My finance major is somewhat locked because if I switch to a CS Major (alone or with a finance minor) I would have to transfer college within the university and end up being a year behind.

1) NTU scholarship
2) BCA scholarship
3) No scholarship

Choices are explained in the full post below.
I am not sure of which decision is the best choice, so it'll be good if you are able to provide me with some advice!

____________________________________________________

Hi guys, thanks for taking some time to read my post and hopefully be able to provide me some advice on deciding how am I going to do my undergrad studies. Hoping to get advice from fellow redditors that are on scholarship or been on scholarship before.

I am a full-time student in SP studying engineering, into my final year. My CGPA is about 3.8 and if I am able to get GPA of around 3.95 - 4.0 for 2 more semesters, I can graduate with a CGPA of 3.85. 

With my current CGPA, I am quite certain that I will be able to get into a university easily. However, with the scholarships offered, I am not if taking up the scholarship will be a wiser choice.

Below are 3 choices that I have to choose from. If there is a 4th choice and you think it's better, do comment on the post :)

1) NTU College Scholarship
This is the most attractive scholarship because there is no bond at all. But the thing is, I am not sure that if I could get this scholarship because of my current CGPA of 3.8, which puts me into one grade below the top students who have higher GPA than me (e.g. CGPA 4.0 and 3.95). Although this is the best offer among the 3, but it is also the scholarship that I have the highest chance of not getting among the 3.

2)BCA-Industry Built Environment Undergraduate Scholarship ( study in probably NUS, if not NTU is good too)
This scholarship is offered to me during my internship. The chances of getting this scholarship is 99% unless something unexpected happens. Downside to this is that this scholarship is bonded and after graduating from my undergrad studies, I will have to work for my internship company that offered me this scholarship. You may wonder why I am having second thoughts on taking this scholarship despite the 99%. That is because after asking relatives for advice, I was told that the economy is not so good right now. Also, after 5 years (2 years NS + 3 years university), no one knows what will happen to the working world. It's either I secure a job in the bad economy or I miss a better opportunity in the good economy

3) No scholarship - funding from family
If not because of the scholarships there are offered, this will be the decision I'm going ahead with. Without a scholarship, my education will lead to higher financial burden to the family. It is possible to pay for my fees but might need to cut expenses from this and that. 

Each decision has it's pros and cons, so it's quite hard to decide on which. I still have end of my year 3 to make a decision.

If there is anything missing information that I have not included in this post that you would like to know, leave me a comment and I will try my best to reply you.

Thanks for the help !"

And I'm also looking at where I want to end up working ultimately. 

I live in Tampa so there's not a huge tech community, but it's not so bad either. The place I'm super interested in is Connectwise. The culture looks great, the location is perfect for me, the pay seems fair, the ratings on Glassdoor are really good and their product is interesting to me. Overall it seems like the perfect fit! They have had openings for Computer Science Interns in the past, but nothing right now. 

Would it be ok for me to contact HR to find out if they will be doing internships next summer? And how do I find out what do they look for in a potential intern? I wouldn't mind doing some extra study between now and then to make myself more useful and hirable. Should I contact the tech managers? I found a few of them on LinkedIn already."

* 4.0 UW GPA 4.35 W, rigorous schedule
* Good ECs (nothing extraordinary, but heavily involved in my sport and community, especially with volunteer work). Internship at local nonprofit this summer. No hooks. 

I'm interested in merit scholarships but I understand that they're REALLY hard to get at many of the schools that I list. My prospective major is something STEM-related, likely chemistry/biochem/chemE/genetics and then on to medical school. For this reason, I would like to keep undergrad tuition to a minimum amount.

**Reach**
* Vanderbilt (Interested in Merit Scholarships)
* Duke (Merit Scholarships)
* WUSTL (Merit)
* University of Southern California (Merit, ""low reach"")
* UPenn (probably highest reach)
* Wake Forest (small possibility for merit, ""low reach"")
* Rice (possibility for Merit, thanks Reddit!)

**Match**
* Boston U (high match? Merit as well)
* Santa Clara U (Johnson Scholars)
* UNC (high match, tiny possibility for merit, OOS)

**Safety**
* Baylor U (automatic admission &amp; full tuition for NMF)
* Oregon State (in-state, probably honors college)

**Others to look into**
* LACs
* CWRU
* Purdue
* Emory
* Tulane

Even when I apply and don't land an interview, they tell me the same thing. I thought internships were about gaining experience and not necessarily being qualified because you have the skills. I posted on my resume all the programming, projects I've done, computer related courses I am taking in school, and how I am currently pursuing my degree. Why can't I land an internship? Is there a way I can improve my chances of getting one?"
4po146,0,2016-06-24,What do you do when you realize you're completely stuck and don't know what to ask?,Awric,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4po146/what_do_you_do_when_you_realize_youre_completely/,"Hello!

So a little background for me is that I've been taking computer science courses for a little bit, and I've passed data structures like a year ago (which I believe is a bad thing, because data structures are no longer fresh in my head. I've spent two semesters trying to pass my computer architecture course which why it was so long ago since I've taken an actual programming class).


I'm currently in an unpaid internship right now at a startup my brother brought me into. He is the senior developer in it, and he and I thought this a great learning experience for me. I'm trying my best to make the most of it so I can eventually get a paid internship or a junior position by next summer.

This internship is on developing in iOS, or at least learning how to develop in Objective-C. The guys who manage me, including my brother, have been giving me some great direction on what to study and what to practice. So far what I've covered (or at least have been introduced to) is learning about properties, creating table views, using 3rd party repositories, parsing JSON, mapping, creating models, understanding data patterns, and a few more things. Of course, I'm not only practicing this, but I'm trying to get the best understanding of these topics so I can carry it over to the future and hopefully answer interview questions on it.

#My Question
Although I have great direction and I'm sure I have access to everything I need, there are many times when I'm straight up lost on a certain task. There are moments where I recognize that I'm lost. Usually this is solved by asking myself ""*What exactly am I trying to do right now?*"" and help myself pin point where I get stuck, but sometimes I can't find out where I'm stuck and I don't know what exactly to ask. **When you guys encounter situations where you are lost and don't know what *exactly* you should ask, what do you do from there?**

I ask this for many reasons, but one big reason is because I don't think I'll have this type of guidance in any other job where I can just have the answer fed to me with a spoon. I want to know what techniques you guys have when you're stuck.


Just as an example: 

A few days ago, when I was trying to practice and learn how to map values to keys given from a JSON dictionary and I was given a library from github, I got lost in my code and couldn't see what I was supposed to do. I couldn't find out what I was supposed to ask because I found myself overwhelmed with how much information was already in the project. 


Anyway, thanks if you took the time to read this. A lot of this is just me writing out my thoughts for myself (I kinda just learned plenty by writing this up), but if you guys have advice for me, I'd really appreciate it."

I went to a few career fairs this year and applied to a few summer internships but considered it practice and didn't put too much effort into it. I filled out a [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YrqyeohRjiq3ry2NJ65vypq8AeIbqImXMaBYdLWKk1w/edit?usp=sharing) based on my university's resume template, but I have only one personal project that was a research project, and one major paid web scraping gig that I could frame as a research project.   

I also stretched the truth in regard to freelance web development (I made a few simple websites for mom and pop shops when I was a kid which are all replaced now and did some subcontracting work for another freelancer that I can't show to anyone contractually). I have all of the software skills listed but have no real concrete personal projects to show, only a few dummy apps from tutorials that look extremely unprofessional.  

I went to my school's career center several times last year but they didn't take me seriously because I was a freshman. So, where do I go from here? What steps do I need to take to guarantee some sort of internship this summer? How can I start a CS career and start paying off my student loans a year and a half from now? "

1 internship as helpdesk during the summer after 2nd year. Stayed part time during 3rd year. Back full time now after graduating. Total of 14 months or so. Took the position originally because I thought I wanted to go into IT but changed my mind 3rd year and decided to go software. Also couldn't find any other positions at the time...

As for open source projects, 1 Android application (not on play store because it would still need a lot of work for production) and a fairly in depth IoT project integrating another Android app, web app, database, arduino and hardware together. I've written in depth articles and published them on my personal wordpress website.

Started applying to jobs after I finished school like an idiot and here I am looking for a sanity check. I feel as I'm getting no luck with responses. 

Applied to over 60 entry level/junior developer positions and a few IT positions just to see if I get responses. And just as I thought, I get IT responses... 2 phone interviews (both were for IT positions which I don't want), 1 in person interview of which the company was not what I was looking for (old, repetitive, barely any programming), and 10+ automated ""dear applicant.""

Other than the general fucked up hiring process in this industry, I think I'm not getting as many replies because of my education. A lot of the positions I apply to prefer a CS degree from a university. I'm coming from a diploma in CE which is focused more on hardware and networking. 

Although I'm pretty decent in Java (Algorithms, Data structures, Collections framework, some Android dev), my program focused a lot more on C, assembly, networking (routing &amp; switching basics, TCP/IP, socket programming, linux sys/net admin) and electronics (circuits, interfacing with microcontrollers, computer architecture, etc...)

Also had a few courses in web dev (html, css, javascript, jquery, php, sql) which were one of my favorites. So why didn't I just drop out and switch to web dev? basically because I was almost done and a local to the school. Living at parents (I'm now almost 21, went to college straight out of highschool) therefore no rent, bills (other than phone), cheap (domestic, non-international) tuition which I paid off myself. 

So what are my plans now? I'm setting a goal of 20+ applications/week. If I don't find something by the end of August, I'm considering taking a bootcamp in full stack web dev. Although I don't wanna drop nearly 10k for a few weeks, I think it would give me some skills that I'm missing (NodeJS, Angular, projects to put in the portfolio) and pretty much guarantee a job that I want. I know I could just learn them on my own (and I've started learning NodeJS) however I personally learn better in person, more motivation if I'm out of the house and not working full time...

Any advice would be nice, thanks for reading my rant. 

**TL;DR** Should have switched majors, lacking skills for the job I want."
4pol0y,3,2016-06-24,Stigma of not finishing college on time,soon2bcpa18,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/4pol0y/stigma_of_not_finishing_college_on_time/,"Why is it frowned upon to take more than 4 years to graduate with a bachelors degree? Its not everyone who can graduate in the default amount of time. Some students are part-time students because they have to work full-time in order to pay for college. Some students are engineering majors and have to take lighter course loads to mitigate the risk of failing classes and falling even further behind. Some students are taking time off from school to gain relevant work experience in their field of study. Yet these students are often considered as ""failures"" when it comes to computing graduation rates. This basically implies that a student who graduated in 4 years with a 2.0 GPA, debt, no relevant work experience is more successful than a student with a 4.0 GPA, no debt, and relevant work experience?! Seriously! Is that really true?! Isn't the performance of a college supposed to be measured by statistics like average GPA (by major), student-faculty retention, number of students getting jobs in their field, etc. 

Im not saying that graduation rates are not important. They are. But they do not tell the full story of how a college is performing if you consider that they do not include part-time students, transfer students, nontraditional students, or students that take time off from school for various reasons, and you regard them as failures regardless of their GPA. Seriously, does anyone also feel the same about graduation rates?

In my case, I am an accounting major going for the CPA. In order to qualify to sit for the CPA Exam, I need to get 150 credit hours (5 years of school). I currently have 132. However, I am taking a year off to do a 7-month co-op and a 3 month internship back-to-back, so I won't be taking any classes this year. I will return to school next year (2017-2018) complete my degree so by graduation it will have taken me a total of 6 years. In addition to the Exam and Education requirements, I have to have at least 2,000 hours of relevant experience in order to obtain my CPA license. "

I was looking through the submission history and noticed that there isn't something that talks about the differences between ArcGIS Pro and other Esri programs. 

Currently at my internship, I'm only licensed to use ArcGIS Pro, so a lot of features are either a) hard to find/obscure naming, or b) simply haven't been integrated into the client yet.

Are there any options out there that could better help me navigate the program? 

Some of the issues I've run into so far:

- Attribute tables can be somewhat hard to edit without other programs (ArcCatalog) and searching for data is all done manually

- Georeferencing PDF's or JPG's over a basemap to show historic changes is extremely difficult

I can post more, but a majority of all tutorials or explanations only deal with ArcMap and other software I don't have access to yet.

I do have the option of working with QGIS and using some of the tools created on there, but have found (once again) the georeferencing applications to be underwhelming. 

What should I do guys?

If I have to, I will start working on a program that would allow easier georeferencing!

You guys are awesome, and I really appreciate the supportive community around here.

[I'm going to the booster test in Utah next week as part of the NASA social team! What can I expect to see while I'm there and will you be there?  Also will you wish Brittany a happy birthday? she's a huge SLS fan.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mjkx6?context=5)|You will tour the booster manufacturing plant and will get VIP viewing access of the test firing.  There will be a live NASA social event as well where you will hear from NASA and Orbital ATK executives talk about future of space program.  Happy birthday, Brittany!  You'll see the largest rocket ever designed for human space flight tested - an enormous show of awesome power over 2 minutes.  You'll hear the test crew as they work down to T-0 and over 5 tons of propellant burned every second, producing 3.6 million lbs of thrust.  Lots of fire, smoke and noise.  You'll love it. Yes, I will be there and hope to see you.  FB  First of all, Happy Birthday Brittany!!! As for the test - you can expect to hear a pre-test countdown as engineers verify the readiness of  each of the subsystems including thrust vector control, data acquisition and ignition systems. Upon ignition a flash of light at the nozzle will be seen followed by a continuous, flame front. Really: you see, then you feel it (shock wave), then you hear it! After that point you will hear variations in the noise levels as they peak and decline then rise again, this is a pre designed throttling of the system (essentially: we press on the gas, let up, then press on the gas again) - AP.
[What are the biggest obstacles when turning a design concept to completion?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mkmoa?context=5)|The biggest key to bringing concept to completion begins with good detailed up front planning followed by the recognition that issues will arise and including contingency plans to resolve them. There is no substitute for similar previous experience...while not required it can simplify the avoidance of many previously learned lessons.- AP.
[While working with your team, how do their unique perspectives influence the way you want to move your profession forward? Is there anything specific that helps you bring out the best in your team?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mkmoa?context=5)|Anytime you're taking something from paper to product it provides difficulty in many areas, including tooling, facilities, materials, and of course processing. Being as prepared as possible and having a system that can react quickly and adequately when things don't go as planned is critical, and not easy. Having different perspectives is critical to getting the best ideas out in the open. It challenges you to think more openly and moving forward you want a culture that promotes that environment. Always let everybody be themselves. If anybody on the team is uncomfortable you won't get their best effort and ideas. - EB.
[Can I ask a more personal-centered question, though?  I'm a student planning to major in aerospace engineering because I basically want your job. Designing, building, testing...all that jazz involved with putting stuff in space up there. I'm a little bit overwhelmed by the fact that I get to talk to you folks! Anyways back on focus. So I'm terribly interested in that path. Do you have any tips on how to get there? I've been obsessed with NASA and rockets and the like since practically when I was born. I've got passion, skills...what else do I need? How did you get where you are?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mjhbi?context=5)|This is Kyle.  First of all, thank you for your question and your interest in SLS.  Your selection of majoring in aerospace engineering is an awesome choice if you're interested in designing, building, testing, and flying rockets!  My degree is actually in mathematics so any technical degree can put you on the path.  As far as tips: Get as much experience as you can! Internships are now really important to gain experience for making yourself stand out for full-time employment. At Orbital ATK, we require a 3.0 GPA, US citizenship or US person, and classical degree.  As a hiring manager, I like to see people with passion and interest.  Generally speaking, most people who go to an accredited university and meet that criteria could all do the job.  We want people who love to do the job! If you show interest (and knowledge from company research) and passion, you'll stand out so keep it up! STEM clubs and volunteer opportunities help too.  Keep it up!  The first, most obvious, part is to focus on math and science and strive to develop your physics-based understanding. Second, take things apart. Understand how stuff works. If something around the house breaks, try to fix it. Then later you'll be able to take your practical understanding of how stuff works and combine it with physics and math. this kind of understanding will help start you down and engineering path...EB.
[Why NASA still working with 70's Booster Tech?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mjw7n?context=5)|We have utilized existing assets to minimize initial costs as the SLS program evolves, that said there are several new technologies which have been incorporated in this booster that  are state of the art including: internal insulation system - that is environmentally friendly and preforms much better than previous systems.  All new avionics and controls. And newly developed non-destructive inspection techniques to ensure the highest reliability. -AP.
 |Booster technology evolves but physics stays constant.  The improvements are usually focused on safety and reliability improvements and cost efficiency.  What was produced in the 70's forms a basis for propulsion technology but the current state of the art has come a tremendous way in casing, insulation,  propellant and nozzle areas.  Guidance systems are completely different today than earlier era.  JF.
[I've heard that solid rocket boosters are dangerous on a manned spacecraft.

Both systems have hazards that require management and SLS incorporates an abort system that uses solid propulsion to take the crew to safety during an anomaly.  The specific characterizations of this issue are often over simplified while reality is much more nuanced.  The key in either case is to properly employ hazard mitigations into the design.  AP.
 |Space launch vehicles that leave earth's orbit use energetic materials that need to be designed and used safely whether liquid or solid propellant or manned or unmanned spacecraft.  Solid propellants are inherently stable but not as easily throttled.  Liquid propellants are more volatile and more easily throttled.

It seems like all the new companies are using liquids?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4ml77v?context=5)|They each have their benefits, and rockets are often at their best when using both, depending on how many stages are required, trajectory, payload, orbit, etc - EB.
 |New endeavors continue to include both liquid and solids.  They have different performance characteristics that are selected based upon mission requirements.  One major characteristic is that liquid engines tend to have more moving parts but higher potential in-space performance.  Solid motors have few moving parts and greater potential thrust capability.

If so what assets do you need work there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/4po9ij/were_working_on_the_solid_rocket_boosters_that/d4mjsp4?context=5)|Some avionics were developed for SLS and some were developed on previous platforms and application engineered for SLS usage.  We are in constant need for smart engineering people particularly in the electronics and computer science disciplines. JF.

4pp6yx,146,2016-06-24,Free Petz to Good Home (Part 8 - The Monarch Code),aliceink,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4pp6yx/free_petz_to_good_home_part_8_the_monarch_code/,"Ever since I found an old copy of the PC game ""Petz 3"" on Craigslist, strange things have been happening in my house. Weird noises, rancid smells, and most recently the disappearance of both my cats, Shelley and Byron. To read more about how my predicament has unfolded, you can [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4lgbl1/free_petz_to_good_home/). Otherwise, let's jump right in...



&amp;nbsp;



---



&amp;nbsp;



When the pixels in the top right of my computer screen finally clicked over to 5:00 pm, I was out the door of my office faster than you could say *pussycat, kill, kill!* I'd barely been able to concentrate at work, my mind replaying Emeric's words over and over and over: *It's Sylvie. I think maybe I have a lead on how to find her.*



&amp;nbsp;



I realized as I drove the half hour to Emeric's house in Lakeview that all this time, I'd assumed Sylvie was probably dead. Let's face it, how often does a missing kid turn up alive - especially after several months? It hadn't really occurred to me that Emeric was still actively looking for her, but I guess it's easier to be cynical if you don't have kids of your own. Hope and love are powerful motivators. Still, I couldn't imagine what he might have found to convince him she was out there somewhere. 



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric answered the door looked frazzled. His face, normally clean shaven, had a patchy five-o'clock shadow and his t-shirt had a noticeable stain down the front. Coffee, I thought. Something vaguely brown. ""Alice!"" He seemed genuinely happy to see me, though his eyes moved past me to the street beyond, scanning it for a moment before taking my arm and tugging me inside. ""So glad you're here. I just needed a second pair of eyes, you know? To make sure I'm not losing it.""



&amp;nbsp;



This was not an encouraging opener, particularly given that our last meet up had ended with both of us in the back of a cop car. I gave him a tight smile and nodded. ""Sure, of course. But hey--"" I reached out to place a hand on his arm, ""what happened the other night? Who called the cops?""



&amp;nbsp;



All of Emeric's nervous energy melted away. He visibly deflated. ""Ah, yes. That."" 



&amp;nbsp;



""A neighbor saw something weird outside your house...?"" I prompted. I imagined the creature I'd seen in his driveway a few weeks ago, crouched with its back away from me, making those awful, husky heaves. 



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric shrugged, helplessly. ""I guess so. I don't know what to think about it - could have been a neighbor kid, maybe a bum. Last year there were a bunch of break-ins around this time. Summer brings out all the crazies.""



&amp;nbsp;



I cleared my throat. I wasn't buying it. 



&amp;nbsp;



""Fine, fine,"" he sighed, running a hand through his unkempt hair. ""I know what you're thinking, ok, and it's not some shady conspiracy. It just..."" he closed his eyes, pinched the bridge of his nose. ""It makes me uncomfortable to talk about. I've been trying not to think about it, ever since Mrs. Dewitt first told me she'd seen someone hanging around in the front yard...""



&amp;nbsp;



The story Emeric told me more or less corresponded to what the officer at the station had said. For about two weeks, Mrs. Dewitt had been seeing a figure in Emeric's front yard - mostly around dusk and only on the days Emeric worked late at GameStop. She hadn't said anything at first, assuming it was Emeric himself (although *he looked funny, shorter than normal and sort of bent forward. At one point I saw him crawling around on all fours near the bushes*). Still, Mrs. Dewitt is a good neighbor - she minds her business as much as possible. She knew he was under a lot of stress and assumed the strange behavior was a direct result of losing his daughter and having his wife walk out on him. But when she started to see the strange figure more and more regularly, she became concerned. On at least one occasion, Mrs. Dewitt saw the figure foraging in the garden at about 6.30 in the evening, by the old dog house. She drew closer to her window to get a better look, and observed the figure *on all fours, rubbing against the side of the dog house with its flanks*. Emeric made it clear to me that Mrs. Dewitt specifically used the word *flanks*, even though until this point she had maintained the figure was human. Still uncertain whether it was Emeric himself, Mrs. Dewitt was shocked to see headlights in the driveway as Emeric returned home from work. When he emerged from his car, the figure *retreated into the underbrush, lurching onto its hind legs and loping unsteadily into the alleyway that separates Mr. Broussard's house from the house next door*. On this occasion, she called the police and filed a report, but no officers were sent. 



&amp;nbsp;



A couple of days went by without a sighting, and Mrs. Dewitt started to believe she might have imagined the whole thing. Until the evening that Emeric and I came by to inspect the dog house. On that evening, Mrs. Dewitt was in her front yard pruning her confederate jasmine when she saw something moving in the bushes across the street. It was just before dusk, and the visibility was hampered by long shadows cast from the tree-lined street. Mrs. Dewitt found herself squinting into the setting sun as she tried to make out the figure in Emeric's front yard. It was the same *thing*, she said; an oddly shaped figure in what looked like a scraggly old black coat, hunched at the shoulders, its back to the street. It was in the same place she'd seen it before, by the dog house, and intermittently it dropped to the ground, making movements Mrs. Dewitt described as *burrowing*. Mrs. Dewitt described a cold feeling creeping over her as she watched frozen in place behind her jasmine bush. And she swore she heard an odd noise, like bugs swarming very near by, or the sound old tube TVS made when they were tuned to the wrong station. At length, Mrs. Dewitt realized what the figure was doing; it was, as she described it to police, *clawing* at the dog house. She could hear the noise of wood splintering, underneath the weird ambient buzzing. She couldn't see clearly enough to tell what was going on, but at one point she saw the figure *contract in on itself*, its flanks sucked in as though all the air in its body had been removed. Even the head, she said (or what she assumed to be the head, since the creature looked as though it was wearing some kind of hood) seemed to warp and shrink, shoulders rolling, limbs popping until it was slender enough to slip through the open hole in the front of the dog house and disappear entirely from view. 



&amp;nbsp;



And that was when Mrs. Dewitt made the 911 call. Exactly what she told them is unclear, but it was enough to have them dispatch a unit as quickly as possible. A unit which, conveniently enough, arrived just a few minutes after Emeric and I pulled into the driveway.



&amp;nbsp;



""...is that what you saw in the dog house?"" I asked him, my mind reeling. ""Was there....was someone inside?""



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric shook his head. He looked pale, shaken. ""...no. That's exactly why I don't want to think about it. When I looked inside that dog house, I didn't see anything. Everything was gone. Everything except a couple of bloodstains on the floor.""



&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;



The 'lead' Emeric had dug up on Sylvie's disappearance was so obvious it was almost a bit disappointing. Personally, if my wife had walked out on me pretty soon after our daughter mysteriously disappeared, the first thing I would have done is gone through all the crap she left behind. But Emeric is a good guy - an aging nerd with a docile, trusting personality. And he really thought Jessica was coming back, that a week or two with her parents in Baton Rouge would straighten everything out. They could grieve together, draw strength from one another in this difficult time. He hadn't looked through any of her things until the night after he returned from the police station. 



&amp;nbsp;



Both Emeric and Jessica, his wife, had careers in IT. They'd graduated from the University of Texas together, but though their aspirations were lofty (Jessica had wanted a career in government security and encryption, Emeric had wanted to trail blaze in silicone valley) it hadn't quite worked out that way. Instead, Emeric worked at GameStop and Jess worked part-time in retail, part-time from home as a web designer. Since it had been a couple of weeks since he'd so much as heard from Jess, Emeric had decided to begin the slow process of packing up her home office. 



&amp;nbsp;



Jess hadn't taken much with her when she'd left; some clothes and personal items, a metal lockbox in which she kept her passport and other legal documents, and that was about it. Her office was practically untouched, though she had taken the laptop she worked on and erased the hard drive on her iMac. Emeric was going through a stack of old design invoices when he found it; a manila folder marked **Ostium Project**. Inside were all sorts of documents, mostly strings of numbers that were indecipherable to Emeric (he thought they might have been more invoices, but he wasn't sure). 



&amp;nbsp;



""But I also found these..."" he slid bound stack of paper across the table to me, his eyebrows raised. The cover sheet said, in bold letters: **Jessica Donahue: Graduate Dissertation - MK-ULTRA and Monarch Programming in a Post-Python Environment**. 



&amp;nbsp;



I blinked slowly and looked up at him. ""...is this supposed to mean something to me?""



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric gave a wry laugh. ""I guess not, no. It was Jessica's final project before she graduated. I'd forgotten all about it. She worked on some weird stuff while she was in grad school, but this really took the cake. I never read the whole thing - I'm technically minded, but I've got no background at all in psychology or medicine, so a lot of her main points were pretty lose on me. Essentially, she was looking into how to translate Monarch Programming into a coding language that could...well, 'live' undetected beneath the regularly operating commands.""



&amp;nbsp;



My face clearly indicated that I still had no idea what he was talking about. He sighed, ""...MK-Ultra was a secret CIA mind control project carried out in the 1950s and 60s.""



&amp;nbsp;



""You're shitting me, right?"" I rolled my eyes. ""You don't really believe all that conspiracy theory junk?""



&amp;nbsp;



""Look it up,"" he carefully drew the papers back across the table towards him, and I thought I detected a slight coldness in his tone. ""There's a Wikipedia article. Google is your friend. And no, since you asked, I don't *believe all that conspiracy theory junk*. But Jessica was into a lot of it, back in college. Lizard people, the Golden Dawn, Area 51--I mean, we're talking about a woman who, when I first met her, sincerely believed that if she tried hard enough she'd get to work on the X-Files - the *actual* X-Files. Not the TV show.""



&amp;nbsp;



""She sounds like a keeper.""



&amp;nbsp;





Emeric gave me a look. But he continued, ""*Anyway*, this is just context. It's not like her thesis was news to me; I helped her edit some segments. The segments I could understand, at least. But there were a couple of things in this file that I *didn't* know about. Every summer from the last year of undergrad to the final year of grad school, Jessica would go off on an unpaid internship. She was really, really committed to her studies and her career, and though I sometimes whined at her that I wanted us to spend vacation together, she assured me it would all be worth it in the end. Most of the companies she interned for were local start-ups, software developers, that kind of thing. But our final year of school, Jessica got an internship she was really excited about. It would take place in France, she said, so she wouldn't be able to talk to me as much - the time difference was killer and phone calls weren't cheap. But she was so thrilled about it there wasn't much I could do but be happy for her.""



&amp;nbsp;



""Until now, I've never really known much about what she did that final summer. In fairness, most of her internships were very intensive. It wasn't uncommon for me not to hear from her for days on end. But this one was different. It was the furthest away, for a start, which brought with it its own set of challenges. But for three months, I barely spoke to Jessica at all. When we did talk, she was always tired and irritable, and she refused to talk about work. *It'll just bore you,"" she'd say. Or, ""I've been dealing with that crap all day, can we just talk about something else?"". All I knew is that it was another software company. Well, when I was going through these papers, I found her contract. The company Jessica was working for was MindScape.""



&amp;nbsp;



I did a double take, my thoughts immediately flashing to the unsettling BBS board posts I'd found the night previous. ""...*MyndEscape*?"" I repeated. 



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric gave me an odd look, ""...right. MindScape. You know who they are, right?"" 



&amp;nbsp; 



I heard him better this time, and slowly shook my head. ""....sorry, I misheard. Who...?""



&amp;nbsp;



""They're an educational video game company,"" Emeric explained. ""They folded in 2011, but for a while they were one of the biggest names on the block. If you ever used that shitty teach-yourself-to-touch-type program, you've used MindScape software. Or played any of the Prince of Persia games. But more importantly..."" he cleared his throat dramatically. He'd clearly been preparing for this. ""...in 1998, right before the release of Petz 3, MindScape bought out PF Magic.""



&amp;nbsp;



I sat for a minute, digesting this information. It was weird, sure, that Emeric's estranged wife had once worked for the very same company that had released Petz 3 into the world. But I was struggling to see the connections he was making. I frowned, ""....right. But...what does that have to do with Sylvie?""



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric gave another deep sigh, and slid another stack of paperclipped pages towards me. It was a string of email print outs, dating from the early 00s right up until 2011. The emails were between two parties; JESSICA DONAHUE and a hidden email address named only as MINDSCAPE RESEARCH TEAM. I flipped through a few, trying to find what I was supposed to be looking for. ""...I don't get it,"" I said eventually. ""I mean - help me out here. What am I missing?""



&amp;nbsp;



Emeric leant over the table and pulled out one particular sheet of paper. It was a short email, sent in early March of 2011, from Jessica. ""Due in October"" was all it said. And attached was a scanned image. A .JPG file of Sylvie's first sonogram. 



---



&amp;nbsp; 



Guys, I've got to go for now. This is getting long, and my boss has just called a meeting to discuss ""team improvement"". My night with Emeric didn't end there, but I'll fill you in on the rest when I'm able. We're planning a little trip over the weekend. 



&amp;nbsp;



We're going to find the girl who gave Emeric the disc in the first place.

Hello, I'm a high school student (rising sophomore) and I'm looking to find a computer science internship at a college or something. I don't know how to do this, nor do I know where to start. I know how to program, looking into web development.

Internships I'm interested in would be software development, web development, artificial intelligence, POSSIBLY data.

Anyone who has had an internship, I'd like to talk to you about this if you don't mind!"
4ppxmf,0,2016-06-24,I know what I did is unforgivable but I'm not a bad person,Beogre1,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/4ppxmf/i_know_what_i_did_is_unforgivable_but_im_not_a/,"Let's just start this off right away. I cheated on my ex-girlfriend of 8 months and it is the biggest mistake of my life. She is beautiful, smart, athletic, and best of fun. Yet I lost sight of all that because I was weak. We were in a weird spot, I was about to graduate college and head half way across the country for an internship before grad school and she was going to be moving to Denver in late august. We always said that we probably wouldn't stay together and do long distance because we'd both done that before and hated it. Yet we really cared for eachother but are stubborn people and didn't change how we viewed where the relationship was going even if we wanted it to continue. Well, my ex wears her heart on her sleeve and at times when she would get upset or annoyed she would say things like ""we might as well just end this now"" or ""what's the pint this isn't going anywhere"" and I would always stay patient and not react to it because I knew she really cared and didn't meant it. Yet every single time she said it would tear at me and give me a little bit of doubt until one day I broke,  cracked. All I wanted was to feel genuinely wanted and wasn't just her. I play soccer in college and all my roomates had finished their careers for school but instill had a year left. And I was always missing out on thing but never felt like anyone cared that I wasn't hanging out as much or not part taking in all the fun because I had soccer obligations. Then in soccer my coaches essentially would tell me there was nothing I could do to get the starting spot I wanted even if I did everything I could. It all hit me at once and this girl I was friends with was actually showing merest and it felt like she was the only one who wanted me. I gave in pathetically and immediately regretted it.

My exes friends would always tell me how much she cared for me, but idk I guess I didn't feel like I was wanted or necessary to anything. It really bothered me but I bottle up my emotions and try to just push on because I don't like expressing myself, but I cracked. It's no excuse for what I did and I hate that I did it. I told my ex the next day, I could not hide that from her I'm a terrible liar and honest has always been my only route. The obvious occurred I destroyed her lost her trust and she ended things a month before I left.

Yet for that last month we hung out almost everyday. I would sleep over, never had sex or anything, but I could tell I still made her happy even after I had done this horrible thing to her, which made it worse because I knew she cared so much for me. It didn't help I became the 3rd bf of hers to do this to her. I despised myself, I didn't have good sleep for a month straight, bUT hey why the hell would I deserve one. At the end of the day it was all my fault, all the pain in felt and still feel. Once I left is when things got bad.

A week of being a way I had bought a flight back to her because she wanted me to come to a friend's wedding. We continued to talk here and there, but she would always say we weren't getting back together, she even admitted to me that she started sleeping with someone else, but that he didn't mean anything to her. We'll now 2 weeks ago she tell me she doesnt want me to come to wedding and I was broken, Idk what I was expecting but that killed me. She has every right to do that, cuz why the fuck would she take a cheater like myself to the wedding. She still cares a ton but she doesn't want to be weak and get back together with me like in the past.

Now I'm kind of lost, I care about this girl more than anyone before, besides my family. I wake up every morning, hurting knowing she is hurting 10 times as much. I'm not a bad person, I dI'd everything for her yet with one action I ruined everything, decimated her trust and belief in me. I want a second more than anything else in this world. I'm doing everything I can to not let this consume my life and to try and enjoy the area I'm living in for the summer, but I always fall back to thinking about her everyday.

I don't know why I writing this, I really don't expect sympathy or anything cuz I don't want pity. I guess I just needed to let it all out. Its less than week when my flight heads back to where she is and she has said she'll get dinner with me, and I'm holding onto that. I'm giving her space no matter how much I want to call her or text her just to hear how her day was. I've learned alot about myself and I have to give it a go, a go to let it all out to her, tell her why I did it ,why she means so much to me and how this is not an unrealistic possibility if she still cares for me. 

I can't get my hopes up because everything is against me and she has every right to say no to move on and find a guy that will never hurt her. But In my whole life and as an athlete I have learned from every mistake and it has always made me stronger.  I know I can bear the weight of the emotion and difficulty it will take to work this out but I know at the end of the day she is someone I can see a future with. If we could get through this there isn't a single thing won't get through together. I love everything about this girl and know that if given the chance this can work again even better than it did before. It won't be easy but nothing in life that you really want is easy. 

If you read this far, I appreciate it and I'm sure you probably think I'm a pathetic, lost guy. Haha thanks for taking the time to read my rant.

Peace, Love,
Brogre

I'm a high school senior who is looking to intern in my field and talk to someone about my future career. Jobs with international opportunities are preferred because I will be living in Madrid for a year, but telecommuting and domestic ones are always welcome since I am moving back! Will be in the U.S. until Fall 2017 and then will probably be in China for a few weeks and then all over Europe for a year before starting university. I'm a young female first generation Latina so diversity is appreciated. Elevator pitch: I go to a top 10 high school for the arts (communications) in South Florida. I major in creative writing, journalism, tech and technical writing, copy editing, film, and digital art. In regards to coding, I don't have too much experience because I'm very young (the youngest coder most of my peers and colleagues know, I'm only 17 and a half) but I am learning and I'm taking a Harvard CS course in Miami (#cs50xMiamiProud). I know how to program in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, all the C languages, and I know a bit of PHP, r, react, Swift, and the Android API. I started my own tech company which is a mother-daughter endeavor, and I work at a cognitive robotics and machine perception lab FAU which is basically artificial intelligence systems. Obviously, since I'm involved with research, I'm trying to learn Linux and MatLab and r. A fun fact is that I'm also an Algebra tutor, I got a perfect score on my state-mandated EOC. Sorry if that's kind of nerdy and not super impressive, but I'm still really proud of myself! I'm kind, personable, very intelligent, and ambitious. I am always willing to take on a new challenge. I'm a team player, an innovator, and I really like to improve myself daily. I read a lot of self-help books but it's really helpful because I want to be the best version of myself that I can be both personally and professionally. I really think I align with a lot of Google and other tech company's mission statements and what they look for in an employee. Let me know if you have any more questions  and thanks to all of you for the help so far! "
4pq8ja,9,2016-06-24,My interview process cultivated from the pathetic to the extremely difficult.,SometimesFlashesYou,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/4pq8ja/my_interview_process_cultivated_from_the_pathetic/,"Someone asked for my help on some things and interviewing for a Jr.-level development position came up.  Since his code was in C# and I'm a C# dev, some of the content may focus there, though it could be tweaked for just about any language.  Please let me know what you think.


As for interviewing for a Junior Developer, I'd probably first have to see what's actually taught nowadays in school!  I've worked with some people in their early 20's that were Sr. level, which was a bit shocking.  I didn't learn much in school except the foundations and a lot of that stuff does get asked during interviews.  By the time I was a junior I was already working a regular job, an internship, and taking classes so school definitely took a back seat.  I did learn a lot during the internships, but not as much as I learned either being mentored by a teammate or just working on a team.

You'll see tons of different interviewing techniques and most are pretty bad.  I've found behavioral analysis to be good, but not for a junior-level position.  Those are the ""Recall a time you didn't agree with one of your co-workers and explain how you resolved the situation"".  They're asking things that you can't always memorize or make up really quick.  Some may give you a logic test, which is always a bit strange in my opinion.  I've had some that had several tests that were all based on algorithms.  And while I did learn about depth-first search in school a long time ago, I can't write the solution from my head w/o Google!  And I've had people just talk to me, ask barely any technical questions, and hire me on the spot!

So to answer how I try to interview: I'd probably start with a 15-minute phone interview asking some basic stuff like explain OOP concepts like Encapsulation, abstraction, etc.  Explain what a static class is and why it's used.  Maybe some life-cycle stuff and your thoughts on Agile vs. Waterfall.  

And then I'd hand-pick some from the obvious sources (like [this](https://www.roberthalf.com/technology/blog/9-net-interview-questions-with-sample-answers) [this](http://career.guru99.com/top-50-c-sharp-interview-questions-answers/) or [this](http://career.guru99.com/top-50-asp-net-interview-questions-answers/)).  

Either in the phone-interview or on-site: I'd ask what projects you've worked on, if you participated in any open source (shows passion) and your experience(s) with C#, ASP.NET, MVC, SQL, JavaScript, and CSS.  More questions like before, but something I wouldn't expect you to know.  We could talk it through -- some people will get it after some subtle hints, some people will give up immediately (bad), and some will try to bullshit an answer (worse).

If that worked out, we'd bring you in and you'd first take a test.  Something *like* the [FizzBuzz](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/) [test](http://codingbat.com/doc/practice/fizzbuzz-code.html).  Just anything that's not too difficult but shows you have analytical skills and can do basic loops, etc.  I always sit down with candidates and have them talk about what they're doing/thinking and guide them if they get stuck.  This helps me determine their process and makes sure that they don't get too panicky/stressed and completely fail an easy test.

If the test went well, I'd have you meet the team.  They may want to ask you questions.  You could certainly ask questions.  That's mainly to gauge if you'll ""fit in"".  I worked in one place where it was loud, there was beer, and people cursed a lot.  A lady came in who had worked at Microsoft and had a phenomenal resume.  Some were concerned we'd have to watch our language and that she wouldn't fit in -- by the time we wanted to hire her, someone else had scooped her up.

Bad idea,OnlywantsthatPhD,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4pqj8s/couldnt_find_work_so_i_started_working_at_the/,"Graduated a year ago with a master's degree. Decided to move back home, applied for 5 to 6 jobs a week and was told (when I was lucky enough to receive an interview) I have too much experience and education. (Was the store manager for a restaurant when I was 20 and kept employment the entire tI'm I was in college). After 7 1/2 months of no job offers, I bit the bullet and decided to help my parents with their family business. 

This business was started a few years after I left for college and very small. Since they didn't do any kind of marketing or social media, I knew that would be beneficial to them. 

I have now grown to a point that I hate every aspect of my life. It's going on almost 4 months of working for them and not getting paid. They have told me that because I live in their house for free and don't buy groceries, I do not deserve a paycheck. I only get one day off a week and put in more hours each day then they do. 

If I quit, they will kick me out. I have still been applying for work, yet still cannot seem to get an interview. I have sent my resume out to friends who are in human resources, I've gone to employment companies, and sent it to recruiters and asked if they could please let me know if there is anything I should fix or change to please let me know, and I have yet to hear anything negative. 

I have sold everything that I own that has some value, I have to pick and choose what bills I pay each month, and no way to de-stress since I'm working between 55 to 60 hours a week and come home to my ""bosses"".

At this point, what can I do? I can't find any specific laws that require family to pay their children, and I'm not sure I could even turn them in for... well, I don't even know. I don't think this would be considered an internship, but I would think with the hours in working I'm due something! 

Any and all advice would be magnificent. Thank you."

 International Student from India (Male). Comp Engg/Comp Sci Major.  
2200 SAT (670CR, 780M, 750W). Given Subject SATs for Math II and Phy in June, but will likely give again in October (didn't go too well). Good Computer-related ECs, done internships and web design for small businesses, developing few apps. Volunteer at women's health NGO. Not very involved in sport though. Good Academics (No GPA here).  
So here's the list, in order of preference, most of these colleges I'm certain on applying, and thinking of adding a couple more. (2 matches or 1 match+1 safety)   
 
**Reaches**  
Cornell (dream school, ED, high reach)  
UMich (EA)  
UC - Berkeley (high reach)  
UIUC (low reach?)  

**Matches**  
UCLA (high match)  
UWash - Seattle (high match?)  
USC
Purdue  
UCSD  
UCSB  
UCDavis  
UCIrvine  

**Safeties**  
Northeastern? (seems like an excellent school, but counselor said it was a safety for me. Is it?)  
UC Riverside  
UC Santa Cruz  

Anyways, I'm sure it's apparent most of the colleges are in California, but I honestly don't mind living anywhere, I actually quite like the cold. So I'm open to suggestions everywhere. Although this is like 14 colleges, 8 of them are the UCs which will have one common application, so hopefully it isn't too many. Thanks in advance!"

I am a Lebanese electrical engineering student currently in my 3rd year. I am trying to work later on in the US, so I am working towards summer internships so that I can build some connections that can facilitate my work there after finishing my degree.

So, for the internship there:
What are the possible ways to apply to internships in the US?
Are the companies generally willing to get international talent?
Do companies prefer giving internships to local students?
Is abroad student internships something common? 

After I complete my education:
How to apply to jobs in the US?
Can the company I interned in and want to hire me help me get me a work visa?

What is the best way to contact companies there so that I can do internships, and hopefully work there too?

Thank you"

Unfortunately I haven't had much luck finding a job in the computer science field, but that is mostly my fault. I went off to college hardly knowing what I wanted to do. Halfway through, I decided on a career path where I didn't need to finish college, but my family convinced me to finish college and since I was at a loss in what major to choose, they suggested I major in something computer related since I had always been interested in computers. Now don't get my wrong, I was a natural at programming in my classes, but after so many years of grade school and college, and the fact that I wanted to do something I didn't need to go to school for, I was miserable. I surprisingly did well enough in my classes, but knowing that I wasn't going to come out with a degree and actually anything to pursue a career with it, I didn't try very hard, nor did I consider graduating with a bachelor of science degree, or even do an internship. Now I am regretting it all.

Now, late last year, a friend and I started messing around with swift and iOS programming. Suddenly I had resparked my interest in computer science. I more than doubled my efforts to find a position in computer science but to no avail. Quite a few of the entry level positions I found required at least an internship, which I didn't do because at the time I didn't care. I basically received either morning, or an email thanking me for my time blah blah blah... Now more than ever I actually wanted to further my education (wish I had that drive while I was in school). Now my biggest dilemma is the debt that I'm in from my undergraduate program, and that is stopping me from actually trying. 

So the big question is, is it worth it to return for a MS in CS? "

Hi guys,
I have recently been hired by a company doing cutting edge 'proof of concept' jobs for high profile companies. Machine learning, AI and commercial heuristics along with lots of data retrieval, parsing etc.

It is a really great company and they take great care of me (relocation, housing and a great salary even though I'm just an intern), great clients, great references, amazing office and fun culture. Howewer I'm afraid I'm just not qualified for this job.

*I do not come from a CS background (I'm an econometrist), and despite having a nicely padded CV and great marks at my uni, I'm just a bachelor (that would be a junior for people on the other side of the pond) who happens to interview really well.*

The rest of my colleagues have a PhD. We have people starting in september coming in from Berkeley and Stanford (we are an european company), and I'm not even a CS student. I just feel underqualified for this job and I'm not sure I can do it.

On my first day I got introduced to the staff, sat down with my supervisor and got a very complicated project dropped on me. It's not a routine project (supervisor also has no idea how to do it), it's something very new (so not something you can google or stackoverflow and hack away on). It's mainly in Python, which is not a language I'm comfortable with. It will run on ComputeEngine, and I'm not even sure how to test something of that scale. Even worse, it's not an internal project but it's something that will be delivered in a couple of week to a paying client.


&amp;nbsp;   


TLDR: I've been losing my sleep on my new great job, which I'm clearly not qualified for. Any tips are more than welcome. How would you tackle a situation like this one? What could I do if I'm unable to complete the project? And how could I make sure I'll get more hand-holding on my next project? Or maybe this is customary for the really good companies, and I should have gotten some more experience at more relaxed companies before biting more than I can chew?

Thanks in advance, CS fellows!

yours truly,

4ptkhf,5,2016-06-25,Our Father the intern.,Snorumobiru,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4ptkhf/our_father_the_intern/,"Humans need religion because we aren't rational beings. We can figure out the right way to act on our own, but when it comes to restraining our emotions and base impulses, putting it into action is tough unless we have some big alpha male in the sky handing down the insights we're having. That's not a criticism of religion, it's our nature. Our rational top brain shares the cranium with our emotional midbrain and our reptilian brain stem. Your top brain can be full of these great ideas, but your midbrain needs to want to obey them, and your midbrain wants to boay the alpha. It's how we're built, thanks to evolution.

I'd love to thank the fucker who created all of this but didn't intelligently design us. The son of a bitch who subjected an entire species to the suffering of being evolved. We breathe and eat through the same hole. We have functionless organs that can explode and kill us. We die of old age! And because we evolved from apes we have feelings about all these things! We suffer because we know this isn't right and we crave something better, but all we have to do is look into our past to know that our creator doesn't love us! 

Maybe we're a scientific simulation, running in another universe. At the top there's gotta be a creator species that evolved naturally and then ran some simulation universes. Then some of those had intelligent life so they ran some more simulation universes. Maybe they study themselves with them. Maybe they keep them as pets. But there's a lot of them. There's so many that if you find yourself living as an intelligent species, alone in a universe, chances are you're simulated too.

Maybe we're here because of some other simulated species. Maybe their bodies are designed by someone who cares. They have it so good that they wonder what it must have been like for the creator species, being intelligent but not designed. The scientists start investigating, the media nag the scientists to create a sim they can use for the news tomorrow.

Next thing you know here we are, No.57 of 72 universes running on some intern's computer overnight. He'll do a five minute lookover tomorrow morning, and the most photogenic universe gets emailed to the news guy at 6AM sharp.

And it's No.56. Fuck those guys! We got past calculus before we invented human rights! We took a universe where everything outside our solar system is a 3D video on a skybox and where physics glitches out completely at a small enough scale, and we came damn close to a unified theory of physics. And then we proved mathematically that thermo, newtonian, relativistic, and quantum physics are mutually incompatible. We just use whichever one best describes the phenomena at hand. It's glaring proof that our universe, at least, was designed. Badly.

So here we are and No.56 is picked because they ""really get math"" and of course they really get math, they're an automaton universe! They built themselves an organ to really get math!

If you'd run No.57 over here for more than 11 hours we could have become an automaton universe too, just like you wanted! But you - oh. I'm being told 56 is literally a cellular automaton universe. They built themselves a brain by firing glider guns at a rock. That's - that's pretty impressive. Godspeed 56. May the intern who made you be praised.

Can you imagine, though? One day a voice rolls in out of the sky, and it's the apocalypse. The voice speaks thick chinese-accented english because english is the worlds most spoken language and thick chinese-accented is its most spoken dialect.

""Herro."" the voice rolls. ""You are being contacted because the medical records act of three-hundred and seventy requires sentient species to be informed of their participacion in research before being deactivated. Do you have anything you'd like to say for the record?""

And boom. Three hours and twenty nine minutes of frantic screaming, pleading, and crying before we start to lose our voices and go quiet, and a bunch of hippie holdouts in Nevada are playing Beatles at the sky, and it's the last thing left that you can hear over the bombs.

""Interesting..."", the voice rolls. Its voice is slow and quiet. The intern is talking to himself, but the translator program picks up the sound. ""The species killed itself. Fourth one today.""

And then click, and the program ends, and reality pauses for the last time. The file is never accessed again, and the backup is destroyed the next summer to free up drive space.

What a way to go."

Cons are I'm good with math but I don't know if I'm good enough for the Engineering course work and it seems like you have to have a master's for most engineering jobs I'm 24 and I would like to stick with just a Bachelors degree if I can.

Computer Science: Pros are there's also plenty of CS jobs and they seem to only need a Bachelors. Also from what I've seen and heard it's an easier program then CE. The only con is I'm not as interested in CS

Geoscience: pros I am extremely interested in this major, I like everything about it. Con is that when I search online I don't find nearly as many jobs for this major compared to the other two.

And I don't like it that much. I was alright for a while then I had a panic attack last week (hasn't happened to me in years) and I freaked out and left the office but it only got worse. It's in the center of a big city and there is nowhere to find peace if you need it. I was scared and now I'm dreading going back in. I could feel my anxiety going up since returning to this job a few weeks ago. It was pretty much non-existent when I was just in school and retail.

Aside from this in general it's just not what I like to do. The days feel insanely long because I work maybe 20% of my time there if that. Even my boss has a lot of downtime and I usually get whatever work the other three IT guys don't get to which usually isn't much. I have no passion for IT like I thought I did. When they start talking about new software or whatever I instantly get tired and lose interest. People in the office are a lot older than me and aren't very friendly. A lot of fake smiles. I also really don't like working in the city everything is so expensive and it's crowded and insanely busy travel wise, my commute is over an hour long or more. 

Here's the thing. I also work retail (same company for 7 months now) and I actually enjoy it. I work with a small team and usually make good sales. I set goals for myself and make them almost every shift. Sure it has it's bad points but generally I'm mostly happy there if only it wasn't a dead end/low paying job. 

I love fashion, cars, and fitness but haven't found any ways to integrate them into my possible careers. I see all my friends working jobs like restaurants, airline support, and landscaping this summer and they make triple what I do and have way more fun doing it. I want that, even if this internship is setting me up for future success, I don't even think I want to be in IT anymore.

I don't know what to do. Part of me wants to take a step back from the internship, pick up a ton of hours at the retail job, and reevaluate my career goals maybe with a counselor at school. They both pay the same anyway, just the internship is full time and retail is part time. I also want to enjoy the summer, yesterday (when I called in sick after the panic attack) was my first day off in 5 weeks.

I would totally take up a trade like being a mechanic but I feel like I wouldn't fit in there or be happier than I am now.

As a computer science major, there are a lot of things I know I should be working on to help me improve my chances at landing internships and improve my programming skills overall.  These were all goals I set for myself at one point.  For example, finishing book on Android development, building a personal portfolio website, etc.  The problem is that I lack the persistence and motivation to do these things.  I can start one day and then  the next day I'll lack any sense of urgency/motivation to continue.  

Lately I've been using my time socializing/meeting up with friends that I don't see often, playing video games, and practicing old hobbies such as drawing.  I enjoy drawing a lot and I have always wanted to improve my skills.  

When I take my medication, I get this clarity and focus that I cherish so much but it doesn't last me the whole day.  At most 6 hours.  My problem is that during this time, I feel extreme guilt doing anything.  Even small things like drawing or eating out with friends.  I feel like everything I do that isn't directly contributing to improving my future (such as practicing programming, working on personal website) is a waste of time.  Yet, I feel like I have no motivation to carry out these more long term goals.  My only motivation for doing things in my life is to not feel like a failure.  I have rarely felt ""proud"" of accomplishments.  But I am already disappointed in myself daily for my lack of persistence, which tends to make me feel worthless.  

I guess my question is how do I stop feeling guilty for everything I do, realize my long term goals/potential, and stop feeling disappointed in myself all the time?  "

4pyjwj,3,2016-06-26,Not sure what to do about my job. Feeling conflicted and stuck.,ImSexyy,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/4pyjwj/not_sure_what_to_do_about_my_job_feeling/,"Note: I'm going to school for Interior Design. As of now I have (collectively) 3+ years experience working in the field and will be graduating next Spring.

I guess a little backstory would be beneficial to start with, so here it goes...

I began working in the field my last semester of community college. After my Grandfather passed I made it my mission to put myself out there and succeed, something he instilled in me.

I landed my very first interview as an intern and worked there for 7 months before moving on. I couldn't afford to work there during school because I made $8.50 an hour and that wasn't feasible for me. Over the years since I've worked 4 more jobs within my field before landing my current position. 

I was hired as a Kitchen and Bath Design ASSISTANT with potential for growth. I was hired on the spot and offered $13.00/hour (which is fair as an assistant). I've made more, but settled because the experience was worth it for me. Well, they did not expect me to catch on as quickly as I did and it took them all by surprise. By month 3, I was assisting on measures, designing kitchens/bathrooms, assisting customers in the showroom and handling quotes. You name it, I was doing it. 

By month 6 I asked for a raise since my boss said we could revisit. I asked for $15.00 and was shut down. He said they could not afford $15.00 and could only afford $14.00. He said he had big plans for the future of the company and hoped I would stick around for it. I wasn't happy considering I felt I was being underpaid for the amount of work I do, but decided to stay anyway. Why?

My manager/partner. She is incredible. She has taught me so much, she trusts me with responsibility and she treats me like an equal. We work incredibly well together and I could not have asked for a better mentor and friend. 

So it's been 7 months since my last talk with the boss man and I'm doing even more now. I handle my own set of clients, start designs for my manager and assist in sending out plans for quotes, etc. We just got back from a business trip for one of the lines we carry as well and that was incredible.

I've been with this company for a little over a year now. I love my job and I really found my niche in this industry, but I can't help but feel stuck. I feel I deserve more than what I'm making right now. He told my manager that there's a full-time design position waiting for me when I graduate. I know she speaks highly of me to him as well.

I want to schedule another meeting with him and ask for another raise, but I'm afraid of the outcome.

I need to know if I'm in the wrong for thinking I deserve more, or if I'm right and very underpaid for the responsibilities I have. If that's the case I need to find the strength to leave. I'm scared because I still have 8 months of school left and it's difficult finding another K&amp;B design job that's flexible in the meantime. I also don't want to leave my awesome partner...

So that's my dilemma. I really need some advice on what to do and if my concerns are justified.

Thanks in advance!

Tl:dr - I feel I'm underpaid, but want to assure my feelings are justified before I move forward.

These last few weeks I just haven't felt myself and finally thursday I had a panic attack at the office. 

Since then I have been getting them once a day and the thought of going back to work is usually the cause of them. My boss and co workers really like me and internship experience is important, even though I really don't want to go into the field I'm interning for, but my mental health is more important. 

I really don't want to go back to work tomorrow, or ever, not there. I haven't been happy, I have no free time, I haven't been to the gym in 2 weeks, and my diet has been disgusting. I wake up at 6am and get home at 7pm and then I'm too tired to do anything, haven't even seen my best friend in 3 weeks. My entire day there is just miserable and boring. I'm researching doctors to go to right now and I'm thinking of staying home tomorrow to go to one. My question is though I have so many connections and people I like at the office, it wouldn't be right for me to just up and leave. However I don't think I could even work two more weeks there if I give notice. 

I have a backup retail gig I've been at for months and I really like it there. I could work a few days a week there until I figure this out. I would rather work part time and maybe see a therapist and work on my physical health via gym and clean nutrition to be ready to go for next semester. 

What do I do? Should I email my boss and explain the situation? I feel like if I just quit now and don't go in again it will destroy all the recommendations I could have gotten from that job.

If you can be bothered reading this entire post and can provide ANY advice, insight or similar experiences you are the man/the woman.


How can I improve my chances of landing an internship if my average will be not so good upon graduating? What can/must I do now onwards to maximise my chances?


Chose to do chemical engineering because didn't know what to study at uni.


First year chemistry, math and general engineering subjects go decently, however when the actual chemeng classes start 2nd year, I don't enjoy it very much.


I lost motivation and barely studied  outside of assessment tasks. Fail 2 subjects core to the major in the first semester.


Unsure if I should continue with chem eng but felt like I was in too deep so I continued anyway. 


Next semester I repeat one of the failed subjects because it runs in both semesters. Fail it again because of procrastination and fail another 2 subjects also core to the major.


Get called to academic meeting to explain why I dun goof'd and to convince them why I should get another shot. I tell them I didn't enjoy the subject material and had poor off campus study habits. 


I get ""re-accepted"" but with some conditions and change my major to mech eng instead. I have to do one first year physics prerequisite subject and then I can start mech eng subjects. 


If I don't fail any more subjects, my graduation will be delayed by two years compared to if I never failed or changed majors at all.


I haven't told my parents that I failed (my dad would kill me) but I told them I'm changing majors. They aren't very involved with my schooling and won't find out due to how student loans work in my country, but they certainly care if I fail. I plan to tell them in the future.


My WAM is around 60% due to my 5 failed subjects and I wish to do a Master's degree in mecheng which requires at least a 65% for all undergrad subjects undertaken at my uni. I crunched some numbers and with 12 subjects remaining, I need an average of 70% from here onwards to just make it into masters. I know if I fail again, I may get kicked of uni and then I would have to tell my parents.

The stakes are high so I can't afford any more screwups;  some of the 2nd and 3rd year ME subjects have notoriously high fail rates, but I guess I will just have to study my ass off and do what you guys suggest to meet my long term goals.

Thanks guys."

It seems like there's not much marketing for me to actually do, social media is taken care of, promotions (print, radio) are taken care of, so I don't really know what I can help with.

I know sales is critical to learn anywhere I go, but it's just not in my nature (I've been trying to get good at it). I spoke with the owner but she's persistent that this is important for me to accomplish

Should I continue to do this unpaid internship (not sure if I can handle two more months, or go work at my uncle's landscaping company where I can do few things on the business side (marketing)? Plus it's good pay.

I am currently an international student senior studying Computer Science and graduating in May of 2017. I have a question on whether to apply for internships, full time positions, or if possible, both for after graduation? 

To give you more background, a graduate school from back home is sponsoring me to get my undergraduate degree in the US. After I am done, they require me to go back and take a Master’s there. The thing is, I would love to spend a couple of years working for a technology company in the US before I go back to do my masters (I am still planning on getting my masters, it would just be delayed for 2-3 years). The reason I want to stay directly after I finish my undergraduate studies is that I can use my OPT to work instead of having to apply for a work visa.  Ideally, I would get a full-time offer from a company then I would talk to my scholarship and convince them to let me delay my masters. This might not go smoothly because 1) I might not get a full time offer. 2) If I do get an offer, my scholarship might not allow me to stay.

That’s why I am thinking of also applying for internship positions so I would still get some experience in the US before I go back. The thing is, I am not sure how to go about that? Should I apply for both full-time and internship positions? Would companies even allow that? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

Aside from typical EE lab skills, Ive made class projects with an FPGA and Atmega328p. Would a more complex microcontroller project aid in my resume at all?  Im trying to make a project that could show my technical experience with important skills that the industry is looking for. Thanks!! 

If anything, any important skills and traits that i should learn would greatly help."

Both internships I did well in. Hospital offered me a full time position but I wanted to get into the corporate world at first. Exxon said they enjoyed having me, but couldn't offer me full time position. Only 10% of interns that summer were hired thanks to oil price dropping. I have made some personal coding projects consisting of a live online stock brokerage and another that did with making an Online GUI page for a bank. Anyone have knowledge as to what my starting salary may be or what The price ranges I should even consider ? Any other tips are appreciated.  My guess is anywhere from 50-60 but is anything above that too high? Should I pursue the 65-70 starting range or will interviewers laugh at me???"

Hello. I am a rising sophomore currently enrolled in Stevens Institute of Technology. Over the past couple of days, I've been debating on whether or not to transfer colleges based on a couple of recent rumors and events. Basically, my current university is rumored to decline drastically in my field of study(Cyber security major) with less funding and support to the program. I value my education a lot and unfortunately, this rumor is leaning on true. I can go into more detail, but that's for another time. Not only is the program declining, private school is getting more and more expensive as the minute goes by. II'm blessed to be free from any major financial difficulties so far, but I'm not rich and this situation can change in a matter of seconds. I am very worried about my money situation.

One of the selling points about Stevens was the ROI and career support post graduation. However, they have not been much of help towards me in my job. I have an internship right now as an IT technician and I found that job all by myself, no help from Stevens. So considering that, Stevens is looking less and less attractive by the minute. I am sad about losing some friends, but I am across the river so I can easily see them at anytime. After much thought about my situation, I've decided to start transferring.

**Help me**

I've decided to transfer from Stevens Institute of Technology into City College of New York's computer science program by the start of this Fall 2016. My current major is Cyber Security and CCNY offers a bunch of courses in that field. So, I need help in the entire transfer process.

This includes:

* FAFSA transfer

* High School Transcript Transfer

* College Transcript Transfer

* Credit Transfer

* SAT/ACT

* Documentation and processing.

* School refunds

I've been looking on the CCNY website and they offer walk in admissions up until July 12th, so I have some time. I plan to be completely transfer by then. I need help on where to start and how to do things. Please someone help me, I'm a little stressed out at the moment.
Thank you everyone for reading."

My internship for the fall is for client-side development using Typescript and Angular2, with the back-end being handled by Scala. I plan to use the remainder of summer to prepare for work but am having trouble on where to begin since I haven't done any web development or worked with frameworks before.

What should I focus on for the remainder of the summer to prepare myself for work? I am thinking about focusing on Typescript and Angular2 for now and have checked out a tutorial on the Angular website. Can I learn Typescript without Javascript? And what would be a good 2-month project to complete while pursuing this?

I would be an International freshman next year in SF, CA and would like to break into a quant/prop shop/ hedge fund if possible. I took a gap year last year so I have delved into value investing and algo trading for quite a while and have grasped its basics, somewhat managed to code/ backtest in MQL4 or Python and learnt how to build a DCF model. In my first college year I would just study a bunch of general subjects before moving on to, hopefully, CS and business major but I have some coursera certificates in finance so don't know if they help. 
I believe that an internship in freshman year is extremely difficult but not impossible. So any advice (i.e where I should apply, who to cold call/network, what more to learn, majors to choose, communities...) is highly appreciated. "

Will be a 20 year old Junior in the fall at Arizona State University majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in Networking and Computer Systems Security. Currently have a 3.26 gpa (was originally computer science but math/programming classes wrecked me). In this major I take 7 networking classes, 6 security classes, and a few UNIX courses and some other IT classes (all heavy project based)

Link to major map here: https://webapp4.asu.edu/programs/t5/roadmaps/ASU00/TSIFTBS/null/ALL/2016

My school (ASU) also has a 4+1 plan where I can get my master’s degree in Information Technology a year after I graduate (classes senior year count for dual credit) and I just need a 3.2 gpa to quality.

I also have an internship where I currently work with networking and managing servers and windows active directory. Additionally, I want to get into information security or network security and will be studying for the security+ cert in my own time. Plan on getting my SSCP, then CISSP when I can.

Basically, I plan on getting my master’s in IT after my bachelors with the 4+1 program, already have internship, and getting the security+ as an undergrad and more certs as time goes on.

Is there anything I can improve on to maximize my chances in IT? Should I play with a homelab or read more books in my free time for networking/security? I would like to do that, however these classes take up a plethora of time and I’d rather spend my free time on other things."

We're both 20 and we dated for two years and almost exactly three months. When we met, I was still struggling to get over a toxic, emotionally abusive relationship more than half a year after it ended. I felt numb all the time, like something was filtering all my emotions and I only felt to like five percent the capacity I once could.

This girl changed all that. I'd rather have lived the two years we spent together than my entire life before I met her. She taught me how to feel again. We lost our virginity to each other. She was my first real love. And now she's gone and my world is crumbling away.

A month and a week before our sophomore year of college let out, we had our second anniversary. The letter she wrote me, in part, reads ""I love you sooooooooo much and I'll always be thankful for everything you've done for me... I can't wait to see where we are in the future."" Less than a month before she broke up with me she was still telling me she loved me and that she always wanted to be with me.

We were long distance for the second time this summer with her being ten hours away for an internship. I knew things got kind of weird near the end - we weren't talking like we used to. We started only talking once every other day, because she wouldn't answer the same day. I figured she just needed space. I asked her about coming up to visit her.

Wednesday night, she called me up and said, ""I don't think you should come to Cincinnati."" I said, ""Okay...?"" She said, ""I don't think we should be in a relationship anymore."" and went on to tell me that she felt like we met when we were both in a bad place and we connected over it. She said she changed a lot and she learned a lot about being happy and I hadn't changed as much because I'm still depressed and angry at the world in some ways.

I said something like ""if the roles were reversed and i was the one who was happy and you were sad do u think i would just have ended our two year long relationship out of nowhere with a fucking phone call or stuck with it and made that sacrifice and helped you get through your worst times""

and her response to that was ""we never said we would get married or stay together forever."" (we never said we'd get married but we both said the second part regularly so not sure what was up with that.) I asked her how the hell she can want to throw two years away based on a difficult period of long distance and then she told me that she'd been thinking about breaking up with me periodically throughout the entire relationship but this time felt different and this time she didn't think she was going to fall back in love.

This is a girl that made me feel like I could watch the world burn to ashes and not give a fuck as long as she was there in my arms. I could achieve every one of my dreams and get everything I ever desired and more and it would all be for shit because she won't be there to share it with me. Now I know I was a dumbass but I really thought that we had something that would last for the rest of our lives and it was everything. And the fact that this whole fucking time she was consistently on the edge of breaking up with me is too fucking horrible to comprehend. I never even knew she was fundamentally unhappy with our relationship, she gave no indication of that whatsoever. And all this time we felt completely different things for each other. I thought everything was fine and we were going through a rough patch but we would stick it out because we were committed to each other and to staying together. When she texted me ""we need to talk"" before the call I was ready for maybe a minor fight or something that would end in us working together to work it out like we always did with our problems.

I have a few questions and if you have any advice for me or input at all on any of them or anything else to say please go for it.

How do I come to terms with the fact that I cared about her more than anything in the world and this whole time she was vacillating between strong feelings and no feelings for me?

Should I be angry at myself? Should I be angry at her? I don't know what to feel.

She said she still liked me as a friend and I told her it would be a long time before I was ready for that. How long should I wait? What if I never get over her? I can't imagine cutting her out of my life forever even though she was willing to do the same for me.

Please help

In my attempt of labeling them and structuring this chaos at least a tad bit, I've tried several things, but without any result:

- the sockets are placed in a lower level than the server room. Thus trying to track down the cable didn't succeed, because they go through walls.

- installing several kinds of network mapping tools leads to confusing and not accurate results. I've tried Intermapper, Solarwinds Network Topology Mapper, LanTopoLog, netTransformer, trying to figure out the port of the switch which is connected to the clients linked to the unlabeled sockets. Problem is, it shows the wrong connection or cannot identify the port. I haven't tried all of the recommended tools (TheDuke or Nmap) because the layout and the installation/configuration exceed my skills, but I don't know whether they would be able to identify the ports.

- connecting/disconnecting clients to the unlabeled sockets and checking whether any lights at the switches turn on/off. Funnily and frustratingly, there is no change in the light pattern, so yea.

Does anyone have an idea how to solve this problem?"

I don't really feel like I'm learning anything more than what I would by just googling every single problem.  Is this how CS internships usually are, or am I just with a bad team?

I am graduating in a year and a half with a BA in Anthropology / Sociology (concentration in Soc.), a certificate in GIS, and a minor in general mathematics.  My GPA is somewhat low (3.25 overall, 3.60 major), however I have received an award for ""Best In Sociology"" both years at my school, and just this last year was put on the Deans list, and got an award for academic excellence (presenting a research project). I currently am working for my 3rd internship (creating online Data science courses) and hope to have another one this upcoming year.

I am currently looking at the Urban Informatics program at Northeastern, and am looking for more Masters programs that incorporate social sciences and quantitative sciences in a similar way. 

I have good knowledge of R, ArcGIS (working on Q-GIS), and want to be able to incorporate data science with social theory / work with ""data science for social good"".

I am looking for more recommendations for programs! Any and all links / school / program names would be helpful.

I do have a few projects on my resume that I think show my ability pretty well, and relate to the fields I'm interested in (Web dev/design, iOS.) I also have regular job experience working for IT at my school, as well as working for a former professor of mine as a homework/projects grader for the class I had taken with him.

I know my lack of actual internship experience will probably be a detriment when I'm looking for a job upon graduation, but it's not like my resume is completely empty.

4q43ne,7,2016-06-27,"[20M] My family is slowly destroying me personally and I hate my job, both of which are destroying my journalism career, but I can't afford to move away...",JustinPSports,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/4q43ne/20m_my_family_is_slowly_destroying_me_personally/,"To put it briefly, my life is a constant hell. Since high school, my family has constantly tried to sabotage my personal/mental/career growth and prospects, including:

- Constantly calling me stupid or saying I don't make sense, then turning around and saying I'm smart because I got good grades during high school

- Hiding mental health/disability diagnoses from me and refusing to get me proper treatment until I was on the verge of mental insanity a few times and/or could get money from the government for them

- Spoiled me as a child, then immediately tried to force me to do chores I had never been encouraged to do before expecting me to say ""Yes"" to everything at Age 13

- Gave up that tactic and never had me learn life skills or the importance of doing them

- Encouraged me to find a job, but never actually wanted me to actually have one in high school

- Constantly asked if they could throw away or sell my childhood memories/gifts/projects to make more space for other things in the garage/basement

- Refused to let me learn how to drive until I had to force them to bring me to the DriveTest centre before I turned 19 years old

- Banned me from applying for any post-secondary schools outside my city limits

- Refused to sign any documents to allow me to move out or get student loans to go to a school out-of-town

- Constantly said they didn't want me to ever move away

- Got mad when I told them the program/field I wanted to get into required me to move to get a job, then happily said ""See? I told you that you can get a job in journalism here. You don't have to move!"" when the program coordinator said there was some possibilities locally

- Got sole access to my life savings/former college fund/inheritance due to the government having the right to take 95 per cent of it away for tax purposes on disability; they had switched the account owner to just my mother before approaching me with the disability payment possibility

- Got mad when I told them I needed a car to get a job

- Only allowed me to buy my own car with my savings when they got tired of driving me around multiple times a day for a new freelance job

- Constantly encouraged me to drop out and go into IT instead partially because ""I am so smart with computers""; meanwhile, my mother doesn't know what the backspace bar does and gets a computer virus every two months

- Constantly encouraged me to work in retail instead of journalism after trying to find a job two weeks into my search

- Yelled at me for joining a gym despite being weak and very underweight

- Tried convincing me doing hard labour in their backyard was a better way to get stronger than doing sports or going to a gym growing up

- Haven't been hugged or been shown affection by anyone, including by my family, n a long time

- Constantly taught aiming for ""just good enough"" and never standing out was the way life should be and discouraged outside the box ideas or hopes (Example: they were against letting me try go-karts due to the cost and safety, but paid the exact amount for a soap box derby car that I never enjoyed doing because they thought it was a good family-bonding thing to do, then refused to go to events that were more than an hour drive away)

Basically, my family (especially my mother) are holding me back and destroying me inside. Every time I think of her, my jaw locks up from stress. I also now have depression, ADHD, high anxiety issues, vision problems and other issues on top of being mildly autistic that I've tried getting help for in my city multiple times with no positive results.

This has gotten to the point where it's affecting my career. Because I've been unable to find a job outside of my city, I had to take a freelance position at an unknown local media outlet that has caused a LOT of issues (see post history). It's gotten to the point where if I could get a job today, I'd quit the freelance position and leave town within the hour.

Unfortunately, I can't because I don't have enough experience and no connections. Also, my family has all of the money I'd need to move without having too many issues. My confidence at this point is at an all-time low because I know I'd be completely happy and fine mentally living somewhere far from my controlling family (I had this happen when I did an internship up north for a week. When I came back home, so did all the issues I had).

What the hell should I do?"

Anyway, after working for the past month or so in ABAP, I've found it to be pretty dry and uninteresting. I've also come to realize that a lot of the devs here aren't from CS backgrounds (mostly business), and that nobody in tech circles ever really talk about ABAP.

So, is there anybody on here that has worked in SAP as a dev before? How is the career path? Is there interesting work to be found? Does taking a job in SAP pigeonhole you into a career in SAP forever?"
4q4ivd,9,2016-06-27,How common is it for experienced developers to get jobs with new (to them) languages?,DanielAtWork,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4q4ivd/how_common_is_it_for_experienced_developers_to/,"Kind of a hypothetical question, as I'm not looking for a job right this second, but will be in a year or so.

I have, experience wise, two internships at Microsoft during college, two years working at Microsoft on Windows (Writing primarily C), and then two years working at a startup using Python/Django and JavaScript.

What's the process to get a job with a language like Go, Scala, F#, Clojure, Groovy without professional experience using the language?  I'd also prefer not to pick up a strictly ""entry-level"" position at this point, because it'd probably be a significant pay cut.

It sounds kind of obvious that the best thing to do is to pick one (or maybe two depending on how ambitious I am) of these languages and start a side project or two with them.  My concern though is that individually these languages aren't common enough for that to be a really viable strategy.  I don't really care which of those languages my next job is in, I just think there's a correlation between teams willing/interested in using one of these languages and teams that care about software craftsmanship and such.

I'm confident in my ability to pick up a language and be an asset to a team in a short time.  I've studied basic functional programming in school and independently and think I could be proficient in it, etc.

Job listings for mid-level developers almost always specify they're looking for experience in the exact language (and often framework(s)) the company uses, I'm just wondering how likely companies are to make concessions for these sorts of languages."

I recently discovered this (incredibly useful) sub and decided to ask on your opinion on an issue I'm having right now.  

First, some context: my country is going through hell. We're in the middle of an unprecedented financial crisis, so the few job openings right now don't pay nearly as much as need, specially in tech since hardware and software are stupidly expensive. On top of that, urban violence is crazy to the point where even going out to work is dangerous. Basically, things here suck and don't seem to be getting better anytime soon, so I want to move to another country where I can have better career opportunities and more quality of life.  

So, here's my question: how viable it is for a junior like me to start a career (basically a life) from scratch in a completely new country, and how can I improve my chances? I'm aiming towards Europe since my sister lives in Germany, but I'm totally OK with moving to Asia or North America if I have the opportunity to do so. The only thing is that I want to move as soon as possible, because this current situation is already affecting my health.  

As for my profile, I'm 24, with a Honours degree in CS and getting my Master's in Computer Graphics in two weeks. All my work experience has been in teaching CS, but I've had internship experiences in mobile and web dev, UI design and QA. I'm really into graphic, physics and gameplay programming, but I'll take anything that pays my bills and gets me a work visa.

I was talked out of it by my parents and due to pressure, I went another direction (huge mistake I know). I am now a few years removed from completing a non-professional B.S. of Architecture degree, which is what I currently do for work for below average pay. I worked a bit with some coding in the past, but nothing major so I would essentially be working from the ground up.

There's nothing particular wrong with my current field, but considering I would need to go back to school anyways to become a licensed architect and the career outlook in terms of salary and stability has lead me to considering other options. The average pay for someone with a license ranges from $55k-$75k with about 10 years worth of project managerial experience. That's not even including the intern development program, examinations, etc that is done before that which would take up even more time before I can consider becoming a project manager. Basically, I'd be well into my 40's before I start earning an average living.

My current financial status does not allow me to really drop anything in the near future to go back to school. I was looking for any advice on where I can start whether it would be online courses, books, ideal paths, etc. I am exceptionally computer literate and a quick learner. I understand the process and dedication I would need, considering my background. I can potentially take introductory classes at my local community college but I am not sure if I should because it'll costs me money immediately. The other option is to teach myself over-time (for free) so I can pursue pre-reqs later to apply to a master's program. If anyone has any considerations or experiences for schools or paths it would greatly be appreciated!"

I have a friend that is a director level software engineer at a large firm. His groups build a lot of the ecommerce and payment processing software. He told me he can get me a paid internship at his firm. It would be 6 months, and I would have to find a job somewhere else after but he and others would give me recommendations. He says that I would learn a lot and have some projects under my belt to discuss for other positions. I'm trying to figure out if it's worth it.

I've been posting here for a long while and I've noticed how few people here seem to have context when they're asking for advice. People have different motivations in life and the advice you listen to should reflect your internal motivations. 

If you're asking for advice, I'd like to ask you to keep these things in mind. I think it'll make this sub a lot more worth while. 

* Unlike many industries, there's a pretty clear hierarchy of tech companies. This typically comes across as the ""Big 4""/""Big N""/unicorn companies. These are the most prestigious companies that offer the benefits you hear about in the news and high compensation. Most of their offices are based in SF area or other large cities. Most advice here seems to gravitate towards people who want to eventually get these jobs. If you don't, then take everything with a grain of salt. 

* Plenty of people (the ones who don't view this sub) get good jobs. They go through college, graduate, and get a regular job. They don't obsess over side projects, prestigious internships, or interview preparation. They don't have Githubs or portfolio websites. They'll have a career. If you want to go super prestigious, you'll need a huge resume. If not, get away from this sub. All of the overachievers will make you bitter. 

* Have a life. A Big 4 job will not solve all of your problems. If you're feeling down, get the hell away from here. There's a lot of overachievers who will make you feel unemployable. You'll be just fine. You'll get a job. You'll have a life.

Hope this helps. Context is important. You don't all have to play for the NFL and there's nothing wrong if you don't want to."

I learned many useful things like requirement elicitation, managing a backlog, UX design basics, automated testing, and creating user stories and test cases. I Landed my first full time gig at a 10,000+ employee corporation as a BA. 

My current job pays well for an entry-level position in comparison to my peers ($57K). However, I do not feel that it is boosting my career skills very much (dealing with outdated ERPs, legacy home grown systems, ColdFusion, VB6, still can't even tell you if we are waterfall or agile, big separation from IT and the business itself, etc.). I feel like I am a ""Support Analyst"" and not a BA, as 40% of my time is dealing with service desk tickets. I am starting to gain a lot of responsibilities but I am not learning any cutting edge technologies or even applying any of the principles I learned during my internships. 

While I am comfortable at this job, I can't help but hear one of my professors in the back of my head lecturing about being pigeon-holed. And, EVERY KEY POINT he brought up is prevalent (lot of ""lifers"" there because they were also pigeon-holed, pays well, change is near impossible, little to no investment in employees, poor project management, lack of control, etc.). I see very few people my age too, which is also a red flag. 

I am currently interviewing at other companies, and my offers are coming in $6-11K lower than what I am making today. The offers are on the table and I want to be a true BA or QA at a smaller software development firm again. For the sake of my young career, help me feel like I am leaving my comfortable corporate job for all the right reasons to go seek a more challenging job where I can better myself. Now that I have some extra experience and am financially stable, I feel there is no better time than to make the move to get out of a small town and into the city. Has anyone else dealt with this and what are your experiences? Thank you for any advice.

A lot of things seem interesting to me at the moment, for example: real-time streaming like they’re doing and Uber and Netflix; developing a platform like Facebook is doing with React Native; virtual reality; functional programming; working on something like protocol buffers. I’m really having trouble figuring out where to go next and where in the industry I’d be a good fit and would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions.

In general do engineering masters programs in Germany feed into certain companies (internship and career wise) who are invested in the field of study? From my own reading I think they do, so I guess I'm looking for some real world anecdotes here. 

Did you do a nano tech masters in TU Dresden and you now work in a high tech company in Dresden after doing an internship there? Did you undertake an embedded systems masters in Berlin and you got an internship working for Siemens?

I was working as a teacher abroad for 6 wonderful years, but then made the decision to come home to the UK last year with the intention of putting down some roots. After speaking to friends who have worked (and quit) their stressful teaching careers, I am not keen to be a teacher in the UK. I decided to look for something else. However, the search for employment has been far from easy. I worked for 5 months as an office coordinator in a London Estate agent, but the role was made redundant. Since then I've done two internships, one as a marketing assistant at a property company, then as a content writer for a film distribution company. Since April this year I've been searching for a full time job.

Aside from the first job I applied to as a marketing assistant/tech writer, where I actually made it as far as down to the final 3 candidates, no one's biting. My experience in internships only amounts to 8 months, and I think my lack of experience is putting employers off. Now I'm wondering if I should apply to admin and clerical positions, just to have regular income. To be honest, I've reached the stage where any work would make me feel grateful.

I knew that it wouldn't be easy to come back to the UK after a long stint abroad - In Japan I worked my way up from a typical language school to a fantastic academy teaching exam preparation, Global Studies, and creative writing. I don't regret coming home, but I do feel sad that I can't get on with my life - living at home aged 31 and unable to make long term plans with my partner. Of course, I'm grateful to have a roof over my head at all given the situation.

One recruitment company called me inviting me to register, which I did. So far, no calls from them.

However, they said they wouldn't be able to justify that as I currently only make $25/hr as an intern.

What was really frustrating is that the company I work for of course isn't going to pay me that much when I don't have a degree yet, but they are replacing my job with a full-time hire for 80-90K in a much lower priced market.

Let me start with some background information about myself before I get to the main point.
I am a recent graduate, with a Bachelor's and a Master's in Mathematics from the University of Oxford (UK) . I have a strong interest in (theoretical) computer science/ finance and I am looking for a stimulating job that can ideally make use of a big subset of my skills. Originally, I was planning to pursue an academic career but this failed and after this I found myself in the job market with only very few practical/applicable skills (my education was in pure mathematics with a small applied component^^).
At the moment I am thinking about two possible future career plans both as a software developer. The first is to try and end up in one of the big 4. The second is to find work within the financial industry, in particular either a high frequency trading firm or a very technologically focused hedge fund. 
Due to some suboptimal choices from my side, I reached the point where I have to choose between two jobs which do not exactly meet my future plans but could serve as a stepping stone. I briefly describe them below!

The Offers:

The time came for me to seek a job and my first thought was to look for software developer roles. At this point it is worth noting that I haven't had any internships in the past or any other sort of work experience. I applied to a few places and managed to land two job offers, of which one was a bit outside my scope. 

First Offer Details(Company 1):

It is from a company who provides solutions to financial entities. In particular they have a platform in which investment banks, hedge funds and other market participants book their trades. They are a big company and a market leader in their field and evidently seem to be quite well-known. The role is for a junior C++ developer (back-end) as part of their graduate intake for the year. The environment is (almost) relaxed, the people seem smart, the working hours are flexible, the culture is good and the training scheme very solid.

 The main concerns I have at the moment are the relatively low salary (a bit below market rate), the time spent at commuting (roughly 2.5 hours back and forth) and based on what I've read on the internet: that they sometimes use old technologies, for example, the TCL language.

Second Offer Details(Company 2):

A small company (currently 25 people) who is developing a solution that is tailored to spreadsheets and databases (in their case mainly Excel and Access). Their product keeps track of changes to the spreadsheets in order to avoid undesired results. Their clients are investment banks, accounting firms and others who make extensive use of spreadsheets. I came to know them through an acquaintance of mine who speaks highly of them. The role is for a Test Automation Engineer (junior) and the company is mainly using .NET. The environment once again is very relaxed and friendly (probably more than the other company), they are located very close to my house (1 hour commuting back and forth) and they pay approximately 15% more than my first offer.

The main concern: The role in itself (more details further down) and the fact that the company is less known in the market.


The Role:
If I was to accept the offer of company 2, my plan would be to work there for 1-2 years and then transition to a software engineer role somewhere else. I do understand that being a developer from the start would certainly position me better, but is there any chance starting out as an automated tester would make me competitive enough to go for a 2-year experienced developer role? In addition to that, when aiming for developer roles, is being a tester considered a negative thing in general?

The Pay:
I don’t give any weight to a 15% difference in salary, so I am not deciding based on that. Nevertheless, I am a bit worried with the fact that company 1 offers a salary which is slightly below market rate (what kind of candidates would they attract like this?).  Despite that, company 1 had a more difficult interview process than company 2 (in terms of technical ability required). Moreover, when moving on to another job eventually (say after 2 years) wouldn’t the new employer be surprised by the previous salary being low and hence you would have a more difficult time negotiating a higher wage?
Thank you once again for reading through my post and would very much appreciate your feedback.

Now the only two departments that are still on desktops is legal and customer service. We are in the middle of transitioning over. And what is the only department that cannot take a day off: Customer Service. Everyone else on the second floor has laptops and those are easy to move. So I come back, drop the keys on my dad's desk and prepare for Monday, part 2.

I am part of Desktop Support and according to company policies, only the users and us can move the computers. And as seen from my last post, not even the engineers can be trusted or even know what a power cord is. As usual I am the third to arrive (6 of us). The others come in about an hour later and stay about an hour later. So three of us have to move about 20 workstations to another conference room in about 20 minutes.

One of my coworkers has already taken extra mice and keyboards and cables from our warehouse to the conference rooms that they will be staying in. So all we have to do is take their desktops, monitor and phone. Their manager wants everyone ready to take calls at 8am. It is currently 7:40am. We agree to have one rep from each region ready by 8am. And the rest by 8:30am. Five stations up and ready to go in 20 min. between three people? Not difficult. I turn to one of my coworkers:

&gt;Me$:Have you called the network guys and told them what is happening?

&gt;Co$: They are setting up switches in each conference room now.

Since this is before 8am, people are still coming in and walking to their desk. They are complaining about the heat and how they ""can't work in this."" We tell them that we are moving their computers to __ confernce rooms and to find their computer set up there in about 20 minutes. 

We get to one of the conference rooms and there are some guys just working on their laptops.

&gt;Me$: Sorry,  but we were told that Customer Service is using this room today.

&gt;S$: Yea, we are part of Customer Service and we have laptops as well. But we would like our phones.

&gt;Me$: You guys have a laptop and a desktop?

&gt;S$: Yea.

We just start setting up the workstations of those that have one machine and while I work I ask them why.

&gt;S$: We are the mangers of each region and have meetings often. So our supervisor requested laptops so when we have a meeting, we can just grab the laptops and have a computer for our meetings.

&gt;Me$: You know we have docks that you hook your laptop up to and it basically does the same thing. And then when you take your laptop, you have all the files and programs you had open.

&gt;S$: Oh. Well what we have now is fine.

I later find out that the department paid for the laptops. If they went with standard LCM, then the department wouldn't have had to pay for anything. Now we have five less computers to set up, I guess.

&gt;S$: While you have my computer, can you fix the issue with it? I put a ticket in last night about it.

&gt;Me$: Maybe, I will have to see if I have any other high priority tickets.

So we get everything set up and Customer Service is working and on time. So I head back to my desk and get some coffee, because this already feels like a long day. The rest of our team shows up and we tell them what they missed. Luckily they offered to move them back to their offices later today.

I start checking tickets and find the one that that Customer Service manager put in.

&gt;I keep getting a popup that says, ""Software changes are required by your IT department."" This started a couple days ago and I close it out, but then it comes back every time I log in.

Desk, meet face.
I call this particular user and inform him of the bad news.

&gt;S$: Hey, now I'm getting the same popup on my laptop.

&gt;Me$: There is nothing wrong with your computer and it is acting as expected. We just pushed some updates to everyone's computers. Please click on that popup and select install now. After the updates install, it will ask you to restart your computer.

&gt;S$: Oh, I thought it was some virus.

&gt;Me$: No, it isn't

&gt;S$: Will these install on my desktop, or do I need to do this on there as well?

Desk, meet face again.

&gt;Me$: Yes, you will have to do it on there as well.

The department provided lunch to everyone who helped with the move as a thank you. And one rep promised to bring in cookies for us tomorrow."

However, I currently live in an awesome city where it is almost impossible to get a job in my field due to high demand. Basically, I need to be overqualified to be considered because everyone and their brother is trying to move here.

The internship is closer to my hometown, but is still 2+ hours away in a very small town.  I do not know anyone or have any connections to the area.  The internship description is ideal for my career goals, and working with state agencies (State Park and Dept. of Natural Resources) that are really hard to get employment with.  I've also been told that this position could turn into a permanent employment opportunity.  


Does it seem like it's worth the risk to take what could be a great career opportunity, but in a not-so-favorable location?  I know no one can answer this for me, but I'd like to get opinions on whether it's worth leaving my awesome city for a small town and not even a *real* job."

Here is my profile: I'm a 24 years old Computer Science graduate who's about to get his Master's degree (just two weeks left after three long years of hard work, yay!). I'm fluent in Portuguese and English (got a 8.5 score on IELTS General Training a couple months ago) and speak intermediate French. I've been working on education since I graduated, teaching basic Computer Science to low income and at-risk adults and seniors. Since teachers are severly underpaid in Brazil and we're going through an unprecedented financial crisis, I unfortunately don't have that big of a budget. By the end the year, after I get my tax refunds and vacation bonuses, I'll have about US$6k to relocate.  

I'm in an almost desperate need to move to a country with better quality of life and career opportunities because the current state of Brazil's economy and society is already affecting my health. Everything is getting more and more expensive, my salary barely affords my bills, I'm scared of even going to work due to the crazy urban violence rates in my city... Life's really crappy. I'm willing to move to any EU or NA country, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand... basically anywhere with a better quality of life. However, it would be better to go to a LGBT friendly place since I'm gay, but most of those options are better than here.  

I know my profile gives me an advantage since so many countries are in need of IT people like me, but I'm afraid my lack of work experience as a de facto developer might be an issue (I have internship experience in development and QA, though). My sister has been living in Germany for 15 years and invited me to go apply for a job search visa and live with her while I look for something, but there's the issue of the language barrier. Going to an English-speaking country would be way easier, but I don't have enough funds to apply for a Canadian or Australian work visa, since those are really expensive when converted to my currency. I thought of going to Ireland as a tourist and looking for something from there too, but I don't know if that would be too risky.  

I could really use any advice you could give me. I can't wait to get the hell out and would love doing that by January. Thank you in advance for your time reading this :)"

I'm also not really sure what tier of schools I'm competitive for. I'm interested in computational biology and genomics, with a particular interest in applications to precision medicine.

**School Info**: Top 20 Public Uni (US)

**Degrees**: B.Phil. (research intensive degree) Neuroscience, B.A. Philosophy of Science, Minors: Chem, CS

**GPA**: 3.82, will likely increase a bit.

**GRE**: Taking in July

**Research**: 3+ years in a lab at home institution for my thesis. Heavy computational neuroscience to my thesis work, but is not exclusively computational. 3 Summer Research/Internships: 1 at a state university, 1 very competitive fellowship at CSHL, 1 internship at leading bioinformatics lab at an Ivy League. I also have a job managing and developing the bioinformatics pipelines for a research group at a local hospital, but this isn't really research...more of a technical role.

**Publications**: None in press, but I have one in review (but has been almost a year now). I also expect to submit a paper relating to my thesis work as a coauthor (possibly first) and a short software paper to Bioinformatics relating to work from a summer fellowship (first author) in the next month or two. I have also submitted a manuscript about the philosophy of the human genome project to a philosophical journal (no idea if this is relevant).

**Presentations:** 1 Poster at leading conference in genomics/bioinformatics earlier this year. Taught a high school class relating to my work.

**Letters**: Not 100% sure, but planning to get 2 from prominent names in genomics that I have worked under (both for a summer) and 1 from my thesis advisor.

**Other**: Working on developing a mini-course to teach high school students about computational bio and genomics, hopefully will be teaching this in the Fall. Won a couple fellowships from my school and was an honorable mention for the Goldwater Scholarship

**Possible Schools**: Unsure where I am competitive, but have been looking at Cornell Tri-I CBM, MIT CSB, Harvard BBS, U of Washington, NYU, BU, Berkeley, Cambridge (Sanger Institute), Johns Hopkins

4qc3cw,1,2016-06-28,UNIX Laptop Choices?,birdkickr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4qc3cw/unix_laptop_choices/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

Long story short, my 2 year old ~$1100 Lenovo Y510P laptop apparently has really bad compatibility with Linux. I have tried most major Linux distributions, including many flavors of Ubuntu, Arch, Mint, and in every since case my internet speeds are around a third of what they are on my phone or when the same laptop is using Windows. The distribution would sometimes suddenly refuse to boot up. Additionally, apparently my Microsoft mouse has really bad compatibility with Linux as well and the scroll wheel speed is abysmally low, making it a pain to scroll through pages as well. This is something I unfortunately could not fix even though I thought it would be a simple look into the settings. It sucks to be unhappy with a computer that is relatively new with nice specs.

I am looking for a new laptop and I have been using a company Macbook Pro 2015 for around 3 weeks now for my internship which I love. I really like the polish of the apps and how everything just works and the safety of the community to help me troubleshoot things when the computer is not working. However, the price point is pretty steep. I have enough money to purchase the upcoming 2016 MBP when it comes out, but I'm not sure if it is the smartest decision.

At the same time, I have had really bad experiences with Linux... and I really don't want to buy a ""more compatible"" computer just to see that Linux doesn't work like I want it to. I have no installed Linux on another other computers before so I'm not sure if my current laptop is a crazy outlier or if it, in general, is just an unpolished OS.

As for Windows, it is out of the question because of the hassle of not being a UNIX machine in general, and all the workarounds that I need to do just to install simple programming languages. I was very excited when the Ubuntu bash for Windows 10 was released, but realized that the functionality was limited as well. No options to fully theme the terminal, overall unpolished, and hassle of trying to juggle between the two workspaces that Windows and Ubuntu use. For example, I can't just go open sublime/atom from the Ubuntu Bash through the terminal. Clunkiness and excess out-in-the-open files that, when using ls, gets spammed with useless system files. No way to change the home to a more convenient place, etc.

Any ideas? How are your experiences with Linux and MacBooks? What laptop would you suggest for someone that is going to his junior year in college? Am I being too particular with everything? Thank you."

I myself did an internship related to a medical field in the past and it was brutal, but I was in a particularly challenging program. I do not know if my experience matches other majors so well. It made me really appreciate the difference good internship mentors can make versus bad ones.

3 other interns. Cooler weather. More opportunities to know the developers. Can Travel Asia after the internship ends in December. Skip a semester of school. 14 weeks

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; Spring                                
&amp;nbsp;
1-2 other interns. Cooler Weather. Can take upper level computer classes before the Spring internship. Can also travel after the internship ends in May. Skip a semester of school. 14 weeks

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; Summer  
&amp;nbsp;
30 other interns. More fun since more people around my age. Program specifically for undergraduate interns. 10 weeks. Gets really HOT. Can't travel. Don't have to miss school. 

Other than this, can people talk about their experiences regarding their internships? (i.e. A Fall internship vs a Summer internship)

I am supposed to start at a top 20 program in the fall. So I thought that I'd try to do some interesting work for the summer, and applied to internships to reinforce my experience pre-MBA. I landed one at one of the most recognizable tech companies in the industry. So, I move to SF for the summer.

It turns out my boss is 10/10, the company is really great, tons of smart people working on really interesting problems, it is obviously a great place to work. Then they make me full time offer where they'd create a position for me on this kick ass team. Comp ~100k all together. Just about everyone else on the team has their top 25 MBA.

I'm having a tough time with this. Is is an offer a lot of people would kill for. But I'm in my 30s and am kind of thinking that if I don't do the MBA now, I'm probably not going to do it.

I didn't ever imagine myself in tech, but I've gotta say, it's pretty great. My concern is that the MBA sets one up with experience that leads to myriad exit opportunities, whereas I don't know if that'd be true with this position. 

Any and all advise on this, the mother of great problems to have, is appreciated. Thanks!

4qe068,9,2016-06-29,What general background might you expect someone interested in OS and other low-level work to have?,zinzam72,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/4qe068/what_general_background_might_you_expect_someone/,"As the title kind of alludes to, I, as a computer science student entering his senior year this fall, am interested, after graduating, in pursuing a career in low-level systems programming of some kind. I was wondering what people might think are sort of ""pre-requisites"" for working in this domain, to make sure I am up-to-speed before graduating.

For myself, so far, from a school perspective, I've done what I can to focus my courses and electives on this sort of area, i.e., low-level programs and the hardware that sits under them. I've taken intro to digital logic (number systems, combinatorial/sequential circuits), the standard assembly/processor architecture course, systems programming (intro to sockets, threads, writing a shell, etc.), concurrent programming (theoretical models, critical section problem, classical problems like dining philosophers, implementing concurrent scenarios in Java), operating systems, computer networks, parallel processor architecture (some architecture concepts like ILP and GPU architecture, mostly parallel programming in pthreads, OpenMP, SSE instructions, and CUDA), high performance computing, an independent study where I tried to port Plan 9 to a new single-board computer (though this ran into a lot of trouble), and another independent study/research project for formal OS verification where I'm currently working with formally modelling assembly.

Besides my in-course work, I also did some assignments for the undergraduate OS course (I took the grad one) that involved working in the Linux kernel. I'm also currently completing a six-month internship working on a driver for a large Silicon Valley company.

However, even given all this, I feel like my knowledge is still lacking in many ways, when it comes to doing this kind of work, particularly when it comes to hardware concepts. I feel that most of the people with whom I work at my internship come from a computer engineering background, so I am wondering if I might be missing things by coming from computer science instead. With my senior year coming up, I'm starting to think of the best ways I can do more to learn and prepare, using courses where possible, before I graduate. For example, there are digital systems, microcontroller, and embedded systems courses offered in the electrical and computer engineering department. Another current plan for next year is doing my group senior design project building a small kernel for a professor's research project. However, most of these courses would be pure electives, so I also don't want to stretch myself too thin during my senior year and so want to try to kind of focus what I should work on.

With all that said, what kind of background, in general, would you expect someone who wants to work on low-level systems code to have? In particular, for me, given the background I've described as already having, what additional types of courses should I take/concepts should I focus on before I graduate to better prepare myself? Sorry if this is too vague or too complicated (or both), but I thought it was worth asking."

Core duties:

* Recruiting and managing a volunteer team

* Running 3 educational tech events a year, mentoring students at them

* Managing an intern for the summer (created the whole role for the intern, as well. In charge of planning what the intern does etc)

* Promoting the event- generally leading innovative growth

* Fundraising, sponsor relations

* Recruiting mentors, judges for each event

* Essentially leading the non-profits operations in a certain region of the US (A state)

* Looking into expanding to an extra city in the state, which would double my duties essentially.

Accomplishments:

* Grown the event exponentially / our operations substantially in one year, in a very difficult region

* Trained a full volunteer staff which will take over the event next time it comes around

* Garnered significant support from school boards, teachers, sponsors

* Very high post-event survey scoring from attendees- near perfect, which is typically unheard of (NPS of ~95)

What I want to do:

* Project management

* General sorts of management

* Maybe growth hacking

When trying to apply this experience, I daunted with online searches; the sheer amount of options leaves me uncertain of which type of role to choose or if I should work at a large or small company. I've been using indeed and my school resources when looking for employment, but are there other places I should be looking at as well?


Any insight to my situation would be incredibly helpful! Thanks!

I was wondering about something for a couple of weeks/months. I want to complete a certification before I graduate next may with my Computer Science BS degree and I was wondering if it was a good idea to study for the Security+ certification? 

Just to give some background, I have already completed my Computer Science major at my college (but I'm staying the extra two semesters for my honors thesis paper and because I love college and don't want to graduate a year early, since I'm only 21 years old). I haven't juggled school life and fraternity/social life well so I have a 3.3 gpa (but I'm doing a good internship at Gartner during this summer). I'm currently planning on taking the certification right before school starts this fall (which gives me about 2 more months to study). I started studying early this month and I think I am making good progress, and also I took a computer security course at my college last semester which make certain topics still fresh in my mind. 

Also one more thing I'd like to add is that I loved hacking games back in highschool and got pretty good at it and cracking applications. Since this is what drove me to do Computer Science, I'll just add that I'm highly motivated and enjoy learning more about security. 

So what do you guys think, is the Security+ certification too high of a goal for an undergraduate? Would it look impressive to employers if I pass or do well? Or should I spend my time doing something else? Any advice or tips would be very appreciated. "

I am a senior CS student at a small liberal arts state school in NC. I spent my first few years slacking off, not really worrying about my grades.

The only language that I know on a level that I feel I could pass a whiteboard interview is Java. I have some knowledge about javaScript, html, and css but that's about it. I have no prior experience that I feel that has prepared me for a career in the industry. I've wanted to apply for internships but I feel that I'd have no value to a company. 

What can I do this last year of school (also for my senior project), to make up for the mistakes I've made so far? My senior project class is in the Spring of 2017. I've thought about trying to work on some personal projects to beef up my resume but I don't know where to start. I'm interested in web development and Android development but I'm afraid I don't have enough time to make anything that has enough value to put on my resume.

I'm not going to do it with the company, but that's not my problem.

When asked about me doing my thesis with them (~7-9 weeks in to my internship, about 2-3 times) I've said ""yea I expect to do my thesis here if you want me to of course :)"" which they have responded to with ""that is awesome we are sooooo looking forward to see what you will bring"". So there I am, stupid me, talking over myself and tomorrow I will be in a black trash bag on the side of a deserted road, fuck I am so stupid.

In the last 5 weeks I've tried to convince myself that doing this project would be the right thing to do, but I just can't seem to convince myself. So in the last couple of days I've talked to my advisor, friends, family and even some of the coworkers I feel comfortable talking to. 

In summary from the above: ""Do what you love, you have a choice between doing it with or without them, the choice is there for a reason, don't feel guilty about it, but be nice about it and excuse your lack of discreetness when you've talked to your boss about the project.""

I really do feel guilty, these guys have individually been taking time out of their schedule to help me understand complex problems, walked me through my code, even made a couple of code reviews and purposely given me compliments in the vicinity of coworkers from other departements. I sincerely believe the company has given my experience which I feel I will need for the rest of my education, no doubt, and now I have to tell them ""I'm outta here"".

Shit guys ...

**TL;DR** I have to tell my super nice and very awesome internship that I'm not doing my thesis with them even though I've expressed 2-3 that I would because I was in doubt the whole time. Also stupid man."

I received a speeding ticket a few months ago in Heber City, Utah (right past Park City). I was going to a local outdoor recreation spot with my girlfriend, her sister and her mother. I already went for the first trial, pleaded not guilty. So tomorrow I have the next trial where the final verdict will be stated. 

What happened was that I moved to the left lane while passing two 18-wheelers that were in the right lane while on a 300(ish) yard downhill. Wasn't too steep, but steep enough for your speed to catch up on you.

I ended up passing the highway patrol, who was parked in the median, soon after passing the trucks. I was clocked at 83 in a 65. I was polite to the officer, did everything he asked, and ended up getting ticketed for 70 in 65. I am currently 19, 18 at the time of the ticket. 

Basically I would be willing to pay the fine, go to a driving class, or do community service...ANYTHING besides having insurance rates go up. This is my first time being in trouble with the law, have a job as well as an internship, also a 3.86 GPA. 

Any suggestions? Thanks!"

But now their job market is over saturated. So many lawyers for people to pick from, so naturally lawyers lower their prices to get business. My mom could barely get clients in our city of 200,000 so she went back to school to get an MBA and we moved to a bigger city. 

Now everyone is saying computer engineering/programming is in high demand. I just finished highschool and everyone wants to be a programmer. They're even teaching in in hs now, because of the high salaries and apparently the job market needs so much more. Every kid who plays video games wants to be a programmer and make video games or apps or whatever.

How is that not going to create an over saturated market? Everyone is learning how to code, with so many people going into that field, I don't understand how the salaries won't decrease? Just like it did for lawyers. Then they will even have to try to get a job next to hundreds of other people trying to get the same job. 

Same with engineering. Just went to see entry level mechanical engineer jobs and hundreds of people apply to every single one. I don't know how I would ever be picked when the field has so many new graduates every single year. 

I wanted to do engineering because it interests me and above all I thought it had a low unemployment rate. Now I don't know anymore. 

I feel so depressed about going to college, because unless I network, join clubs, do interships/co-ops and maintain a 3.5GPA I'll just be one of the hundreds all applying for the same entry level job and being overlooked. 

I know there are plenty of people who managed to get jobs with lower scores and less internships and all that. But that's because of networking mostly. 

I'm wrong right? 

I heard the baby boomers or whatever generation is going to be retiring soon. Is that true? I'd probably graduate in like 4 years so if that timeline matches up I'd feel better about all this.

I've been looking into the possibility of applying to grad school, but I know I have a lot of work to do to get myself into acceptable shape for grad school admissions, especially if I want it to be in CS.

My questions are:

1. I don't have any undergrad research experience, which I really regret. Where do I start looking for this kind of experience, especially when most, if not all, internship opportunities are for students? I see that a lot of weight is put on this.

2. I graduated with a 3.2 GPA, which I understand is on the low end. I've seen advice for people to go back and retake advanced classes with a better grade to show your improvement and to raise your GPA. I've already long since graduated. How would I ""replace"" my GPA for a higher one? Go back to school for an associates degree? Apply to another school and take classes for my degree all over again? Would they even allow me to retake classes a degree I already earned?

3. I don't have any academic references, but I do have some professional ones. This is something I'll have to figure out on my own.

4. For those who applied to grad school long after your bachelors, what did you have on your application that you think really made you stand out/get accepted?

In the end, I'm probably just going to need to ace the GREs, reteach myself CS, (somehow) get a job in a CS research related field, and hope that's enough to get me accepted into a graduate program?

Where in the US are most CE jobs located. Where is the industry most active? 

What are interviews for CE positions like? I'm guessing they don't just grill you on algorithm questions and want to see understanding of OS/computer architecture stuff.

How hard is it to get find entry level CE positions and get into the field? How important is GPA?

About pigeon-holing. How separate is it from the rest of software engineering. How hard would it be to get into or out of into normal software engineering? (like servers and backend stuff not webdev or mobile)

But...

I barely have any programming skills. I did some personal projects, know quite a few programming languages but can't make myself to program. I am actually really depressed about it because I found at an internship that I seem to dislike IT work in general. A few times, classmates asked me why I am studying CS and I could not answer. The only explanation was that ""it was time to move towards some goal"" and ""I did not have anything more intriguing lined up."" I realized that I was telling myself to complete a few projects for years and they are not even started yet. I find that programming is very hard for me and does not come easy as for my other classmates. I also have issues with grandiosity because I HATE to be mediocre at something but still can't make myself phenomenal programmer. I believe that the real story is that I don't really like this line of work. But I have nothing else lined up that I would care about.

If this helps, I am INTP - a type most likely to enjoy abstract problems and analysing. Yet, I feel absolutely in the black depressed about my choices so far. I do not love myself and tend to beat myself for not exploring alternative options earlier.

I performed well at school, ended up depressed because I could not choose subject to study, found Edx courses, applied for CS and here I am, unsatisfied again. I studied biology, chemistry, physics at school and was very good at first two. I was told by multiple people I'd make a phenomenal doctor(I truly care about diseases and find them fascinating, I read blogs on nutrition and cutting-edge research on things like human microbiome). However, I love sciency stuff, not that into patient care aspect which would make me horrible doctor.

Truth is, I cannot see myself doing software development professionally, I don't care about business analyst or managers role. I did QA and found it excruciatingly boring and mind-numbing. I still have an option of med school and the reason of not going there was commitment of at least 6 years. I was not and still don't know if I shall pursue that. I just know that I care about biology, chemistry and human body a lot more than any IT stuff. If someone gave me 50m bucks, I'd probably never write a line of code again. That says it all.

The downside is, the pay is minimum wage and I'd have to stick with it for 2-3 months and I'm not guaranteed to get a developer position at the end of the internship.

My question is, should I even go through with this interview process and should I accept if I were offered the job? Is it worth my time?

Here is some more information about the company and the position:
