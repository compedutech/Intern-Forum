5lcpnv,2,2016-12-31,Graduate School Applications,justsomeriverbrooks,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/5lcpnv/graduate_school_applications/,"Out of curiosity, does anyone know how graduate schools value internships and experience against research and extracurriculars in engineering? I like to think that I have a pretty strong resume for a computer engineering student, but I'm having trouble deciding on what to focus on. Here's a little bit about me.

- Undergraduate junior majoring in computer engineering, minors in comp sci and math

- 4.0 major GPA, 3.96 cumulative 

- Been working on research regarding computer vision and robotics since sophomore year of college in a lab at my university (mostly C and Python programming)

- Completed an internship on big data analytics last summer, going to work as an intern for computer vision/autonomous robotics at Lockheed Martin this summer

- some interesting side projects, like iOS development, computer games controllable through hand gestures via webcam, and writing a multicore processor for assembly on FPGA boards

- programing skills in C/C++, Python, Java, C#, Matlab, Swift, Assembly

- worked as an undergrad TA in a few different classes (introductory C, data structures in C/C++, diff eq)

But my extracurriculars are a little lacking. I guess what I'm asking is, do you think it would be better for me to relax a bit on side projects/internship stuff, and focus on extracurriculars/research for graduate school, or should I keep doing what I am doing? Currently I am only involved in my college's ambassador's program, but my research/courses/side projects take so much time that I rarely have time to sleep or see my friends, let alone join tons of clubs. I also wonder if my decision to pursue internships and make industry connections will be perceived as worse than constant focus on research."

All your help was awesome!

All of you answered my question perfectly and gave me a ton of useful resources. But then you went above and beyond! One of you sent me a keyboard over Amazon, which I've been using ever since. One of you sent me an internship program in NYC (didn't get in, but ah well!). One of you even offered me a room in your apartment! I felt too bad to take it, but I really appreciated the offer. Maybe be a little more careful taking strangers into your homes, Pythonistas! Haha, just kidding.

Coding's helped me keep my sanity these past months. I've been working on a ""world creator"" of sorts. Builds a procedurally-generated (I hope I'm using that term right!) world from the ground up, including the terrain and climate. Got me reading all sorts of weird books in the library, that's for sure; topics I've never considered before. Maybe I'll share what I've got so far once I clean it all up a bit! It's quite messy at this point.

Sorry for ranting, I'm feeling quite excited right now and I wanted to share it with someone! I'm getting off the streets this week. I mended my ties with my family and now I'm gonna take care of my grandma, who's become very ill recently.

Hope you all have a great New Year's Eve/Day!"

After that my working profile is pretty sad i only work shit jobs like clerk groceries store, steward and waiter (im 24)

I plan to go back and complete higschool (at least) but to do that i need a decent job with set on stone work hrs or set on stone day off so working for restaurants is not a option

Looking at my job market in my city, iven aming to job like departamental cloth store, receptionist, office assistant or whatever other job that offers good working hrs (not really looking to much into howmuch money they pay) but the problem is that all this jobs ask for higschool and above some even want finishd collage on top of 1 or 2 years of experience and FEMALE ONLY (literally getting told NO because i have a dick) and im feeling cornered to go back and work in restaurants.

We also have big boys hotels in my city that hire people all the time, sometimes they just list jobs and say ""send resume"" i was thinking to send mine and just put in there ""looking for whatever job this is the list of jobs im interesting in"" and hope they give me a call offering me something but not really sure if is a smart thing to do

The interviews that i already did in the past my experience is pretty much the employer talking about the job im applying for in a bigger and more complicated way of what it actually is and telling me lack of experience and shit and just getting told no

My GPA is pretty bad (2.6) so unfortunately I can't get into grad school. I have had a few internships that aren't relevant to my field at all (one was in publishing, the other was event coordination and marketing), some research experience (I worked on an econometrics project with a professor), volunteer work, service industry jobs and random campus jobs I held as a student.

I have been searching for the past year, started to get more aggressive in my search since July. I have probably submitted around 700+ job applications (combination of sending in resumes + cover letter, applying on company websites and sites like LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, StartWire, Indeed, Craigslist, etc). I tried connecting with alumni from my school, and even thought I was going to get a part-time job doing remote data work through that connection but that didn't work out. I tried going to career fairs and networking events but nothing came of those either. I tried asking my professors if they knew of any leads but they ignored me. I've redone my resume and cover letters multiple times and made sure everything was perfect and up to date. I am getting desperate and helpless with each rejection I get. I see all of my peers getting these amazing jobs on LinkedIn and I constantly wonder what is wrong with me. 

I have a few skills. I know how to use SAS and Stata. I am fairly competent with Excel, I know basic VBA, macros, pivot tables, powerpivot, vlookup and all that jazz. I have been working on improving my Access, SQL server, R, and Python skills these past few months as well through tutorials on Lynda. I've also been volunteering as an SAT tutor these past few months too so I have something to explain my resume gap.

I have had a few interviews (mostly phone screenings) but they never seem to go anywhere. I realize I probably don't interview well and am working on improving that. A lot of jobs I apply to are out of state, as my area and state in general is terrible for job opportunities right now. That might be a factor too as I'm sure most employers have hoards of competent local candidates competing for those positions. I've applied to mainly entry-level analyst jobs but I've since branched out and am looking for anything, at this point.

I would greatly appreciate any help and advice at this point. I am nearly 50K in student loan debt, desperate and don't want to be living in my parents house forever! (Although I am grateful for their support!)

Also, I'm in the US if that helps!

Please. 


I don't know where you think you are, or who you think you are, or when you think you are, but whatever you think is wrong. 


Your names are Dr. Lily Jacobs and Dr. Simon Yao. You are brilliant particle physicists. The year is 2072 and you have to snap out of it or we’re all going to die. 


Maybe I should back up. Maybe if I tell you about what’s going on something will jog your memory. God I hope so. My name is Evie, Evie McCray. I’m an intern at Protech, working for the Division of Matter Transfer. In laypeople terms, we call it teleportation. I work for you two. Or at least I did. Right now the whole division has gone absolutely haywire, but I’m getting ahead of myself. I started working here three months ago. It’s part of a college research project for me, the worst part is, I’m not even a particle physicist, I’m an analytical chemist, but this was where I could get in for an internship. In any case, when I started, you two were damn near finished building the full size machine. Again, I’m moving too quickly.


Dr. Jacobs - you started working for Protech five years ago, directly out of your PhD. Your thesis was on the transmutative properties of neutrinos, and you’d been working in an underground lab studying how subatomic particles (when present in sufficient quantities), can transform neutrons into protons. Then, the newly transformed atoms can be heated to incredibly high temperatures to promote electron activity, and you essentially change one atom into another. That’s a lot of technical jargon, but it essentially meant that you could change carbon into nitrogen using physics and chemistry, which is a pretty huge deal. Anyway, you were hired to run the Division of Matter Transfer after the higher ups were impressed by your publications. The idea was always to make a system that could safely transport perishables to high risk areas. You are brilliant, and kind and funny. You were always my favorite person to see every day. Your mother misses you terribly, and I’ve been taking care of your dog for you.


Dr. Yao - you’ve been working for Protech for much longer than Lily - I mean - Dr. Jacobs, nearly 10 years. You started off engineering nanites that could take genetic material and clone it almost instantly, before moving on to cloning inorganic and non-living materials. I’m not really sure how it works, you never really explained it to me. You started working in DMT at the same time as Dr. Jacobs was as Chief Engineer. You built the machine that made the magic happen. Your family is in Cleveland, but you don't talk about them much. We were never really close, but you're the smartest man I ever met. 


I suppose now we should get to the good stuff, but I’d like to preface with we never intended for this to be used on humans. It wasn't in the design plans, we weren't even sure that the small scale machine was safe to transport food until we got the people from the FDA involved. But it was safe, and we built a bigger machine. A huge machine in fact. Big enough to transfer 100 tons of grain from our lab in Seattle to our partner lab in Savannah. Everything was set to go, but when we hit the button to start the process, the particle beam warning light came on. There was a bad connection between the transmitter and the power source, and we had to fix it. So, the three of us went down. I wasn't allowed to touch anything, seeing as my most important function to this point was proofreading emails. So the two of you got your hands in, and for lack of better terminology, fiddled around. We heard a loud electrical noise, smelled copper and you were gone. So was the grain. 


We called Savannah to see if they’d gotten you guys and/or the grain. They hadn't, but something showed up. It smelled wrong and it oozed some sort of thick, black, pasty substance. The chemists who looked at it were stumped. It was as though everything holding the grain together decided it didn't feel like it anymore, and so all the protons, neutrons and electrons slurries together, and the charges all faded. That’s never happened before. Charges aren't supposed to fade. Protons and electrons repel one another, they don't commingle into some sort of sludge. The scientists who weren't wearing protective gear when they encountered whatever came through started to feel sick. They smelled what they described as an “electrical smell.” Within two hours they were puking up black slime. Within four hours they were dead. Whatever that shit was, it was toxic. It also doesn't burn, dissolve or interact with the substances around it, it can't, from a chemical perspective. 


We assumed that you two were part of the sludge, and that you were unfortunate victims of a scientific experiment gone wrong. The problem was, the sludge didn't go away, but it did expand. It started to reduce the things around it to slurry as well, until the lab was essentially a black pit. The smell at that point grew too strong to block it with standard protective gear. And the black shit that people were vomiting up was the same toxic muck. The government is currently trying to lockdown the site and prevent anyone else from going near it, but there have been reports around Savannah of people who work in sewage coming into contact with it. Those people take it home, and it’s spreading. The doctors here estimate that once 100 people are infected, the resulting spread will be enough to start an epidemic, seeing as nothing seems to get rid of it. We’re at 23 now. About 15 minutes ago we got a call that the sludge had leaked into the water supply. I won't be surprised if half of the watershed is infected within the next 48 hours. 


It turns out that there is some silver lining. You guys aren't dead. You got trapped, in my head. It’s amazing what a brain activity monitor can tell you. At first we thought I was having a seizure or something, but there’s three sets of activity, three separate brainwave patterns, and most eerie, three separate heartbeats, although your two heartbeats are fainter. We don't know exactly how this happened. But I can tell you this. Whatever your life is, it's not real. Those people in your house are not your family/friends. You don't live in the house you’re in. You don't have the job that you remember going to every day. Whatever life you’ve carved yourself is a fantasy, something that will take you away from what’s really going on. It isn't real. 


The heartbeats have gotten fainter, as my brain is treating you two like an infection, cutting off oxygen and resources from the parts of my body dedicated to feeding you. You won't live long if we can't get you out, and neither will I. The black sludge is dangerous, contagious, and highly suspect. If you’re there, you’re the only people who can fix this.


So please, wake up.

5ldzio,4,2017-01-01,Postgraduation Resume...Which internships stay and Which ones Go?,loner-_-,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5ldzio/postgraduation_resumewhich_internships_stay_and/,"Hey Everyone,

I'll try to make this as short as possible. I'm graduating in electrical engineering soon and applying to specific jobs. Problem is, I've had a lot of engineering internships from completely different fields. I wanted to make sure I exposed myself to as many different engineering fields as possible while in college (better to try then, than when you are graduated), and I'll never regret that decision.

What I'm having a hard time deciding is if only certain internships should stay, or if I should keep them. Also, some of the internships lasted longer than others. On average though, each lasted 5-8 months and I never had more than 3 weeks between them. Here are two reasons why I'm having a hard time deciding:

1. If I remove an internship, I will have a few months of a gap (either in the summer or school year) in my resume.

2. I worked a lot of jobs while in college (7, to be exact). They all gave me unique skills that I feel make me a good candidate for several of these jobs. One gave experience in dealing with the technical support and maintaining customer relationships. Another gave me great software development experience and the Agile development process. Another made me better at multitasking. Another made me better at understanding how control systems worked. Another gave me good experience with technical writing. Another gave me experience with machine learning (hot word for many many jobs right now, and will continue to be). And...you get the picture.

So, how should I go about deciding which internships and/or jobs should I remove? I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything they may find as useful to their team or company.


Thanks in advance everyone, I really appreciate it."

I wanted to major in computer science, but my parents did not let me, because they said there's no jobs and they are all outsourced, and that my marks were too high to go into computer science (I had a 99% average), and that I couldn't turn down acceptance into the best engineering school in my country, and that engineers made 200k/year (which now I obviously know is not true), etc. So I had to major in electrical &amp; computer engineering, which I regret.

However, I want to get into computer science and be as good as I can be. Currently, I have a 3.9/4.0 GPA in my program, so I should be able to get into grad school, but know very little discrete math and theoretical computer science.

So my question is, what should I do? Should I shift my current undergrad degrees focus from computer engineering to electrical engineering, and then go back to school to get a bachelors in CS, or go the computer engineering route and try to get into a CS grad school? Apparently the latter is possible, but I'm not sure what my best options would be. I'm in my third year, and have taken all computer engineering courses so far. Such as compilers, operating systems, hardware,

EDIT: My gut opinion is that I think it would be best to focus in electrical engineering, and then get a double major in theoretical math and theoretical computer science, then go into grad school, which would probably give me the best of both worlds.

I will have no student loans after completing my degree, because I have landed an internship position, and can likely use the money I make to pay for my next degree as well, since I currently live with my parents.

Thanks!

I've been working on getting rid of these bad habits and trying to make my code more legible and easier for other people to look at and immediately understand. 

I saw a story here on reddit posted by a intern who always had to have his code be rewritten by a senior developer. Every morning he would come in to the office and find that his original code had been commented-out and rewritten. It wasn't an issue of functionality; it was always a problem with readability, efficiency, or conforming to generally accepted standards. I can already see myself as that guy and want to know how to avoid becoming ""that guy"". Do you guys have any tips on writing better code or know any good habits I should be learning?

We have asset tags, but we do not use any asset tracking software. The asset tag number is in the computer name. The only way for us to know who a computer is assigned to is that our help desk software scans the network every day, and fills in the logged on user. We also use another product to manage computers that also pulls the logged on user. There are 3 obvious massive flaws in this; 1) the computer needs to be online and 2) the user needs to be logged on and 3) logged on user is not always going to be 100% reliable in telling us who the computer is assigned to.  
I have a security role, so while this isn't exactly my area, it totally is at the same time because accurately tracking our assets is absolutely part of being secure.  
I've brought this up before, and have faced resistance from both management, who don't seem to understand the importance, and coworkers, who don't want to deal with the extra work (yeah that's right, scanning an asset tag in is a real back breaker).

Firstly, let me apologise for the garbled response I gave in my daughter’s last post, a year ago now. I simply wanted to let you all know it was over, but I’ll be honest, I posted that before I realised it was a single part of her ‘story’. I thought the writing I saw on her phone was just her calling a friend for help. Forgive me, I am not the most technological person. I have managed to find and read the previous posts on here. I’ve linked them at the top of the post, in case you want to understand more about what I’m going to tell you, but please remember this is her version of events. I’m sure it’s what she believes, but she doesn’t know the whole truth. 


I should have ignored my instincts and told her the real truth from the beginning, but I ignored advice, buried both our heads in the sand. I have spent the last year, since that awful night, running, hiding, crying, and every second I’ve mourned not only for my family, but for the daughter I lost.

I don’t doubt you all think I am a monster. I suppose I am. But you have to understand, things are not as black and white as they seem. I loved my daughter, she was my whole world, the reason I woke up every morning.  I protected her for as long as I could. Then my wife got ill. They called it cancer, but I know better. She took something from someone she shouldn’t have, invaded someone she should have left alone. Apologies, I am getting ahead of myself here. Let me start at the beginning.


I met my beautiful wife 35 years ago, both aged 20 and working as interns at a fairly successful accountancy company. I never thought she would look twice at me but somehow she feel for my charms and we loved each other almost immediately. Life was perfect for the first few years, I would go so far as to call it blissful. 


Until that night. Until the night I came home from a night out unexpectedly. A little worse for wear, preferring to go home to my beautiful, vibrant wife rather than continue to watch workmates attempt to kiss and fondle each other, the inevitable embarrassment to follow on Monday bothering them not a jot.


I unlocked the door uncharacteristically quietly, eager to prove I was in fact, not drunk, and definitely sober enough not to wake her from any possible slumber. The house was in darkness, so I crept up the stairs, and opened the bedroom door, smiling at the thought of her beautiful face. She wasn’t there. I checked the kitchen, the living room, no sign of her. I began to panic, and even in my slightly foggy state, I knew something wasn’t right. 


I entered the garden through our kitchen door and saw a flickering light in the window of a battered shed at the bottom of the garden. I opened my mouth to call out her name, but something stopped me. Muted me. I walked quietly towards the shed, the dusk-born dew covering my shoes. I approached the window, and there she was, crouched on the floor, her forehead pressed to another’s, a man’s forehead. Rage engulfed me so, that I failed to see the blood until I threw open the shed door, screaming her name. 


Her face wasn’t her face. I mean, it was her face, but it wasn’t. It was dark, so much darker. She was covered in blood, her face glistening in the light of a single candle. She stood slowly, never taking her eyes from me. I saw them change from dark black, her eyeball made entirely of pupil, to her soft blue eyes, back to the eyes I have loved for years. It was as if she shrank before my eyes, became so small, that my first instinct was to hold her, to breathe in her scent, let her head rest on my chest, but as I moved towards her I saw him, properly for the first time. 


A man lay at her feet, perfectly still, his eyes wide, his mouth wider still. He was dead, I knew that. And I knew my beautiful wife had somehow killed him. Silently, wordlessly, I spent the night cleaning the shed and driving a dead body to a deserted spot, and burying it in a shallow grave. It sounds like a bad film doesn’t it. It still, even now, doesn’t feel real to me, that first time. Like I was watching it unfold from somewhere high above. The more often it happens the more normal it becomes though, almost acceptable. 


That night we didn’t speak of it. I held her all night, watching her breathing slow as she fell into a deep sleep, resting on my chest in our marital bed. My mind ran wild as she sank further into the deepest slumber. How on earth could I help me wife get over this? Come to terms with the fact that she had murdered someone, no matter what the reason might be?  


As she woke the next morning, she began to speak.

But with grad school apps approaching and summer internships (I'm a junior in college), I feel like it might be better to voluntarily wait until I've had more experience and met more people who could help me before I decide to pursue something by myself full time. I heard a story once of some people who were trying to crack a code, and their current computer hardware would do it in 10 years. However if they waited 7 years for the hardware to improve in quality due to Moore's law, the computer would do it in 2 years and finish the whole process 1 year before the initial computer. I'm thinking the same may apply to starting a business.

So obviously there are going to be two camps: the just do it and fail hard camp, or the prepare well and go into it full force with a plan camp. But I'm thinking it's a moderate mix of the two. What are your thoughts?"

I currently have a 4.0 GPA at a midtier school, and I'm pursuing a degree in computer science with a focus on software engineering and a degree in mathematics, for now at least. During the past year I developed an educational iOS game for a professor, and he is trying to take that to market and use it for research.

I don't like compsci at all. I originally got into it because I knew I would be good at it, and I always wanted to be a game developer. By game development I really mean having a large say in the design, but that's unrealistic, and I don't even like playing games anymore. I used to be addicted to games but now I only play then if there's a social element or a monetary incentive.

Anyways, I took a class last semester that was a better reflection of what a CS job might actually look like, and it was awful. Every time I look at potential CS career paths or look for an internship I get filled with incredible dread. I want to do something meaningful and adventurous, and I don't want to stare at a screen for 8 hours and then stare at it when I'm done with work just because a lot of the things I like to do involve a computer. I want to do something more social.

I'm thinking about doing biology. Medical research would be my dream. Frankly, any science seems more interesting to me than CS, but the job market for biology looks scary.

I don't know what to do. Math is my strongest talent by far by the way."

Here's some background: I took a lot of AP and dual credit courses in high school and got a lot of elective/prereq credit. I knew I had a lot of credit piling up, but didn't think about the effects it would have on my college career until I looked at my degree audit today and saw I was listed as a sophomore. It gave me a rude awakening-college is moving faster than I thought it was, and sooner rather than later I'll start having to worry about getting a job.

I just completed my first semester of actual college (all prereqs). I did pretty well-I made the Dean's List-but I haven't taken any major courses yet. I will this upcoming semester, but it'll be an introductory course. 

So my question is, when should I look for an internship? I've always been told to start looking junior year, but since it's sooner than expected I don't know if I'll have the requisite knowledge for the job. Should I wait or just take the leap?

If it helps, I'm majoring in CIS and plan to get an IT job."

So naturally I started looking into the certificates but with no direction of where I wanted to go I didn't hold interest to invest enough time to get any certificates. The lucky contribution to my situation is probably the fact that I work at a big hobby store near DC. This means I'm exposed to all the technology people in the DC area that come by to get there Tech toys or to get help repairing and troubleshooting them. I worked on remote controlled helicopters for a bit and when all the Drone stuff took off a year ago I was naturally interested in it for the fun aspect. You had to build them from scratch at first there wasn't too much ready to go out of the box stuff yet. So I learned just enough to be able to build one that I like and used the knowledge I gained to help people build theirs and naturally I ran into all the problems that they ran into and had to learn just enough again to fix those new problems as well. Being the only ""drone"" guy in that shop I get to take first crack at all the random problems that can walk through the door. So about 80% of the time I'm having to troubleshoot/learn and apply a solution to a majority of the problems that walk through the door. This I realize later actually allowed people to see my on-the-fly problem-solving multitasking skills for something that there isn't much documentation out on at the time. I personally got interested in coding as it's pretty much the backbone for development and creating things which is what I realized I enjoyed doing development and creating Solutions. So I learned on my own the basics of coding and some more fundamentals of understanding so I could be at least a little useful with my knowledge. Opening my mouth to random customers about looking for job experience after they already saw my skill set allowed me to get internship opportunities. Now my lack of experience  and certificates with actual systems did hold me back on one job interview as they were looking for someone with more experience but that didn't hold me back from all the other places that wanted to take me in with the mindset that they just ""needed to teach me the basics and I'd be dangerous"". Another interview with a higher end company in DC even offered me an internship a day after the interview but I turned it down as I was too afraid a position in a private  Contracting Company  for the military and other government agencies would be too much for me as a first IT job. Now I'm taking a job at an app development company/ software development company and I like the company dynamic much more. I didn't want to Ramble On too much so if there's any questions or someone has any advice let me know. :-)"

I have experience in R, Stata, some minor experience in C++ and a basic ability to write in SQL and Python. I also completed a 10 week internship with a utility company that taught me some, albeit basic, methods for implementing machine learning to produce predictions models for large datasets.

My questions are more specifically phrased as follows:

1. How should I improve on my Python skills with respect to statistics applications? Nearly all of the resources I find online about improving one's Python skills with respect to the tech industry focus more on the coding aspect than on statistical analyses. For example, most of my CS friends tout the Cracking the Coding Interview book as one that I should know cold yet it does not focus at all on statistical applications. Should I be utilizing these resources?

2. What kind of tech jobs with a statistics background do not require an MS or PhD? I am not sure that I would want to pursue either in the future as my theoretical math skills and understanding are rather shaky. Yet nearly all of the jobs I find on my university career site are oriented to individuals with MS or PhDs in Stats or CS.

3. What kinds of career fairs should I be attending? The general one by my university has companies that are generally not looking for very technical roles for their hires yet the CS career fairs naturally are looking for very technical CS students.

Overall, should I be doing the same things as my CS friends to make myself more attractive to tech companies (ie interview prepping coding problems, hackathons, attending technical career fairs oriented to CS majors, etc.) or should I be focusing on something else entirely?

Generally, I have an interest in predictive modeling but I am unsure of what I generally should be doing and internet, and university resources, give many conflicting answers on the topic.

Thanks for all your guys help!

TLDR: Almost a recent stats-oriented grad unsure of what steps I should take in the next 4-5 months to prep myself to enter the tech (data science) field."

I was kind of fine with it but then today they also told me they would need to install ubuntu on it (the work they do is node.js/android so unix type system is not a requirement) and format my system drive as well. I think that's crazy. It's my system and I should be able to control what happens to it. Yes I can of course quit but this should not be a thing.
The reason they gave everyone is that they cannot risk people using pirated windows but I don't have a single bit of pirated code on my system and they still insisted on it. I was hoping to probe good people of randia to see what they think. I realize they can request whatever they want and final control still lies with me but I think this is very personal invasion of my privacy and rights to my own rig.

And my laptop is a lenovo yoga the flex version, it has touch screen and screen folds back. It's semi hybrid version and Ubuntu would look laughably bad and criminally useless on my machine. Not to mention I have all my workstation set up on it. I told them I have genuine windows which will be rendered useless and their response was that I can always take my machine to the service center and tell them to install windows again. My internship is 6 months long so all this trouble would only be for 6 months to begin with.

I tried to negotiate quite a bit but they don't seem to budge. Dual boot, VM, or just working with windows all don't seem to make any dent in their resolve. If I cannot resolve it tomorrow I will have to either escalate it to top management (it's a small 300 person company) or just give up and leave.

I am not looking for any legal recourse, instead I am just trying to find your take on the matter."

I am currently a double major in strategic communication in the journalism school and political science with a digital studies certificate. I have a 3.2 gpa sadly after receiving a literal F in accounting. I went through a really traumatic family experience this fall and spent every weekend for the last two months of the semester driving 7 hours each way to help my family. Accounting requires a lot of time to master. Time that I did not have. I am hoping schools will be able to look past this due to the circumstance. Other than that, I do have good grades in all of the relevant courses to my major (took a few Econ and math classes last year when I thought I wanted to major in business) but they aren't relevant to my degree. 

I was an intern at Hillary for America for six months while also holding a retail job and leadership positions in a few organizations. I also had an impressive internship last summer and already have received an internship at a top ad agency in NYC for this summer. 

In high school, I had a 3.9 unweighted gpa and was on honor roll all eight semesters. I also had a lot of volunteer hours in high school that have continued into my college years. 

Questions:
1) will schools be able to look past my F in accounting? Would it be worth trying to pursue a retroactive drop of the course? I am hoping they will understand the circumstance that led to this.
2) how seriously do schools take extra curriculars and work experience? I think I am very well rounded but fear that gpa is the only thing that matters.
3) Which schools would I have a chance of being accepted into? These are the ones I want to apply to:
-USC (applied to transfer last year but was not accepted) 
-NYU
-Fordham (was accepted as a senior in high school)
-George Washington
-University of Minnesota/University of Washington/UT Austin (accepted to all as a senior in high school)
Any other ideas for schools I should apply to for pr/communications? I don't want to downgrade the quality of program from where I am, but I really dislike the environment of my school and am not happy there.

Any help would be appreciated! This year has been brutal for me and am hoping for positive change! Much love to everyone that read this. Happy new year!

Here's my situation:

I go to a top university for my major and just finished the first semester of my second year.

This past semester, finals was an especially rough time because I realized I wasn't really studying throughout the semester (between extracurriculars--a part time job and leadership position--and going out more than I should have, I did the bare minimum to get me through week to week on assignments and midterms; this is a study habit that I've had since high school, I've just been able to pull As in the past, but at this school and this major (engineering), this is obviously not how it works).

Now, I'm seriously regretting the semester and I'm afraid I'm really behind my peers. The classes are only going to get harder and I feel as though I don't have the background that I should have established because instead of doing the ""daily grind"", I've been a crammer my whole life.

To add to that, in a week, I'm about to start an internship that I feel like I'm not qualified for. Basically, I feel like a complete fraud.

I'm so scared to continue pursuing my major because I'm afraid I dont have the discipline to do what needs to get done. I'm particularly afraid to go back to my school, where there's an expectation that you are able to do everything-- the academics, the extracurriculars, leadership positions, etc. (I mean I guess that's why when you do ""get out"", they say you can work anywhere.) Maybe I just didn't have the right balance this past semester, but I'm afraid of failing again, of making the same mistakes.

I'm afraid that I won't be employable at the end of it; whether it be my less than stellar GPA (or even failing out) or my lack of involvement and necessary extracurriculars (needing to step back to focus on academics/catch up).

To add to that, my parents have invested money and I have my personal loans to consider too. It's about 5k a year for me and 35k for them.

Going into college, the plan was that if I put in the work, I will be able to be competitive in the end... well, I guess I feel like I haven't put in the work and I'm afraid I can't possibly catch up between now and graduation.

In a way, because of the feelings mentioned above, I've entertained the idea of switching out of my specific major and engineering in general. But I don't know to what... so that seems like just giving up, doesn't it? 

Anyway, I've spent the entire holiday break contemplating my future and it's seriously drained me of my energy and motivation. I've also caused some strife in my family, bogging my parents down with my awful mood.

I'm afraid that if I don't get out of this mentality, my reality would turn out to be the fears that I have: unemployed with thousands of debt. 

I hope this post has made some sense. I'll be happy to explain things further if needed (to the best of my ability) but I could really use a 3rd party's insight/advice on what I should do.

tl;dr: I want to switch majors but I think it could be for the wrong reasons. Yet, staying in seems like an impossible battle."

5lq5nw,369,2017-01-03,Is the whole “literally anyone can code” mentality indicative of a bubble?,DBZ5episodesyelling,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lq5nw/is_the_whole_literally_anyone_can_code_mentality/,"DISCLAIMER: I am a bored undergrad. This is my personal opinion. If anyone has a well reasoned counterpoint I would love to hear it. 
 
I remember hearing an anecdote about a famous investor pulling his investments before the 1929 stock market crash. Essentially, he realized that that the bubble was about to burst when his shoeshine boy was giving him investment advice.

You can sort of see the same thing today. There’s a serious mentality that “anyone can code” and I’m talking ANYONE. There are bootcamps that promise to get somebody with zero experience jobs six-figure jobs. There are plenty of askreddit threads extolling how you don’t even need that; all anyone has to do is learn some javascript, build a portfolio, and BAM! High-paying programmer salary. On the frontpage of /r/cscareerquestions right now you can see someone pointing out that there seems to be many people with an expectation of going from working at McDonalds to getting a high paying programming job in six months. In the real world, I've noticed a lot of people parroting similar sentiments. 

There are plenty of high paying jobs with growth potential: Multiple fields of engineering, pharmacy tech,  and countless trades(think electrician). Yet only software development seems to have this mentality of immediate turnaround. 

Granted, this could all be (largely) BS. It could be that it takes an extremely special skillset, talent, or work ethic. However, that doesn’t change the fact that there is a perception that such a move is easily possible. This should, in theory, flood the entry level with a glut of (albeit unqualified) applicants and drive wages for programmers down dramatically. 

...Or it could be true. In which case there are thousands of people (like myself) who go through a 4-year program for no reason. I am a senior in a four-year program. I’ve spent the last four years working at my program, applying/working at internships,  and get my  (more recently. It took me a while to get serious about career stuff) portfolio up to snuff. I would be distraught to learn I could have skipped all of that or it’s more or less meaningless in obtaining an entry level programming job. I mean, I have a job offer I’m really happy with, but still…

I also think it might be indicative of software development seen as “easy money”. That mentality, in terms of both jobs and investment into tech companies, can be dangerous. I (again, personal opinion) that will lead to an over-saturation of the market and the funding of risky investments or the hiring of underqualifed devs. 

I’d love to hear what you guys think about this. 

TL:DR I think the whole “anyone can code” mentality is, to some extent, a canary in the coalmine of a bubble for the tech industry software developers. I know I’m just one dude with an opinion, so I’d love some thoughts. "

I've even had multiple internships as a PM and loved the role, and worked at some cool companies. 

At the same time, Im also fascinated by pattern recognition and even deep learning in CS, and very much want to learn more. Ideally, I very much want to work on projects in my career that leverage these concepts in CS. In my undergraduate career, ive not really been exposed to these concepts other than some elective classes with limited scope. 

Ideally, I want to be a PM that works with engineers on projects involving pattern recognition and deep learning. The questions is, what is the best way to get there? I have PM experience , and I am finishing up my undergraduate CS degree in years time. Would graduate school in CS help me fufil this goal? Even if I don't want to be a software engineer?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

5lqz45,1,2017-01-03,Learning more about backend,qtumble,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lqz45/learning_more_about_backend/,"I'm a junior student who's done side projects and internships on mostly full stack or front end stuff. Most of the stuff on my resume is with javascript and all the hottest frameworks. Even though I consider myself a ""full stack"" developer, I realized the only thing I've ever done with the backend side was to just create a node server that can do routing and some other stuff, or some simple api.

I would like to learn more about backend stuff, and for job postings related to backend, I see words like ""scalable"", ""distributed"", ""fault-tolerant"", or ""concurrency"" and usually in languages like Java or python (funny though, I thought nodejs was considered backend, but never saw it ever pop up much). I know Java pretty well and would like to learn how to use it to build a scalable and fault-tolerant backend, most likely for enterprise applications. I'm finding it hard to know where to start.  What should I look into or what books do you suggest? 

I've looked into it a bit and it seems like J2EE or Spring could be something to look at. Where could I learn about making them scalable, distributed, fault-tolerant, etc.? What would be a good project to work on?"
5ls66d,0,2017-01-03,Started job search 6+ months after graduation... how screwed am I?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ls66d/started_job_search_6_months_after_graduation_how/,"I graduated last summer with a BS in Computer Science at the decrepit age of 30. I have a high-ish GPA (3.6) from an unremarkable program/university. By the time I graduated, I was pretty depressed and burned out. I attribute this to going to school while working full time, the self-doubt/impostor syndrome that a lot of people seem to experience in this field, and life circumstances at the time. 

As I was finishing up my degree, I had become pretty convinced that I shouldn't/couldn't do this. I didn't do an internship and I didn't bother applying for jobs before or after graduation. I felt like I lacked the intelligence and motivation needed to succeed in this career. I wanted nothing to do with software development and spent months just pretending the degree never happened.

After having some time off to relax and getting back to programming, I'm finding that I actually sort of enjoy it. I'll never have passion or consider myself a real computer scientist but I think I could do this for a living. I don't really care about working anywhere too competitive and I'd be fine with just doing boring CRUD apps for a boring company somewhere that isn't SF/Seattle/Austin/etc. 

Anyway, I feel like my biggest issues right now are the fact that I have no experience, live in an area with very few development jobs, and have a large and growing gap on my resume since when I graduated. I'm pretty adamant about wanting to relocate since being able to move was one of my reasons for going back to school. I feel like I'm going to have to move for my career sooner or later and I'd rather do it now and get it done with. 

I started applying for jobs (5-10 per weekday) in mid-November and have received a lot of rejections. I'm guessing hiring slows down over the holidays so I'm sure there's a chance I could hear back from some others. I'd like to find something by summer if at all possible but I know it's going to be an uphill battle due to my location and lack of experience.

What I'm doing:
-Working on projects and trying to learn new languages/frameworks/libraries/etc. These are nothing special and won't likely impress a recruiter. Right now I'm developing a simple web app for a family friend that I think I might actually get paid for by their employer so that might give me something to talk about in interviews.
-Working on coding exercises on the usual sites mentioned here (Leetcode, etc). I am very, very bad at them and it's an absolutely miserable experience but I keep telling myself that everyone sucks when they start and that I'll get better with practice.
-Refreshing my knowledge of data structures and algorithms. I've been pleasantly surprised how much I actually retained so that's encouraging. 

My questions:
-How good do projects need to be? Do I need to meticulously follow best practices, have unit tests, etc, or is it ok to have some code that probably reveals that I was learning as I went along?
-How do I explain the fact that I'm still searching 6+ months after graduation? 
-How can I make myself more likely to get responses from companies out of state when I live in a relative backwater? Are there any tech hubs in particular where companies might be more open/less competitive for non-local candidates?

tl;dr: How screwed am I for waiting over half a year after graduation to start applying for jobs and what are some ways I can combat being a 30 year old in the ass end of nowhere with a shitty resume?"

I've held two programming jobs. My first job I started as an intern and worked my way up to being the lead backend developer (it was a smaller company so take that title with a grain of salt). I was there for about three years.  My second programming job was as a software engineer with a bank, and I was there for about a year.


Skills: I have done a wide variety of  different work including frontend, backend, and a little DevOps. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, ASP.NET, Git, SVN, SQL, Jenkins CI, and a few others. I would say I'm strongest with C#, SQL, and Git. I primarily have worked on back-end CRUD projects, and have had the opportunity to be the technical lead on some. Again I've worked with small companies, so I wouldn't have had that same opportunity if I was working at a large company with more experienced devs.


I'm starting the process of looking for a software development job. I've been out of programming for three months. I was going through a divorce that really threw my world upside down. I quit my job (stupidly), and I'm now working for my Dad's construction company in a technical role in which I don't get to do any programming. 


My current job is Ok and I make a decent salary, but I really miss programming. I don't enjoy coming into work everyday as I once did. My Dad would like me to take his share in the business one day, but I'm just not passionate about it. So I'm going to start the process of looking for a dev job. I would Ideally like to find a remote or semi-remote job. I worked remote about one day a week at my last job, and I found I was more productive that way. 


I've never really had to interview for a programming job. I did some interviews for some internships, but that was about it. I got hired after my internship, and my second job I got hired by the CTO who had worked with me previously. He offered me a job without any kind of formal interview.


I'm not urgently looking for a new job, I just want to make sure I find one that I will enjoy, with people I can respect, and a salary I'm comfortable with.  I'm really looking for some direction on how to go about this. I think the first place I need to start is expanding my Github profile. I don't think I interview well, and I think having some solid projects, and open source contributions can mitigate that. Anybody have some suggestions where I could start looking? Also, will companies look at why I'm not currently at a programming job?"

Anyways, Im appling to internships already because, why not? I would actually be getting paid more than i currently am in most of the internships ive seen, and I would have that extra experience to leverage getting an even better one next year.

 I have a 3.6 GPA and a very good resume for someone in my current field so im tring my hardest to spin all my experience to be applicable for a career with technology. 

But whats really affecting my success im sure:

Lack of industry experience
Lack of applicable class work.

Thinking of filling these gaps with some online courses in my personal time,  Im thinking an intro python course or ,maybe some basic IT certs like CCENT. What would you all say is going to get my the most bang for my buck(time invested).

Im applying to software internships and also IT internships if that makes any difference.

TL:DR Graduated 3 years ago with no internships. Tired of current job that has no relevance to the career I want. Looking for advice on getting started in the field.

I graduated December 2013 with a BS in Computer Engineering. During which, I did not secure any sort of internship. I spent two years unemployed and depressed. I have spent this last year working in a job I loathe because it was literally the only offer I had during that time.

I am ready to make a change. I know that my skills have rusted considerably since graduation, and I am no competition for a fresh graduate in my current state. In fact, I am so out of the loop I don’t know what my greatest shortcomings are, let alone how to figure them out.

Currently my plan is to use CodeBlocks for C++ and PyCharm for Python, make some working code and post it online. Problem with that is I’m having difficulty thinking of projects that are nontrivial yet something I can feasibly manage on my own.

Another problem that I’ll have to deal with is how bare my resume is. Like I said, I only took my current job because it was the only offer I had in two years, and there is nothing technical about it apart from using the occasional spreadsheet. It’s mostly a struggle of not wanting to shoot myself while talking with customers on the phone.

Any advice for my current situation?"

So I got my first class honors last year in Maths and has been applying for graduate positions in the last few months. I got a few interview opportunities but I failed pretty much all of them unfortunately.

Now, I got a 6-month internship offer from a Big 4 firm. Although the salary is ~$1000/month which is half of that of a full time position, I think it is a good opportunity for at least some more work experiences in case I am not able to secure any permanent positions this year. 

There is potentially one more interview opportunity soon, but I need to pass a test first.

I want to know what you guys think, should I take the offer or not? If not, what are the alternatives?

I guess my question is: What should I include in this guide? Since I was a college student/intern, I'm sure it took me a lot longer to figure out the project than it would someone who is a professional, so I'm not sure what all types of information need to be included.

Below is my profile for review, I also have some general questions at the bottom of the post. Thank you for your time. 


**Background**


* Work experience: 1 Year internship at top tech firm during undergrad, 4 years of full time work experience at largest Canadian Telecom Company ($15 billion USD in annual Revenue) with one promotion. 
* Extra curriculars: ARCT Diploma in Piano Performance from RCM, Amateur Stand up Comedian for a few months (I have some stuff on youtube), Various leadership roles in student groups in undergrad, plan to do some relevant volunteering between now and time of application.
* Undergrad school/major: Top Canadian University (University of Toronto), Specialist in Commerce, major in Human Biology
* Other education/coursework: n/a
* Race/nationality: Canadian born Asian (Vietnamese)
* Sex: Male


**Stats**


* GMAT Score (include breakdown!): Have not taken, based on friends who have I am aiming for a 730 or equivalent. May want to take GRE. 
* Undergrad GPA: 3.46/4.00 (3.5/4.0)


**MBA Info**


*Goal of MBA: To transition my career into the sustainability sector as well as make a geographical change to the USA. Ideally either in corporate sustainability or sustainability/environmental consulting. 


* Target schools: Reach -  Fuqua MBA/MEM dual degree;  Ross MBA/MS Environment, Yale MBA/MEM. 
* Potential Target: Rice University MBA/PSM. 
* Safeties: ???


**General questions:** 

1. Are there other programs I should consider? Perhaps traditional 2 year MBA's with a environment/sustainability focus? 

2. If I decide to target Dual Degree programs, would the GRE or GMAT be more appropriate? I'm leaning towards GRE right now because Rice's PSM does not accept GMAT but all of the other MBA's listed above do accept GRE. 

3. In general are dual degree programs harder to get into vs traditional MBA's? 


Thank you for your time /r/mba, best of luck to those currently in the application process.


Cheers,

  1. Interns: Do you have a mentor? If you do, what do they do that you like? What don't you like? Is there anything you wish your mentor would do?

    a. Female interns only: The intern I have been assigned is the only female intern, and will be the only female developer on the team. Is there anything I should do or look out for to help her in this regard?
   
  2. Intern mentors: What was the best thing you did for the intern? How did you approach things that the intern needed to change in code? Any advice?

Other potentially relevant background info: I was at another software company prior to this, for ~5 years. Her future alma mater and my degree come from the same school, same department. In the brief 5 mins I met her today, I worry that her interests aren't totally aligned with my teams current projects.

I went to an average school and did extremely well, and have had many internships and what not, as well as 1 year of full-time non-internship experience. I'm about to finish my MS in CS. Let me emphasize that last point, I'd expect to be paid considerably more because I have both experience and an MS. Even before I decided to do my MS I was disappointed by the offers, for example I had a 55k offer in a small city, and a 60k offer in Austin, Texas. I just received an offer from a large tech company in a large city (I'd rather not disclose either for the sake of anonymity), it was a $71k offer. That is more money that I ever could have imagined, but I'm still disappointed. I expected more given my experience and MS. Do I just lower my expectations? How do I find out if this is actually reasonable. According to Glassdoor, the SE's at this company make 90k+. And I'm not sure CoL is a great way to gauge if it's a decent offer.

Need a bit more advice.

I graduated University a few months ago and was having a bit of a hard time finding a job. My husband was in the military before I finished my degree so I moved a lot and never got to do any internships. I still had a 3.77 GPA with a Math degree which is very competitive, but the lack of internships hurt me.

Eventually I started slipping into a bit of a funk because I didn't like waking up every day to do nothing while my husband went to both work and school so I started applying for a LOT of jobs that were less of where I wanted to be. I started working for a bank back in early November as a credit analyst.

Here's where it gets frustrating. Back in September I met with a company at the University career fair and we really hit it off. He told me he was only authorized to hire interns at the time but that he would like to keep a resume and bring me up at their next quarterly meeting.

They just emailed me asking me to formally apply for a position with them. I'm concerned about a couple of things. I don't want them to think I'm flighty and just jumping from one job to the next, and I also don't want them to base their salary offer off of my current position. On the application where it asks for the reason I'm leaving my current job it only has room for like 15 characters so I said to see the attached document and this is what I've got so far. I'd love some critiques.

&gt;HR,

&gt;In the formal application process I was asked why I am interested in leaving my current position to pursue a position with NEW JOB. The answer is simple, I met RECRUITER at a career fair at the UNIVERSITY and we spoke about career opportunities at NEW JOB. RECRUITER did a wonderful job of explaining the culture you offer, the career possibilities that are available, and the challenging aspect of the work to be done. These things resonated with me and I have been interested in a career opportunity with NEW JOB ever since. When I was approached and invited to apply for this position I felt like it was too good of an opportunity to pass up considering how well I felt I would do in that environment.


&gt;Additionally, while I am very thankful to my current employer I am currently working in a role that does not require, nor make use of, my degree. I feel as though I have worked very diligently to learn a very particular skill set and that my skills are not being utilized to their potential in my current position.

&gt;Best,

&gt;NAME

Is it inappropriate to mention my current position not using my degree like that? I don't want to just say I'm leaving because I don't make enough money, but I'm currently making $30k/yr at my job and BLS says entry level for this new position is $46k/yr and with my competitive GPA I'm confident I could push for $50k/yr. Or at least I'm confident I could do that if I hadn't just told them I accepted a job paying $30k/yr. That's why I made the comment about my current job not using my degree.

Does that seem reasonable?

And for that matter, like I said the Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the bottom 10% of incomes for this line of work in my state in $46k/year. The average GPA for a college graduate in 3.1, and mine is 3.77. I think that being ~22% above the average GPA (and that gets bigger when you account for STEM degrees since they are almost universally lower) is enough to argue for a slightly higher salary and this is how I had planned on doing so.

&gt;In my research I found the average entry level salary for POSITIONS in the oil and natural gas industry in CITY to be roughly $45,500/year. Comparing my GPA to the average college graduate GPA you will see I am nearly 22% above the average GPA, and the gap only gets larger when you account for my holding a STEM degree. I believe that the potential and the diligence I have shown in my undergraduate studies are enough to justify what is roughly a 10% higher salary than my peers. Obviously this is negotiable.

That would obviously come out if we arrived at the salary negotiations stage of an offer, but am I crazy to things that's doable? 

Thanks for any help guys."
5lv2sq,1,2017-01-03,Need internship advice,ImmutablePig,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5lv2sq/need_internship_advice/,"Hey everyone!

So during the off-days during these past holiday weeks, I decided to start looking for an internship required by my university. I started filling out information forms on several sites and sending out my CV to the companies that looked promising. 

On December 29th I got a call from a recruiter from one of the best companies in my area about my application. According to her, everything I sent was perfect and she just made the call to clarify some minor details. She told me all that was left to do was to get my schedule to be able to work out my hours with my university courses, and to have the in-person interview. She told me that work would start at the beginning of March.

I mentioned that my schedule might be a little weird because I would be taking classes from the course one year ahead of mine to lessen the load later, and that I'd send it to her via email as soon as we finished the call. Anyways, I did just that. Now, I might just be nervous or anxious because I would really like to be an intern at this company, but I sent that email on December 29th and have still not received an answer. I understand that we are still in holiday season and she might not be back at work yet, but I'm assuming even if my schedule doesn't work out with them, they'd let me know through email, right? 

I know it's only been a couple of days and I should just wait and see what happens, but should I send another email at some point to see what's the status on the whole issue? If so, how long should I wait for this? 

I probably sound really desperate but the truth is it's my first chance at an internship and the fact that it could be at a good company has me racking my mind a bit. "
5lvrko,4,2017-01-03,How do I become better?,csttt,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5lvrko/how_do_i_become_better/,"Hi everybody!

I am a university student, but I feel that I still A LOT to learn, and don’t know that much in comparison to my peers. There are so many things I want to learn, but I have no idea where to start. (I want to learn: ML, iOS – Swift, C++, Python)
My biggest problem is sticking to a certain topic when I encounter a problem/something I do not know about.
For example when I start learning about a certain topic and I encounter something that I do not know about I get frustrated when I cannot find a solution even after a VERY long time. And because of this I loose a lot of time and do not learn much. I think I am trying to dive into too advanced topics quickly without having the basics figured out. After one year of university I am still incapable of building something useful. I do get perfect marks at university, but I am lost at hackathons, or during internships etc. 

Another issue are also coding challenges – I got sent so many challenges to do from companies. But I was incapable of completing even a single one properly. 

What should I learn and how should I learn it?

My end goal is: I want to become a bright programmer who is able to pick up new technologies very fast, can quickly understand problems and come up with solutions to them. I want to be able to build stuff at hackathons, personal projects etc. I really love technology – it is my whole life, but I want to stop reading about what great people have done and actually do something great myself. 

*Is there any “roadmap” for a computer scientist (What should I know to become good)?
*How do I know when I am going to fast and skipping over material?
*How do others learn from zero?
*How much time should I be spending on such problems?

I am not afraid of working hard, I just don’t want to be in a situation where I do not understand problems just because I do not know the basics. Furthermore I am not sure if knowing what to learn and how to learn are really my main issues – has anybody experienced any similar situations? 

Thank you all in advance :) "

Im graduating in May with with BA in Economics from a major university, but not really known for academics.


I started out college at a community college after barely passing high school, my first year of community college i did okay. I got Bs and Cs. Second year i did terrible but my first year was decent enough to get me into a university. I went there for a semester and failed every class but one. Wrote a long letter and explained everything and my GPA was 2.5 and somehow transferred again and got a major university to accept me. First semester here i got a 1.9 and almost failed out again. At that point in my life i realized i needed to either leave college because i was wasting my time, or buck the hell up and be a responsible person and get my shit together. I chose the latter. After that semester i tried to get into the business school for marketing and but my GPA wasnt good enough so i went with a major that was 3 minors. One of my minors i picked was Economics. I took econ classes and finally had found my passion. I went to school for 2.5 years straight, 6 classes each semester, and then 4 classes also in the summer for 2 summers straight and worked my ass off get into the business college for Economics. Since i hit that crossroads in my life i got above 3.25 every single semester (i know not the best, but for me it was a huge achievement) and got my GPA up to a 2.72. Since i switched majors, transferred between three schools, and took classes every summer i never had a real chance to get an internship related to Econ and now im graduating in May and super stressed about finding a job.


I have applied to about 100-125 jobs so far for analysts, underwriter, and really anything related and heard nothing back from anyone. Ive contacted my professors trying to ask if they know of any research, or analytical opportunities next semester that could bolster my resume (still waiting to hear back). Ive worked many hours perfecting my resume with the critiquing of people from all over the internet. Have learned skills like SQL and im working on STATA now. I feel like im trying to do all the right stuff but i just dont know where to go from this point on. If i got an interview i think could try to tell someone my story and show them how this industry practically turned around my life but i cant get any calls back i assume becuase i have no experience. 

I really just feel like im at a dead end, i dont know what to do or how to go about breaking into the financial industry and i just need some guidance from someone. If anyone could give me any advice on where to go from here i would greatly appreciate it."

I'm currently entering my last semester at a small state school in southern California. I, like a lot of us here, am worried that I haven't set myself up properly to break into the software dev scene. I don't have any programming experience outside of school, and I've just discovered (with ~90% certainty) that I'll be moving to Alabama come July.

After searching for ""Computer Science"", ""Software Engineering"", ""Software Developer"", and ""Software Development"", it's pretty evident that there isn't much within 30 miles of my future home town. I do have 5 years experience in IT, but the point of school was to get away from that.

I have two questions:

* Regardless of location, what's the most realistic thing I can do to beef up my resume? Spring internships seem to be scarce and I've been getting conflicting info about contributing to projects on GitHub and OpenHatch.

* Should I get a jump start on freelancing/remote work or hold out for a ""normal"" software dev position?

Thank you for your time &amp; consideration.

I have mainly web development skills rather than mobile. I have made android app before and enjoyed it.
Mobile Development elective, allows me to create a full fledge app which i can showcase whereas Learning C++ will develop a strong background for me to apply into Big 4 companies , high frequency trading HFT companies.

5lz7uz,1,2017-01-04,An interesting predicament,dwhit5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5lz7uz/an_interesting_predicament/,"So in November, I applied for an entry level position at the large company I completed my internship at. The job is not as big-exposure as I wanted, but as an entry level graduate, I'll take anything that has the title I want that I can get. During the interview process, the manager explained there is currently a temp-worker in the position and that they would ultimately have to decide if hiring me was a good choice over keeping him/her on staff. 

Fast forward to my second interview, and his boss was now the one asking questions. She said she had received outstanding reviews from my former managers and even an executive I worked under during my internship, and I felt this was very positive news. (I feel that networking plays a huge role in this company) It has led me to believe they may be leaning towards hiring me over the temp. 
After being told that they would be making the decision after the holiday season, I'm expecting to receive a phone call regarding that decision today and am having serious anxiety about the outcome. 

My question is: do you think I have a good shot? It's nearly been 2 months since I started the interviewing process and today's the day I find out their ultimate decision. "

5lzpe8,73,2017-01-04,TIFU by getting my mother's car towed during a hookup,tonybenwhite,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5lzpe8/tifu_by_getting_my_mothers_car_towed_during_a/,"Obligatory ""this actually happened 3 years ago"" preface. I had just moved to Florida on an internship with Disney. I previously lived in Washington state, which outside the city limits of Seattle, is actually a VERY conservative and gay-intolerant state. So, until this point, I was straight because everyone around me was likewise too scared to be gay, and so there was no opportunity to even entertain the idea of experimenting.

Orlando was an entirely shiny new world, and I learned I'm actually gay as fuck. I can't deny that I was a little promiscuous with my newfound sexuality in the beginning; imagine never tasting sugar until you were 21. I learned of new things I never would have believed existed, and one of those things was Grindr. If you're unaware, it's the gay version of Tinder, and the main goal is no-strings-attached hookups. Literally 9 out of 10 guys would agree to fuck an avocado if it hit them up on this app, and I'm a pretty attractive guy.

It's winter time now, and I'm boarding my plane to visit family for the holidays, and by this point, logging onto Grindr is just force of habit. There's two guys in my terminal, both of which were too busy for a quicky, none on my plane, and an incredibly hot and tattooed man working for Chicago's TSA during my layover, which unfortunately only lasted for 20 minutes and I wasn't about to get stranded in Illinois. By this point, I've been teased with chat, pictures, and dozens of profiles I rifled through during my 9 hour flight, and was crazy horny by the time I got to WA.

It was a redeye flight, so I landed around noon in SEATAC, and my mother drove me home. We have to pass through a town called Tacoma in order to get to my hometown, and I was in the backseat with my face glued to Grindr the entire way. I was hit up by an incredibly hot guy while passing through Tacoma, and my mind would not have me spend this afternoon any other way. I immediately made plans with my friends from a town next to Tacoma to give me plausible reason to drive back out of town later that afternoon, and I borrowed my mothers car to do so.

I made it back to Tacoma, spent a few hours catching up with my friend, and then set off to hook up with this guy. Sparing you the details, it was a subpar fuck, the guy looked nothing like his profile picture, I suspected it was 'shopped, so I called him out on it before I go. As I'm leaving, I walk out into his complex' parking, and my mother's car (a very conspicuous, periwinkle Scion xB) is gone.

I have to go back and knock on the guy's door after basically telling him he ain't that pretty, and he's all smiles like ""did you leave your car in covered parking?"" I had. He told me it was reserved parking and tow trucks are pretty efficient in Tacoma. He wasn't completely heartless, he gave me a ride to the tow lot and asked if I needed him to stick around until I figured it out, but I was pretty embarrassed so I sent him away. By this time it was 6PM, and considered ""after hours"" for the tow lot. When I called the office, the lady who answered informed me the tow fee would be $240 plus a $90 after-hours service fee to call a worker out to the lot to retrieve my car and process my pickup. 

At this point, I *refused* to admit to my mother that any of this happened, and so I was ready to pay any fee to get the car back and be home on time. I agree, and the man (*who was inside the office the entire time.......*) unlocked the door to let me in. We processed the claim, he gave me the keys to grab the registration from the car glove box, and took my ID. Midway through the paperwork, he stops dead and looks between me and the ID. He informs me that I'm not legally authorized to retrieve the car because I'm not on the registration of the vehicle, and the only person who can pick it up is K, my mother.

At this point I'm shitting my pants because my mother is going to wonder why my car was towed by a Tacoma company when the friend I'm supposed to be visiting lives in Olympia. I call my sister because I'm desperate for a solution. I give her my story, leaving out the fact that I was on a bootycall, just that I was trapped after visiting a friend. Unfortunately she answered on speaker phone, and my mother was actually with her.

As expected, my mother flew off the handle and screamed at me for a solid 5 minutes while I'm sitting in front of the guy in the office. He tells me I need to leave if I'm not able to pick it up, he's not going to wait around all night for me to figure out my shit, so I pack up and go. My sister, mother, and I go around in circles for another hour trying to figure out how I'm going to get her car off the lot without forcing her to call into work (she works night shift) and driving two hours out to Tacoma.

In the end, my sister, who is a branch manager at a credit union, gets her notary coworker to fax a notarized letter of consent for my mother to release the car to me at 9PM at night, and I have to pay cash because they won't accept a card payment unless it's in K's name. So I call the dispatch, they confirm (rather unbelievably) that they received my notarized release letter, and told me it would be ANOTHER $90 for another after-hour pickup session, bringing the total up to $420. I get $500 cash from an ATM, pick up the car, and I'm finally on my way home.

I NEVER told anyone that I had basically paid $420 for a hookup until today, and from that day, all promiscuous behavior ceased, and the very thought of hookups leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

tl;dr I discovered I was gay, went sex-crazy, got stranded in a random city after getting my mother's car towed during a hookup, and had to pay $420 to get home.

EDIT: All things considered, I'm happy I learned this lesson through monetary punishment, rather than contracting some STD as a result of my promiscuity."

SO. Got into CS university about an year ago, already got a lot of programming experience with Java (from command line and UI desktop apps, to games shipped on Steam and webserver programming). I've also done some minimal stuff with python, a bit more with C++ and got academic experience with C. During the past month I've been looking into pentesting - again, the first time I was a proper skid :3 - and I'm thinking into enrolling into OSCP, but I have a couple or questions..

Although I'm fairly comfortable with linux and the terminal, I don't have much pentesting experience yet. I've read whole 'metasploit-unleashed' free course/docs on offensive security and cracked a few wi-fi passwords. Recently I learned more detailed stuff on how arp spoofing works etc. I think I need further training before enrolling into the course. Based on what I've read I think I need to:

- Download vulerable VMs and apps (DVWA, Metasploitable, vulnhub.com , etc)
- Learn some better nmap scanning
- Get more familiar with metasploit (read Book: ""Metasplot: A penetration testers guide"")
- Get a bit more knowledge on SQL
- Learn more python (along with packet manpulation libraries)
- Learn how to properly use Ncat
- Gain broader knowledge on hacking by reading ""the web application hackers handbook""
- Learn some ruby in order to understand metasploit better

I've also read the syllabus' index that OffSec provides for free (contains only the contents of the course), but I think I'd better learn most of these stuff in parallel with the lab time?

Can anyone evaluate my thoughts/give further advice? :) Thanks for the help!

Also, what is all the crapstorm about OSCPs not being able to find a proper job? Imho these opinions are now outdated because the certification gains ground fast.

Edit: Thanks for the responses, I'm probably going to start the course at the end of June, after the exams of the university, unless I am an intern at google :)"

Like many college juniors, I've been looking for a summer internship in the hopes that I can turn it into a full-time offer for post graduation and start my career. I haven't had trouble getting interviews (I've had superdays with Goldman Sachs Investment Management in Chicago and JP Morgan Commercial Banking in Milwaukee, as well as countless first round and phone interviews in Wealth Management, Investment Banking, and Corporate Finance). I usually leave the interviews feeling pretty good about how things went but I can't seem to get an offer/many second round interviews.

Time is running out, and most of my friends know what they are doing this summer, while I am still stuck in the search. Basically, I'm looking for any advice to help me be a more appealing candidate in the interview process/any ideas on next steps I should take. Ideally, I want to work in financial services in Chicago this summer.

Some of my stats if it helps:

* 3.9 GPA University of Wisconsin

* Internship experience last summer in a corporate finance role (Operational Finance- worked a lot in Excel and VBA, developing programs and analyzing performance and generating reports on a per-plant basis) 

* 2 leadership roles in business fraternity (Fundraising chair, financial reporting chair)
* VP-Recruitment for Wealth management group on campus
* Scholarships based on academic performance

Not to mention doing other non-programming related duties.  I can just picture the marketing guy expecting you to produce magic for him.

Unless you are working in a real software team, working in a proper environment (like an agile one), and have people who can actually teach you... the above opportunity seems useless.

I feel like time spent building a real app, and getting experience with modern techniques (RESTful APIs, heavy JS front-end work) and getting other fundamentals down (databases, testing) would be better worth your time.
I could also use the extra time to go to small hacking meetups and build things with other people, etc.

Am I right to think this way?  Assume someone has no internship/professional programming experience but otherwise good work experience.

Spent hours picking the parts, doing the analysis figuring out where I could go cheaper and where I could spend big dollars. Had everything -- 144Hz Monitor, rockin GPU at the time, the most highly recommended CPU. I was incredibly excited, being on the avant-garde of gaming. Especially since I played League, having that 144Hz monitor was awesome.

Then I spent hours learning how to assemble everything, and actually doing the assembly. Virtually no directions on anything, just had to figure it all out on my own since I had no guidance beyond videos which were always of difference cases and parts. After multiple roadblocks I finally got it all set up and running!

And then 5 days later, the crashes! The first time was playing Skyrim, I had just spent hours (see the theme here?) downloading all the graphics mods and everything and seeing the beautiful output. Then, bzzzzzrt crash. Said a prayer that it was a one-off thing, and then even when playing League it crashed. And then it wouldn't restart 100% of the time. Sometimes it would, seemingly randomly. I have no fucking clue how electronics in the 21st century seem to have an emotional mind of their own, but once the system began being more unstable, I tried taking it to professionals for help. Of course, this is after spending hours trying to troubleshoot the machine I dropped $1500 bucks on and giving up. Since I ""custom build"" my machine it's not like I could even go to any one manufacturer.

And even the professionals couldn't diagnose the crashes. They tried looking at crash logs, tried taking out RAM sticks, tried using the integrated GPU, nope. I ran Memtestx86 and also purchased an 800W power supply because some geniuses said it wasn't enough power, even though PCpartpicker said it was more than 100W over the maximum. That fixed it for like 2 days, and then it started crashing all over again.

I've been browsing this subreddit for a while, and I estimate about 20% of the time things that hit the front are troubleshooting exercises. **What I really want to know is, how the heck can people really suggest newbies (and I wasn't a fucking newbie at computers, trust me) to invest hundreds if not over a thousand dollars into building their own PC, when it seems like people constantly have problems with it, and consequently no real recourse to fix it?** Is it a buyers remorse situation where they convince themselves they're happy with their purchase because they don't want to admit they should have left it to a professional?

The follow-up is what do you think the percent is of people having perfectly fine builds that work without a hitch, and what percent of people, like me, drop HUNDREDS of hours and THOUSANDS of dollars on a nice piece of silicon?

EDIT: For the record, It's really not about the money, more the massive time wasted. It was a great learning experience, and part of the fun was the anticipation of building and seeing the output. Which of course made it all the worse when I realized these crashes were undiagnosable. The really sick irony of course was that it was probably for the best, because otherwise I would have played video games all throughout senior year of college instead of having IRL fun. So in some sick twisted way it was a blessing to keep me off video games more than I would have."

The company i have worked for has rapidly grown in every aspect. Every single god damn team but dev has grown 4x times bigger. Unfortunately we got hit really hard with crunch, and now dev has shrunk to 4 people in the last 6 months due to the situation not improving. Our CTO has been on maternity leave since july, now she announced she is taking an extra 2 months due to stress. 

Due to all the people leaving i am now responsible devops/backend/iot/anything else falling through the cracks, aside from me we have a single frontend developer (who has taken over frontend, and now both our iOS and Android apps), a brand new intern that started today (and was more or less completely ignored the entire day unfortunately), and a QA (that has no interest in coding or ops). 

However to counter this in the past 6 months, i have received 3 separate and substantial raises. So i get the impression that people know my value and are terrified for me to leave. 

Our entire infrastructure feels like it is being held together by little bits of string and tape, however none of us have any time to fix it. Honestly i don't even know what we should really be doing, we are months and months behind on deliverables (the last set of deliverables we have recorded is for September and half of isn't done), and every day it feels like someone else wants my head because ""we promised customer X we would have feature Y by Z."" Now the customer is unhappy, and might churn. I also loose sleep constasntly over how broken and a train wreck our cloud security has become. 

To make matters worse i have somehow become the defacto head of dev to the entire office, except the CTO doesn't see it that way. Our CTO when she left on maternity leave wrote this long email that basically amounted to ""its only a baby it won't impact my ability to lead."" However she rarely if ever responds to emails when asking for direction or information, and i have repeatedly been told by her to ""figure it out my self"" and i need to ""understand she just had a baby"".  However i am not allowed to make decisions according to her, for example i have gone through 3 different interview rounds/selections and every single time we could have gotten 1-2 great people, except:

* Interviews finished right when she left for maternity, HR kept dragging feet because he needs her approval. A month later she finally responds and by then its too late
* Round 2, found a great backend dev with experience in one of our obscure backend frameworks. She turns around and basically gives a 101 reasons why we shouldn't hire him and it all boils down to ""i wasn't there so i don't approve this person.""
* Round 3 i skip our CTO go to our CEO basically begging him to hire these two people. He says sure and agrees completely. CTO wrote me a very nasty and long email about how me going around her implies i value her less because of her baby. Apparently this caused some sort of weird tension and now i am being told to sit on the hiring by HR. 

Everytime she gets nasty at me, i point out bluntly point out that she isn't responding to her email, slack, and reiterate how tired and frustrated the entire team is. She immediately ether just ignores that part or points out she had a baby recently. 

I recently sat down with our CEO and laid out everything on table, and explained why and how everyone is frustrated and why we are not hitting any of our milestones in dev. Talked about how dev is basically wandering around directionless because we don't even know what is on our plate (which apparently surprised him because our CTO has been claiming otherwise, and i showed him our kaban board which hasn't been changed since September). However he doesn't feel comfortable going over our CTO when it comes to office stuff like hiring. In the end he basically offered us more money and 2 months paid vacation when our teams are back to strength. 

Today was absolute hell, and everyone was angry at me for some reason or another. I am so god damn tired of being asked ""Is there any reason why we haven't done X"", and when pointing out we ether didn't know about X or it is such low priority it will never be done.  I am tired of being dragged into meetings about products to explain to person Y why they don't have X. I am tired of working from 8am - midnight, 7 days a week.

I feel like i am 2 steps away from a nervous breakdown and just want to walk. But at the same time i have constant rage, since for so long our startup struggled and when we finally started making progress, and doing really well this happened. I also cannot get over my sense of guilt, since if i leave who is going to take over ops. There is almost 0 documentation (if it exists it is terribly wrong), and I am the only person in the company right now who has full access to our AWS account (CFO has access to billing but only that).

Long time lurker and first time poster here! I currently am in college(sophomore) for computer science and I've been viewing possible routes I could take with my degree. The reason why I am considering IT Consulting is that I really enjoy doing backend work as well as dealing with unique problems and dealing with the general public (worked in retail for 4+ years).

Over the summer, I had an internship at a Dev shop that focused on Data Hosting as well as web design. Over the couple months that I worked there, I was taken through the process of building a server using RHEL to work all the way up to creating a website for one of their clients. I learned a lot at the internship, but throughout the process, I tended to enjoy the backend work(Apache, setting up PHP, SQL, PhpMyAdmin, automated scripts) more than the frontend work(PHP, HTML5, CSS, JQuery). Which sparked a general interest for how Linux worked at a deeper level. I've done the Linux From Scratch project, and all the computers I operate run Arch Linux, and the server I maintain runs Ubuntu Server. 

Currently, a friend of mine and myself have made a few websites for small companies around our college. I do backend work mostly and frontend work when needed. Which has kind of solidified that I want to do something with a heavy backend aspect. 

I also have experience managing enterprise networks from working for my college. Over this summer, I am doing work with the network as well as setting up some new servers that run RHEL.

Ultimately, the overreaching question I have is what other things should I try to learn while I am at school and have the time to build my portfolio? Are there possibly better suited jobs that fit my skill set?

I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Accounting and Finance at a four-year university in Chicago. I ultimately want to end up at a more prestigious university with a reputable business program and I'm wondering which school I'm applying to would be the most suitable path for someone who wants to go into finance.

I've applied to UCLA, UC Berkeley/Haas, UC Santa Barbara, Boston College, UNC Chapel Hill, USC, and SMU. I know that some of these programs, especially at Berkeley and Boston College, are difficult to get into as a transfer student. With regards to Berkeley, I'm a California resident so I'm hoping this is beneficial to my application. I also have a 3.87 GPA and have only received one B+ in Microeconomics of probably 8+ business courses I have taken thus far, with membership in a professional fraternity, a business competition club, and a fall 2016 finance internship for one of the presidential candidates, so I'm hopeful about my chances.

My questions are: 
1) does anyone know how likely it is for someone to get into Haas as a transfer from another four-year institution? 

2) How is the investment banking/finance recruitment from UCSB compared to my other potential schools? 

I want to have a better idea of what my opportunities will be like at each school before decisions come out so I can make a well-informed decision.

Thanks!"

I recently lost my best friend of 8 years due to my behavior towards her. I was an asshole and I often took out all of my frustrations with myself and my life on her. She ended the friendship. Just now, my older cousin just ended his friendship with me due to my behavior, the way I treat ppl, and the way I live my life. My mom has told me multiple times that if I wasn't her daughter, she would have cut me off by now. My brother said the same, he would have cut me off if I wasn't his sister. I grew up with an abusive father and picked up his habits. I emotionally abuse ppl, manipulate them, and use them for my own selfish needs. I'm extremely selfish and I don't really care about other ppl and their needs. I have a really bad temper and I often say really hurtful things to ppl that I later regret. This morning my mom woke me up to do the dishes. I almost yelled at her and told her that I'd take all the dishes, put them in a trash bag, and throw it outside so that it smashes on the concrete. I wasn't actually going to do it, but I was close to saying it. On top of how disrespectful I am to my mom, I'm still living off her. She pays for EVERYTHING. I'm in college &amp; I have an unpaid internship, but I still feel shitty about not taking care of myself. I'm also terrified of being independent.

I get why ppl don't want to be around me. If I was them, I would want to cut me off too. I'm so frustrated with myself and my life rn. I was thinking about ending my life, I won't do it but it crossed my mind. I hate the way I act and I hate myself. I don't have any friends, I don't know how to make any friends because I have low self esteem.

I know everything that I'm doing wrong but I just can't seem to stop. I lost the best friend I've ever had in my entire life because I couldn't stop being emotionally abusive.

I'm 22, ppl around me are talking about having kids, but I can't have kids if I'm this type of person. I have been trying to change for a long time. I fully accept everything that I've done wrong, and I know what I'm doing, I don't get why I can't just stop.

This is driving me crazy. Im supposed to work out, mediate, eat healthier, have better hygiene, but I can't seem to keep up with everything due to lack of motivation. Not to mention my bad weed habit.

I don't know what to do... How can I change if I know what's wrong in my behavior already but I'm just not changing ....."

I'm aware that all the schools I just listed are very good, but the student body at MIT is likely stronger overall than that of, say, VT.

I'm curious whether or not this would make it harder to get an interview and internship at MIT than at VT, because at MIT you are competing with many more very strong CS students. In other words, it's harder for your resume to stand out among other MIT students, than it is for a strong CS student at VT.

Does anyone have any tips throughout college? (Maybe self teaching while taking a class or freelancing? For instance when I mentioned that I was thinking of freelancing a little with the limited knowledge of code I know he advised against it and suggested I wait till I was taught correctly how to code so I dont have sloppy habits, opinions on his statement?)

I'm failing college because I have no motivation.

I want to be a producer &amp; rapper and Im starting to think I'm crazy for it. I'm going to school for audio production and I moved to NYC. I might be manic right now... But who knows lol... I'm bipolar so my perspective of everything, including myself, changes drastically depending on my mood. Which changes rapidly......

I have no friends. My best friend of 8 years cut me off because I treated her like shit. Even though I cared about her, I just couldn't bring myself to stop. My older cousin just cut me off today lol. My mom &amp; brother have both told me that they wouldn't keep me in their lives if I wasn't family.

I'm 22, living off of my moms money. I have an unpaid internship and I'm in college.

I have no friends lol. My social life was pretty much non-existent when I was still friends with my ex best friend. My whole life revolved around her, but now she's gone and I feel like a good for nothing with no friends. I have really low self esteem and I don't know how to make new friends and I am having trouble letting people in, I push ppl away once they show interest in me. It's also hard for me to believe that someone actually likes me and enjoys my presence even when their actions show that they do.

I have poor hygiene and have little to no motivation to change that. I'm supposed to eat healthy &amp; workout to help with all of my issues and to be more clear-headed, but I can't bring myself to keep up with doing it.

I'm selfish, manipulative, and emotionally abusive. I try to stop but unfortunately my father's abusive influence just won't let go of me and I hate myself for it.

I lie so much, I believe my own lies, and I've been in situations where I wanted to tell the truth but I just couldn't bring myself to be 100% honest.

I always have a problem with someone. Everywhere I go, I'm always going to find something wrong about a situation or with a person and whatever that ""problem"" is, entirely consumes me.
Example: I find that a guy named Jacob at my job is arrogant. Other ppl also think he is arrogant but treat him like they would treat anyone else because in their minds, it's not that serious. I end up seriously disliking Jacob because of his arrogance and I then find every little thing about him that annoys me and consume myself with it to the point where he makes me visibly upset whenever I have to interact with him.

I have no self control. Weed, porn, temper tantrums.. I'm addicted to all 3.

Im honestly, so sick of myself. I considered ending it all so many times, but I can't do that to my mother. Most of the time I'm not thinking about ending it though.

I want to change but don't know how. I'd make progress then fall right back in to old habits.

A few years back I graduated and got my bachelor degree: Journalism. I should add that 3 years before that I had a hard time making the decision... Journalism or Computer Science. I took the... let's call it 'easy' way. I got my degree without having to study too much (I passed all exams on first try by just getting everything in my head the day – and night – before an exam). 

So after that I had to make another 'big life decision'. Get a job or get another degree. I decided to take a job, because I got a job offer from the company where I did an internship and I wanted to be in the possibility to move out of my parents house and start living with my girlfriend. Online football (soccer) journalism. Not a permanent contract, but I was a 'freelancer'. I should add I was working 12h/day + weekends for that company and was getting quite some money from it. 

But then, before I even moved out of my parents house, everything went wrong. It all started with the payments getting more and more delayed and the company (with the website I'm working for as just one small part of the bigger company) ending up bankrupt (in total I missed out on 3 months of payment, which I will never see, due to the fact I was 'just' a freelancer – eventhough I pretty much ran the website entirely by myself, content-wise). I should add at this point I even got a second job some months before the bankruptcy, but I let it go, because of several reasons. Not a job to continue my carreer in (betting website, …).

So there I was, january 2016, jobless. At that point my girlfriend decided to leave me. Completely different story, but it had to be mentioned, because it makes me reconsider my big life decisions (even up to this point, where I still regulary get in contact with her, but without making any progress – and I FINALLY start giving up on her) and it has some ties to this. Me working so many hours, not having enough time for her, stopped working out (but started again, yay!), ...

In april 2016 I got a new job, permanent contract (after a trial), business journalism. Writing technical articles for several magazines that are distributed to companies in the sector. Payments are in time, but I'm making only half (a bit above the minimum 'start salary') of what I used to make. This is where I'm at now. Not completely unhappy with my job, also due to the fact that in the near future (2-3 years) I could get a promotion (and a company car) to be 'chief editor' of one of the magazines. 

But here I am, starting courses on CodeAcademy and considering if I should get another degree, in Computer Science. And if I do, should I do it in home school (evening) or day school to get a bachelor degree? I'm quite sure I'm 'smart' enough to get a bachelor degree, but I'm not sure if I want to leave my job for it. Getting back to school means saying goodbye to this promotion I might get AND deciding to live at my parents house for another three years... This last thing is what is bothering me the most. I was ready to move out and move in with my girlfriend-at-the-time. Still considering moving out and start living on my own, but financially not do-able without a dayjob.

I'm trying to list the pro's and the cons, but still can't really decide.

Any advice or things you would do in my situation – and why

About six weeks ago, I started as an intern in my first degree-related job. My manager and team often engage in office banter and most of the time I am excluded from this, so I just continue working quietly at my desk. I think I have developed a reputation for being quiet and shy because of this.

I have attempted to join in numerous times and have initiated conversations with the individual team members which normally go well but none of them make the effort to talk to me first. My manager has only ever acknowledged me once, when we were introduced, but has ignored me since. I have become more and more anxious about being excluded. My self-esteem has dwindled as a result, and it has made me become even more quiet and shy - it's a vicious cycle and I am no longer motivated to go to work and do my job.

I am naturally a shy and introverted person, but I am able to socialise well if the other person shows a genuine interest in wanting to speak with me. So far this has not happened.

How can I recover from the situation I am in so that I can get a second chance at getting along with my team?

My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed, and If I radically change course, it would take 1 to 1 and a half more school years to finish, and tuition per semester is in the 6 to 7,000+ range, not counting miscellaneous expenses, which potentially adds up to 10 to 12,000 per year at most, though. My Financial Aid advisor told me that, at the rate I’m going, total amount is within the 6/7/8k range.


---My Situation--- I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate.


*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.


*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.


*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.
There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I looking at it pragmatically enough? Careers aren’t light decisions, and I’m ultimately drawn to these paths in particular because of opportunities for interesting work with potentially good salary between 40 to 80k, along with good work-life balance that allows for family, personal projects and hobbies. BUT, I also need to keep in mind the potential flaws. For instance, Web Dev/Software Engineering roles are better paying and in higher demand compared to Web Design, yet I strongly believe that I could do perfectly well with that as a career – even with the elephant of student debt being a potentially stronger pressing concern. English major stereotypes are largely just that, but there’s truth in stereotypes, and there’s always the risk that I could live out the nightmare scenario of nearly a decade of low paying jobs WITH debt. I’ve been told by my family that I don’t have to worry about that having that potential debt, as I have a personal financial cushion along with financial aid and scholarships. I live in the RGV of South Texas, and there’s not much opportunities for the above careers, so there’s also the financial issue of relocation. 


I thank you all, and am interested in hearing your comments on this matter."

I'm a current undergrad junior who's interested in both data science and finance. But I haven't quite figured out which field I prefer as of right now. 

I got my first internship offer in Data Science. It's an ok offer, in terms of pay. Not great location. But it's better than nothing and I'm thrilled I was able to get an offer at all. 

That being said, I am still interviewing/applying for quite a few other firms, in both data science and Finance. I have two final round interviews coming up, one in data science one in finance, among others in earlier rounds. Pretty much all of them have better locations, likely better pay, and are probably better for my career. I would rather work at both the companies I am currently in the final round in, as well as most of the other companies I'm still interviewing for. 

So the data science offer I hold right now has a deadline for this coming Monday, but there's a good chance I won't do the final round interviews (among other interviews) until mid-late January. The dilemma I'm in is that I don't want to turn down my current offer and then get rejected from all my other offers, leaving me with nothing for this summer. 

My dad thinks I should accept the current offer, and then just back out if I get another offer. I can't help but feel this is unethical. Anyway have recommendations for me on where to proceed? 

Thanks in advance. "

I recently started 3 months unpaid internship this week (only commute is reimburse after internship ends) at a laid-back an established training center mainly focused graphic design and media production software, along with Mac IT. I'm also a recent college graduate with a business degree but I wanted to do more IT stuff. 

Now from what I've researched this place offers great training in those software and my manager has been giving some books to read and hints at placing me in classes so I can develop troubleshooting skills with OS X and possibly OS X servers. The unpaid intern-to-employee rate is also about 56% according to my estimates.

I am the only IT guy--hence why I have my own office--at this small business and I work here full-time but I am not paid. I feel like a generalist and pretty much do anything related to computers. Now my question is that is this internship worth it? I only see two paths after ending this internship, which is being brought on full-time or finding another IT job in a place that heavily uses macs after becoming Apple certified, both are which are still uncertain. Thanks!"

5m9wr3,0,2017-01-05,New Job (first job) and some questions!,NotSoInfamousE,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5m9wr3/new_job_first_job_and_some_questions/,"I just started my ""internship"" at a school district working in the finance department doing reporting and other small general IT things. Down the hall there is the technology department who handles everything that the normal visitor of this subreddit would handle.

So, my responsibilities are to manage our financial and hr management systems and their databases. We are the admins of the system and have full access to everybody's information and then we go and do all the SQL reporting that needs to be custom because the system's don't have those features. Blah, blah, I've only been here a week, so I'm learning.

I can't tell if since it's my first week that things are just going slow and will pick up, but so far there hasn't been jack shit for me to do. It took until Tuesday afternoon to get a working computer, the first machine wasn't imaging correctly. I got lucky with this second machine that there was an oversight I have local admin. My biggest surprise since starting has been that I walked into my bosses office on Monday/Tuesday and was talking to her about our databases and asked ""So, do we have an ERD or any diagrams at all for this thing?"" and she says ""Nope. The vendor gave us nothing."". Is this a common thing? I can't believe that a vendor would sell you a system with hundreds and hundreds of tables and then not provide any documentation. But then there's the next part that I just absolutely cannot figure out. There's no god damn foreign keys in this database. I used some other software (this is where having local admin pays off) to reverse the DDL file I got from SSMS and got a picture of this database. And there's a total of maybe 8-10 foreign keys out of hundreds of tables. How the fuck does this thing function?

Anyways, my boss wanted me to try and learn how to use SSRS instead of cognos just because of they way they have it setup, using cognos for reporting is kind of a bitch. So I got my report established in SSRS in 2 hours and have been waiting for days for the admin's to give me privileges on the SSRS server to get these reports up and running.

My biggest problems this week have been running into walls and needing more permissions / access to more servers. I'm asking the technology team to give me or my boss privileges to use diagrams in SSMS on the databases. I'm asking for rights to create stored procedures, I just keep running into walls where I can't do what I want without having to ask for permissions. Maybe it's because this is my first job and I've only learned in an environment where I had full control. But it really is a bitch to keep running into walls and feeling like if I keeping asking, they're going to start getting suspicious.

I guess my main questions out of all of this are as follows:

1. Is it common for the technology team and another team who heavily interface / depend on having access to the systems to be so separated and not allowed to speak to each other?

2. Are they going to start getting suspicious and asking questions about why I keep needing more and more? (Would you as a sysadmin be questioning my motives?)

3. Why do I feel like there is a DBA down that hall that has diagrams of these databases or even a data dictionary and my boss just isn't aware of it?

4. Is my job in the finance department a normal role? I feel like the things we're doing and some of the projects I'm being asked to start up are more of the ""IT"" realm, rather than just another department that uses the databases.

My main goals this week has been to starting creating documentation. When I walked in and my boss and coworker said ""you just have to go searching through hundreds of tables to figure out what links to what"", I was amazed. There's no way people can be expected to just ""work"" without being provided proper documentation.

TL;DR: This is my first job, I've been programming and learning databases since high school and everything I try to do is from the mindset of having free access. I just have some questions and don't want to overstep an boundaries."

I've had a handful of phone screens and code tests, but nothing in-person yet.


I've been applying to jobs everyday on LinkedIn, Indeed, Gamasutra, and my school's job board (which is horrible). I've gotten feedback from here on my resume multiple times, and most people said it looks solid overall. I've probably been applying to about 3-5 jobs a day. Junior/associate positions seem very rare, and its even harder to find a job that matches my skills. So I've been applying to anything even remotely close.


I've probably applied to 150+ jobs by now. I didn't start seriously applying until around October/November (I was still working a lot to provide for my family). I've only been applying on those job boards that I listed above. Sometimes that involves being directed to the actual company website and applying.


I had an 18 month internship, but it was a government position, so they were unable to immediately offer a full-time position afterwards (you need to take a test and go on a waitlist, which I have done).


I had a phone screen yesterday for a gaming company, followed by a 2 hour code test of 2 questions. I managed to only pass 4/8 test cases for each question (the questions were very weird, but I felt like I could have passed given a bit more time), and they haven't responded to me since, which really got my hopes down. I've been studying CTCI diligently and doing leetcode for the past month or so.

I'm currently a senior with two semesters left going to one of top 10 computer engineering school in our nation.
I am under an academic probation for having my cumulative GPA at 2.7 (TGPA below 2.0 due to one failed course.)

Two semesters left, no internship under my belt. I've relied on my intelligence to carry me through school. 4.0 and came to this prestigious school while playing about 5~6 hours a day along with extracurricular activity. I still don't think I've matured out of that.

I'm still a very social person and most of my friends don't even know that I'm an active gamer nor that I'm top ranked in lot of games (Noticeably current top 500 in overwatch and league of legends. Participated in pro gaming scene for two different game (FPS and fighting))

My parent who is first generation aren't very fluent in English and hasn't seen my transcript once or took part in my academic life. My peers think I'm some kind of genius elitist because I help around whenever someone asks a coding question and I'm above average with programming among my peers just because I seem to understand the problem and find a way to solve them efficiently.

But my GPA is garbage from not attending lectures and not doing homework that isn't coding. My one F in the transcript is because one of my teammates cheated on a final project that counts for 30% of our grade which resulted in 0 for our entire team. I also worked full-time to financially support myself while going to school. I slept on average about 4~5 hours a day to play a video game, meet people, work, and spend the least amount of time just to get by at school.

My current standing is a senior with two semesters left (with summer for an internship in between). Over entire college period, I sent out about a total of 15 resumes got 4 interviews failed 3 and got into one where I worked as an IT... I wouldn't really call this an ""internship"".

I want to get an internship, I want to break off from gaming. I want someone to just slap me and force me to do stuff at this point because I keep making goals to solve problems on OJ leet code, enhance my personal project, and most importantly send out resumes yet... I just play video games and push it to tomorrow. This has been my last 3weeks and I realize that I'm a game addict... 

I say that I want a better life yet I don't put in 1/3 the effort of people around me.
How do you guys think I should go about pushing myself to just do it?
I don't think I can ever break off from a gaming completely just because of all the relationships with people that revolve around it.

5mcfdo,39,2017-01-06,Last year I was on the news for leaving a suicide note in my dorm room and now I can't fit in socially or thrive professionally,raspberrysorbetto,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5mcfdo/last_year_i_was_on_the_news_for_leaving_a_suicide/,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet, as I've had to explain it too many times.

I go to high-profile college.
Last year due to a number of issues, I became depressed and suicidal.

Convinced I'd do it, I left a note in my room and went to go do it, but changed my mind before I could follow through (due to a risk of cowardice and a sliver of hope.)

I was reported missing, a fiasco ensued, I didn't return for a week, and when I returned, everything was different. I stopped getting invited to parties. People stopped talking to me. The guy I was dating stopped asking me out. I don't think people hated me, they just didn't know how to react. Or maybe they did. I don't know.

Everything is still shit. There are 5 pages of news articles of this when you Google my name.

The thing I miss most is feeling young. I'm 19, but I feel 50. I don't feel invincible. I don't feel like anything is possible for me. I don't feel like the world is my oyster. I don't feel like I can make any more mistakes. I don't feel carefree, ever. I only see myself through the eyes of the people who called me psycho and made me feel less than human. I only see the stigma, and the shame, and the scrutiny. All I want is to have fun. People try to recommend therapy, coping mechanisms, blah blah blah. Like I'm perpetually sick. I don't want any of that. I want to be a kid, and enjoy myself. But there's nobody who wants to enjoy life with me anymore, because everyone stays away from me.

What do I want?
I want to be happy. I want to have social connections, and be successful. I want to get a respectable internship and feel like I could actually have a shot at a high-profile job. I want to feel like nothing is impossible for me if I put in effort. Like this event wouldn't disqualify me from being trusted with responsibility if I met the credentials. I used to want a career in politics, but I'm so demoralized that I've completely limited my goals. I just know the media would dig this up and have a field day, and I'd have to relive it all over again only to be called mentally unfit to govern. I know how America sees people like me. I'm a black female, so I already had strikes against me before any of this bullshit went down. 

But what do I need, if nothing else?
I need to be acceptable. To be normal. To smile again. To believe that I actually have a shot at my dreams. To believe that I'm not a lost cause. To believe that the world still wants what I have to offer. To feel alive again, instead of just living. To feel like I haven't been robbed of a path to my goals. A never-ending list of wants. Each quite simple yet, at least now, completely outside of my grasp. It all feels impossible. I feel like society, and my school, and most people, won't let me. Sure, I can act confident or happy, but at the end of the day nobody is buying it. I can act how I want, but when there's no external validation towards it that's all it can ever amount to...an act. I feel trapped with this awful reputation and this awful stigma. I feel stifled and limited by the Google results. I feel like I'll never rise above my past, and I just don't know how to thrive.

Even when I put forth a good effort in customizing my resume and cover letter (which I am confident are both well-written and structured), there seems to be no response for the most part. I also feel I am pretty qualified for most positions I apply for, but perhaps employers are only selecting the very top level of candidates. 

I have an Hons BA in Economics &amp; Financial Management (graduated in June), completed my CSC, and am awaiting results of CFA level 1, so I'm mainly looking for careers in finance (the goal is equity research, portfolio management, private equity, venture capital, investment banking, or something similar - in no particular order). As for my work experience, I quit my most recent job having only worked from sep-dec (client service at a big banks’ brokerage), because it was something I felt I was not growing or learning whatsoever.  None of the skills I have were being used or expanded, and I felt working there for a while would not get me anywhere I really wanted to go. I also have worked 3 internships in order of recency: one in finance, one at a small marketing firm (operations), and one in accounting/tax. My skill set is pretty broad, and not confined to one area which might be hurting my chances applying for the positions I desire.

Anyways, I’m hoping to get some advice on what I can do to improve and actually get feedback from some of these companies I really want to work for. It seems that getting a position requires you to know someone, otherwise your application won’t even be looked at.  Any help or advice is appreciated a ton!"

The trouble is that school starts in August and I'm graduating the following May, and my work experience will look like:

- IT internship 2012
- IT internship 2013
- Web development work 4 months, 2013/2014
- Web development work 1.5 years, 2015/2016

None of these jobs were very good at all, and I was dealing with medical issues at the time. Anything before 2014 might as well be worthless in shaping me as a candidate. From 2010-2013, I went to a top 20 school and completely ruined any chance of good standing there, and left due to said issue.

I know literally nobody who codes, have no network, and I'm currently trying to apply to internships and getting pretty plainly rejected without any interviews or phone screens. And I went, and am returning, to a top 20 school. I know I don't meet the requirements (returning to program I was just at) and am about 4 months late, but I really don't want to have two major unexplainable gaps in my career.

Right now, I have an offer as a letter carrier that will pretty much ensure I don't have the flexibility to go to through any interview process for the next 7 months.

What can I do? Are there jobs other than internships that would be better suited to my needs? Am I even doing the right thing by applying to internships? I live about an hour and a half out of NYC, if that's worth anything."

If you want to skip my little story below, here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-stein-0895b885

I've been unemployed for about 6 months now, after I left a serving job that wasn't the greatest environment (in addition to working 7 days a week for a few months… I needed a break, but not a break this long). The NYC job market has gotten intimidating.

I've been an Editorial Intern for that time, learning art copywriting (artist biographies, introductions to content written by other people, my own small piece or two, curating small thematic collections of art for sale and writing accompanying descriptions of the pieces, etc.).

Before that I was a PR and Marketing intern where I wrote many, too many, press releases, researched with the rest of my time, and occasionally had to drive clients around, get product to trade shows, and other various errands.

I've also been immersed in the fine dining world for a few years now, serving at a farm to table restaurant while I was in college upstate (where I made a lot of ""third-wave"" espresso on a La Marzocco) and at a very fast-paced NYC restaurant. I love food, talking about food, making people happy, and drinking wine beyond my paygrade. (Once had a 1962 Rothschild Bordeaux… it was good, but not as life-changing as I wanted.)

Before I started working in restaurants, I was a student technician. I did a little bit of everything—phone support (diagnosing and trying to fix problems, walking users through their software, etc. Think: helping professors get to their email who don't *quite* know what a mouse cursor is. It was fun.), hardware replacements, re-imaging machines, wiping and reinstalling Windows (for student computers), etc. Basic computer janitor stuff. I got to drive a massive 4WD enclosed golf cart around at my first job, too.

I host my own website off of a DigitalOcean VPN (my portfolio, on Koken) and I'm just about done building a pretty rudimentary website for my mom in Wordpress (customizing a commercial theme for her needs, mostly). My Sysadmin skills are rusty, as I've been out of the game for a while, but I've used MacOS (RIP ""OS X""), Windows (95 through 10), Debian, and Ubuntu for years. They call us digital natives, right?

Basically… I know technology, I can write, and I can be comfortable while selling high-end food and wine. In my personal life I'm a photographer, writer (photography theory and criticism), bookmaker, and I'm currently working on curating my first show.

I studied Human Rights and Photography in school, and I've been using Photoshop since I was 11 with Photoshop CS. When I was a teenager I wanted to be a graphic designer, so I made business cards, personal brand identities, even forum signatures all the time, so I'm at home in Photoshop (though not the best graphic designer). Studying Photography in school, including black &amp; white and chromogenic printing, made me an excellent retoucher. I've also laid-out and printed (via Blurb) a few photo books, so I'm pretty comfortable in InDesign. I've also done some editing in Premier and Final Cut Pro 7, but I'm a little rusty still, it would probably take me a couple weeks to pick it up again and learn After Effects.

I live in Manhattan. I have a driver's license. My schedule is pretty open and flexible (I intern two days a week, but I would leave for the right job), and I'm pretty much looking for any job that my skills suit me for. Part-time or full-time, temporary or not. I learn quickly and my biggest issue is probably difficulty saying no… sometimes I take on too many projects at once because I want to please everyone, but I think that stems from taking 7 or 9 tables all at once in restaurants. I'll work nights, weekends, whatever. Mornings, too, though I'm not a morning person. But, hey, beggars can't be choosers, right?

And if you want to know a little bit more about me, my ultimate goal is to ""break-in"" to the art editorial world. I want to make photo books and write about photography, essentially, though that doesn't have to be my *career*. I just want to find someone to pay me to do something I'm good at. I can write on my own time.

Thanks everyone! If I sound like a good fit for any opportunities you know of, please shoot me a message through my email listed on LinkedIn."

I landed my self a internship that morphed into a full time job at a startup.  

A few weeks ago, my boss introduce me to someone else as ""the software engineer"".  

Fast forward a few weeks, and I am home for the holidays and people have been asking me what I do.  I usually say something along the line of ""I am developing a mobile app"" or ""I work for a startup"". But sometimes, it slips out ""I am a software engineer"" or ""Im a mobile developer"".  

Everytime I say it, my voice starts to trail off. I feel like i don't deserve the title. Engineer for me is someone who went to school for a long time and studied high level math and physics.  Developer is someone who could hold their own in a job interview exam.  


Anybody else who is self-taught have imposter syndrome? And how did you deal with it?"

I have citizenship and passport to an EU country, as well as citizenship in Canada. I have 2 degrees (Science and Electrical Engineer, EE being the most recent). I have some experience (about 2-3 years) in an oil &amp; gas role as both software dev and IT admin. My skills include hardware development at the microchip level as well as the firmware that drives them, and software development for embedded systems and desktop users. I've even released some software on my website in both a paid and free model. I have a couple internships under my belt, but those companies have either downsized or been sold off so can't go back there. I will move anywhere, worldwide, to work. I just want to work.

I've been job hunting since July '16 and have had 2 interviews in Canada since I started. I have had 2 interviews in Austria as well, but didn't work out as the company was unwilling to meet part way for cost of travel to interview (many companies in the EU, especially Germany, are willing to either fully pay or partly pay for travel for just interviews). I have gone through dozens of revisions for both CV/resume and cover letters. Each resume and cover letter is tuned to the job and uses keywords to reflect what they want in the candidate. I do my research of the company and try to display that I want to work there and for what reasons. I've even written software to automate some of the more monotonous parts of applications, such as tuning with keywords for certain industries. I tried recruiters in different countries as well, especially in Japan (since gf is Japanese and has no PR or visa to live here) where they told me they won't even talk to me until I'm in Japan.

I'm tired of hunting and being filtered. I'm exhausted of getting daily emails saying ""we thank you for applying but have gone with a more suitable candidate"". I don't know how I can make myself more suitable. I've spent a few months learning web development and have made several websites. I've honed my skills in both hardware and software. I've learned new languages, both programming and linguistic. I've worked for free on various projects. I've networked with friends and graduating members of my classes, most of which weren't in a much better position than myself. I've networked with friends of friends to no avail. I've entertained random LinkedIn recruiters only to never hear from them again after saying I'm interested. I've sought out recruiters and headhunters, which never resulted in any jobs in my field. I included a link to my website, which shows various projects and my ability to problem solve, on my applications and track visitors, but found not a single person visited after I applied. This suggests no one is looking (or at least interested in) at my site and skills.

I've teetered from desperate to fake-it-till-you-make-it and back. I am lucky to have amazing family that is helping me until I get on my feet, but I can't and don't want to rely on that forever. I just don't know what to do anymore. I thought having experience and a degree would be enough even for entry level, or at least having someone entertain my application, sadly I've not seen this in reality.

Feel free to call me out on any BS if you see any. I'm under no illusion that I deserve anything, I'm just trying to find a way to live and be productive. "
5mgwtf,3,2017-01-06,[Advice] Might have my first programming job!....using VB.Net,nemonemo33,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5mgwtf/advice_might_have_my_first_programming_jobusing/,"So to give background I am a sophomore in college who fell in love with programming and decided I wanted to teach myself and hopefully end up using it to pay my way through school. To this end I learned web development as it has the most resources online (such as free code camp and the odin project) and is the quickest to learn. From this I got an internship by the end of which my manager is dying to keep me but there is no room on the web dev side. Given that I have recently taken a liking to C# and .Net he suggests me over to the application development side of things. Which leads me to where I am now.
  
  
I just got finished with testing and interviewing for the Application Developer job both of which I aced and from the sound of it they want me. My only worry is...is this useful? Is this a good idea? I don't see many VB jobs in my area and on this sub I have yet to hear a positive thing about the language. Would a year here give me enough experience to just go ahead and work elsewhere with C# (which I know and can train more in) or would I be shunned or stunted in my job search for using such an unpopular language? I really was hoping this would kind of be the start of my development career so basically I'm asking, is this a good deal or a waste of time career wise?
  
  P.S: If it matters, I'd be using SQL a lot as well if that matters."

I have lots of family there. I want to live and work in a place that values my experience and hard work, where basic human rights and requirements aren't traded back and forth in politics (yes, yes, I know it happens everywhere, but universal health care, basic human decency and such are valued much more than here). I am tired of the Canadian way, it no longer interests me or my future. I do not want my future kids going to school in Canada like I did. Just not interested. Japan: my gf is from there, I have visited and liked it. I find it generally very polite there, and even though there are many things that aren't desirable there (cram schools, etc) I think it would be a good step to take. Regardless, I just want out of Canada."

I just got an interview at a really good company in the next couple weeks (and am applying to internships now as well), and I have my first interview in 2 weeks exactly. I've been going through CTCI in my off days over break, and I'm getting the approaches/general algorithms to problems correct, but I'm struggling really hard to finish and solve the problem correctly and get the correct output for the problem on my own, even after looking at the solution without having to look things up online (make random errors with java as a language, for example).

Sometimes I get an approach semi-right, but it's not optimal.  I write out all this code, and then can't figure out how to debug it. I'm horrible at harder brainteasers. I have a lot left to learn as well. In an interview setting, I definitely will not get the right output, let alone I'll just miss some syntax, won't notice and the interviewer will think I'm an idiot. Aside from easy array/list problems, I don't think I've gotten anything right on the first try/without having to debug. I almost always end up over-complicating problems in terms of lines of code versus the actual solution.

I need your advice, if there even is any for this situation... How can I try and prepare as well as I can for these interviews when I'm failing these questions so miserably? I want to succeed so badly, but I'm feeling like I'm coming closer and closer to abject failure."
5mhupj,5,2017-01-06,My Chinese Parents,MENEV,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/5mhupj/my_chinese_parents/,"Before I start I want to give a heads up that my memory is complete horse poop. I have a hard time remembering names, anything I remember was a constant occurrence or was significant to my life. I have a tendency to almost completely forget things that were insignificant. This makes it even more sad that all my life I've felt a deep emotional disconnect with my parents.

I am currently 19 years old and still finding my way. 
My parents are both from the same village, my mom apparently came as a refugee while my dad smuggled his way as crate. They're both legal citizens now though.

At the age of 2-3 I was sent to China and didn't come back till I was 5. I spent my earliest memories in china with my grandparents. I only knew the village language. (China has many different sub-languages) When I was pulled back to America I was thrown into this Pre-K chinese school thing. Where they taught me Mandarin and English. Even then it was just mainly Mandarin. So there I was with my first language as a village language, the mandarin. I only later on learned to understand English through the old fashioned tv we had. When I first came over my family rented out a basement. As a child I didn't think much of it, I continued to act the same way I did back in China, a very load and curious kid. Somewhere between then and when I started grade school I became a mute. I remember something about me singing a song I really like and my dad screamed at me to shut up. 
Now when I said I learned to understand English, I didn't learn how to speak it. So when I got sent to grade school they instantly threw me into ESL classes. The first 3 years of grade school was terrible. Thankfully I've forgotten most of it, the bad memories still come back to me every so often, the 1 thing I will share is that I was the 1%. The teachers didn't know how to teach a asain, and most of them ignored me. 3rd grade was when we moved to a actual house. A 3 story house that was newly built. We move into the 1st floor and rented out the 2nd and 3rd. 
This meant a new school for me, this new school is where I end up getting bullied. I ended up in a mainly Black/Hispanic school. Genetically these people were bigger and matured faster then me. This contributed to me being very anti-social throughout middle school, which by the way was bully filled as well. I told my mom once during 4th grade about it and all she did was complain to me about why I'm letting it happen, then complained to the entire school about it. So I learned not to rely on my parents for jack shit at a early age. Somewhere in middle school I got into a fight, things got out of hand and I ended up with half my face swollen. But surprise surprise! The guy I fought lost and was in the hospital. The other students all reported that he attacked me so i was let off rather easy. (they probably knew about me being bullied) It was a spur of the moment and as a child I completely didnt remember what I did at all, all i remember was feeling a sharp pain on my right side and then I was standing on top of the guy. My classmates told me that when I entered the stairway the guy swung at me hard, they all thought I was gonna fall flat. But apparently I turned, grabbed him, then used him as a surfboard as i rammed his head down the stairs. The school labeled it as a accident since all the injuries he had were from the stairs.
I boasted to my mother about it thinking she would be proud of me. And ended up getting punished for ""hurting a poor soul"" and how it'll damage her name if other people found out. 
Highschool things started getting better, I ended up with people that accepted me. But as a socially awkward kid I'm very thankful they all had the patience to handle me.
That's the rather good gist of my school life, heres the next part.
So I stated that I was rather disconnected to my parents. Growing up I only saw them as free food. And I'm pretty sure they saw me as a investment for when they are old. I didn't know even the most basic things about my parents, even now if you asked my my parents favorite colors I wouldn't know. They were always working so I was always left alone. At first I always looked forward to seeing them but as times past by I stopped caring if they were home or not. Rather I perfered it if they weren't home. They never asked how my day was or just any generic interactions. All They'll ever ask was ""How your grades"", ""Did you finish your homework"", and if I'm done with everything they'll just tell me to go ""study"". Now that I'm older I can understand they were probably tired from work, but I still don't understand why they never actually tried to interact with me more, it was the same on holidays. They always forced me into there saturday sunday schools saying how I better do good in these classes because they paid for it. As a child growing up I never learned how to smile. I didn't realize what a real smile was till high school. 
During one high school summer, for some reason instead of forcing me to go to a summer school they took me to literally ever single coaster park you can think of. Hersey Park, Six Flags, Dorney Park, and plenty other ones that wasen't as popular or wide known. It was like a attempt to cram every motherly and fatherly love they had saved up over the last 10 years crammed into 2 months. I enjoyed it since it was better then going to school. This was also the first time I skipped the first day of school after summer break. The trip was told to me the night before we left which was about 1 week after school ended, and we didn't come home till the night of the 1st day of school. So as the child I was I completely forgot about summer homework. Andddd Tadaaa guess what happened. School called my parents up asking why I didn't finish my homework. I go home and they start chewing me out. The only thing I remember them saying, or repeatedly saying, ""How could you not do your homework, do you have any idea how much money we spent on you this summer"". Great way to end the almost new beginning of a parent child bond. I never got a chance to speak since ""a child should shut up and listen"".

Well those days are over, and I actually didn't want to bring it up but recent things have completely killed my sense of thought.

When I graduated Highschool I didn't know what I wanted to do, my nagging mother just won't let me off the hook so I joined the Marines Reserve as a way to relieve myself of her nagging and experience more of the world. My ship date was August 10, a week early from my birthday August 17. I didn't really care since a birthday wasn't a big deal to me growing it. It's just a fucking date of when you were born why bother waste of time. Training was 3 months. It was probably the longest 2 months of my life. When I somehow managed to pass everything I came home for boot leave. It was 10 days, my parents couldn't really control me anymore. I spent my the first 3 days crashing with my friends day in and day out. Thats when my mom complained about me being out all the time. So To keep her from nagging whenever I saw her I spent the next few days home. AND THEN SHE NAGGED ABOUT ME ALWAYS BEING HOME. I gave up and just started doing whatever I wanted to do which was hanging with my friends. AND THEN SHE CALLED ME AND SAYS ""YOUR GRANDMOTHER SPENT HOURS MAKING FOOD FOR YOU WHY ARENT YOU HOME"" WHEN I TOLD HER I'LL BE SLEEPING OVER AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE. My parent have this thing were IIIIIII have to tell EVERYONE  where I'm going or they will all make there own seperate agendas for me. I tell my dad I'll be home late, 5 min later mom calls asking where the hell am I. Vice-versa. THIS HAPPENS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY ARE, my parents work together and NO SHIT live together but just simply can't tell eachother whats happening. I SWEAR I'LL BE THAT ONE GUY WHO GETS HIT BY A FUCKING CAR AND THEY'LL CALL MY DAD WHO'LL MAYBE COME TO THE HOSPITAL AND THEN MY MOM WILL CALL 911 BECAUSE HER SON HASENT RETURNED A GOD DANM PHONECALL IN THE LAST 4 HOURS.
Well bootleave ends and I move onto the rest of my training. The entire training process was long enough that I spent 2 of my birthdays with it. I finally came home Sept. I want'ed to relax and learn to communicate like a normal human being now. No more of that bullshit yes sir no sir, I'm a reservist and I need to remember how to be a civilian. I spent a month trying to forget my marine vocabulary for more friendly words. I was finally able to get myself  talk in a laid back way. I went around town enjoying the freedom actually appreciating being able to do that for once. 
Then my parents started doing shit again. They told me to get a drivers permit and then a license. I found that reasonable so I went and got a permit. And somewhere down the line my mother started talking about college. I told her don;t worry about it. Since I still haven't figured out what I wanted to do I've been volunteering in these projects. I became a intern in this business. etc I was living the free teenage life. 
Well she ended up saying ""Now that you wasted 2 years of your life how about you start doing something with it"". This pissed me the FUCK off. She is calling my military career wasted. 
In her eyes the ideal son was a college graduate.
I am still very pissed. I need help. So far I've found business interesting, but I enjoy helping people. I spent this Christmas helping feed the homeless and I couldn't help but feel joy in doing so. I'm starting to lean towards being a cop. But my current problem is my parents not approving of it. ""Your gonna get shot by some black guy"" ""go be a lawyer"" 

Any hints on getting them to STFU and let me ride my first few years out? Any older mates that are or were in this same exact boat?"

I'm a totally blind student (and I only mention this because I'd be doing something like Lyft or Uber if I could). I've had internships at Acquia and Carbonite and most recently just got my first FreeBSD patch committed. I started dev when I was about 12 with a form of basic and grew to c++ and other languages beyond that.

My biggest problem is that I'm really bored with classes and am working for the degree to get done. I'm looking for some ideas that might give me a challenge, and also give me a good way to make money on the side as someone who is fairly decent at software development. I'm fluent with C, C++, PHP, Python, Java and others and have experience with FreeBSD, Linux, and various configuration of services/some pen testing. I'm also experienced with Jenkins, which is something I picked up at my last internship. I've looked at sites like upwork and others where people post jobs, but most of the easy jobs which would be used to build my ratings are things like ""design a css,"" which is pretty notoriously hard for me to accomplish. I'm great with backend work/system administration.

I'd appreciate any advice you can offer and thanks for your time!

First year went by fine, my grades were pretty good. In 2A, I failed a course and couldn’t get the grade required for another course to move on. I’ve had problems with anxiety and depression since high school and it took a toll after the mediocre performance in 2A. I began seeing a counsellor and taking meds, but despite my best effort, I failed 3/5 courses in 2B. Frustrated, I took the summer off and managed to land a software developer internship with a startup. During this time I kept seeing a counsellor and filed a petition to clear my 2B term. The petition was approved pending a conditional term in Fall 2016. I kept on my meds and managed to get through Fall 2016 term pretty well, doing well on my midterms and assignments for all of my courses. However, disaster struck during my first exam. I had a terrible panic attack and left the exam midway, and ended up at the Emergency wing of the Grand River Hospital. I met my counsellor the next day and with her help I managed to get an INC for the course and permission to write the exam later. Struggling, I managed to get through the rest of the exams but did poorly on each. Despite the poor performance, I managed to pass each of my classes but I couldn’t meet the conditions of the conditional term. However, I am completely out of hope. Failed out of my program and now in Mathematical Studies. It seems like no matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to get my grades up. I have completely given up hope. Being home for the holidays, I have been completely depressed and I am not looking forward to anything anymore because it seems like I am nothing but a failure. I’ve been to a doctor and seems like ADHD but its probably too late now. Nothing seems to be working and honestly suicide seems like the only option. Just so tired. If you managed to read this far, thank you. I just needed to get it off my chest. I don’t know how much longer I can keep this up as I have already wasted enough of my parents time and money. Hopefully death will bring peace. "

Anyways, I have seen examples of some in the past, and I'm not entirely sure what to look for on the googles, so I figure a community like this would be the best place to ask to point me in a good direction. I've dabbled with python, html, and css in the past, so I believe that I'd be able to pick something up rather quickly. Plus, since my major is computer science and I've been around code for awhile now, I shouldn't have a problem. 

Basically, I want to make a search across multiple job boards; like indeed, monster, etc., and then take only the job offerings that have specific keywords within them. Specifically, I'm looking for paid software engineering internships in Pennsylvania that include housing stipends. There's so many positions and so many different companies looking for SE interns, that it would take me forever to crawl all the sites myself.

I'm currently going into my second semester of my Sophomore year at college and things haven't been going the best. My very first semester I failed college algebra because I 
1) Was never good at math
2) Deal with extreme testing anxiety where I would completely blank out then start to panic because I blanked out and in turn start to become physically agitated. 

I ended up taking another lower level math course this previous semester that would suffice and BARELY failed that course as well because of the same issues. My G.P.A is sitting at a very low 2.3 and I actually had dreams about going to law school.

Friends around me are accomplishing great things and are in way better academic states than I am in. A friend of mine, a freshman, just got an internship at the House of Reps. I applied to this same internship and was denied. 

Some days I just kinda sit in my apartment and play World of Warcraft and wouldn't get up or check my phone because I didn't want to interact with people. Whenever I see my parents or old teachers from HS everyone always raves about how ""intelligent"" I apparently am and how they're looking forward to me accomplishing great things.

I'm never going to. I've given my all to my studies and always ending up coming up short? What am I doing wrong? 

I went to the doctor a while back because I was having physical spasm attacks at night when I would think about all of this stuff and he prescribed my Zoloft. I never went to pickup the prescription because I was afraid of (and I know this is such a miniscule and nonexistent thing) the CVS Pharmacy tech seeing that I had to take anti-depressants or if someone found out I had to start taking them. I had a followup scheduled with the doctor 4 weeks after I was supposed to be taking them but never went because I never started and was too scared to say so.

I know this post is all over the place and I apologize I just have a lot I wish I could get off my chest but I don't want to make this obnoxiously long in fear someone will dislike it and in-turn me."

I have an idea I want to ask the community about, but first - some background.
I spend a lot of time trying to solve some *competitive programming problems* and I want to utilize my time better and to film my progress. I didn't win any TopCoder/ICPC rounds, but I had an internship at Google and just signed an offer from Amazon, so I focus more on career development through learning, than attempting to win a contest. 

There are mainly 3 tutorial types of videos on YouTube. 

* A problem explained in a super-detailed manner, like Bubble Sort with real cubes with people replacing them and showing each step. Sometimes the code is shown.
* A problem explained on a whiteboard with voice explanation, charts, formulas, examples, and code, sometimes with a person filmed. 

1 and 2 are both well-prepared and we are given the algorithm/information about problem solution immediately. Although this is a good way of learning, there is another one which I think YouTube lacks. 

* Screen-recording. Petr Mitrichev (the only channel I found from CP community) solves a round on TopCoder and we can see him going through a problem statement and writing corresponding code. This is more interesting for some intermediate level programmers (like me). But he lacks one important thing - explanation, making his videos for an unprepared person almost useless. We can just guess what thoughts came to him and why he decided to go with one algorithm and not another.

I found a lot of blogs/github codes with solutions to TONS of problems, but they are usually one-liners, like ""use Dijkstra"" or ""think backwards"". Although sometimes it's really enough info to solve the problem, but this is not really encouraging and makes things too complicated.  
So I am thinking to come up with a format of live-streaming/screen-recording with a thought process explanation and coding. To show the way a person would tackle a problem seen first, without previous preparation and deriving the solution on-go. This format causes some bad feelings, because I usually make some stupid guesses and mistakes, but this is super-honest. And this is how *a real coding interview will look like*, with a portion of struggling. And here my main question comes.

**Would this type of content be helpful for someone?
And what are some other thoughts about this, maybe I'm missing something?**


I imagine this in the way that one instead of watching game streams/news/series in the evening would watch coding streams. I found a good example here: [liveedu.tv](https://www.liveedu.tv/), but I am not sure how popular this field is, and I was able to find only 1 stream about coding interviews / competitive programming with few viewers."

White / Male / Eastern European / 27 at matriculation

**Work Experience**: 4 years, Presales &amp; then Consulting - IT Services firm, London  
• 4 years at matriculation, all in the London office of a European blue chip IT Services firm (virtually unknown in US), of which:  
	• 1.5 years+: IT presales / bid management  
		  ○ consistent strong performance: one promotion with no title change.
	• 2.5 years+: Same IT services firm, but moved to business consulting arm - in the Digital division within consulting  
		  ○ [NB: I've just transferred here, and considering moving again if I can better my chances significantly.]  
	• Previously did a 12-month internship at Fortune 30 company - think GE/HP (non-consulting)    

**Extra Curriculars**: Several but nothing amazing.  
	• was on the board of one of the largest student societies at my college  
	• played soccer for my campus team  
	• lots of small initiatives at work outside my core job  
	  
**Undergrad school**: Official rankings of my undergrad: UK Top 10 overall / Top 140 globally. Think Loughborough/Surrey- not Russell Group, and virtually unknown in US I presume. To get an idea: it's target for Big4, but not for any MBB or even niche MCs.  
Major: BSc Management

**Stats**  
• GMAT Score: Let's assume 750+. I've got plenty of time to prepare and I also need a good score to offset lack of big names on CV.  
• Undergrad: UK 2:1, ~80th percentile in my class. There's no standard conversion to US GPA, estimates I found range between 3.1 and 3.7.  
	• I have some mitigating circumstances (bereavement), but don't want to bring them up.  

**MBA Info**:  
•Goal of MBA: Short term - consulting (ideally MBB).  
• Target schools: M7, INSEAD, LBS, Oxbridge or bust. Might extend to a few other schools targeted by MBB.

**Advice Required**  

I'm unclear on how much weight some factors have (e.g. prestige of employers and college, or lack thereof). I'd like to hear your thoughts, particularly around how the following options would change my prospects:  

1. Moving to a more prestigious firm  
	• Where would be best purely for M7 MBA chances? Big 4? Niche MC? Fortune 100 non-consulting?  
2. Stay at my current firm, in consulting, but move to another office, abroad  
3. Stay at my current firm, in consulting, but within consulting, move away from Digital business consulting - based on my assumption that 'Digital' consulting is frowned upon by Adcoms.
  
Some other questions I'd like to hear your views on:  
  
4\. How important are public speaking ECs for Adcoms, are they just expected from everyone?  
5\. If I get British citizenship (will have dual nationality), will this affect my chances? Am I in an underrepresented demographic at the moment?  
6\. Bringing up mitigating circumstances during college - is it frowned upon by Adcoms? If not, would it make any difference in my case? My grades are by no means disastrous, just pretty average.  
7\. Realistically, does a rejection have any effect on subsequent applications at that school? I already know they say it doesn't, but will they even look at past applications from candidates?   
8\. With my default path mentioned before, what tier of schools am I looking for as target atm e.g. top50? Do I have more than a 0% chance at any of my target schools mentioned?  
9\. If you were me, what would you focus on in the next 2 years to become a better candidate?   
	• Would you wait 1-2 more years? Would this make me a significantly better candidate?  

&amp;nbsp;

I put some structure to it to make it easier to follow, but feel free to comment in any format. Thanks!"

Tl;dr 22 Year College student nearing end of degree path seeking practical, honest feedback on with planning for Design, Marketing, and Developer career/jobs. Have personal preference towards good work life balance in career, without getting into too much debt right out of the gate, but want an honest outsider’s perspective on my specific dilemma and what could be reasonably be done hack it out. My full ride Texas Grant is coming to an end, but all my core courses are completed.

I started my college career as a Graphic Design major, before switching to English with the intent of teaching, but when I decided that I really wasn’t cut out for it, I was sent into a depressive, desperate, emotional tailspin the entire fall semester as I struggled to figure out just what the hell I was going to DO with my life, with the major I had after scouring reddit and hearing an unsettling amount of horror stories of not only English majors, but of millennials in general. I’ve been asking myself brutally tough questions about what I hoped to accomplish in life, and as I see it, there’s a few paths I can see ahead of me that I can undertake with the major I have, or if I intend to switch entirely at this point. Each path has its own pros and cons related to practical viability considering where I am in life, what I want, and where I live – with each option, I’m willing to relocate. The job market down here doesn't offer much for these.

*MARKETING/PR: From what I’ve read, English majors can make pretty nice careers here, and I could snugly add another minor alongside Graphic Design, either with marketing or computer science – giving me eight more classes, and at the absolute most, an extra school year to beef up my resume/ seek out relevant internships. I don’t know if that might even be enough, but It’s as viable an option as any. If I have a comp sci major, that might also be an asset if I seek out TECHNICAL WRITING. JOURNALISM is also viable.

*GRAPHIC/WEB DESIGN: This one weighed very heavily on me, as I did enjoy the major, and I do regret changing course from it. If I were to change back, I would have to take 19 more classes, and at the absolute latest, graduate December 2018 – this might not be so bad, as this extra time would allow me to seek out relevant graphic/ web design internships. I know someone who has had a paid graphic/web design internship for my local school district for about two years, and I’d kill to have that type of experience on my resume – although, such positions aren’t super uncommon. I feel that on several levels, this might be the riskiest investment, but there’s also a payoff at the end of it that might make it worth it.

*WEB DEVELOPMENT/PROGRAMMING: With this plan, I feel that I would just graduate as is, devote time to learning the craft, then relocate to whichever part of Texas would take me.

There’s an overarching question for each of these: Am I thinking pragmatically enough? I think I have the same preferences as other people my age: good work/life balance and adequate/more than adequate pay for what I do, benefits- each path has its own in terms of attaining jobs, some more difficult than others. I'd be very appreciative to hear honest suggestions on what I could do."

Just a couple of questions I have:

1. Am I spending too much space talking about my two internships? I didn't really do all that much during either. Would it help more to have an extra line or two to talk more about my current job?

2. Is there too little in the skills section? I've read this section should be reserved for hard skills, but I don't have all that much to put in the way of hard skills. For example, the only computer skill I have is MS Office.

Thanks for your time!"
5mo0ph,2,2017-01-07,How to explain wrongful termination in application/interview?,Ultra16,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5mo0ph/how_to_explain_wrongful_termination_in/,"I have posted about this before. Basically, I was terminated from my first professional job 2 months ago due to being framed and then thrown under the bus. 

I took a 1-year paid internship (no benefits) at a big company to get my foot in the door, but my sociopathic supervisor would make me work off the clock and violate some **very** serious animal care rules (that could have everyone in the lab's privilege to work with animals taken away if discovered). She was also very unprofessional, disrespectful, emotionally abusive (would yell and throw tantrums for petty things, put employees against each other and humiliate them, gaslight me to avoid admitting faults, etc.), and immature. For these reasons she has a very high turnover rate but still somehow has a job there. 

After 9 months of internship, I was looking for other jobs within the company but other supervisors were afraid of taking me from her. My supervisor officially hired me, and I only accepted out of necessity (working off the clock keeps you poor), fear, and for the healthcare benefits. 

*This is where things get bad.* After 2 employees under my supervisor resigned one after the other and reported her to the department manager (also female), I decided to speak up. 

It didn't go well. 
The dept manager originally seemed receptive to my complaints, but then sent me a letter with ""performance issues my supervisor has documented and I must fix immediately."" I knew this was my supervisor's method of retaliation, since the issues were all systematic but blamed only on me. I replied stating this and forwarded it to HR, so my supervisor started bombarding me with emails of similar errors and making them seem like they were only my fault, then forwarding them to the department manager. More errors started to happen as my supervisor got my only coworker (who would also be at least partially responsible for these errors and violations) to also deny all claims by me. HR claimed that the clock punch photos only proved I worked off the clock and not that she made me do it (???). The manager then said I had not improved my performance and fired me for ""performance deficiencies on probationary period.""

*How do I explain this when applying to new jobs? The fake documentation makes me seem pretty bad in case any new employers contact my old one, so I'm trying to figure out if I should even keep these jobs on the application/resume.* **Should I only put the internship?**

**TL;DR: I got fired from my first job after college due to being framed and thrown under the bus, so I need help on what to say in application/interview.**

At the same time I started an online Post Baccalaureate at Oregon State University where I took: 


+Two intro classes 


+Computer Architecture 


+Data Structures 


+Operating Systems


&amp;nbsp;



After completing these classes I enrolled in Georgia Tech's OMSCS program, where I have only taken Knowledge Based Artificial Intelligence.    


&amp;nbsp;


    

My question is about the best way to transition to a job as a Software Developer. Unfortunately, I don't have any work experience as a software developer. I use SQL at my job, but it is pretty basic. Since, I don't have much experience I want to know would it be better to apply to internships? I think internships could make it easier for me to get my foot in the door, but at the same time I would be leaving a well paying ($29 an hr) full time job with benefits. The biggest concern here is that after an internship ended I might not have a job. How common is it for companies to extend full time offers immediately following an internship?     

&amp;nbsp;


Ideally I would prefer to look for full time jobs,but I realize that I don't have much experience, and one purpose of internships is to provide learning opportunities for the interns. Would a company have a problem with someone with unrelated work experience applying for an internship?     
      
&amp;nbsp;

  
    
If this changes anything I was planning on applying for jobs (internships) in around 6-7 months after taking a few more classes. I would rather focus my time now on learning, and building a side project in order to have more successful interviews in the future. On the other hand, the quicker I get into a CS job or internship the more I'll learn. At this point this is probably extraneous, but my undergrad was in Mathematics (pure). In any case, I'm here because I'm not sure of the best approach, so any guidance, personal experience, stories, or opinions are all welcome. Thanks all!

&amp;nbsp;



tl;dr I am entering my second semester in GA Tech's OMSCS program, and work full time (1.5 years so far, pretty good job). What's the best way to transition to a CS career (internship or full-time job, and when should I start looking)?

* American in Scandinavia because wife has a good job here. 
* Have the equivalent of a Green Card 
* I am 28, work part time as a bartender
* My first bachelors is in Urban Planning from the US. 
* Have not really tried to get related work/don't think it'll lead to worthwhile related work here.
* Just bought our first home here with good terms and I can afford my half of the mortgage just working part time. 
* Nearing 100% fluency in local language (been here three years)
* Only prior tech experience I can point to is a position I had before moving abroad writing R data-cleaning scripts for a transportation agency. (Paid Internship)

I took a couple Bachelor's programming courses at university (Intro to OOP &amp; Numeric Computing) this past Fall out of curiosity and loved them and the tech department itself. Got upper percentile exam results on both. This Spring I've elected to take System Architecture 1, and the followup to Intro to OOP. 

Now I'm considering applying for a full time bachelors in CS for the Fall (here it would be a Bachelors of Programming and System Architecture). 

The structure of this bachelor's (3 year program) has one semester of fully open personal project studio development, and another semester of free subject choices. And because I will have taken 2 or 3 of the degree's requisite courses on my own beforehand, I'll have even more open credits to take what I want - or maybe just finish early. 

**Most importantly:** Because of my visa status and because this is Northern Europe: if I'm accepted to a bachelors in the Fall I'll be awarded some living expense stipends and probably be able to bartend just once or twice a week each semester. 

Along the way I very much plan to publish my smaller project work online and keep myself looking shiny. 

The situation is pretty good as far as career turnarounds go, but I worry about some pitfalls ahead I don't see now. 

I worry also that by the time I'm finished (at age ~30) I'll be kind of old for that first Junior Dev position. I ask here because *maybe* someone has happened to have a similar experience (maybe even abroad as a married expat?) 

Also, besides the usual *git gud* advice, what are some productive ideas for personal network building/friendmaking at meetups?  "
5msb7o,12,2017-01-08,Want to expand my own knowledge and credentials as a current IT student outside of school,ongstrong,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5msb7o/want_to_expand_my_own_knowledge_and_credentials/,"Hi /r/ITCareerQuestions,

I'm currently a sophomore majoring in IT with a concentration/focus on Networking &amp; Security. I was fortunate enough to have hard-working parents that took it upon themselves to take on second jobs and ask me, personally, to quit my part-time retail job to focus more on school. I was in shock as they presented this to me as they haven't even asked for my opinion before deciding on the second jobs. My grades weren't that bad, as I was sitting around as mostly a B-student while working, but I do definitely believe that my part-time job affected my grades, and now I'm determined to make myself an A-student again. Anyways, shortening this, my last day on the job was this past week and now I have a bunch of free time until the next semester starts and I'll have more time off during the semester. My goal is to hopefully land an internship for the Summer (although it is a bit late, and I do realize I don't really qualify for most of them yet), but if not work another part-time job while working on my own self-development.

Anyways, my question to you /r/ITCareerQuestions, is **what can I do in my free time to expand myself as an IT student?**

I've updated my resume a bit as well with my Linkedin profile, although they aren't the best. As for my school, I haven't actually learned that much related to Networking &amp; Security because of pre-req classes that I did not finish up until last semester, so at the start of next semester I begin my first few classes relating to the concentration. So far into my IT degree I have only learned how to use programming languages such as: HTML, CSS (a bit), Java, and Python (a bit). This past semester I also learned how to use database management languages such as MySQL and Adobe software such as Dreamweaver, Photoshop, and Flash. That aside, I don't really have anything else besides my retail work experience. 

So, back to my question, any advice on what can I do to expand myself and increase my self-development? I read through the Wiki, some FAQs, and other threads but as far as I know, self-development plays a huge role(?) to where I stand right now. Should I be working on getting certifications, keep applying for internships, or just wait and focus on school for another semester? I'm aware that I live in an area that has a high demand for IT/CompSci majors (DMV) and I want to take advantage of that."
5msfsu,6,2017-01-08,Career path for the reluctant generalist? [20/college student],sphades,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/5msfsu/career_path_for_the_reluctant_generalist/,"The essence of my dilemma is that I'm in love with everything. I entered college thinking I wanted to be a rocket scientist and began carving out a path in physics. I told myself physics was my life: I would watch Feynman videos in my free time, go to all the visiting lecturer talks, slave away at problem sets, you name it. Perhaps all of this stubbornness was due to the fact that everyone in high school was so impressed by my writing that they just assumed I was going to be an english major, and I wanted to prove them wrong by choosing the 'hardest thing possible'. Perhaps it was also partly motivated by the fact that my parents never went to college and I felt like I had to get the most out of it for their sakes; and I was also partly giving the middle finger to gender stereotypes because I'm a girl. I'm a stubborn kid, but back then my hard-headedness was coming from the wrong places.

Nevertheless I was a fantastically mediocre physics student in college and GPA stress was getting to me. (quick aside: I'm at a top 10 US university on a full ride, so I was also beating myself up for doing badly) The thrill of understanding physical concepts slowly gave way to a sense of detachment and confusion with mathematics, and I didn't reach out for help (again, I'm not defending myself here: I was just incredibly stubborn and thought asking for help was weak or something.) 

Anyway, I sat myself down at the end of my first year and realized I wasn't happy. Almost at the same time - by some gigantic stroke of luck - I managed to land an internship at a NASA subcontractor. So of course I thought, *well, if I'm not convinced after this, there's no point*. The internship proved enlightening and although I was grateful for the opportunity, this was my final nail in the coffin for research science: it just wasn't for me.

Meanwhile, I had dabbled in a couple of English courses my first year and got tremendous support from the department. I loved it there. Needless to say on the very first day of my sophomore year I declared English (alongside German - that had been a thing from day one though.) In my second year I took some upper level physics courses alongside english and german and while I was still rather mediocre, I found myself enjoying science again, probably because I could learn without the stress of being a major in the subject.

Now I'm 20 and in my third year (abroad in Germany). I'm very happy with my studies, but my future concerns me because I know that I want to operate in the nexus of the sciences and the humanities: I can't live without both of them at the same time. What exactly does that look like? I've considered data analysis, even the CIA. I love foreign languages, programming, computation, but I think above all I love the challenge of receiving new information, connecting the dots, and drawing valuable implications from data. Research excites me (it's academia that didn't: and that's probably what turned me off to research science). My skills can go in a lot of directions and this just muddles my view of the big picture more than anything.
Thanks in advance.

Fast-forward to today and I've been working in the marketing industry for almost 4 years counting internships, with 3 in analytics. I'm more financially secure than I've ever been in my life, have potential for income growth if I'm willing to jump agencies and put up with crazy hours and even crazier clients, but I'm not happy.

And I'm starting to realize that's probably the most important thing in life: *being happy.*

To give you all some background:

I switched companies about 8 months ago and realized I still don't like the work I do (in fact I like it *less*), and dread the chaotic, client-whim driven environment that makes it so I can only commit to work. Even worse, it's wrecking havoc on my health. Experience and chats with veterans in the industry tell me I'll find many of the same frustrations everywhere and that the work remains the same repetitive and tedious reporting at it's core regardless of level.

That said, I haven't hated all parts of my career so far. I liked learning how different parts of the business relate to each other, and I took surprisingly well to SQL. In my new role (which doesn't use SQL), I've started learning R and Python on my own to try and deal with the issue of  *“Excel can't read billions of rows of data”* and *“everything takes too much time”.*

Ultimately, I want to do work that is more meaningful, more creative, and more people-oriented. I need something that still is intellectually challenging, but which can give me the same sense of pride and accomplishment as finishing a story or teaching others. Some soul-searching tells me I'd probably do well in academia, though the questions of what to study, employ-ability, and financial sustainability remain. I also don't want to limit myself or discount something I might enjoy for sheer ignorance.

That said, here are some details about my needs, skills, and interests then the floor is all yours! 

**Work/Life:** I've been most comfortable in small business type cultures that encourage open communication and collaboration. Flex-schedules and unlimited vacation would be awesome, but I'd be happy with a stable schedule, 8-5 with rare “long days”. For health reasons, I should avoid stress and can't do things like skip meals or sleep, drinking, and spending over 4-6 hours at a time on a computer. As a morning-person, evening and night schedules aren't very productive for me.

**Technical Skills**: SQL (building ETLs, queries, and functions), MS Suite, various industry programs, R (basic; while loops, simple calculations), Python (super novice, read this file, save it there), Photoshop, Illustrator (mostly font and vector creation), HTML &amp; CSS (enough to edit some web design elements and content)


**Most Liked  Subjects (in order of interest):** English/Literature, Art &amp; Art History, Psychology, Marketing Theory, Economics, Philosophy, Sciences (especially Chemistry &amp; Biology)

**Least Liked Subjects:** Math (I liked Algebra most), Finance

As long it's a good fit, I'm willing to get a Masters or a Phd if the career requires it, and I'm willing to deal with less income if it means more happiness (though I wouldn't mind 6-figures!).

Thank you everyone and please forgive the mini-rant. "
5mu6ue,11,2017-01-08,A few questions!,D1rty0n3,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/5mu6ue/a_few_questions/,"Hello EE guys and gals.  I'm new to this subreddit.  I've got a couple questions to shoot off to you all if you aren't too busy.  

First things first.  About me. I'm medically retiring from the Navy after 9 years.   Before joining the Navy I went to Remington College for ECET and got an Associates.  

While in the navy I did computer networking, and some electrical (Aegis FC of the Aegis Computer Networking Tech variety).  Based on this I'm looking to go back to school for EE at IUPUI in Indianapolis, IN.  They have a program with Purdue so I figured it's a good college to go to.  

Based off of this here are a few of the questions I have.

1.  Internships.  How easy are they to get?  I'm not really worried to much on getting paid for them it's alot more important for me to get practical experience.  

2.  Should I apply for an internship while in my Freshman year since I have experience in the field?

I have googled a bit on internships and such, but I wanted to get the word from people that have been there and done that so to speak.  

3.  It's been about 10 years since I've been in college.  Are there any recommended sites to ""brush up"" on theory/math?  It's actually been so long that I barely remember what kind of math to brush up on other than algebra, trig, calc, and such...  

Anyhow I'm glad to be here, and looking forward to hearing from you all.  Thanks!"

I'm going through my second internship (most likely my last before graduating) and the experiences have not been too great at either. Both are at large companies (not household names). I should mention I'm very grateful for these opportunities (it's nice to finally make money).

I've been doing a lot of busy work and not really learning much after the first few weeks I couldn't have learned over a few weekends (working in a large team was new but I got used to that quickly). Someone has to do it and obviously it's a good idea to offload that work to the cheaper intern (I'm not underpaid). I mostly work alone and hardly speak to anyone which is getting sad. I don't find there's much in the way of guidance (in becoming a better programmer, or even just a professional) and communication is a bit strained. I don't have anything to do a lot of the time though I ask for work - I end up with a lot of QA stuff.

I went for CS because I loved programming, and I thought programmers did interesting things. I don't find reading poor documentation of heavyweight frameworks and stitching them together interesting - I'm sure some others might (maybe from seeing the end result, etc.). I get excited at the thought of having to use the debugger on existing code just because I don't seem to do anything more engaging. I've enjoyed the degree mostly but not my real world experience.

I've done work at these internships, but it's so insignificant I'm actually really embarrassed that I have nothing to show for it. Do I expect too much from myself?

Work is work at the end of the day, but then why would I prefer this to unskilled work (prospects and security for developers don't seem too great here)?

Will I be stuck doing the same thing for the rest of my career?

Are my expectations unrealistic?

Will I go through the same song and dance as my internships (boredom) when I start full time work?

That was really ranty and disjointed, but in short I just want an answer to the title given the context of the unreadable body. Thanks :)"

[19 F] and pretty hesitant to continue my life the way it is. I just kind of need some practical advice about where to go next from here. 

None of my family has gone to college, much less graduated high school, so it's hard to imagine myself continuing college all the way through. Especially considering how touch-and-go I feel about majoring in computer science (despite having at least SOME passion for this most of my life). 

I'm two years in now, but it's been a rough time already. I dropped out the second week freshman year, took that semester off, went to a community college, and now I'm back at the state university this year. I just completed my fall semester and I did okay - I think I'm sitting at like a 3.45 right now. However, not exactly psyched about the college I'm going to - I've wanted to transfer since I was accepted there. Probably wasn't a smart idea to even go in the first place.. 

Reason I don't like this college: 
-It's far away from all the internships I've held (which pay actual money, $15/hr - pretty good in my book). If I transferred back locally, I could work and do school at the same time.

-The school isn't good for what I want to do, really, and there's no opportunities in the surrounding community.

Options I see for myself: 
-Drop out of college and just stop trying to convince myself it's necessary. 

-Transfer next year, get an internship, continue hating myself for just two or three more years.. end up unsatisfied anyways. 

-Blahwgafjgsdf I don't know, continue making mistakes because I'm anxious and have no idea what to do next?

Any thoughts would be appreciated.. I don't really have any more at this point.

My thing with CS right now, is that although I've completed a few courses, I am still wildly un-polished and inexperienced/unknowledgeable on a lot of the stuff. I'm far from like a CS prodigy as some of my peers are. So my issue is that a. I'm not sure of whether I'd get into any CS internships b. even if I do, whether I'd be equipped to handle the work. Now besides being a student, I'm also an aspiring musician and will be looking to network around my city and gain valuable relationships, which doing an internship in something related to the music industry would help with. Getting an internship in the music industry wouldn't be as difficult and hard to do as something for CS, so I was thinking I'd do a Music internship this summer, then do CS internships my next 2 summers after I have more experience coding and working on projects, as well as more knowledge of CS from different courses.

My question is, would this be prudent/smart? And what would you recommend I do?"

I do have a SWE internship for the summer, so this would be part-time during the semesters. Thanks friends!"
5mw13p,6,2017-01-09,Advice on how to utilize a connection at Wells Fargo. Should I do retail banking?,djrainbowpixie,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5mw13p/advice_on_how_to_utilize_a_connection_at_wells/,"Hello,


I am a recent graduate of a non target school, with a Master's degree in Finance. My work experience consists of the following: Accounting internship, Operations Coordinator, and Treasurer. (I realize that most of my experience is accounting related but I want a job that's in finance.)


Recently my father meet the Assistant VP of the Wells Fargo banks in my region. My father told him that his daughter (me) was a recent graduate looking for a job and the ""banker"" gave him his card and told me to contact him.


I did and the banker is very helpful. He forwarded my information to the District Manager and he also gave me a list of few jobs to apply to. All of the jobs are in retail though. Most of them require sales experience, which I don't have. I took an assessment test for a personal banker position but it kicked me out during the preliminary question stage because I checked ""no"" when asked if I had previous sales experience. He is now telling me to apply for lower positions that don't have assessment tests, so I can avoid the sales experience requirement.


I've realized quickly that I'm not interested in the roles he is telling me to apply for. I don't mind starting at a low position if I can move my way up but I know for a fact that sales objectives are going to stress me out and drain me. 


We plan to have a phone call sometime this week. I figured that the best thing to do is to just apply to the jobs he tells me to and see what happens. But I would like a job in corporate, not retail. My dream job at the moment is to be a Financial Analyst.


How can I tell him this without coming off as not being appreciative? How can I utilize this connection if I DON'T want to work in retail? Should I just suck it up and do retail and get promoted afterwards?


Thank you!"

I've been noticeably depressed for about half my life now, and suicide has always been something I've wanted but never bad enough to ignore the consequences.

I don't think I need help but that's a lie. I'm making a post here to prove that to myself. The past day or two, instead of thinking about suicide, I've been thinking about calling one of those lines that never made sense to me. ""If I'm at risk of suicide, it's going to be because I've decided that it's absolutely what I want, and if there is a moment to change my mind and call for help, I'd instead just change my mind and walk away.""

I'm 20, starting classes again tomorrow morning, 8:00, haven't been able to prepare anything. I might have enough folders brought with me, dunno what textbooks I need. It's 2:00. Past month I've been staying up all night til around 5:00 and sleeping as much as 13 hours. Lost my internship job I'm expected to maintain whenever I'm not at school, gave me a long break to train horrible sleeping habits all in preparation for ruining today.

I already asked my Mom to help set up a doctor's appointment to get help with depression. I was really resistant to getting help at first. I flaunt the reason as being that I don't have the time or money, constantly busy with school and work, moving between states every few months. I think the biggest reason I didn't want to is because when I was much younger, not quite as early as 10 but in middle school and occasionally after, I would ask to seek help and get a diagnosis and see what could be done, and I was told I was too yound for medication and would be forced to attend weekly, time consuming, early morning therapy sessions that ""didn't help my sister any."" Things haven't really changed, and now I've got a decade of experience dealing with it. If help wasn't important then, why would it be now?

I have a tendency to delete these types of outbursts before sending them, but I'll just take this one down in the morning if I remember or have time before class.

ADHD is something I was never officially diagnosed with, but for my entire life it has been something that I clearly struggled with.


My mom admitted to suspecting me to have ADHD as a child, but never brought it up to my doctor out of fear that my dad and his side of the family would be angry with her.  (ADHD is clearly prominent on my father's side of the family, but they deny it).


This past semester of my junior year of college, I struggled greatly with my ADHD and depression after some difficult personal trauma.  I was a great student, always working extremely hard to get As and Bs in school.  For the first time ever I was faced with nearly receiving no credit in one of my courses, and poor grades in the others due to my lack of motivation and focus through the entire semester.  Normally my ADHD will cause me to have spurts of times where I cannot concentrate, but coupled with the depression, I was like this for an extended period of time

By the very end of the semester I was finally beginning to come out of the rut I was in.  I was contemplating reaching out to a doctor and requesting medication.  I decided to just relax and enjoy the holidays and figure everything out after New Years.

After New Years, things started to click again.  Instead of sitting around unable to get myself to do anything productive, or focus on anything, I started doing things small steps at a time.  


In two days I was able to put together my resume, which I had been putting off doing the entire break.  After that point I was on a roll; I completed my cover letter and applied for four summer internships the next day.  Today I completed all of the tasks I needed to for my Resident Assistant job back at school, so now I am completely prepared for the new semester.


This is the most productive I have been in four months.  I think I am finally coming out of the rut I was in, and I am going to begin to develop a plan of attack for the coming semester for how I need to deal with my ADHD.  For all of you stuck, you can do it!  And for all of you not stuck right now, tell me your tips and tricks for coping!"

This was my second degree, and I pushed to get through my program as quickly as possible to minimize my student loans. My GPA was decent (3.6), and I published and presented a research paper at an IEEE conference. However, I failed to land an internship during my only summer in school because I started applying too late.

I'm now having a difficult time getting past HR for interviews. I had some friends from school help me to revamp my resume, but I haven't gotten so much as a phone interview since graduating.

Outside of school, I've been developing in Java SE and Python in a Linux environment. I'm brushing up on my DS&amp;A skills by working through CLRS, doing problems on Leetcode, and working as a grader for undergraduate DS&amp;A course. I wrote a basic web app using LAMP, and am going through the Django tutorial. I designed and implemented a Java library to support my research project and plan to write a second research paper this month with my research adviser.

I'm trying to get a better idea of what I should be expecting, and I have some pretty specific goals. I wanted to post here to get advice, opinions, and just to get an idea if what I want to do is realistic. This post will probably get pretty long.

I'm a 26 year old who graduated with a Computer Science &amp; Engineering degree (but with a sub-par GPA) from a well respected state school (Uconn). After graduating I got a job in the insurance industry doing database work, mostly SQL dev with some .Net thrown in occasionally. I've been doing this for 3 years now, not counting my 2 summer internships. The work is fairly uninteresting, the company is huge and super conservative so there's not much innovation, especially on the tech side of things, and 95% of my coworkers at over 40. It's not great, but not terrible either. I don't need to be on the bleeding edge, working in some super fast-pace corner of the tech world. In fact, I don't really want that.

I've always wanted to work on Android, and I've always wanted to live in New York City. I want to work with other smart, young people, doing interesting stuff. But I don't want to work 80 hours a week in a cut-throat, fast pace, high-stress environment. Currently I'm living in Hartford on a lease that ends in September, so that's most likely when I'll be looking to make the move. I've dabbled in Android development before, I took a Coursera course a while back on Android dev, and I'm currently finishing up Udacity's ""Developing Android Apps"" course. After that I plan on working on my own little side projects to build up some sort of portfolio. Hopefully I can get something into the app store by around summer time. Even if it's something super simple that's been done a hundred times before. So I'm working on this stuff on the side and trying to become more consistent at doing so. I've always kept up with the industry, and Android dev scenes so I kinda know what's up. I just need to put that into practice. Though it can be tough with a full-time job. I want to be able to put all my effort into Android, but it really isn't an option for me to do that unless it is my day job.

Anyways, what I really want to ask is this... Is is realistic for me to expect to find a job as a beginner Android dev that meets the following criteria:

* Make a comfortable living by NYC standards ($80k-ish)
* Be able to learn and be mentored on the job
* Work at a larger company as part of a large-ish team (I'm someone who appreciates a fair amount of job security and not being the sole person responsible for something)
* Is a full-time position, not on a contract basis

Thank you for you input."

I have two years post college experience at a Fortune 100 company doing Java/C# programming (was promoted during this time as well). I also have two internships prior to this.

I have, 1.5 years ago, decided to make a career change that has unfortunately not worked out (I am in the military as a pilot; but was recently found Not Physically Qualified anymore to train). 

I am in my mid-late twenties and was wondering if I will be able to make any sort of return to the field? I was making just north of 100k prior and would like to return to something similar, however I am looking at some other threads on here and it seems that there is a lot of strife; lots of lower pay, inability to find work, etc.. and even if I do return I would be lucky to get any job let alone a decent paying one.

I still have a Linkedin but have not updated that I have been out of the industry for over a year now, so I do get recruiter emails etc. still., but if it were apparent I was out of the industry for so long I don't think it would be the case.

I will be making a big decision here soon (whether I should push for separation and hopefully a civilian programming career, or stay in the military in a different job), and am just trying to get a gauge on what my options are.

Thank you kindly."

My original plan was grad school in math but I'm realizing I'm not cut out for that and that I'd like to try to get into software engineering. My background:

* Some relevant coursework: Discrete Math, Intro Java, Computer Modelling in Matlab (Monte Carlo methods, numerical methods), I'm taking computability theory this spring and possibly a course on data structures or aritificial intelligence (class availability isn't great, still up in the air).
* Hobby projects: Wrote a program in Python that parsed wikipedia into a graph and ran breadth-first search to find shortest click path between articles (won a prize for it), worked through NAND to Tetris, wrote a Pong game for an Arduino that displayed to a little LCD
* Some relevant work projects: Designed and created an interim inventory management system with Excel and SQL, did some CMS work on our e-commerce back end and a (very) small amount of javascript to automate some tedious tasks. It was also technically a management position so I can check the leadership box

I know I'm really far from the ideal candidate but I'm hoping my location (the Bay Area) and the reputation of Berkeley should make up for it and at least get me an internship somewhere as I'm going to need experience to compensate for the lack of a CS degree.. My GPA is okay but not great (~3.6). I've applied to around 10 or so places and got firm 'no's from all of them. I realize it's a numbers game but I'd really like to be realistic and not waste my time if it's not going to happen this summer.

I found a nice position that plenty of other students who had worked there said was a fantastic company to work for. 

So after buying my first suit, interviewing with them here at school, and then driving to their location 3 hours away for a second interview, I found out I got the internship! I was excited, especially since I had heard it was a competitive position that offered great pay(at least in my college student eyes). 

I filled out there online application, and signed a digital signature thinking everything was good to go. Then, for a month...silence. I thought it was odd I didn't hear back from them, and I was going to send an email, making sure everything was fine. Before I did though, a generic email came saying they had reviewed many candidates, and had decided to go with some else. 

Obviously, I was confused and assumed I had to have read the previous emails wrong, and that I thought I had gotten the position when I actually hadn't. To be sure, I had a couple of friends read over the earlier correspondence emails with me. 

I had indeed gotten the position but, what I had thought was just a brief synopsis/summary describing benefits/pay of the position (that was attached to the email with the link to the online application) was actually a letter that I was supposed to hand sign, and mail in confirming my acceptance of the position. The only thing that made that clear was the very last line of it saying to do so. (I know what you are thinking, ""You should have read all of it carefully!"", and you are correct, but it honestly wasn't obvious at all, and In my excitement I didn't notice.)

Now, I am sitting here very frustrated, but I am going to make it into a learning experience as best I can. 

TL;DR: Didn't confirm with company that I wanted an internship position. Shockingly(/s), I did not get it. "

It's been a while since I posted here. I have recently been hired by a very popular entertainment/software company on the west coast as a desktop technician; I have already been working there as an intern. It's very exciting to be working with an IT department that strives to use new technologies wherever possible and constantly evaluates its processes to determine where more effectiveness can be had. However, not all of these evaluations could possibly be effective...

This morning I had enough time to clock in and picture the warm cup of coffee that I was about to acquire and consume before a frantic $user1 approached me. She had left for maternity leave months ago and returned to find that Windows lost its trust relationship with the domain. Easy enough, I just needed to have her log in with cached credentials and I could rebind it from there.

But wait, why don't I log in with our local administrator account included with our images? Last year, our local admin account was deactivated on every machine due to ""security concerns"". After the resulting uproar from the technicians had settled, a new system was put in place that reactivated the local admin account and gave it a randomly generated password. This password is different for every machine and is regenerated periodically or when a machine rebinds to the domain. Of course, if a machine was online when the account was deactivated but not when it was reactivated, there is no way to access the local admin account at all.

Hold on, *users* have local admin rights on their machines? Yes, across the entire company. This is surprisingly one of the least problematic policies we follow. Looking up the randomly generated passwords for the local admin accounts takes more time than us techs would like to spend on a domain rebinding, so 99% of the time we'll rebind on the user's account.

I followed $user1 to her desk and was greeted by a Windows login screen displaying a username different from her own. During her absence, another $user2 logged into her machine and now her cached credentials are gone.

I logged into the system that stores the randomly generated local admin passwords and was unable to locate the PC. I tried the original local admin password we used before this system existed and it didn't work. $user1's PC must have been online during deactivation and offline during reactivation.

I tried to contact $user2 only to discover that they are on an extended leave of absence and will not be around for quite some time.

At this point, our ""security measures"" have left this machine unusable. We have no way of rebinding it to the domain. I'll have to drop $user1's drives into a dock, have her copy the data to a network location, and reimage the machine.

Welcome back, $user1!"

I would love to get an internship on ARM next year so I'm about to start preparing. In general, the qualifications for those internships are knowledge on ARM assembly and ARM architecture.

I have already taken a Digital Systems Design course, as well as a Computer Architecture course. Now I think I have good knowledge of digital systems, Verilog and general computer organization. I also had a microcontrollers course where we used a chip with an ARM M-core and we had some insights on the internal organization of the core, but not in much deep. 

However, my Computer Architecture class was focused on MIPS architecture and I surprised that there are not that much resources for learning ARM as there are for MIPS. I find most of the official documentation rather oriented to those who already have some knowledge of the internal organization. 

Should I be looking for other type or resources or trying to figure out those manuals?

Additionally, what type of personal projects should I highlight/do? Related to hardware, I have done a couple FPGA projects, a MIPS processor implementation, all of them were class projects. Perhaps coding a simple RTOS for a microcontroller?"

I haven't interviewed in a couple years, and when I did interview previously I didn't do much of it. Got an offer from an internship that I had out here. Got my BS CS and MS CS from a top ranked CS school. Have done well at my current job and have a good resume.

I've been cranking on leetcode for awhile now. I'm up to 170 problems solved where I wrote the solution myself and about another 50ish where I reviewed the problem and was confident I knew how to solve it but didn't write the code. I've gotten to the point where I feel confident about being able to solve easy and medium problems during interviews.  I've also done review for other types of questions besides algorithm ones.

However, I am a lot less confident about hard problems on leetcode. I'd say I feel confident about only a third of the ones I see. The rest I struggle with and make some progress, but I will often either take way too long solving it or have to look at the solution. How often do people see hard problems during interviews and how well do you have to do on them? Should I be prepping more?

I'm planning to do interviews in waves so that if the first wave goes too poorly I can take more time off to practice, but it is a bit punishing to be working my job and then going home to solve problems on leetcode then spending the weekend solving problems on leetcode.

Some of the companies that I will be interviewing at: airbnb, google, facebook, uber, linkedin, yelp, stripe, twilio, dropbox (for people who have interviewed at these places and have a general idea)."

I'm 18 and had written off web development as something I hate for a long time, as my boss I've had for about a year now had me using wordpress to do everything and I had no clue what the world of web development was about.

Over winter break, while I was home from college, someone I did an internship for a year back wanted to hire me back and have me do web development for just two weeks, since he needed a simple site made. Well, he had me do it from scratch, and I didn't realize how fun and satisfying actually creating a website was from scratch, writing all the php, css, and html myself, setting up the databases, making all the interlocking parts work in harmony to do what I want them to do. 

I just had the best day of work in my life, in which eight and a half hours absolutely flew by and I was so intensely absorbed with what I was doing. I love doing the actual programming behind the sites, I love the feeling of learning as I work, I love troubleshooting the weird bugs (had a fatal error in one of my sql queries because the apostrophe's in one of the variables that sometimes would be there messed up the quotes and made everything shut down. Oh well. More fun learning for tomorrow!) and I just feel excited to go to work for the first time since I started working a few years ago.

ANYTHING?!,CallMeShiibbyy,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5n4kiz/data_web_app_launched_but_struggling_to_gain/,"Hello all! I come to you today on behalf of a company I am working with that works on internal projects that aim to solve real issues within the world. We are pretty new to this (one year old) and, whilst we have helped others build their products (so we can fund our own) we have never needed to help after the product is built, except for updates or maintenance.

Anyway. Our First product is [Conseris.io](http://conseris.io/). It is a data collection/analysing tool that can be used in a variety of ways by a  variety of companies/people.

It allows users to do everything needed from create input forms/fields, collect the data (or import data) view and analyse data using a large variety of algorithms then even take this data and construct it in a way to present to others.

You can collaborate in real time with any size team, it is free (for basic uses) and cheap compared to competitors (who most seem to be stuck in the early 2000s). 

The ideal situation we see this would be hugely beneficial of when a disaster strikes. It would allow a team to use ipads, laptops or mobiles to go into the field, collect data on injuries, issues in the area, etc. Then real time send this back to HQ and they can quickly analyse and discover pain points and figure a solution.

We are also looking to incorporate a marketplace which will allows those who have the means to collect data easily are able to sell (or share for free, in some cases) their data to those who dont have access. A good example of this is, a local study could be under-taken to gather shopping habits of shoppers within certain stores. This could then be sold to small clothing stores that dont have the money to conduct their own research but still want to see what is trending right now, what their shoppers want, age range, etc etc.

Really, there is no limit to how this can currently be used, and we only hope to expand it further.

So, here is my question. How the heck do we get those first few thousand people to try out our service? We have a small team designers and developers as well as marketing interns and an SEO guy. But still we are a little stuck.

Currently, we have;
- Basic social media presence (but finding trouble building/engaging an audience)
- Blog posts about uses of Conseris etc
- Looking for local places to talk/mingle with data scientists.
- Re-building our website to be more focused on what we do, at the moment it is not very clear.

Any tips/advice on how we could get this app in front of the right people? 

Any questions are welcome, hopefully I can go back to the team with a bunch of suggestions and we cant try everything."

A bit about me. I'm female, 20 years old. I attend university. I have a boyfriend. By all accounts, you'd think I was the stereotypical pretty party girl. I always try and be the happiest person in the room. But inside, I think I'm broken. I'm a horrible, selfish human being - I don't think I even deserve to be alive.

It all started when I fell in love with my boyfriend's friend, two years ago. He's such a cool guy, and he makes me happy to talk to. But at the same time, it's so bittersweet. We'll be leaving university in June, so I'll probably never see him again. He'd never like me like that anyway. Plus just his existence makes me feel like shit, because what kind of god awful human being falls in love with their partner's friend? Me, that's who.

Wait - it gets better. I'm so god damn awful that I can't even break up with my amazing, loving boyfriend, because my only 'friends' are all his friends. And if we broke up, and if I was forced to sit for days by myself and actually examine my life, I don't think I'd last the month. I don't think I'll last the year, to be honest. 

Everyone looks at me and says, 'Oh, you don't need to worry - you'll be successful no matter what you do!' Will I? I've been rejected from every graduate scheme, every internship I applied. Endless tears, endless rejection emails. How am I meant to get a job with no experience, no connections? How am I meant to get experience when I can't even get any damn experience?! I look at my friends, with their secured jobs and great internships and I weep for the failure I've become. It wasn't meant to be like this. My future was supposed to be bright. That's what they told me.

Even this post is awful. And you know what? I sound like a whiny, ungrateful little slut because that's what I am. I went to the funeral of an elderly relative recently, and someone worried that not enough people would turn up. In the end, about 60 did - but if I died, I'm pretty sure I could count on both hands the number of people that would attend and it wouldn't even reach 10. 

I am not religious, but I pray every night for some kind of help. Any help. I pray that I won't go to hell when I finally die. I try and fail, and I try and I fail, and I know I should carry on trying but sometimes it is so damn hard, and I pray again that maybe next time I could be stronger, I could stop being so damn weak. 

If nothing else happens to change my mind, I will probably kill myself a month or so before graduation by finding the tallest building in London and jumping off it. I am so empty.

There's tears pouring down my face right now. To everyone - I am sorry. I wish I knew what for.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kindness. I wish I met more people like you in my everyday life. "

On leave of absence May 2014—Nov 2016.

Despite all this I remain part of the ExCo of a programming-related Interest Group, and we frequently hold workshops and the largest student hackathons in our geographical region.

Right now I'm a little unsure and anxious about which foot to put forward to get myself going. I'm pretty late to the summer internship party too, and don't know how to position myself to explain the gap and lack of recent practice.

I'm looking for advice, both directly in respect to getting an internship, and in respect to getting my professional life back on track."
5n5sy1,4,2017-01-10,Possibility of getting out of helpdesk early?,HisDomePiece,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5n5sy1/possibility_of_getting_out_of_helpdesk_early/,"Hi all,

I'm a third-year information systems student and while I'm attempting to get into the industry, and I'm a little bit confused at how to pursue my goals. I'm confused because I'm not confident that a ""helpdesk intern"" will get me the right job.. If an IT student that wants to become a DBA, does that student still choose the helpdesk position, or does he/she look for a Junior DBA position? I've also seen from some posts that if a student wants to become a sysadmin or a network engineer, they also head through this process. As work in IT goes, many of us wear a number of different hats to accommodate the work we have, but how can funneling jobs in helpdesk reliably get a person a more specialized job position? 

I feel like I'm in a ""the grass is always greener on the other side"" kind of attitude right now. Helpdesk is something I'm interested in experiencing, but I previously had a software engineering internship, and I'm not sure if I can say helpdesk is on the same technical level; the experience itself is great to have, but I feel like I'm putting myself down in regards to technical experience.  

What are your thoughts on this?

I've had a hard time surviving my academic years due to my learning disability as it requires lot of time for me to learn things, university education is fast paced and I simply could not keep up. I have quite a lot of (W) withdrawals, (U) unsatisfactories on my transcript as a result. I graduated with below 3 gpa unfortunately. 

All this has seriously affected my self-confidence in my programming abilities and I don't see much confidence in myself anymore. 

The one problem that has always persisted is that I get bored with my work very easily. I have good interest in programming but somehow, I get bored with it and can't seem to maintain the consistency of effort as I would in the beginning. 

I am simply worried about my work performance, I can't withdraw anymore. One mistake and I am out, I will be judged constantly.

5n6gct,1,2017-01-10,Where do I go from here?,cinnister,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/5n6gct/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm 29, graduated from a non-target with a 3.44 GPA (not great, I know) with a Finance Degree. I took a job at a commercial cleaning company so I could work afternoons into nights and go to school during the day, so unfortunately I had no time for internships, groups or anything else. In my senior year, I started my own tiny cleaning company so I wouldn't have to work a full work week anymore. 

Wanting to get into FP&amp;A as an end goal, I figured getting a temp job would be a good way to make up for not having an internship in college or any experience at all, at least in the Finance world. My original plan was to look for an internship after college but so far that seems to be a long shot. 

After figuring out that I wanted to end up in FP&amp;A, and combing this sub for the past few weeks. I wanted to follow advice given to others and get my Excel level higher, along with learning VBA and SQL. Because of my business, I have time to sit at home and teach myself whatever I need to to be more attractive to employers. Here's my conundrum:

A recruiter set me up with an interview with Morgan Stanley as a temp for 2 roles: Operations support for settlement team, and for a position with Trading operations risk team.

So on one hand, I feel that should I get offered a job at Morgan Stanley, I should take it. I'm on the older side for an undergrad and need to make up time. At the very least it would look good on my resume. Though, I've heard working there as a temp can be a bit of a ""churn and burn"" situation, which could rob me of valuable time I could use to be learning stuff relevant to what I want to do.

So should I take the job at MS even if I end up hating it just to buff up my resume or should I use the cushion my business is giving me, get super acquainted with Excel, VBA, SQL and start studying for CFA level 1?

**TL;DR: Should I take MS job so I have something to put on my resume or teach myself skills and take CFA (level 1) to try to get into FP&amp;A on the entry level?**

Edit: Taking the name of my university out because of...a certain element in responses so far."

First off, yes we have a legit licence for every copy of Windows 10.

No, we don't have a deployment server.

I'm an intern at a mid-sized tech company and one of my tasks is to set up the notebooks for our new employees. Since the manual set-up of a notebook can take up several hours with all the updates I have to install and we since have a lot of new entries each month, this can take a pretty big chunk of my time.

Is there a way to do this more efficient?

Situation:

* The new notebooks come with a factory issued copy of Windows, OR I need to reset an older notebook with Windows already installed.

* Privacy settings during the installation need to be deactivated, Cortana and Windows Hello as well. Timezone, language and Keyboard layout needs to be changed.

* I have to install and configure several programs like Office 2016, Webbrowsers etc.

* I have to rename the notebook and join the domain.

* I need to set the option that the language settings are copied from the local admin account for each new domain user that logs in on the notebook.

You guys have any ideas how I can optimize this? I haven't been able to find anything useful on Google that fits my requirements...

Thanks for your help!"

My parents are very overbearing sometimes. They always ask me if I'm graduating on time, why my grades are ""slipping"" (from a 3.6 to a 3.5), where I'm going and with who, etc. They still don't believe that I'm suffering from ADHD, and have refused to let me see a doctor for medication so I'm going behind their back when I get back to campus. I think it's incredibly fucked up that I have to do this, but it is what it is. 

 For being 20 years old and out of state, you think they would back off a bit, for fucks sake I still have a curfew when I'm at home for break.

Each summer, they always fight with me about working internships. They don't want me to intern somewhere this summer because 'I need to be home' for one week in July to watch the pets when they go on vacation to the Bahamas. When I had an internship freshman year at NASA, they were mad that ""I was working too many hours"" and that I was needed around the house to watch my brother supposedly. He's 15, I think he can watch himself.... and last summer when I took summer classes, they refused to let me work part time because I also ""needed to watch my brother"" when literally all he did was play on the computer lol

This summer, I want to intern somewhere away from home to both gain more experience and cash (which I desperately need at this point; my bank account is running low). Especially since I'm in my junior year, I feel having another internship is crucial to me securing an entry-level job. They keep fighting with me saying that ""it's not going to happen"" and ""I need to be at home"" and ""you have your entire life to work, why start now"". I'm miserable at home, and I recently had a very rough semester personally so I just really want to branch out and work somewhere new and have a fresh change of pace. They didn't go to college, so they don't understand the importance of internships. They assume I'll just walk out with a job, but it's not that simple unfortunately.

Anyone else have to deal with overprotective parents, and how did you convince them to let you pursue your dreams? I'm embarrrassed that I even have to ask this. I feel like I'm 15, but I'm almost of legal drinking age. If they trust me to go out of state, why don't they trust me to go work in a different state for a summer?"

I have noise cancelling headphones and that helps, but I can't help but feel like i'm constantly being watched.  I have some anxiety but the open floor just really exacerbates it.  I really need my ""own space"" when I do coding, I just do.

I'm on the verge of quitting and looking for another job.  The thing is this job pays very well, whereever I go I'll likely make less, but i'm just stressed and miserable and thinking it's not worth it. (For reference, i'm making ~101k including sign on bonus).  

I accepted an offer before from Boeing for ~80, and cancelled after accepting because I thought the other opportunity was more for me. Now i'm regretting it, I respect Boeing as a company (unlike my current one) and I would of had my own office!! Not to mention, I feel like ""serving my country"" is more meaningful than what i'm currently doing.

What would you guys do?  With my anxiety in the open floor I feel like i'm not getting anything done.  I reached back out to Boeing, but after cancelling I'm not thinking they'll still want me.  I'm going to apply to lots of contractors in my area.  I want to find a new job before I quit, but at the same time if i'm so miserable everyday it may not be worth the money."

-

I am 31 years old, have been working very successfully in the food service industry for 9 years in nyc. I attended 3.5 semesters of a private major university (that is very far from where I now live) with decent grades but did not graduate. I was working on a double major in music and computer science.


What is the best path for me to a shift back to a career as a software engineer / developer? I am interested in working with back-end stuff, algorithms, data science in the context of a startup, less interested in web design, javascript, css, android/ios apps etc. Generally am looking to get back into a more intellectually fulfilling / stimulating career that scratches my inner engineering itch.


Should I go back and finish a bs or attend a bootcamp?  Can I find a way into an internship / first job?  Do companies ever hire non-students as interns?  How would I best communicate my odd circumstance?  Should I look for a masters program that doesn't have a specific bachelors requirement?

A little more background:

I remember a good deal of cs from school, have a working knowledge of python, c++, java, but am definitely out of practice. I was a pretty typical curious cs student, hacking random things in spare time, building servers / websites for fun, playing with old/outdated languages. I have a very dusty knowledge base of upper level math, algebra, calculus, discrete math. I can follow along with the math in basic cs algorithm tutorials.


I have an exemplary resume in the industry that I am in.  Non of it is relevant to work in computer science, but it is full of notable places and great accolades.


Good knowledge of types of algorithms, asymptotic notation, basic cs concepts. I have read around this sub a good amount, have looked at things like leet code, and can generally understand many of of the easy / medium problems. I am severely out of practice with all of it, but I can read along a solution in python and comprehend it with some googling.


I did one internship while in school, and one shortly afterwards. One was in IT for a small software company, and one was as a programmer working in C and unix shell scripts. Still have a working knowledge of bash, linux, c, etc.


I have built websites before, pretty good knowledge of css and html.


tldr: went to school for cs for 3.5 years, didn't graduate, became successful working in another industry. it's been 9 years since school and i want to get back to a cs career. can I fake my way in with what I remember from school?"

I was extremely desperate for money and was pretty much looking for any job in my field (IT, as a junior developer) that paid. I took a job at a small firm with no benefits but paid me $48,000 a year, with a guaranteed raise to $50,000 a year after 6 months. 

For the first month or 2, things were really great and I thought I found my dream job. But I noticed how employees at my company complained often about how my boss runs his business. I couldn't understand why people would be so quick to say how bad someone is at running their company and tried to avoid getting involved in it because I was new and not trying to get canned when I'm desperate for money. 

After month 3, I saw exactly what my co-workers were saying when it came to why they feel my boss can't run a business. I had watched my boss belittle my superior and cuss at a fellow co-worker. He brought up in a company meeting the discussion of another employee's employment and if we thought the employee should be fired. It's disturbing to see this and I finally decided that the best thing for me is to find other employment.

I have contacted numerous recruitment within the past 48 hours and filled out 20 job applications. I'm trying to keep the job hunt secret, but I feel so depressed knowing that it was so challenging to find the job I have and I ended up in such a bad spot. I blame myself for taking a job for nothing other than money and ignoring the more important reasons to take a job (I.E the company culture, the benefits, the opportunity). But now I feel helpless because I have less than 4 months experience and that seems to be all that people look at when hiring in IT. 

Is there any hope for me to find another job despite so little experience? I've completed some projects at my current job and prior to this I had an internship where I completed another project. How do I talk to the tech recruiters and future employers about this?"

As a nervous senior with post application anxiety, I thought that making one of these threads would be fun.

State: AZ
School Type: Private
Ethnicity: White
Gender: Male

Major (general): Business/Computer Science

Scores
ACT: 31 (E: 29, M: 27, R: 36, S: 33). 7 overall on writing. I’m not a great writer on the fly, often I like to take time to revise my piece to make it better.
SAT: 1370 (R/W: 650, M: 720). 6 on writing.
A-Levels: Business Studies (B), AS Global Perspectives (a), and English (D - I got an A in the class overall, but I think I just bombed one of the heavily weighted papers which caused my score to bomb. It was about theories of language development, not even related to writing skill.)

Grades
3.61 UW GPA
Weighted GPA: Not offered at my school, even though A-levels are rigorous courses.
Class size: 13 (its a super small school!)

Extracurriculars:
Interact District Council (2 years, member then District Governor. I planned and led a 100 person leadership conference)
Another Interact District Council (1 year, Assistant Governor/Webmaster. These two Districts are merging. I made a new website and managed the social media for both districts.)
Interact Club (2 years, President/Founder, completed a plethora of service projects such as raising money for a well in South America and food drives)
Moot Court (2 years, member then Internal Executive Director. Was accepted to the National High School Moot Court Competition at Duke University two years running)
Sunday School (volunteer teacher’s aide, then was offered to be paid as a head teacher’s aide. I worked with 5th/6th graders, and also worked in the office)
Library Volunteer (2 years, helped arrange tai-monthly bookstalls that raised over $10,000 for the library)
Internship at Children’s Hospital (2 years, only high school intern they’ve ever had, working on Information Technology/Business Administration)

I do have more extracurriculars, but I only mentioned those here because they are what are on my application and what I consider ‘most important.’ I’m a member of NHS and Thespian Society, but not very involved in either/didn’t do them for very long. I was also on our school’s Robotics team, but only did that for a year and we didn’t do much.

Additional Information: I had a chronic disease (basically Chron’s Disease) for most of my high school career. This caused me to miss about 130 days of school to date.

Letters of Rec:
Psychology/Business Teacher: I haven’t seen her recommendation, but I’m sure that she wrote me a very strong one. She’s basically a second mother to me. 9/10.
History Teacher/Principal: 8/10

Additional: My mentor I work with in Interact. He had a very high ranking in the military, and a very impressive resume himself. He wrote me an absolutely stellar recommendation (100/10)

Common App Essay: 9/10. I wrote about my experience in the hospital (Without going into too much detail) and how the volunteers there inspired me to become an intern at the hospital and volunteer more.

Writing Supplements: My Babson one is probably 9/10.

Schools applying to: Babson (ED, deferred), Brandeis (EDII), Skidmore, Wesleyan, ASU Barrett, possibly Colgate


College information: I thought my interview for Babson went well. I also went to their information session and preview day, where I presented my group’s mock business in front of about 100 other kids and my interviewer. I was talking over e-mail to an admissions counselor for a while about getting credit for my A-Levels. I went on a campus tour of Brandeis, but didn't interview or anything as I hadn't been interested until I actually saw the campus on a whim.

tl’dr :

Started a digital out of home advertising business and my 6-month journey as a 22 y/o entrepreneur so far is down below.

Hi there redditors , bit of a long post so prepare yourself. I’m a 22y/o old design student and last summer whilst interning at a large tech company I stumbled across a reddit post from a guy who told the story of how he was making $3,000 a month selling advertising on placemats in his Universities cafeteria.I have a keen interest in business and thought this was a perfect opportunity to jump in to the world of entrepreneurship.

Finished my summer internship and set about trying to figure out this new project. I went for the straight solid business of placemats as inspired by reddit. Got in contact with university , landed a meeting had all prepared , they were lovely but unfortunately said they couldn’t do anything for me. All cafeteria handling’s were done by a third party . Went back to the drawing board worked hard on my prototypes of the placemats and tried to find the manager of the cafeteria at my university. A week later I found him , no luck he was point blank not interested in hearing what I had to say and essentially told me to f**k off.

Now what I’d be rejected twice by the placemats concept. Rather than give up I tried to pivot and explore other options of local advertising in my town. I noticed all of these outdoor posters / billboards (scrolling lightbox types) in my home town and thought that could be a good bet. Only thing was the town was littered with them I’d need to find a high traffic location that was unused. So I got out and scouted the whole town. Eventually found a wall that was perfect  , just by the train station lots of footfall. 

Location found , next was to find who owns the wall. Directly went and asked several local business owners and nobody could help. Eventually found one guy who owned the local bar. Despite being a straight out dick he told me who owned it. I got in contact with the owner and set up a meeting. This guy was a real estate agent , again seemed like he was trying to shake me down for money rather than help out a budding entrepreneur. I had sourced my lightbox on Alibaba and negotiated with suppliers for the price taking my initial investment to €800 per box. He then wanted me to rent out the wall with the condition that I would put up 3 of these billboards on his wall. Taking my investment to €2,400 and he then wanted €9,000 a year for the wall , which is ridiculous. But at the time I was so eager to get going I didn’t care. I drafted paperwork and almost signed myself into €9,000 of debt. The day before signing I had thought about how he treated me , he looked down on me , gave me very little of his time and belittled me and my idea in most cases. Thought to myself money aside is this someone I wanted to do business with? The answer was no and despite wanting to get this project going so bad I told him the deal was off.

2 weeks later slightly discouraged I moved onto my second pivot. I discovered the world of digital signage. Indoor tv’s that you place adverts on. I spent almost a month on figuring out how the systems work and what business model I could use.  I thought this could be it. I was inspired by outdoor advertising models used by some large industry players. They would offer free furniture to cities in return for exclusive advertising rights on the furniture. I thought this was my business model , offer a restaurant a free tv to display their promotions on and get exclusive advertising on the tv. Next was location , I scouted 3 restaurants to deal with and got  a meeting in two. I was rejected by one but accepted by the other!


I just launched last week and have the solution running. Built a website , registered as a company , bought a landline number, set up email with ZOHO and I’m now in the sales side of things trying to sell ad space on the TV but struggling. I’m working on a yearly term with clients and offering a months free advertising before they sign up. The screen offers over 2,500 ad plays a month and is only €150 a month for a 15 second slot working out to €5 a day. Despite this I’ve only managed to sell trials for 8/20 slots. I would appreciate any help on the sales fronts. My prices are much much less than newspaper advertising or any other forms of media. The restaurant gets well over 10,000+ impressions per month. A lot of impressions would come from students and staff from the local university so I’m targeting people interested in advertising to the 18-35 demographic. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated greatly.


EDIT 1 :

Thanks to all you guys who have helped so far your feedback and advice is really appreciated and I'm trying it all. Your support is keeping me going on this battle! For anybody interested here's the site I've set up , no inbound calls from it as of yet.

Get over yourself before you drain the company of all its tech talent.",dartmouthmoose,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ncqti/no_palantir_your_internships_are_not_worth_5/,"I recently decided to quit the recruiting process with Palantir after having first reached out in July of 2016 and having my first interview in October. Last summer I was really excited about the prospect of working at Palantir--cool tech, smart people, sick perks. After 2 phone screens, 3 onsites in NY, a hiring manager interviews and dozens of emails back and forth with recruiters I got a call offering me the ""opportunity"" to do even more onsites for the Forward Deployed Engineering role.

During this time I also found two separate internships, one at a breakout list company and another at Google. I took both offers (I had two off terms from school essentially) and am currently working at the breakout list company. Yet, here I am in January talking to Palantir still and being asked to do more interviews. Finally I said enough, no tech internship could possibly be worth what would be 8 interviews or more if I kept going.

This made me seriously consider though, how does Palantir get good talent if they have such a horrible recruiting process?

I'm asking this question because I thought maybe I was an outlier, but heard of several people with similar experiences. My perception of Palantir has been drastically reduced through this process. I told my recruiters via email about already finding internship, being stuck in the recruiting pipeline for nearly five months, and how I was not willing nor had the time to interview as I'm working now. She just recanted the same things as before about wanting to find a good fit for me, how that takes time, and asked me to do more interviews.

Not only is the recruiting process awful, but I think a company would have to be seriously delusional about its status to think that 5 months and 6 interviews later I'll take a day off of work from my current internship to take the CalTrain down to Palo Alto and do some brain teasers on a whiteboard so that maybe I can get another hiring manager interview for a role as a glorified customer support engineer that I didn't actually want in the first place.

How in the world does Palantir stay competitive thinking like this? Is there still any hype for Palantir from top engineering talent? 


I wholeheartedly regret even starting this process of applying to Palantir as it's been a huge time and energy investment and I have absolutely no closure--I didn't get rejected, I didn't get an offer, I just walked away. 

If you've had a similar experience with Palantir I'd love to hear about it and what you did. I'm also interested in what anyone who has had a positive experience being recruited or working at Palantir has to say. "

I have experience working with embedded systems and microcomputers but web based programming is somewhat foreign to me.  To practice, I have built a portfolio website using bootstrap, jquery, and other concepts I will need to know at my internship.  

To gain a better understanding of backend web design and to display my hard work, I have decided to take it step further and host the website on a raspberry pi 3 using a Ubuntu or Debian operating system.  I have already purchased a  domain name from goDaddy and I am waiting for a microSD card to come in the mail before I can start working on the backend.  

While searching for how to use the domain name I had bought and connect it to my website, I came across a lot of webserver programs such as Amazon EC2.  Do I still need to use one of these services if I am using apache and plan on building a rudimentary backend using php or another language? 

Furthermore, as a broke and often unemployed college student, I am trying to build this website at as little of a cost and as much of an intellectual gain as possible.  Are there any other programs or webservices I must acquire/purchase to make this portfolio website a reality? Or, are there other programming topics I should seek more information on?

Additionally, I am learning Node.js on freeCodeCamp as I will be interacting with it in some form during my internship.  I am using npm and a linux command line.  What is a Node.js server used and more importantly, where/how would I incorporate one into my website? I found this on stackoverflow but I still don't have a clear understanding.

This began as simply a way to get more reading done. Reading has been central in my life as long as I can remember, but as I transitioned into the adult world I found reading (like fitness and friendships) got squeezed out by the bullshit we’re told is important. As the habit of early morning reading has become more deeply engrained in my routine, though, it has leveled me up in ways I couldn’t have predicted. My students think I’m nuts. My wife is reserving judgment. I think it’s fucking awesome.

Now, I’ve always liked reading. I grew up in libraries, and I don’t remember a time that I couldn’t make sense of a book put in front of me. Here’s the thing, though: Even if I hated reading, the benefits would outweigh the drawbacks by such a massive margin, that I couldn’t justify not doing it. 

**It’s like free weights for your brain**	
&gt; “The best routine is the one you can stick to.” ― Anon

Books as dumbbells might be a tired cliche (is ‘tired cliche’ a tired cliche?), but hear me out. When I began bodyweight fitness, I dreaded my routine. I wasn’t good at it, and it made me face some short-sighted assumptions about gym-going mouth breathers that I’d been holding onto for years. It was humbling, and something I did not think was sustainable. I was not strong, I was not fast, and I only owned two pairs of athletic shorts.

The one thing I had a surplus of, though, was determination. Even though I wasn’t good at my routine, I showed up on a regular, tightly-observed schedule, and did it. Workout days turned into workout weeks, and workout weeks became months. As time went on I began to feel like one of my old D&amp;D characters. I could feel myself level up. Eight pull-ups became thirty. Bodyweight squats turned to deep step-ups, which turned to barbell squats. I got better, harder, and stronger.

**But this is about reading**

And reading is no different. As I’ve recommitted myself to a literary life, I’ve realized the same gains. It’s harder to measure than counting push-ups, but the improvement is the same. As I’ve settled into this ritual the last few years, this steady commitment to my routine has sharpened me. It has made me a clearer thinker. It has invigorated my mind and has allowed me to shift through stages of early-morning grogginess and begin my workday in top gear.

Reading is fitness for your brain. Not only that, but long-form reading has been shown to have a centering and calming effect on the mind. Many benefits of reading are obvious and well-documented, and I won’t rehash them here, but I want to take a moment to talk about a few less obvious ones.

**Reading turns great thinkers into your own personal mentors**
&gt; 	“The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a fire to be kindled.” ― Plutarch

I first read the book *Slapstick* when I was in 1oth grade. We had an intern in our library named Do Nothing Dave, and he casually mentioned I might enjoy Vonnegut. I walked over to the shelf (where my high school library [mercifully, astoundingly] had the collected works) and browsed until I found something that looked interesting. What I read is a book that Vonnegut would--late in life--call the worst book he’d ever written. For me it was life-changing.

I didn’t know a book could be like this, I remember thinking as I devoured its final pages next to my 3am bedlamp. Not only did Vonnegut expose me to a style of writing that I have never encountered, he exposed me to a style of thinking that was fresh in my life. He was saying things in his books that I was not hearing from any other outlet. He wrote at length about loneliness, war, cruelty, and unhappiness--and he wrote about them in a way that was engaging and hilarious. This is a book that the New York times blasted (the best jab comes when the reviewer says that Vonnegut has, “happened to give up storytelling altogether”), but it sent me into a Vonnegut spiral that, by the end of the year, had spun me through everything he’d ever written and implanted ideas that would become foundational in my life.

Since that year I have made a habit of devouring the collected works of authors I love--from Douglas Adams to William Zinsser. The result has been that each one has claimed a small part of me, and I--in turn--have synthesized them into something of my own. These men and women have mentored--and continue to mentor--me to this day.

**Reading provides the latticework for thinking clearly**
&gt; 	""...the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” ― F. Scott Fitzgerald

In my adult life, about 95% of my reading is non-fiction. Taking in a good non-fiction book has an effect on me similar to drinking a glass of cool water when I’m thirsty. It is refreshing, invigorating, and satisfies something almost fundamental to my biology. 

Non-fiction, though, has a clearer benefit. Good non-fiction writing is often marked by its structure. To be convincing, it must be arranged logically--with each new idea or rung of an argument coming only after the author has firmly secured his footing on the previous rung. Exposure to this structure shapes your brain to expect similar rigidity in your own thinking. When you condition yourself to interpret these logical structures, you condition yourself to think in these same structures. It’s not that reading makes you smarter--it's that reading gives you the ability to manipulate your thoughts and hold two opposing thoughts in tandem. It builds the latticework that your own critical capacities hang from.

**It provides the foundations from where you can comprehend the world**
&gt; “If you only read the books that everyone else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is thinking.”  ― Haruki Murakami, Norwegian Wood

Beyond this, a healthy regime of reading informs. It educates. It exposes you to worlds outside of your own. Reading widely will not make you an expert in any field, but it WILL provide the low-level background signal that will allow you to make connections. 

In Steven Johnson’s Where Good Ideas Come From he explores the origin of good ideas. What he comes down to is this: If you want good ideas to happen, put different people with different areas of expertise in a place where they can slam into one another.  Apple does it (they famously designed 1 Infinite Loop with centralized resources); Facebook does it (they have the largest open office plan in the world); and Google does it.

The good news is that you don’t need their billions of dollars in capital to create a microcosm of this in your own world. With the power of regimented reading, you can turn yourself into a one-man idea creation machine. 

Reading broadly gives you the fodder to make the connections that lead to good ideas. This is why Bill Gates sets aside time in his schedule to undergo Think Weeks and Warren Buffett says his primary course of doing business is to, “just sit in his office and read all day.” Successful people understand the power of habitual, regimented reading, and they take great strides to make it routine.

**It habitualizes learning** 
&gt; “The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read.” ― Mark Twain

And this is perhaps the most important reason to read. Creating a reading habit will create a learning habit. It will force you to level up.

Ultimately, I’m not just advocating for reading. Putting the latest James Patterson on your nightstand to tumble through for ten minutes before bed isn’t going to make a much of a dent in your intellectual fitness. 

Instead what I’m advocating is to make reading a habit in the same way that you would the gym. Look at your daily routine, choose a time that will work, and stick to it like your life depends on it.

After a week of this the response becomes Pavlovian. Whatever time you’ve set aside for reading will begin to feel natural. As you settle into your usual place each day, you’ll find that your transition into deep focus is easier than the day before. Your mind will begin to feel elastic and and receptive, taking in new ideas, combining them with old, and cranking out something uniquely your own.

**The Takeaway**
&gt; 	“If you go home with somebody, and they don't have books, don't fuck them.” ― John Waters

Reading is a sort of wonderdrug. It makes you smarter, improves your empathy, boosts memory, reduces stress, provides entertainment, calms the mind, connects you to the world around you, and makes you more attractive to the opposite sex. 

If they sold this in a pill, you’d pay $1000/month for it.

Ultimately, it doesn’t matter what you read (although I would caution that while infotainment like reddit feels informative, it generally has the nutritional value of reading a Lucky Charms box). And don’t get hung up on the medium (I prefer reading on a iPad mini converted into a rich ereader, but I also subscribe to magazines, have hard copies of books, and will take most anything in a pinch). The most important thing is that you pursue reading that you find interesting. Beyond that, I will only invoke the old computer science adage, “Garbage in, garbage out.” Fiction, non-fiction, long-form articles--we live in a world that is rich with great writing and bursting with new and interesting ideas that are waiting to be digested.

So my advice? Embrace it. Habitualize it. Make it as routine as going to the gym or getting a good night’s  sleep. Wake up early; stay up late; ditch the dopamine delivery system in your pocket and bring a book with you everywhere you go. However you manage it, just fucking read."

I realize that, in the beginning of my career, I may not have any idea where I want to specialize, and that it will be necessary to just get started doing something. For that reason, I'm doing a full stack web dev course with the goal of creating my first website/blog in my free time. I'm almost done with CC, and am transferring to uni in the fall. That said, I have an almost guaranteed internship at a company that gives engineering related internships, and my first correspondence with the person with the relevant information mentioned that the team would likely be looking for me to work on a data analysis project.

How does experience of that kind benefit me as a prospective software developer? How relevant is data analysis to CS? Does the fact that it would be easily secured in the summer prior to entering university hold as much weight as I'm giving it? Personally, I didn't expect to be getting an internship at all this summer, considering I don't have any technical experience yet. I mean, I have my military experience, but in an unrelated technical field.

Anyway, I tried searching for this topic but felt it was worthy of a thread. Thanks for the read!"

(not in number of employees but revenue(doubling every year)) I went to a technical school and got A+ certified which i think is a big part about getting this job. However, i want to get into programming and i would really like to get a degree so i am starting college in a week. It is a community college but i will transfer to a state school after 2 years for my bachelors in computer science.

Now my question is, i see people asking a lot about internships during early years of college. My current boss is willing to help me learn programming so i can help build the new website and application to manage inventory while i am in school. i am also going to be working 20 hours a week for him while in school. He also offered to meet on weekends to do one on one programming with him.

Do you think it would be better to apply for different internships while i am in school instead? or would it look better to stay with this company and get real world experience and projects done to put on my resume as well as the one on one experience with him. Even though it would just be this one job not 2-3 internships.

I am not sure what would look better on a resume to potential employers in the future.

Also wanted to add i spoke to my boss about long term positioning with the company after school and he said it will probably grow to the point that a manger type position may come up down the road if it gets big enough and he said he would offer me the position. But he doesn't know if they would have the need for a full time developer.

TLDR: should i stay at my current job throughout college or try and do multiple internships?"
5nf9na,1,2017-01-11,Stay at my job or leave and finish degree?,reznap,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nf9na/stay_at_my_job_or_leave_and_finish_degree/,"I'm a software developer in my first real career job for 2.5 years doing internal app and web dev. At the same time, I am a post-bacc student (previous degree is a BS in Applied Math) as well with 6 classes left to go for my BS CS. 

It first started out with a 2 person team, the lead dev (who created pretty much everything over the span of 10+ years) and I. He left a year and a half ago and since then I became the sole developer with barely any documentation and way too many things for me to maintain and handle. I find doing classes on top full time work as a sole dev to be very stressful and I feel myself burning out. 

I have crucial classes that I have to take soon such as Algorithms and Operating Systems, I don't think I can sustain doing work and school without my work or grades suffering for it. I want to just finish my degree and be done with it ASAP, but this will require leaving my job. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Pros:**

- I call the shots when it comes what technologies/frameworks/processes to use.
- Recently promoted, and treated relatively well by the company given my situation.
- Currently involved in a couple of very high profile/visibility projects that replaces our old software.
- Full autonomy in terms of how I work, when I come and go at the office or work from home.
- Was able to self-learn a lot of things related to software development due to this situation.
- Tuition reimbursement

&amp;nbsp;

**Cons:**

- I call the shots (this is a double edged sword).
- No technical mentorship, I feel like I'm coding in a vacuum.
- Codebase is spaghetti and was developed cowboy style with no process to it (no version control, unit/integration tests, CI/builds etc..). Feels like I'm pretty much winging it.
- Burned out and stressed.
- No other developers, team is just me.
- No plans by management to hire some help in the near future.
- Even after promoted, salary feels a little low (68k in NY metro area).
- Company is prone to cycles of profitability/non-profitability due to the industry it is in.
- Take longer (or never) to complete school

&amp;nbsp;

If I leave, I will have to pay back ~$6k to the company in tuition reimbursement due to their policy (must stay at company for 1 year), but I've already come to terms with this and will just pay it back.

I still live at home and am not required to pay rent, food, or bills if I quit my job (though I still contribute whatever I can regardless). I have enough money saved I think (26k in savings) to get me by until I finish my degree.

I have an interview with one of the big 4 in a few months that I'd very much like to prepare for. I'd also like to intern at other places just to see what other companies are like since I can stretch out my semesters, but would this be viewed as a step backwards?

I'm pretty much leaning on leaving unless there's a strong argument to be made to stay. What are your opinions?

I got two offers and although both aren't big name companies they are still pretty decent imo. One pays a lot, $55/hr and I wanna take it purely for the money; that's more money than my parents make together. but the team is kinda small and they are distributed, plus the interviewer seemed kinda like douche when interviewing, and I'm not that interested in what they do or their stack per say, but I think I could suck it up for the money. they told me in the interview that I wouldn't get any mentorship and that I should treat this like a full time job. Everyone works in cubicles, not much interaction among coworkers, I've heard from previous coops, and everyone's like 40 lol. The other job however I find a lot more interesting, their stack is what I like and the people seem pretty chill and their culture seems nice. The role is more in line with what I may want to do later on. however the pay is pretty low. it was $22/hr, I tried to push them on it, and compared my other offer and they moved to $25/hr, I doubt they would go any higher. the higher paying company has an older stack and is more corporate like, while the lower paying one is a cool new startup with latest tech, and all the hype. If they both had the same pay, I would take the $25/hr one for sure. Is it worth it to suck it up for one term for the money or take a major pay hit and take the lower paying job? It would pay less than half, but I'd say a better job in all other regards, particularly my interests. While the higher paying one is mostly for the money, but I guess I suck it up 9-5, take my pay and go home and work on my own projects. I need help deciding

I hesitate to put it in Employment because I think would look weird seeing my first job out of college being a CTO, and again this might trigger the employer to avoid me as to not waste money training me just so I can leave down the line.

During my last year in school I got an internship as a QA engineer at a relatively small company that no one has heard off. What they were doing with their product was really cool, and I thought it would get bigger, so I signed on full time when I graduated as an Associate Software Engineer.


I was put on a team that was trying to port their established windows product over to Android. I don't want to reveal too much, but the product was basically a way to virtualize applications on a computer or mobile device without the app taking up all the space it normally would. It utilized cloud technology to deliver data to the device on an as-needed basis. So it basically saved space at the expense of network, but it wasn't pixel streaming.


The stuff I got to work on and learn were:

1) Getting to know the details about Android APKs and OBBs, including how they were built with Gradle and the Android Build Tools, APKtool and the like.

2) Converting our packaging shell scripts into Gradle scripts.

3) Developing an invisible system-level Android app for installing/uninstalling apps and some lower-level JNI-calls.

4) Creating a GUI wrapper for all of our scripts in Java Swing.

5) Spot debugging windows code in C++ when our team found something amiss.

Unfortunately the company had to downsize and since my team was mostly R&amp;D and we hadn't secured a customer yet most of my team was laid off. So now I have a couple years of experience in... a few different things that not a lot of people are looking for. I am not really sure what kind of job would be looking for someone like me, and if I should just ""start over"" at another entry level position so I can build a better foundation in C# or front-end stuff.

Any guidance would be greatly appreciated."

It's frustrating to not find a semi-decent amount of results when I search. I know there have to be internships available locally. I refuse to believe there's any way a city is *this* deprived of opportunities.

Aside from whatever mistakes I'm making here, I was also wondering:

1. If a local company doesn't have any internships listed, is it acceptable to email them and introduce myself and ask if they are opening up any listings soon?

2. I've been mainly looking for ""Software Developer/Engineer Internship"" as the position. Are there any other variations of that title I should be looking for?

Hi, everyone I'm currently a 2^nd year CompSci student at a University in UK. And as part of my degree I need to do a placement year where I work in the industry. Now Since the start of the academic year I've been looking for placement opportunities in places like GradCracker, RateMyPlacement, LinkedIn, and I even went to careers fairs and talked to people offering placements.

However few months away from the deadline in my school, and many placement application deadlines approaching, I still haven't received any positive indicators showing me that I will actually be able to work somewhere over the coming year.

I've applied mostly for Software/Games/Web Developer roles, and as of yet I've gotten to a technical code review stage of application with one company (haven't heard from them in ~2 months though), and got rejected from another company after it turned out that my application wasn't as strong as other candidates'.

So my ask to r/AskProgramming is some guidance in terms of:

* Where do companies post about placement opportunities they are offering?
* If your company has a placement scheme, what things are your HR &amp; Devs are looking for in the applicants?

Any type of help would be useful at this point as I'm starting to panic ever so slightly, thanks!

Right now its summer school and I am just taking some elective subjects to make my workload less during my final year this year. What I have recently found out though is that apparently you are already supposed to have professional level experience by now, interning in your 1st/2nd year of University.

This however doesn't make any sense to me, why would a company pay a 1st/2nd year student which doesn't know anything to Intern at their company? I wasn't really informed of how you're supposed to transition from University into the work force so I guess this is a good time to ask now.

Being a last year student in University with no professional level experience have I messed up my chance at getting a job? I don't have the faintest clue on how Internships or Job applications even work, previously I had thought that after you finish your degree you just simply send out applications to companies you wish to work for, but now that seems completely wrong since I heard people have been interning on their 1st/2nd year.

I was offered a role at BlackRock in NYC working on a team that is basically an intermediate between a software team and clients, they support the software and do minor SQL/UNIX work.


My other option is returning to the place I've worked at, a consumer product good company in California and working in IT. It would be my 6th summer there, which I feel pigeonholes me a lot, but the experience seems to be more relevant. However, it is not a big-name company (medium-sized, 5000 employees) and I definitely want to get out of my hometown.


My goal is to get a software development job in SV. Which of these two offers would be a bigger benefit? Any other advice?

**BlackRock pros:**

* NYC, new place to explore. 
* Big Name
* Love the company and it's goals. Would love to work in their software teams
* Get to learn SQL/Unix 

**BlackRock Cons:**

* NYC is expensive
* Less technical internship, more business focused
* Move across country

**Hometown Company Pros:**

* IT internship, (Angular, Java Spring, etc.) 
* Live at home (better in terms of spending)

**Hometown Company Cons:**

* Don't want to stay at the company at all
* Have to stay in hometown (terrible town in CA)

Lo and behold, a job I did NOT think I would get-- a really great situation in an industry I actually care about-- came through and I'm unbelievably excited. 

However, terrified to quit. Honestly terrified. I mean yeah, what can he do to me besides yell and carry on? Yes, but I'm a woman who does not do well mentally or anxiety-wise with yelling, so I truly feel semi-afraid. (There's no HR btw.) 

I also made a huge point of insisting I would stay at least a year (my resume is a little patched together because I've been switching industries) and he had some hesitation about whether or not I would stay on, and here I am cutting and running at the first opportunity... but I feel I have no choice!

The other problem is, he is very computer illiterate and actually depends on me (quite literally) to do things for him. So if I leave very immediately, I know the panic will be real... 

And it doesn't help that he's going away for a month (to his house overseas) next Friday. So he won't be able to interview or place someone unless he literally does it next week and I train them. 

So my question is-- how do I quit? 

And is there any possibility of being a coward and emailing him over the weekend (on Friday-- he won't be in tomorrow) and letting him stew over the weekend, or do I have to gird my loins and do it today in person face to face? "

I'll be meeting with 7 people for ~30ish minutes each from various parts of the company, many of them being pretty important. How should I prepare? 

I've never had a video type interview before, let alone for 3 hours with this many people. I'm so excited about the position - any tips or insight as to what questions might be asked would be helpful. Thanks!"

5nkpvl,4,2017-01-12,Entering senior year - getting questioned about my target industry?,mattdeveloper,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nkpvl/entering_senior_year_getting_questioned_about_my/,"As I enter my senior year for my CS degree I'm getting the same question from a few of my friends and family that typically goes like this:

Them: ""What industry are you looking to work in when you graduate?""

Me: ""I just want to be a programmer.  I'm not really concerned with the specific industry I want to be in."" 

Them: ""Well you should be researching which field you want to go into so you can start preparing for it now""

So this is the beginning of my research...  I know there are different specializations within computer science like cyber security, web development, AI etc but they are thinking more broadly like energy, healthcare, finance, government etc.  In my mind with a CS degree you could adapt to the nuances of those fields on job but there is not a lot course/prep work to do outside of maybe getting some sort of minor in one of those areas or an internship.  As an example, I have a friend that studied communications and went on to be a PR manager for a bed and breakfast management company.  He didn't take any management or hospitality courses but was able to apply his communication skills for his position and learned the industry over the years.  Am I wrong in this thinking?  Should I be targeting and learning details of specific broad industries?

As some insight, I'd like to work at software development company so that I get the chance to work on different projects and would prefer if they worked with Java or C#.  Not sure how much more specific I need to get.

One at a startup in NYC, pays ~$12/hr, and one at an established company that provides housing (which is why I'm leaving out location) and ~$28/hr.

My gut is inclined to take the start-up offer. I like the work environment, the work that they do, and just being able to work in a start-up. However, the competing offer is what's making this hard to decide: with the corporate offer, I potentially have a better chance of getting a return offer with a solid post-grad salary, and I wouldn't have to worry about paying a bit out of pocket this summer just to intern at the company.

I'm an advocate for focusing on the experience when it comes to internships, and know that I will be challenged and will learn if I choose to go there. The way I'm considering leaning towards the start-up is that if I *do* go to the corporate route, and *don't* get a return offer, I would regret not choosing the startup.

However, I just need some opinions right now, I've been debating in my head for the entire week.

I'm currently attempting to network into an ER gig/applying to position after position. If I'm graduating in 6 months, is now too early to apply?

This is my second week.

I'm primarily skilled in java and for the first week my manager and mentor were both very nice and understanding. For the first day of this week, my manager assigned me to debug part of a new update for the company's primary software (I was told I'd be debugging for the first month or so). This worked fine and it gave me a nice understanding of the code I'd be working with (but a very small fraction of it as it's 13000 packages). 

My mentor is nice but very awkward and doesn't do a great job of explaining things. He's helpful when I had trouble with setting up the environment or hitting a roadblock in setting up something else. I usually don't try to ask him anything because he has his own work to do.

Anyway, apparently manually testing the company's primary software is somewhat annoying and the team I'm on had been wanting to make a web-based, UI-friendly way to test their code for a while but that would take time as one of them would need to learn javascript and such. My mentor showed me a plugin I could use that basically uses java to build frontend web services. I also need to learn database-related programming and how to eventually tie the UI I create to the company's software and essentially tie everything I learn together.

My manager was originally going to have me debug and stuff for the first month but after my mentor told everyone what I'm working on, the team got excited about it. My manager even told me today that it was exciting and would be great on my resume. It's all I've been working on all week and today was kind of the boiling point because I really don't think I can do it. I'm learning so much software I've never used before and even a lot of the command line stuff ends up taking me a while when things don't go as the tutorials describe. I'm really trying but I don't think I'm up to the task (my mentor seemed to originally describe it as something we'd work on together but he doesn't know the software either and the end goal also seems very vague to me). I also have no idea how long it'll take me, so I'm pretty concerned I'll end up wasting a month of the company's time for a completed but shittily put together project. I already spent this week on it...

What should I do? Tell my manager the truth? Really try to complete the project, therefore learning/gaining a lot from it?"

I just graduated last May with a BS in Financial Math. No certifications otherwise, vaguely familiar with SAS, Tableau, and MySql as well as excellent (almost advanced) excel skills. I have been trying to become a data analyst, but due to unfortunate life events was unable to intern in college. There's a shortage of D.A. In this area, but they mostly want 1+ years experience. *sigh*

 Thus I began to temp while throwing my resume around and doing light D.A. Work for a friend's company. First temp job literally created a job as HR Analyst for close to 50k start because they liked me so much. Everything was negotiated, was moving to my permanent desk and signing Monday. Sunday I get a call not to return. The very last person to sign off declined the hire. Whatever. They wanted ""payroll skills"" in addition. 

The next month I get picked up for a Reconciliation project with another company. They fucking love me. To quote them I'm ""better at this than they are"". And I even accelerated the project with some basic excel. Frankly my analytic skills give me that edge. They have literally been actively looking for a place to hire me at end of project but can't guarantee yet as that's not till end of February or later. I will do more networking Monday with VPof Finance and the Manager for Master Data Management about any hiring plans they may have as far out as May and maybe drop off my resume. The company seems genuine and friendly. It's easy to have conversations with the CEO etc in passing. They are growing but still have that homey feel while being corporate. I love it here, but I'm still tossing out my resume sometimes. 

Then there's ""Mary"" ( false name). She's another temp. She sucks. They at least like her. I have been able to time her at not doing more than tapping the space bar for as much as 3 hours. She needs things repeated, spends a lot of time on her phone, and does her side business sometimes while working here. She does 25% the work I do I'm almost positive. And that's with hours of my time spent developing sheets to make us more efficient. As a manager my expectations would be higher for praise. She would get none. She's a nice enough person, but it's just how I feel. 

So, after working along side Mary... I begin to wonder. Am I the person that will get passed by? Am I working too hard? What can I do to ensure I'm working hard the right ways? Is this a smart way to develop a career?"

Due to some medical events (c-word) I've only had a 3.4 gpa with little extra curriculars. Haven't taken sat yet (psat 1380/1520). Family solidly middle class so can't expect a lot of help.
The way I see it I have a few options. 

•The cheapest is to stay in-state and take advantage of the free 2 years of community college Oregon has. After that finish bachelors at a college in Oregon (OSU, UofO, etc.)

•The most expensive option is to go to a higher ranked computer science school out of state. The best I have a chance at is probably the University of Washington. I know I'd have to get a mountain of student loans.

•Everything inbetween (cc then transfer out of state, 4 years in-state college, etc.)

Questions (slightly repititive, sorry)
1. Would I lose out on jobs or internships (big 4 and similar companies) by doing one of the cheaper paths?

2. What benefits are there to going to one of the more highly regarded computer science schools?

3. Any suggestions for other colleges I should look at? Prefer to stay on the west coast or Texas. 

4. What do you think I should do? What was your experience like with one of the options?

5. Anything else I should consider?

Not sure if it matters with this, but I think artificial intelligence is really cool, and would like to work with that if possible. The other thing I know I care about is how where I go to college impacts eventual salary.

Before this, I had applied to company B, an SF startup where I would've really liked to work, quite a bit more than company A (ie, if I had offers from both A and B, I'd pick B quite easily). The problem is, they got back to me to set up interviews after I had signed my offer for A. I still went on with the interviews, and ended up receiving an offer from them. 

Now I'm conflicted - do I stick with A, which is itself a highly regarded company and will certainly be an awesome internship experience? Or do I renege on A, and go with B, which is what my choice would've been if reneging wasn't an issue? 

Here are a few pros and cons I've thought of for reneging: 

Pros: 

- Get to work at a company I like better, and one that I think will be a lot more successful in the future, would love working there full time (though I have 2 years before I graduate)

- Company B is more well-regarded, but the difference is probably not much. 

- Culture seems a bit better but not much, my project is something I'm a little more interested in, wicked smart people and I loved talking to the employees there (though this can be said for A too)

Cons: 

- Will be blacklisted by a pretty good (highly regarded) company where I'd likely be pretty happy working at, and that's one less option I have to work at in the future. 

- Risk of company contacting career services center and banning me from university career fairs (there's 100+ tech companies at our career fairs)

- Risk of ruining my reputation in the tech industry at age 19, which isn't ideal for a future in Silicon Valley

- Possible risk of company B, the company I reneged for, finding out, and cancelling my offer with them

As you can probably tell, I'm pretty conflicted and would really appreciate some advice on this. It's my first time recruiting/searching for jobs/any of that stuff, so I've not been going about it as well as possible. My hunch is that my type of situation probably happens somewhat often, since its pretty common for companies to have different timeframes and getting weeks and weeks of offer extensions is rare."
5nori3,17,2017-01-13,How to be more... engaging/interactive?,F-ck_up,socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5nori3/how_to_be_more_engaginginteractive/,"To open up, I'm currently a 19 year old male in college. I like to think I'm a fairly smart guy. Ive won several math competitions and national-level programming competitions, but can't seem to get my hands on an internship. Some of my friends have managed to get them (and not to be obnoxious), but I feel like I have more experience in computer science than they do. If they can get them, why can't I?

I have few close friends I can talk to because I'm a very antisocial person. I try to go out of my comfort zone every once in a while and meet new people, but never really seem to get close to them... All my close friends I've known since either middle school or elementary school. I think the only reason they became friends with me is because they got to know me for 4+ years. I joined some clubs in college with the hopes of making some friends,but it seems like everyone else in the clubs have ""clicked"" by now and I feel left out.

 My best friend recently gave me some honest feedback and told me that I am BORING AS HELL to talk to. I'm fun to chat with over text, but in person or over voice chat it is just boring and awkward to talk to me. I give slow replies, and seem disinterested (even though I'm not)

I'm guessing that this is the main reason that although Ive had several interviews, and I am able to answer the questions in the interviews, I do not get the offer. 

I would really like to improve my personality and be an exciting person to talk to, but it seems like a very hard thing to change. I want to be able to make new friends in college and especially do well in interviews. At this point, I'm not even going to think about dating/relationships as that seems like a long way away ( I can barely even talk to girls)

Does anyone have a collection of tips or books to read on how to become a more interesting, engaging,and interactive person to talk to? Any help is appreciated, thanks."

5np0cx,0,2017-01-13,Best school for a prospective CS major?,PM_MeYourFeels,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5np0cx/best_school_for_a_prospective_cs_major/,"It's my junior year in highschool, and after completing the first few weeks of Harvard's CS50x, I have fallen in love with computer science. What is the best school that will give me access to valuable internships and job offers? Academics aren't holding me back as much as financial limitations.

To give an example of where I am currently at academically:

By the end of this year I will have taken 6 AP courses. (WHAP, APUSH, AP Calc BC, AP Physics, AP Lang/Comp, and AP Music Theory) I'm expecting at least a 4 on every test. I plan to take at least 4 more AP courses my senior year.

My current ACT score is a 33 (as of the end of sophomore year), but I have frequently scored higher on the practice tests and expect a 34-35 when I take it at the end of this year. 

I scored one composite point below National Merit qualifications on my PSAT (99 percentile). I haven't taken the actual SAT yet.

I have only had one B (AP Calc BC) and am in the top 1% of my class. (Maybe salutatorian? We don't have class rank anymore.) 

Are these competitive enough academics to qualify me for a school like Stanford, or am I wasting my time? Stanford provides enough financial aid for me to go to school almost debt free and is located in an excellent location for CS majors, so it is very appealing to me. UC Berkeley and MIT most likely won't give me enough aid to graduate without a decent amount of debt. My parents are middle class, so we make enough to not receive aid, but not enough to finance two students in college.  Are there any schools that you guys recommend? Even the University of Washington might be financially out of reach. I'm looking for schools with large merit scholarships or ridiculous amounts of financial aid (Stanford, Princeton, etc.) along with an excellent CS program."

5nqwex,0,2017-01-13,"Unemployed for 4 months, here is my analysis.",angryguy4444,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5nqwex/unemployed_for_4_months_here_is_my_analysis/,"Tl;dr at the end.

I got my engineering degree 4 months ago. 

At that time, I was suffering from depression and bad health due to a very bad diet, not getting enough sleep and not doing any sport. 

Since then, I've recovered, but I've not been sending more resumes. 

On average, I send one resume every week. I know a guy who is supposed to get my resume to some top people but he never calls me back and I'm not even bothered enough to call him back. It's like I don't care. 

So yeah, I'm tired, but I could totally go to my desk to send more resumes. So I've been thinking a little bit about all that, and why I don't do more things to get a job.

**First of all, I still hadn't make any decision regarding my immediate future**

I graduated from college and everyone told me I was going to get a job but me? I never made any decision ! Everything good that I earned in my life stemed from me taking the decision to earn them (""I want to go to college"", ""I want to do my internship in Canada"", for example). Here, I never choose anything ! 

**Intellectually, I know I should get a job but emotionnally, I want to feel good and have no problem**

I don't like my situation : I'm at home, my parents feed me...that's not what I want out of life. Plus, I'm unemployed. Because of me not liking these, I get bad emotions and feelings and it seems (when one looks at my actions) that my only goal right now is avoid negative emotion and emotional disturbances like the plague (and not find a job). Every time I get a negative emotion because of my situation, I run away from it or try to numb it with ice cream and video games. 

Every time someone gives me advices about my situation I go into panick mode and leave, because I don't want anyone to talk about my situation (which is bad).

**""TELL ME IT'S OKAY OR SHUT THE FUCK UP""**

Therefore, I flee away from reality, which makes me unable to change it. 

**I don't feel ready to get a job in a company**

Because of my bad experience during my last internship, because I've been living a terrible lifestyle for the past 3 years and thus feel the need to rest, I feel like I can't assume a job right now. Transitioning between college and the industry seems to be too big of a stretch to me.

There is a disconnect between my rational mind and my emotions. 

**What do I want, emotionnally?** 

Intellectually, I know I should get a job but I always had to have my emotions working for me, in the directions chosen by my rational mind, to get shit done and reach it's goal. Right now, I believe my emotions are playing against me. 

* On one hand I seek pleasure and fun, on the other hand I seek relaxation, calmness and a smooth, problem-free life. I use things that numbs me from reality and the negative feelings that my situation creates to feel as if everything is OK. 

* I'm affraid of people. I've been living alone for the past three years and the last people I use to hang out with betrayed me. I spent 3 years alone and I now see people as dangers. 

* I feel like I can't take on any challenges. I feel weak, incapable and inadequate. When a challenge or a conflict comes up I feel overwhelmed, like it's too much for me, and I flee away. Getting a job? The interview? And then actually DOING the job? No way, man. 

* After 3 hard years, I want to rest, relax and enjoy life. Not go back to working. 

* I want to feel good, to feel *safe*, to be able to relax. My environment provides me with that right now. My parents are great and encouraging. So they don't create any discomfort and thus no fear of what's going to happen if I don't find a job.

* I don't like my situation, and I want to flee away from it. That's why I always take long walks to just go away, leave. I also live it mentally by shutting down my brain thanks to the computer 24/7.

* Finally, and it's the best thing I want emotionnaly, I want to change my situation. Not deal with it, but radically change it. Because I'm sick and tired of it. But will I find the strength?

If you look at my actions, what I do during the day is basically mindlessly surfing the internet. I use that to bumb myself so that I can trick me into believing I'm OK and everything's gonna be fine, because I believe I couldn't deal with the challenge that my actual situation represents and the feelings of fear, anxiety, panick it would create. I can't deal with the reality of my situation so I numb myself to it, which makes it even worse. It's a downward spiral. 

**Tl;dr :** I don't feel like I could do a good job if I ever had a job. Due to my very bad experience during my internship, I don't want to go bad to an engineering position because I remember how bad I was feeling there, even though everyone tells me it was a bad company and that it's not like that in most companies. Because of those, I don't apply for jobs, my life goes to shit, I feel anxious and I have panick attacks, but I suppress those feelings with ice cream, computer games and porn in order to make life as comfortable as I can.

5nsgh0,1,2017-01-13,25y/o vfx artist back to school,vfxback2school,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nsgh0/25yo_vfx_artist_back_to_school/,"Hey guys, so I was recently just offered an internship with an intent to extend to an actual contract position and then perhaps full-time if they see I'm doing well, etc. at a major game studio in NorCal for VFX.

Great! However, after about two years of looking for work I kinda pivoted a bit to CS and started moving towards a tech-art position (thought it'd be easier to get a job in) and the thing is...I really like programming and moreover, think it'll be better for me in the long run (career-wise).

I recognize I'm not the best at programming/math and am not going to be inventing ""innovative, algorithmically complex, and ingenious code"", however I can already see how being able to make a couple of tools in c# to get things done quicker in my VFX is going to be invaluable. 

My question was...what should I do?

The company told me if after the internship I did well, they'd hire me as a contractor for VFX. I'm just wondering though...should I keep trying to finish school? 

Should I tell them I want to go back to school after the summer? Or should I try to work something out where I take a semester off (not sure if this is even possible) and just alternate until I finish up.

In you guys' experience, do companies, especially huge companies, like it that their employees are trying to learn new things?

This would be my second degree and I already checked that there is like...one school in the norCal that does offer second degrees. So I could enroll there.

It would really only be two years of just programming since I got my general requirements and just have to finish a couple of upper division math courses this semester to be able to ""transfer"" in to that other uni in the bay.

Or would you guys just say screw it and maybe do a bootcamp? 

I'm mostly concerned because it would just be a contract position (three month renewals), so it's not anything that's...""for sure"".

Also...I think I just really want to be a tech artist! I like making vfx, but the programming part is just super interesting and even if I don't become a ""Technical Artist"", knowing how to read the code errors that come up from time to time and being able to fix it without having to bother/slack a programmer sounds like a dream!

Any general advice is welcomed!!

thank you guys!"

I go into the room, log in, test every key, no issues, it's running fine. Then I look down at the keyboard and find out that a student thought it would be a good idea to use white-out on EVERY key on an all-white keyboard.

After my discovery I left if alone. I figured they would be able to manage with this issue. But then, the decided it would be a good idea to color in the keys with a magic marker...

5nskvb,4,2017-01-13,Worth it to intern at a small startup in Silicon Valley?,birdkickr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nskvb/worth_it_to_intern_at_a_small_startup_in_silicon/,"Hi /r/cscareerquestions,

I am about to receive an offer for a small startup in Silicon Valley for around 30-35 dollars an hour without a housing stipend. I believe I will be working with a very small team of 5 - 10 engineers throughout the summer. The company itself is not well-known but is backed by reputable firms such as Y Combinator. 

My question is if this is a good opportunity as this will be the last internship before I will be looking for a full-time offer next year. Comparing myself with the things that I see on this sub, I feel like this is low pay in a place with very high COL. Although I feel like this will be a great opportunity to work with a small team and challenge myself intellectually, I'm a little scared that working at a company without a reputable name will make it harder for me to find a full-time position next year. 

I also previously received an offer for $27 dollars with $5K housing stipend in a low COL area for a company that is well-known but does not have high recruiting standards and is fairly bureaucratic with low GlassDoor rankings. Although working here would definitely give me more money in the short term and will have a recognizable name, I'm not sure about its internship program. Note that although it is a recognizable company, it is not highly regarded by all means.

Is it safe to say my best option is the SV startup? Overall is the startup offer reasonable? I have been seeing many individuals on this sub that are getting top companies in the area that are making much more in terms of salary alongside with getting a housing stipend. Although I don't come from a top school or have been coding since I was in high school, I still can't help but to compare myself to other high achievers. It does make me work harder and stand out from my peers at my university but at the same time still gives me a low sense of self worth."

After that i got lucky enough to land a internship position in IT systems for a hotel (paid internship) and i did that for 9 months (finishd in 2012).

Sadly after that internship i never managed to get another IT job mostly because all jobs i saw asked for collage grade school and that combined with the very low market for IT jobs in my city yeah a big fuck me in my face.

Since then i worked shit jobs (clerk, steward and waiter) (and yes never bothered to come back to school) and yesterday i saw an assistant systems without specific requirements so i was like ""Fuck it send resume lets see what happens"" and i got a email for a interview on monday 

So now im wondering if im actually capable of doing the job and i want to know opinions of people that work in the IT stuff

This is the things i did back in the internship days: 

 • Fixing, maintenance and building of pc's, customer/employee support (AKA cant enter my password) 

 • word documents (report and stuff) and excel documents (basic formulas), 

 • insalling pcs (AKA go connect a pc for someone and make sure you do nice cable management) 

 • on top of that this internship was my first experience in the hotel industry and my boss was pretty cool guy and push me to learn english 

i never really touched the servers and did very little work on the networking (but i understod the concept)

Fast forward 4 years (NOW) im more confident about my knowledge on the things i listed above, (mostly because im a tech fanboy) i got more experience on hotels by working other lower positions and my english i think is pretty good i can talk very fluent and i guess my grammar is shit.

and yes im thinking to get back to school this year i need to get a better job with more office like working hrs to be able to do it."

I'm applying to full time positions in CS/IT areas, but to be honest I feel like my actual work experience is a bit underwhelming. I think another internship would really help my resume but I'm not sure if companies want to have a summer intern who just graduated. Is it worth applying anyway? I'm looking at one listing for an IT internship that says they're looking for someone with an ""anticipated graduation between December 2017 and Summer 2018"" (mine would be June 2017), but it also says that students selected for the internship would be considered for full time employment. I think my ideal outcome from this summer would be if I could land a summer internship that led to full time employment, so this sounds like a good opportunity for me but I'm not sure if it's worth my time applying... Should I apply anyway or will I likely automatically be disqualified? (It's a pretty large company.) If I do apply should I bring this up in the cover letter? If so what should I say? Any other tips for getting internships as a soon to be graduated senior?"
5ntsfz,6,2017-01-13,How to manage a web developer?,benabus,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/5ntsfz/how_to_manage_a_web_developer/,"I'm a full-stack web developer.  In my department, I'm the ONLY web developer and my workload was getting to be too heavy for a single person.  Thankfully, the higher ups recognized this and got a part-time web developer to take up some of the load.

This guy was brought in to basically be my assistant, so while I'm not technically his boss (I don't set his hours or sign his timesheet or anything), I'm the one who gets to manage what projects he works on and oversee his work.  Thus far, I've given him one easy-ish project that I just haven't had the time to work on and I'm confident that he can handle it, so I've kind of given him free reign on it for the time being.

The problem is, I've never managed anyone before. I had an intern at one point a few years ago, but he didn't really do too much, so this is the first time I'm in any sort of a ""boss"" role. I've been planning on taking a laissez-faire approach and treating him how I like to be managed, but thinking back to my intern, I'm not sure this is a wonderful idea.  I don't want to micro-manage, but at the same time, I don't want him to take advantage of my inexperience and laid back attitude.  Another issue is that he's older and more experienced than I am, so it feels a little awkward telling him what to do and looking over his shoulder.

Up until now, my credo has been ""I'm just a web developer"", but I don't think this is going to fly in this scenario where I'm put into some sort of pseudo- supervisorial role.  It's only been a few days since he's started, so I'd greatly appreciate any sort of advice on managing before I screw up too badly and set poor precedents.

tl;dr
I'm a full-time web developer that needs advice on how to manage a part-time web developer working under me.

Any help would be appreciated."

Manager said he'd keep in touch over my school year but never got back to me.",Trollzore,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5nut4d/interned_for_a_big_company_never_got_official/,"Hi Reddit, I'm very lost. 

I'm a senior student majoring in CSCI and I'm graduating undergrad in May 2017.

I was a software engineering intern for a couple of months this summer at a big company in New York. While I was interning there, I was put on the spot with real world problems and supporting their infrastructure. I had to do a lot of back end development including C/C++, Java, Shell, Linux, and SQL stuff. In addition, they had me work on new features of projects on my own and document a lot of their legacy code.

I had to present my work not only to my manager, but to the project lead, and clients.

I got along with my team well, and my manager was always super excited and proud of my accomplishments in the short time period of my internship. He reviewed me on a weekly basis, and mentioned I even outperformed some of the senior employees.

The company even encouraged me to attend these cool meetings at their main New York City HQ, and flew me to their Florida HQ with all travel reimbursed.

With all of that said, my internship was (in my eyes) successful. On my last day, the whole office had a little surprise party for me with cake, and my manager has been in touch with me for a little afterwards while I was studying in college.

During the semester at school I realized I haven't heard back from my manager in a while... So I decided to email him. I never got a reply, and later found out he was let go (for financial reasons). I don't have any way to contact my former manager so I'm confused. I only had his work email and cell-phone. 

* I have even tried to contact the person who was in charge of my manager, but so far it's been a week with no response.

Now I'm left with not knowing what to do and feel lost with this situation. I never got a job offer either!

I'm starting the job application process, so I'm still just learning! I appreciate any advice!

I had a phone interview today with a company that I am really interested in! They seem like a great company. Things went very well, and I have moved on to the ""next round"" but there was one small issue I need help on!

I was initially interviewing for a position that I have decent background in--I have freelanced in the field for several years, and had a great internship with an S&amp;P 100 company, where I now have great contacts and recs. I know my value in that career path, and feel that the salary range is appropriate for the amount of work typical to that position.

During my interview for this familiar type of position, my interviewer really pressured me for a salary figure to work with--of course I tried to avoid an exact number, talked about how I was open to negotiating and understood working around an industry standard etc. etc. but basically she wasn't going to let the conversation move on until I gave some estimate, so I gave an appropriate range for that position. (I know, I know, that's a no-no but I wasn't sure how to do any more avoiding without losing out on the interview)!

Now, after talking for quite a while she tells me that the company is actually quite interested in taking me on for a much more high-stakes, higher pressure, much more interesting job----a management position. I'm definitely interested, so we talk more about that position and she's very open to me doing more research on that kind of role because I don't have much background in project management. Things go great and we seem to have pivoted to a job that's even more of a dream job to me than the initial position I had applied for...

But now I'm worried that she will take the number I had discussed for the ORIGINAL job I applied for as a hard number. This number would be quite low (we're talking at least 20k lower...) for a LOW end of the industry standard of the management role I am now being vetted for... This would obviously not only hurt me in terms of raises/promotions in THIS company, but would also be a bad start later down the road with other career opportunities.

So... Advice for discussing that salary discrepancy now that I'm being interviewed for a much more intensive role? I have some decent ideas on how to negotiate, but I would really, really appreciate input! Thanks guys!

tldr: Had a job interview for one job that turned into an interview for a more intensive job, but how can I avoid them insisting on the salary of the first job?"

This semester, I`m taking a course in which I will be studying towards the exam of a certification during the entire semester. My question is: which certification would be the best to study for? I`m new to IT and do not have any other certifications or professional experience. The only experience I have is what would be considered amateur, from building gaming PCs and fixing and troubleshooting personal computers.

I was considered studying towards the A+, however, many have told me that this certification is not very useful and beneficial for employment purposes. I was recommended the CCENT, then, CCNA (or go straight to this one). Instead of A+, then, Network+, then, Security+. As I do not have any professional experience, I thought the A+ would be a good foundation to gain knowledge in order to get an internship or even a part-time job.

If it matters, I`m taking the following courses this semester:

Intro to Computer Concepts - Project Management - Digital Hardware Basics - Computer Applications - Management of Technological Organizations - Certification Practicum in IT (course in question).

The following are the options that are available.

LabSim Courses for CompTIA: TestOut Linux Pro - TestOut Network Pro - TestOut PC Pro (A+) - TestOut Security Pro. LabSim Courses for Cisco: TestOut Routing and Switching Pro

My areas of interest are Cyber Security and Network Administration.

At this point, my gpa is around a 3.2. 

Moving forward a couple of weeks, I was contacted for an initial interview. It was just a couple of behavioral questions and technical questions; all of which I aced. Now, I have been contacted to go to the company's superday and will need to give an unofficial transcript to rsvp. Due to two new F's, my gpa has sunk down to 2.85. 

From the companies website, the job listing states that a cgpa of 3.0 is the required minimum for this position, so I'm at a lost of ideas on what to do. If I give them my transcript, I'm afraid they will decline my interview offer due to a gpa below their standard.

Without this requirement, I'm certain that I would nail the final interviews as my resume is quite good (nice previous internship related to big data/spark, and impressive side projects). I also have been practicing hackerrank/ leetcode(maybe too much). I know that I could forge a transcript, but I'm guessing I would be caught in a mandatory background check.

Its not that I don't try in school, I try a bit too hard. I was managing another job, in addition to taking a full course load with some graduate level courses while I am an undergrad. I also go to a top university with rigorous testing. 

Is there any suggestions on how I should message hr about this issue or just roll the dice and submit my transcript. I don't want to be taken out of contention solely based on gpa as it is a dream job."

And I seem to actually enjoy it more than chemistry too!

My little brother graduated in 2014 with a CS degree and average grades from the same college. A relatively recent CS degree is obviously the key to getting the job I want. He got a great job right out of the gate with zero internships or work experience (unlike me who had a two year paid stint in a lab). He keeps on telling me I'd really like his job and he offered to help me out this way. He's willing to close his LinkedIn and stuff because he doesn't need to use it at all for at least the next year. I'd keep the same SSN and just tell my employers that I went by [my brother's name] while in college, and that I first entered college several years past the norm.

I don't have enough money, time, or good enough credit to slog through yet another 4 year degree. I know I have the skills because a wide variety of people have been impressed by my work, including hiring managers, but that measly little piece of paper is the only thing stopping me from actually starting a career.

I was debating whether to major in MIS or Supply Chain. I have never coded before, and know nothing about it, but was always interested in working with computer programs and such. 

I really don't want to do a help desk job, though. Why?

Just entering the industry, I probably shouldn't be so picky. I would like to be a network administrator eventually.

Here's the question as direct as possible.  I evenually would love to work in information security, and I know it is a good mix of being a vigilant badass and stuck in a lot of meetings.  Here are my thoughts.

1st option.  Eastern Illinois University has an Management Information Systems program which is a mix of busiess courses and IT course.  They offer a master's in cybersecurity if I wanted to go that route, which looks enticing to me. Thought with this is to get the bachelor's degree and get my certifications while still in school--security+, etc.

2nd option.  Illinois State University has an information security and assurance program which is more technical and specific.  Same thing here about getting certifications.

Hoping to intern both junior and senior years--so any advice for figuring that out would be great.  Side note:  I enjoy working with people, but if I need to be a code warrior, so be it...Im sure I'll enjoy both.   Thanks for any help!

anyone else feel like being a cs (or any other form on engineering for that matter) is a huge drain on their mental well being?  I'm an A/B student with a nice internship lined up for the summer, but I feel like in order to achieve that, I've had to give up eating, sleeping, friendship, and any sort of joy or relaxation I previously had in my life. When I'm not working or in class, I'm at Siebel, more often than not for 7 hours a day. Don't get me wrong, I truly enjoy coding/computer science, but now that academics have consumed my entire life, that enjoyment is sort of gone. I feel like I'm mentally starting to burn out, and the constant stress and testing is starting to wear hard on my motivation. I don't want to look back on my college years and see nothing but studying. It's just that any time I decide fuck it, I'll make time for something else, I quite literally fail tests, like maintaining my grades takes all my concentration.

Anyone else like cs but feel like the coursework is slowly killing them?

tldr; The time commitment required to do well in school/internships for computer science has pretty much consumed my life and I don't know what to do about it other than let my grades tank."
5o0cbz,2,2017-01-14,Is that how working in an office should be?,throwaway1127652,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5o0cbz/is_that_how_working_in_an_office_should_be/,"Using throwaway for obvious reasons. I'll try to not get too specific about my job, but I also want to give as many info so you can understand.

Me:
This is my first job ever, right after college. The only jobs I've had were internships and for some reasons I did all my internships working from home. So it is my first office job. I’ve been working 6 months there and it is not what I imagined it would be. I don't have a lot of friends and I just don't have a lot of people who can give me their input of what work is suppose to be. As I said, I have NO OFFICE WORK EXPERIENCE, so I just have no clue of what office work feels like in terms of relationship with boss.

 I'm in the marketing department of a small manufacturing company and I basically do social media posts, taking pictures, photoshop, spy on other companies, and write newsletters and blog posts. And my problem is I am bored at work. It's 8 to 5 and it's very slow.

The work environment:
It is a small manufacturing company, and I was very excited when I got the job. Got a job right after graduation, I am very lucky! The offices are kind of scattered throughout the place, but most of them are in the same area. My boss and I share the same office space, and we are away from everybody. It's mostly him and I in the office. And he gives me stuff to do, but I don't have a deadline for all of these tasks. I don't feel a sense of urgency and therefore I kind of take all my time to do the job, and I just don't feel motivated to do the job. 

My boss has bipolar disorder (one day he said he had to live early to get his bipolar medications) and now I understand the several mood switch. He doesn't speak much during the day, mostly behind his computer, headphones on. And so I don't know what he is working on.
I spoke about that to my mother already. She thinks that we are supposed to be a team, and therefore he should tell me sometimes what project he is working on. I wanted to know what you think about that?

He does give me tasks to do, but there would be very big tasks. Like to do over the week, such as “do a brochure for the company”. This is a very big project, and I have no creative skills and very little experience. I was able to create a very rough draft, and gave it to him, he said he will take a look at it. So far it has been 2 weeks and the brochure is still on his desk.

Everyday I come into work wondering how I am going to occupy my day. Since I have no daily deadlines, I struggle to stay motivated and create my own agenda. I need more guidelines than that. The days are very long, and I usually do something productive for like 2-3 hours a day, and the 6-7 hours left, I am on facebook or reddit.

I do want to post on social media, write newsletters and things like that. He actually asked me once to do a social media calendar, which is a big project for me. I started on one, send it to him, but I haven’t heard back.
One day I posted on social media, and I got an email from him (same office, and didn’t speak out) about a typo I’ve done, therefore he deleted it and changed it. I understand, but since this day, I asked his permission for posting on social media. So instead of posting 2-3 times a day like I thought I would be doing, I do every 2-3 days.

I have no clue what my boss is working on. Seriously. And I have very little guidelines. I thought work would be more pleasant than that. I do ask him about what I should work on, but the problem is he is bipolar, and I don’t know what mood he will be on at this minute. I get scared every time to ask about work. I feel like that’s something I should know, and he will be upset at me.

I am so stressed about this situation. My husband and I are planning to move to a big city this year or next year, so I thought I just handle it for a year, but this is becoming unbearable. I am so stressed I have insomnia weekly, and I think about work all the times, such as “how I am going to occupy my day on Monday?”

I’ve also been wondering is maybe the marketing field isn’t for me. I’ve read on a couple of reddit thread that Marketing is mostly doing research.

I forgot to mention I am a very social person. I barely drink any coffee, but at work I would get a new cup every 2-3 hours only to get away from the office and have conversations with people. So the situation of me in front of a computer 9 hours a day depresses me a lot. I also don’t like spending money out to eat, but everyday at lunch I go to a fast food to eat and play on my phone for an hour, only to get away from the office. Instead of eating at my desk. Boss doesn’t take lunch break.

I am not asking for advice. I know what I can do to deal better: talk to him, get my own work schedule, quit, etc. I am aware of that, but it’s harder to actually do that.
I am asking for YOUR work situation. If my situation is a normal way to work, and that’s how work is: meaning you don’t know what your boss is working on and you are basically on your own most of the time. Or is my work not normal because of me? Because my boss is lacking experience in managing people? (don’t know about that, I am just assuming).

Boss was hire 2-3 months before me, and there was another girl on my spot, but she didn’t stay long. One day she left for lunch, and never went back. She sent an email to the president saying she quits. I am saying that because I am the only one who struggle with Boss managing style.

Thanks for your input!

TD;DR. First office job, right out of college. Marketing department. Boss is bipolar and have mood switch, doesn’t give me enough directives and feedback, and communication in general. Left on my own, stressed and not motivated. Is that what work should be?

So I had my first code challenge today for a big 5 internship. I've been preparing for quite a bit actually and I thought I had my nerves in check. So I open the challenge and there are 2 questions, both around a medium difficulty on leetcode. So I'm pretty nervous but I know I can solve them both because I've done very similar problems before. Slowly, I start panicking more and more and can barely do anything. I get lightheaded, can barely think/code and just overall perform horribly. I've never experienced nerves like this. They mentioned that I should solve the questions within 90 minutes to have a serious shot of progressing, but I could not do so. I took a walk straight after to clear my head and I came back and solved the questions almost immediately. What do you suggest I do about this and help prep for my upcoming code challenges/interviews. 

Thanks again


tl:dr 

- Had code challenge today for big 5 company
- Got so nervous that I could barely answer the questions
- Currently freaking out if I'll get any internships this year"

I'm going to be graduating with a CS degree but have a concentration in cybersecurity. I've been applying for jobs with what I think are pretty realistic goals (entry level, pays around 45k so I can pay off my loans) but have gotten nothing back. I got called for an interview and then they cancelled it without telling me. I've applied for software engineer, systems analyst, infosec and data analyst jobs and tailor a cover letter for all of them but still have nothing. 

Most of the ""entry level"" jobs I see want 3-10 years of experience and I don't apply to a lot of them because I don't have that experience (I've only had one internship). Some people in in my program have already gotten offers before 2017 started and I need a job before I graduate. Do I need to lower my standards a bit or is this normal?"

I'm a recent college graduate (political science) at a crossroads right now. I turned 24 a few months ago. I work at a great company full time, even though I don't make a ton of money (without getting into specifics, I make just under 30k a year...before taxes). I graduated college in the summer of 2015, so well less than a year ago.

My biggest goal for 2017 is to move out of my parents' place. I'm paying off student loans and a car, however, that is on top of my various other mandatory expenditures. To round it to a good, even, workable number, I'm paying 500 bucks a month in bills...that's not cool when I pretty much only make 500 bucks a week.

Granted, I don't plan on staying at this company for more than a year, I've been there for five and a half months, so I'm getting to the point where I either plant my roots or look for something else. I'm trying to go for the latter. I'm updating my resume and my LinkedIn profile and once I hit the 6 month mark, I'm starting the job hunt again. If there's a silver lining to my situation, I stumbled into a GREAT internship at the end of college and the job I work right now is highly technical, so I'm pretty confident in my resume.

Anyway, I could live on my own if i found a cheap enough place, but I'd be struggling. My best friend is 3 years younger than me, and he's the ONLY person I'd consider living with. My friends who are my age are deadbeats, even though I love them to death. Unfortunately, he's a computer technician (graduated debt-free with an IT degree) with a long term girlfriend who's more than happy living with his parents and girlfriend for the foreseeable future. So, realistically, I can't count on him to decide to move out any time soon.

On top of that, I lose my insurance at the end of this year...I have Crohn's disease and asthma, so I'll have to start paying out of pocket for my own insurance AND my own medicine (I already pay for my own medicine, insurance is a different animal) in October. Just one more thing to pay for, man. I'm scared to death that I'll be living with my folks at age 30.

I'm probably overthinking things, and I'll be looking for a new job in the coming weeks, but I'm freaking out and could use some advice. I hate to say this, but damn, this is one time in my life that I wish I had a significant other to team up with. I've spent most of my adult life being single and I enjoy the stability and lack of commitment, but fuck, I feel like I'm getting a little old for that too."

I'm currently pursuing a Master's in CS after working ~3 years as an Industrial Engineer (this was my undergrad degree). I work and go to school full-time. It's been working out well but I'm interested in getting a CS internship for the summer.

At my current job, I make ~$90,000 a year and love the job stability, as well as the flexibility to study and work at the same time. However, my job has little-to-no applicability to software development and I'm worried that I won't be able to find a CS job after I graduate if I don't have any internship or professional experience. Of course, after the internship ends I'll go back to school but likely be jobless until I graduate (May 2018). 

Any advice on my situation would be appreciated. Is it worth quitting a decent job to get some development experience under my belt? "

5o2nmb,57,2017-01-15,The Man in the Gray Robe,Kryptonovich,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5o2nmb/the_man_in_the_gray_robe/,"Until you’ve had to stay awake - to *have* to not go to sleep, no matter what - you’ll never know what it’s like. The anxiety nipping at your heels, every minute of every hour of every day, that somehow, you’ll mess up and fall asleep. The terror just gnawing at you as you’re on your couch at night, feeling yourself about to nod off. The knowledge that if you *do* fall asleep, and have to face what’s waiting for you in your dreams, you’re finished. 

I should start from the beginning. It…well, it all goes back to my mother. 

My mother had raised me alone ever since my father ran out on us when I was two, and…she and I were never close as I was growing up. For years I wanted us to be, and for years she frustrated me in that area. I mean, she cared for me, provided for me, supported me, but she was always distant. Just…cold. She never told me she loved me. She never really hugged me, or got close, or treated me warmly. She was polite, kind, reasonable, but…that was about it. And in the end, it got to me, and over the years I got bitter toward her for it. Real bitter, even though I couldn’t quite conceptualize at the time *why* I was so hurt.

I remember being eighteen, packing my bags in my room. I’d graduated high school, was still waiting to hear back if I got into university, but at the same time still needing to get out. Like I said, I hadn’t by that point really put my finger on *why* I couldn’t bear to be under the same roof as my mother, but I did know that I had to get out.

I looked up midway through packing to see her standing in the doorway, her face expressionless, but…her voice betrayed her somewhat.

“Where are you going?” she asked, her voice slightly unsteady.

“Somewhere, anywhere,” I replied, looking back to my suitcase as I worked.

She paused before continuing. “You haven’t even given me any information, where I can reach you.” 

“Yeah, well,” I answered back, my eyes still on my open suitcase “if I need you, I’ll call you.”

“You’re not being a good son by doing this,” she snapped, finally frustrated.

I paused, feeling anger welling up inside of me. I looked back at her, and just barely managed to keep myself civil. “I’ve given everything I have to give.” I paused, then continued. “I’m leaving, and I’m sorry if you can’t accept that.”

She just stared at me for a few moments, and then turned and walked out of the room and down the hallway and into her own room.

I was out of the house later that day. She never even saw me out the door. At the time I thought it was typical of our relationship - she just didn’t give a damn. But now I know that she never saw me out the door because it hurt her too much to see me go, and to see me go in a way that seemed to confirm to her that I didn’t care about her. 

So I got to another province successfully, got word that I had made it into university, and I went. Four years later, I had an English degree. Then I went to journalism school, and then I got a job at a major paper in Vancouver. Life was good - I was making good money, in a field I loved, but…I wasn’t happy. There was an emptiness in my heart. It took me a few years to realize, with the help of a good amount of therapy, that it was my mother. I’d never gotten a sense of closure with her, because I’d never fixed things. So, I decided I needed to attend to that. I made my decision a day before I got the phone call from her. See, she’d tracked me down to tell me she was dying.

How did I feel about it? A mix of emotions. I was, in a way, heartbroken - *just* as I had come to terms with how I was raised by her, and had firmly decided to make things right, she was leaving me - forever. But I had a duty. So I shoved my heartbreak aside, and went to work fulfilling that duty.

I took a sabbatical from work and flew out to the sleepy little suburb I grew up in the next day. I knocked on the door, the paint on it chipped and worn with time, and after a moment, she answered. She looked older, more worn and tired, but still just as beautiful in her own way - her auburn hair tied into a ponytail and her emerald green eyes standing out. But…she acted differently this time. Her eyes widened and I saw life just shoot into them as she saw me.

“Oh, Anthony!” she exclaimed, embracing me in a tight hug. She led me into the house, where she got my coat off and quickly started to set the table…before I stopped her, forcefully reminding her that *I* was there to take care of *her*.

From then on, for the last few months we had, things were different. She was warm, loving, kind. Everything I’d needed growing up but had never gotten. I couldn’t figure it out, and I felt, for some reason, that it’d be inappropriate to inquire, so I didn’t.

Then came the day she died. With me at her bedside were the friends she’d had her whole life - spiritual types. New Age, that kind of thing. As they were with me, it occurred to me that she’d always been far closer to them than she ever was with me, and that I’d remembered her always being up to all sorts of activities with them, things I was never allowed to get any hint of.

But we were there, and Mom told them all to give us a moment. So, the various men and women left. Then Mom, looking so thin and so frail, rested her tired, old eyes on me, and gripped my hand.

“I’m sorry,” she said, her voice just fraught with weakness, “for being so cold and so distant your whole life. I…I needed to be. I don’t expect you to understand, but…in my time, both before and after you were born, I fought a lot of battles, and made a lot of people very angry.” She paused, tears coming to her eyes, and when she spoke again, her voice broke. “Everything I *did*, I did to *protect* you.” At this, I stroked her face and gripped her hand back.

“Mom, no, it’s fine. I get it. What matters is that we have *right now*, that’s all that matters.” My voice was calm but urgent - conciliatory. I needed to calm her down.

Mom nodded quickly, blinking her tears away. Then she continued. “Just know, no matter what - I love you, and the one thing I’ve always tried to do is be there for you. Even when you never knew it.” I nodded, trying to convey understanding, even though I didn’t really understand at all. 

Finally, she told me to go get everyone else back in the room, and I did. Fifteen minutes later she was dead.

What else is there to say? I handled the funeral arrangements, and then headed back to my life in Vancouver.

As I got home and got back to my life, I tried to fathom what had happened. My mother had been so distant and cold my whole life, and in the end it drove me away from her entirely the moment I hit adulthood. I’d had so much pain and angst inside of me for so many years over it, with me being unable to really work out what it was that was raging inside of me. And it messed me up. Then Mom calls me home, and she’s totally different. It was so off and jarring, but I realized inside of me a great regret that I’d never tried to work things out with her, never tried to really *make things work*. I did have our last few months together, but it was far too short. As I returned to my ordinary routine, I realized that I’d always have that regret inside of me.

So I got back to my life, and that’s when it started.

I’d been home for about a week or two when it happened. I’d gotten home from a long day at work, chasing a story on corporate fraud that I was pretty sure the CEOs in questions knew about and were trying to cover up. I got my shoes off, and collapsed onto the bed, beat. I had literally run myself ragged all over town, getting quotes, interviews, the whole deal, including interviewing a mid-level corporate lawyer as he sat in the backseat of my car, which was parked in an alley (he absolutely could not be seen speaking to me). So, suffice it to say, I was pretty tired. So like I said, I collapsed onto the bed and I was asleep minutes later.

I opened my eyes what seemed like seconds after I closed them. I was standing by a dark, pitch black river, illuminated by moonlight. It was cold. The river…it stretched on forever, and there was no horizon at the end of it…just this shroud of deep darkness.

Then I noticed him, out of the corner of my eye. This tall, rail-thin man in a dark gray monk’s robe. He was bald, and his skin was deeply wrinkled. His eyes were completely dark, and in his hand…in his hand was a long, curved knife, dripping with blood.

My heart started to pound as I started to get really, really scared. At that moment, he started to walk toward me. I wanted to run but I couldn’t move - I was frozen in place, somehow. So I’m standing there, trying to figure out what to do, and then, when he’s just about close to me…I wake up.

When I shot up in my bed, my mouth was dry as a desert and my heart was desperately trying to beat its way out of my chest. Rattled, I got up and went to the bathroom. I turned the light on and stared at myself in the mirror. My hair was a mess and my eyes were wide, and I looked…just scared. Scared as hell. I wasn’t sure why, exactly - it was just a dream, after all. But it felt and seemed so *real*. At the time I thought it was nothing, but I’d later realize exactly why I felt that way.

I didn’t sleep for the rest of that night. I laid awake in bed, unable to fall asleep, and then when morning came, I got dressed and went to work. I would later wish that I’d have been able to keep that natural inability to fall asleep.

Work was…weird. I…I don’t know how to describe it. Something was happening to me, and I only started to realize it that day.

It came on really hard as I was in an interview in the Starbucks inside the Metrotown Chapters Bookstore, in Burnaby. 

“So the truth is, of *course* the money’s being laundered, but the *real* question is, does Mr. Ladner and the other executives on the Board *know* about it? Now, to get to that…” Jerald Cheng, the lawyer from the other day, was telling me. But I couldn’t pay attention. I was just too anxious. I had this feeling like I was being watched, like I was being followed by someone. And something deeper - this tense, anxious feeling inside my chest, and a kind of fear of something bad happening to me. I tried to focus, tried to stay on track with the interview, but within the next fifteen minutes, I couldn’t pay attention to a word he was saying, I was so anxious.

 So, I broke off the interview. Jerald was somewhat upset - after all, he was risking a lot by being seen with me. But what could I do? My mind wasn’t on the game. So, I canceled. 

I spent the rest of the day just trying to clear my head, shake off what I was feeling. I grabbed some lunch at Cafe Crepe on Granville, then spent the day wandering downtown. But the anxious and tense feeling I had, the feeling of being watched and followed, wouldn’t shake off. 

I got home at around six in the evening. I went straight to bed, deciding to sleep it all off.

I never expected what would happen next. 

I woke up on the ground. The ground was made up of wet dirt, and it was cold and windy. Carefully getting up on my feet, I examined my surroundings. I was in the woods, and a ways down was the river, where I’d been standing before when I last dreamed. The feeling of being watched hit me in a massive, strong wave. Trying to stay calm, I looked ahead of me and saw him - the man in the robe. He smiled this…this horrifying, awful smile, and slowly approached me. Frozen in place, I couldn’t move. But as he approached me, he briefly stopped and looked off to the side, deep into the dark expanse of the rest of the woods, and his face…his face started to look somewhat worried, as if something he hadn’t expected was going to happen. But then, after a moment, he looked back at me and the smile was back on and he was walking toward me yet again. 

As he reached me, I decided to try and talk this out. “Who are you?” I said, my voice cracking with fear. He responded by raising the knife and…and *driving it* into my shoulder, all slow. The pain screamed through my arm and my body. My heart was pounding, as if it was gonna break out of my chest. He drove the knife deeper, and deeper in, and as I looked at the knife in my shoulder, my blood…it was *dark black* - not even red. Like oil, actually, in colour. But something else happened, something weird. As the knife was being driven into my shoulder, I felt *vicious* pain inside of me, as if my organs were being ripped apart - as if I was coming undone. I screamed even louder, moreso in terror than in pain, screaming for help, for relief. Then…then something odd happened. The man stopped, and his eyes went wide, and…I woke up.

I shot up in bed, terrified. Overwhelmed, mere seconds after I woke up, I leaned over the edge of my bed and vomited. But…what terrified me the most wasn’t actually in the dream. For some reason, my shoulder still hurt, like it was on fire. I reached over and rubbed it…only to feel an open, raw, knife wound. A wound that hadn’t been there when I got undressed for bed hours earlier. 

I jumped up and raced into the bathroom, switching the light on and staring at my shoulder hard in the mirror. There it was - red, inflamed and bloody. I twisted my shoulder a bit, feeling the raw shock of pain and sensitivity as I did so. My eyes were wide and shot with terror as I tried to work this out. The dream had felt real, and was *real enough* that something had happened to me in real life. 

This may sound crazy, but…I decided, after heavy thought, that this was real. There was something in my dreams that was after me, and the harm it had done to me had transitioned into the real world. The wound in my shoulder was a knife wound - *nothing* else could have caused it. I knew because I’d seen photos of knife wounds in case files in my work as a journalist - what was in my shoulder matched it to a tee. 

I mean, it was *crazy* - how could something in a dream have real-life effects? Of course, at first I thought someone had broken into my apartment. But I checked the security footage of my entire apartment as I slept, and…nothing. I was alone in my apartment, the whole time I slept. So that caused a huge bunch of things to run through my mind - how could this be happening? *What* was happening? I spent an hour surfing the Internet, trying to come up with a clear answer - but in the end, nothing. So in the end, my mind…oh God, I couldn’t make sense of this at all. I started to panic, and…well, in the end, I did the only thing I could do. I picked the most obvious, albeit short-term, solution, and ran with it. I decided to just not go to sleep, at least until I could figure all this out.

So, over the next few days, I lived entirely on not just food and liquids, but caffeine pills. I was determined to stay awake until I could figure out what was going on and what I could do about it. That didn’t go well, though, as I had no idea what was happening to me and what was after me, and no idea where to start looking for answers. So eventually I settled into an uncomfortable truth that, honestly, I just tried to not think about because it was so terrifying: I could only stay awake for so long, and eventually I would fall asleep, and when that happened, the man in the robe would get me. 

It’s odd, living in that mindset. You know you’re marching toward the inevitable, and that produces in you this natural state of deep-seated anxiety, but there’s nothing you can do about it, so you just shove it down and try not to deal with it. More than once I wondered if this is what people on death row felt as the dates of their execution approached.

Things went somewhat well, but…not well in other ways. I worked during the day, and during the night I did more work, along with watching Netflix and going on early morning jogs. I just needed to stay active, right, just stay active, keep it moving, don’t stop for anything, don’t let myself get caught off-guard. But I had that anxious feeling like I was being watched…like the man in the robe was just waiting for me to slip up, and then catch me. And, on top of this, all my time awake started to take a toll on me.

I was on my third straight day being up, and I was starting to unravel. I was feeling extremely anxious due to the sleep deprivation, and I was extremely irritable. The day as this all started to unravel, I was sitting at my desk working on a story. I was on my fifth draft - I just couldn’t get it right and it was *pissing me off so damned much*. Lynn, an intern who had been there for the past month and who I’d told could come to me if she needed help with anything, approached my desk.

“Uh, Anthony,” she started hesitantly, apparently noticing how high-strung I was, “I was wondering if you could give me any pointers for interviewing the big names? I’ve got an interview with *the Premier*, and I was thinking-”

I snapped. I whirled around, and shot out, “Lynn, I’m really busy now and I don’t have any bloody time to hold your hand, so could you try and work it out on your own or talk to someone else who *actually has the time*?” 

Lynn’s eyes went wide, and she went quiet, before she started to stutter out an apology, and then a moment later hurried off. I exhaled deeply and went back to work, my hands trembling slightly on their own as I typed. 

I also started to see things in the corner of my eye, and some even in my direct vision - odd things, some of which were typical of sleep deprivation, and others…others which weren’t. Rotting corpses. Bloody, stillborn infants. It terrified the living hell out of me, but I dealt with it because I had no other option. I could tell something was creeping up on me, something horrifying, but I had no idea what to do about it. So I just kept keeping on keeping on, delaying the inevitable by not thinking about it. This had the effect, consequently, of me being constantly terrified - *knowing* something terrible was bound to happen eventually, but not being able to do anything about it. And I had to deal with it. I mean, I couldn’t *tell* anyone about it - no one would understand. So I was alone in facing this.

Things came to a head that night. I was watching TV, and unbeknownst to me at the time, I’d forgotten to pop a caffeine pill. So I’m watching the TV, and before I knew it, my eyes were closed and I was immersed in a dream.

I opened my eyes to see the man in the gray robe standing directly in front of me in the midst of the darkened forest, his mouth wide in a horrifying smile, the bloody knife in his hand. As my heart began to beat wildly in sheer terror, and tears began to run down my face, I idly noticed how yellow and rotted his teeth were. He slowly, myself frozen in place, drove the knife into my stomach, pain shooting through me like fire. His eyes came alive with horrific glee, and the fiery pain rippled through my entire body, and that old feeling of every part of me starting to feel torn apart, that started too. As he began to drive the knife deeper in, I knew…I knew that this time, this was it. There’d be no escape. It was this sick, hopeless, horrible feeling that, at first, was only deep in my stomach, then spread throughout me, which quickly gave rise to panic. And in that panic, I began to scream wildly.

But only just as the knife entered me…something happened. A blinding white light filled the expanse of the forest, and suddenly I found I could move again. I stepped back quickly, and felt something very ticklish and tingly at the spot in my stomach where the knife went in. I looked down quickly to see that it had healed immediately. I looked up at the sound of screaming. The man in the gray robe was on the ground, engulfed in flames, rolling around on the ground desperately and screaming horribly. My eyes wide and I was shot through with shock, as I watched him scream and scream as the flames burnt him more and more, his flesh and clothes being burned away so quickly, until nothing was left but an ashen skeleton.

The man gone, I looked over to the source of the light, and…and I saw her. I saw my mother. She was standing, brilliant and shining, dressed in a pristine white gown, and looking just as she had when I was a child - radiant and beautiful. She smiled warmly at me as I felt tears of both joy and deep sadness run down my face. Mom was here - oh my God, Mom was here to save me. I opened my mouth to speak, but before I could, she cut me off.

“Wake up,” she said as she smiled down at me. And…I did.

I woke up in my bed, calm and peacefully. I felt my stomach and my shoulder - the knife wound in my shoulder was gone, and there was no wound in my stomach. I sat there for a few moments in silence, trying to process everything. And then…then I wept. I cried and cried and cried, so hard, for the next half hour, with a flood of thoughts and feelings about my mother overwhelming me, making everything so startlingly clear. All that time spent apart from me, keeping her distance, trying to protect me from the world she lived in, not ever getting too close for fear of drawing me into it or, through her love for me, drawing attention to me from beyond. And even after she was gone, stepping in to protect me from those forces that would seek to harm me as a last ditch effort against her.

I never had any other nightmares like that after that night. So, how did I move forward? I lived. I lived, and sought out the best life had to offer, and I found it. Four years after the end of all that, I was married, and two years after that, we had our first child. Jacob is four now, and while I know I can’t protect him the way my mother protected me…I know I have the privilege, the *gift*, of loving him outwardly and warmly the way my mother never could with me when she was raising me. 

And above all else, I’ll never forget her and what she did for me - from when I was a child to now. 

I love you, Mom. Thank you so much.

5o2opw,1,2017-01-15,Is it possible for me to transfer in my current situation?,Riftenzo,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o2opw/is_it_possible_for_me_to_transfer_in_my_current/,"I am going into my second semester of my first year at a good public university yet I still feel that I want to transfer. Family and friends said this feeling would pass and most students feel that way at the beginning, and while I'm doing very well and have made close friends, I still want to transfer. My major is Political Science and I am leaning towards a double major in Econ and I feel as though I would have better chances at a school that was more focused on either of these two degrees. Also, I am not really close to any internship opportunities. I don't want anyone to think that I'm aiming for a more prestigious or big name school too, I would just like to attend a school that's more focused on my major. Ultimately, I just don't feel comfortable and I'm not really looking forward to another three years.

I am not really sure who to ask for advice and googling has not really answered my questions.

My situation might be a bit complicated too so I'll lay it out.

-It's my first year but I have a sophomore standing (credit wise) and will have a junior standing by fall 2017. I understand a lot of colleges will not accept a student with more than 60 credits so trying for spring of 2018 or fall 2018 would probably not be doable (unless there is some way around this, or even doing an extra year).

-I attend a pretty large school with large classes, and while that isn't a great excuse for not getting to know my professors, I only have maybe one that I could ask for a recommendation and she did not teach a class that directly related to my major.

-The deadline for fall of 2017 for most schools that I am interested in is March 1st or 15th. I was a dumbass during winter break and spent it stressing while not actually doing anything or preparing documents and such.

Is it even worth trying with my situation? Hell, is it even possible?

I'll be thankful for any advice considering I haven't got anyone else to talk with this about. I feel like I'm stuck. I'll be willing to give any extra info in the comments."

I have been having difficulties getting a single offer for an internship. I have applied already 60 companies and more than half of those come from my school job board. I have received 6 responses so far and all are rejections. On top of that I am atrocious at interviews (actually laughably bad); so even if I do ever get a interview I would struggle hard (I cant get them at the moment so this is not what I am focused on).

Currently for applying I go to career fairs, apply through school job boards, some networking events, utilize friends (rejected from all of these companies), companies at hackathons, and last resort online companies. I am not sure where else to attack from.

I have had friends interning at Microsoft and other big companies look at my resume, my school career services, and I have posted it here as well for feedback; many of them say my layout and writing is good or only need small fixes, but I lack content which I am not surprised because I have only been in the major for one year. So I do not believe the issue is my resume, more of my lack of experience. I transferred into the major and I only have this summer and next to get an internship since I only need cs classes to graduate. Next summer I want to work at a bigger more well known company and this summer work at a smaller company.

I probably could more easily get research in a CS field this summer as an alternative, but doing that would obviously forgo getting industry experience. I have not decided yet if I want to go to grad school either because I may want to do ML which requires a PhD (would want to work somewhere like Google X so not basic ML either). I would do research during the academic year as my alternative if I got an internship this summer, but my chances are literally dwindling by the day. I do not know how to approach this either. I am not excluding myself to only ML internships either because I will gain experience at any internship.

As I keep applying to internships the shear stress if bringing me down. I find myself being more and more depressed because I feel helpless and unable to got an internship which so many of my other friends have; waking up in the middle of the night and almost crying a few times. Obviously I do not want to compare myself to others because everyone moves at a different pace, but I feel as though this is going to reflect on my ability once I graduate. I do not want to end up working at some small company doing basic software. I want to be a leader in the industry and work on something bigger that can and will affect millions of people (Microsoft, Nvidia, Intel, Google come to mind). Yea I know you can do this at a smaller company as well, but I like the culture of working on big teams and places because I like to meet and work with many people.

Thanks in advance for any insight or advice you can give!"

This idea came to me when the Chief Science Officer of  the Institute I went to do an internship at said &gt;"" Wouldn't it be great if we could do  analysis on our phones, I guess we'll have that soon"" &gt;

That time, I was the only CS student that had come to train in the  Bioinformatics Department, the rest being PhD students of Microbiology, Biostatistics and other trades.Even though  I was a CS student, I had not done any android app development at that time, so didn't really think about it.

However, things are different now, as I've already made quite a few android apps (  productivity apps with a lot of algorithmic implementation )  for myself, and as college projects.

Now for my final dissertation, I would like to make a bioinformatics project (an Android App ) that would help solve a problem (or hopefully many problems )  for the common bioinformatician of today.

*I would love to hear from you what you'd want in a Bioinformatics app so that I could implement that functionality, and make it available to all the bioinformaticians through the Android Play Store *

** I'd prefer algorithmic tasks to implement, like searching DNA sequences using the KMP algorithm in O(M+N) time ... etc . As we all know that mobile devices have low processing power and data holding capacity**

Currently, I'm enrolled in a 2nd degree in CS program at a Top 5 university in Canada.

I just found out that my university also has a Post Bacc Diploma in CS program. The reason why I'm even considering it is the duration (2 years for the degree, vs 6 months for the diploma, without any co-ops) and the cost (as an International student, I have to pay a lot of tuition). Further, with the CS degree, I will be able to complete one Co-op (internship) before my study permit runs out. However, with the diploma, I can probably do 2-3 internships, which will obviously help cover all my tuition and also give me more experience, and still finish faster.

As for the content of the diploma, I will pretty much cover all core CS topics (10 courses on Algorithms, Operating Systems, Databases, Compilers, Networking etc).

Should I switch over to the diploma?

5o56xq,0,2017-01-15,Is it even worth it to minor in a STEM subject like statistics or computer science?,dasaim,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o56xq/is_it_even_worth_it_to_minor_in_a_stem_subject/,"Pretty much every time I see a post on reddit where someone is asking if they should major in something like computer science or statistics to beef up their humanities/social science degree, tons of people respond by saying ""why don't you just major in (whatever STEM subject) and take your humanities/social science degree and turn that into your minor"" - so flip the political science major with a statistics minor to a statistics major with a political science minor, that psychology major with a finance minor into a finance major with a psychology minor, the design major with a computer science minor into a computer science major with a design minor, etc. 

I really don't think I have what it takes to actually major in something like statistics or computer science; and based on my limited experience with those two subjects so far, even if I could do it I'm fairly certain that I'd hate it. But I *do* think I might be able to stomach minoring in a STEM subject to help me with future job hunting, because right now the thought of graduating with a non-STEM major and no real quantitative skills to back it up terrifies me. I know you can make up for it somewhat by having a great GPA (done) and lots of internships, but I have a lot of social issues and other issues going on in my personal life, and I just don't see myself being that ""go-getter"" type who aggressively networks, joins lots of clubs and takes on leadership positions in them, sniffs out a bunch of really awesome internships, etc. So right now, I'm feeling pretty lost. 

Is it even worth it to minor in a STEM subject? it? So many people say that minors are worthless because they don't give you nearly enough exposure to the subject to make you proficient in it, and that they carry hardly any weight at all on a resume. Is this true? My school has minors in computer science, statistics, data science, information systems, economics, and management, but I don't even know if it's worth it to try and do one or more of them if there's hardly any payoff. If that's the case, I'll just minor in a subject I actually feel passionate about.

5o716o,76,2017-01-15,How to convince my controlling mom to let me dorm at college next year?,jjh0928,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5o716o/how_to_convince_my_controlling_mom_to_let_me_dorm/,"I'm a 19 year old girl, and I'm currently a freshman at a pretty well-known private university. I worked my ass off to get accepted there, and I absolutely love it (even though it's very challenging and stressful at times). I get stressed/anxious very easily, it's just part of my character, but lately, being a commenter student (and having a very strict mom) has been a bigger challenge than I anticipated. 

My dad is not the problem - he's a chill guy, but my mom is a whole other story. Growing up, I was very isolated from other kids my age. I wasn't allowed to have friends over, hang out with them outside of school, go to school dances/events (not even prom), I wasn't allowed to play sports or join many after school/extracurricular activities, blah blah you get the idea. Don't get me wrong, I love my mom, and she loves me, but she is way too overprotective of me. 

Everyday, I wake up about 3 hours earlier compared to my peers just to get to school on time. Traffic is terrible where I live, and my college is a good 16 miles away from my house, and since I don't have a car, my mom drops me off/picks me up EVERY DAY. I try not to get embarrassed about it, but it's really hard not to be humiliated every time my mom drops me off by the front steps of my building in her minivan in front of dozens of fellow college students. 

In total, we probably do about 3 hours of driving everyday (to school and back). This quarter, my classes get off pretty late and I have so much homework and studying to do and I'm constantly tired since I sleep so late. I try to see the positives of living at home, like sleeping in my own bed and having my own bathroom, but that's pretty much it. The time wasted in car rides could be of so much use to me, and I'll be getting more sleep and I can participate in clubs and sports like I've always wanted, but my mom just won't let me do anything. I've actually talked to her about this stuff but she just doesn't get it. She just dismisses me and calls me dumb or ridiculous for wanting to dorm at college when ""I have a perfectly good bed at home."" She thinks going to campus events is unnecessary and bad people would want to do bad things to me, and she's always acted this way, even with my older sisters (who are both in their thirties and still live at home even though they have good jobs because my mom never have them independence). 

I've been so obedient towards my mom for so long, because I know that whatever I do/say, she'll always reject my ideas if it involves me getting even the tiniest bit of independence. I've asked her so many times if I could hang out with friends or get a job or go to a campus event and every time she's said no. If I disobey her, she will make my life miserable. She'll slap the living daylight out of me and take away my phone, laptop, and pretty much every other form of communication to the outside world (And please don't say ""slapping you is abuse, call the cops on your mom."" because that's going to make things worse). Friends tell me to speak up for myself, that I'm an adult, but *they just don't get it*. I've tried *everything* to get my mom to let me dorm. She's been saying for months now that she'll get me a car, but I've crunched the numbers and her getting me a car, insurance, maintenance parking permits, and gas would cost more than just letting me dorm for the next two academic years (I'm graduating early). I've been given so much in scholarships/grants/aid that it just doesn't make any financial sense to commute, but my mom says she doesn't care, that she needs to keep an eye on me until I'm out of the house. I'm a very responsible person. I've never caused trouble in my entire life. I do great in school. I don't party or do drugs or anything like that. The worse thing I've done is keep my room messy. 

I just don't get it, and I'm at my wits end with my mom. School is only going to get harder next year, and I just don't have the time or energy to drive 3 hours a day and deal with my overbearing family. I don't have anyone to talk to that'll understand my situation. Whenever I voice my concerns, my older sisters tell me to get over myself and to stop being immature and to just deal with our mom whether I like it or not. I want to get an internship at my university, but it's just not realistic with my mom because she demands that I print out my schedule for her to see and she expects me to be out and done with school  after my last class of the day. I feel like I'm stuck and going nowhere. And people tell me ""oh, you just need to get control of your own life, you're an adult. Stop being such a pushover,"" but what the hell am I supposed to to in this situation? Risk my relationship with my mom/family and make her even more controlling of me? Everyone seems to judge me for being so obedient but they never offer suggestions of what I can do to better my situation. I could use some advice or encouragement on what to do. I feel like my mom is holding me back from accomplishing so many things in life, but I just don't know how to make her stop this. 


EDIT: Thank you SO MUCH everyone for your kind words and advice. I was in desperate need of some encouragement and I will defiantly provide some updates on my situation. Take care :)"

I need some help making a decision, I've been thinking about it for nearly a month and I keep waffling back and forth. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but there are a number of variables. 

I've received a job offer for a consultant position in Washington D.C. paying north of $90K. This position would allow me to keep my security clearance which would otherwise expire in the coming months, my clearance is above Secret. The exact job is unknown to me as I would essentially be a government resource and put where they need me, so until I get started I don't know who I would be working with or what I would actually be doing. 

I've worked in the DC area before as an intern and then a government employee, and I left after about a year because I absolutely hated the area - the traffic is an absolute nightmare and the people are generally more career oriented and much more.. assertive than I am. I've always been an anxious person, but living in that area before caused my anxiety to spike and I was completely depressed living in that environment. It was a very isolating experience being nearly a full day driving away from my old friends and family. 

Since I left, I've moved back to my home state and taken a job as an analyst at a bank, and I've been much happier - I'm closer to my friends and I make a decent salary considering my location. While I'm much happier now, my job is certainly less fulfilling than my role in DC was and I'm not sure if losing my clearance would completely shut me out of those opportunities. 

I'm wondering if moving back to DC would be a mistake, it's been nearly 2 years since I left and I think I've matured a lot in that time and adjusted considerably to working life, but I'm not sure if that would have any impact on my happiness once I got back to DC. The money is considerably better than I am making now, and the job would likely be much more engaging as well - plus the experience would be extremely unique. I just can't get over the worry about moving back to DC - I get anxious just at the thought of being back up in that area. 

What would you do? Is there something that I should consider that I'm not? I appreciate any and all advice!

Also, is my strategy (just browsing a site like indeed) an effective one, or should I be doing something else. It doesn't seem like I'm finding positions I can realistically land, but I don't know if I'm just looking in the wrong place or if there are no internships for a person like me without experience outside of class.

After three full years of college, I graduated with my bachelor's degree and got a job right away at a hospital. Everyone in my department that I work with is 40+ years of age. We get along, but not well enough to hang out outside of work.

My best friend, his fiance, and I live in the same apartment complex, though on different floors. This is great, since we can hang out and not have to really go anywhere. Sadly, he's moving to Oklahoma later this year (I'm living in Wisconsin).

Currently, I go to work from 7am-3:30pm Monday-Friday and then go to the gym for about an hour everyday. On Fridays, my friend and I will go to dinner, then drink, and watch movies.

Other than that, I can't say that I do much to find new people for the time being. Obviously, the easiest thing would be to ""just get out there"", but it seems extremely difficult when I know so few people to get out there and explore with. I'd love to be able to introduce myself to people in the gym, but I wouldn't have any idea how to start that conversation without seeming weird. Would people at the gym be weirded out by someone introducing themself? I'd also love to be able to go downtown on the weekends and meet people at college bars, but I wouldn't know how to not look so alone and akward. How can I do this? How can I meet people my age?"

I am a current sophomore at a target, majoring in Business Administration, minoring in Computer Science. I have a 3.8+ GPA.

Since mid-freshman year I've been first employee at a fin-tech startup started by an acquaintance of mine. We've raised funding, and are currently in the process of an acquisition, leading to me needing a summer internship.

My brother works in trading, and told me to use this site to get all my questions answered.

1) The main finance jobs I've heard college graduates get are IB, consulting, and trading. Is this correct, or are there any other finance related jobs that pay well?

2) While I do have technical/quantitative skills (CS minor, work on fin-tech product), I am not into work that is super technical like my brother (a trader) is. I'm fine with putting in long hours for fluffy classes, I'm fine with waking up at 5 AM to give demos of the fintech startup I work for, because those aren't really ""hard,"" they're more just going the extra mile and putting in the work. My impression is that trading is more PnL/bottom line oriented and technical, whereas IB might have longer hours, but the work itself is not as challenging. Is this correct?

3) I've cold emailed a few boutique investment banks. A few liked my resume, and said let's talk in a few weeks. I don't know shit about IB, though hopefully I will ""intern"" at my school's Investment Club this semester. What are the best books/guides/resources or stuff in general to start learning? Outside of directly applying to the larger banks, is cold emailing boutique banks the best way to get a summer internship? 

4) Is VC an option? I have experience in getting startups acquired, and my network is much more developed in the startup/VC community than the IB community.

5) Will my CS knowledge be less useful in IB than in trading, and therefore just be an unnecessary burden that drains my GPA?

6) My brother makes 200k, 2 years out of college (bonuses included). I look online, IB's average salary first year out of college is 70k. Is the pay difference really that great?

If you have any other thoughts/feedback, please let me know. Thanks everyone for the help, I really appreciate it. "

your favorite bitter German here this time looking for some input myself instead of complaining and telling people they likely can't move somewhere. 


I'm looking to move to the United States one day and I'm pretty much willing to study what it needs to get there on a work visa one day  - since this is at least four years from now I know that laws may change drastically till then but I'd still like an evaluation of my plans. 
I have been looking at majors in the STEM Field that I could pick up and do a Bachelors in and came up with a very rough plan or path I could take and I'd like to hear how my cards would look if I went through with it. 


So as for me and my skills today:
I'm a 23 yo German, native German speaker (duh) fluent and close to being native in English (study English at university for two years) and fluent in Spanish (by the time I will graduate I should be able to use it even in a professional work environment - probably useless when it comes to finding a job in the US but I guess it can't hurt). 
As for work experience so far: I did work part-time in my uncles Pharmacy, nothing too fancy. Aside from that I work as treasurer for the youth organization of a political party in my town - its an unpaid job that I was elected to do, probably not too fancy either but I guess it can look good on a resume. 
My HS grades weren't too grade - Did very well in some subjects and pretty awful in others overall my GPA is about average (not bad enough to not allow me to study CS). 


Now for my future plans: 
I would like to study Computer Science and have a good selection of Universities here in Berlin (while I doubt any of the Universities here are well-known in the US, two of them are among the best rated in Germany/Europe and sometimes even listed in worldwide rankings) to choose from. 
During my studies I would obviously try to get as many internships in as possible - and would focus my studies/classes on a direction that is in demand in the US (CS can be a pretty big field, so I would need to look into that some more). 
Taking a semester abroad during my bachelors is something that I would love to do, but due to the logistics and cost of it isn't something that I would count on becoming reality. I know that it would increase my chances, but I don't think its necessary? 

Post-Graduation I would like to find a job in the US as soon as possible and from the looks of it a Masters degree is not expected/necessary in most cases? 

However I'm not turned off by the idea of pursuing a Masters degree in the US after finishing my bachelors. I read that there are plenty of opportunities and affordable programs for international students to do so? Afterwards I should then be certainly able to find a job? (as an international student in the STEM Field you do have a grace period after graduating from a US college in which you can look for a job - or is that simply a fabrication?)

So thats all for now - mainly I want to focus on immigrating with only a bachelors for now, the masters part is optional. 

Thank you for any help or input on the matter.

I'll go first, M7 MBA, recruited for investment banking only. Ended up with a handful of offers (split evenly between BB and EB). I was very surprised just how top heavy the recruiting was. It seems that it's pretty common that the top 35% or so got a ton of offers, and that it was much tougher after that (know a guy that went 0 for 12 on interviews). Most seemed to have gotten something, but definitely a lot of disappointment in terms of level of firm (people who thought they would end up GS/MS/JPM who are going to be at Citi/Barcap/CS instead type deal or even more drastic than that). Foreigners definitely struggled relative to the Americans, as well. 

Consulting recruiting I know is still going on, but from what i've heard it's been tough. The problem here is that the consulting firms actually take way less interns than they do full time hires. So there are a ton of people who want to do consulting, but probably only enough intern slots for 2/3rds of them. Will be more full time slots, though.

Two startups (let's call them X and Y), and a big company (let's call it G).  

Last week, startup X moved to make an offer, which has a deadline at the end of this week.   Startup Y had invited me to do an onsite, and we were trying to schedule it when I learned about the offer.   Startup Y agreed to do the onsite early this week, but hadn't gotten back to me about the specifics.  Late last week, I also entered the project matching stage for BigCo G, which I understand can go quickly if you have deadlines.

This morning I heard back from startup Y, saying that because of travel expenses, they actually want to do the onsite next week (i.e. after my offer expires from startup X). 

My plan now is that I should tell startup Y that next week is fine, and then try to extend the deadline for startup X as much as possible (probably by 2 weeks from their original deadline).   I *think*, but am not sure, that I'd prefer to work at startup Y over startup X, and I'm also not sure where bigco G falls (depends on project).  So I definitely don't wanna blow the deadline with startup X, but I also feel a little uncomfortable with the standard advice (accept and renege later) because it could be someplace I want to work full-time even if I don't do it this summer.

My other question is if startup Y wanting to move the onsite to next week is a big red flag.  They've otherwise had one of the better interview/recruitment processes I've been in, but this does seem a little candidate-unfriendly."

I've applied to many new-grad positions but I know I am much more qualified for an internship rather than a permanent full-time.  Due to interns not being as experienced, it would also put me towards the higher-qualified end of applicants rather than the mid/less-qualified applicants for full-time.

I can't tell if I don't see this more often in this forum because the users of /cscq are very intense works and want the best job (new-grad vs. intern) or if it is actually not common to have a fresh grad as an intern."

5oe7qf,1,2017-01-16,22[F] How do I handle being bullied as an adult at work?,CreativeVisionaryKid,selfimprovement,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/5oe7qf/22f_how_do_i_handle_being_bullied_as_an_adult_at/,"I'm an intern at a recording studio. The management and owner make the environment super youthful. As an intern you get the grunt work but generallly, people don't treat you like shit. So everyone is cool, and we are all friends, there is a family vibe between all of the staff.

There's an intern who treats me like I'm less than basically. Like I don't matter and no one likes me. I think that's his perception of me, I'm assuming it because of the way he treats me and talks to me. I don't know what his deal is, I'm nice to everyone.

The thing is, I'm the type of person that ends up getting bullied quite a bit. I have been getting bullied since I was a little kid.

The thing is, it doesn't really hurt my feelings like it did when I was younger. My issue is not knowing how to handle it. I don't want to be outwardly upset, because the way he treats me is his problem, not mine. So how do I just treat him like nothing is happening. Like no one would even know that there was a problem coming from my end if he tried to bully me in front of other people (which he has).

I'm also not sure if I should let management know. I don't want to seem like I'm telling on him, but I just want it to be on record in case it escalates and I'm in a seriously bad situation where I'm perceived as being in the wrong, or the both of us are.

This happened with my roommate last semester. She constantly harassed me over the use of the bathroom, to the point where my other roommates noticed. None of us liked her, she was really obnoxious. We ended up getting into a fight and I ended up getting in trouble for it. I regretted not talking to my RA about it ahead of time. It could have ended differently.

So now, I'm in a new situation, with a new bully, something that isn't new to me though. I don't know if I should tell my manager or not. And I don't know what to even say if I do decide to tell her.

I almost ended up getting fired one time. My manager called me into her office and told me she had to let me go. I just broke down crying because it was so unexpected and this is like the one thing in my life that is going great for me. I begged her not to fire me and I couldn't stop crying. She ended up speaking to the owner and he let me stay. I guess they saw how passionate I was about music. The reason I almost got fired is because I opened the door to the roof and I wasn't supposed to. If the door gets opened, the police have to come check if someone went on the roof. I cost the studio $500 because of this. I had no idea I wasn't supposed to open the door.

I say this to say, if she saw me crying on the floor, then it may be seen as a red flag for me to mention the situation I am in with the other intern. I really just want to have it on record in case something happens, due to circumstances out of my control. Due to the other interns actions.

The final question I have is, how can I not care about it! A lot of people in this situation wouldn't even care, they would treat him like they treat everyone or just not be fazed at all.

Help me out fellow redditors.

PS: Adult bullying is a thing and if you think it's not, let's just focus on the questions I'm asking, or refrain from answering. No offense but I want this to be a productive post for myself and for others in the same situation. Thank you!

EDIT: I wouldn't want him to know I told management. I don't want anyone to know accept my manager. Saying it behind his back is not a problem, id rather him not know because then it would become a bigger issue. I don't want my manager to do anything about it right now, I just want it to be noted."

Here's how I see it.

GPA and test scores are the most important, but their more of a qualifier. High scores and GPA can keep you in consideration and low scores/GPA can sorta keep you out. Most applicants probably fall within the 25th to 75th percentile range.

ECs are important, but the vast majority are probably similarly solid (interns, lots of volunteering, involved with clubs, competitions, leadership positions, etc.). Then, with exceptions for people that did something like start a major company or something, we move on to essays.

The way I see it, for most applicants, essays are make or break time. This is where the many, many top GPA/test score and very solid, but not astonishingly amazing ECs type students get to sell themselves.

Basically, most of the time do essays end up as the major decider?

Is this accurate? I'm not the most knowledgeable so I'm not really sure.

import Tkinter as tk

name = tk.entry 

and is it constantly updating?
Furthermore, what I need is for the user to input a bunch of information, and then to have a button that says ""Calculate"". Let's say the function object that has all of my main code in it is called 'maincode'. I would just have the calculate button run that command when clicked. Would I be able to put a line of code like

theinputineed = name

into 'maincode' in order to call the information? Normally for function objects you have to list arguments, but I'm not sure how to do that when using a button to run the function. Would it be something like

command = maincode(argument 0, argument 1, argument 2, etc...) ?

Finally, how can I get 'maincode' to print to a textbox on the GUI? I've only ever really printed stuff to the IDE and using matplotlib, so I'm not sure what commands to use. I'm looking for something like

print output[:,:] to tk.textbox

or something. 
Actually, one last thing. I know how to save to documents, but it would be nice to have a ""Save As"" button that allows you to save to any particular destination that you like. If someone could help me there as well, that would be great.

Sorry for all the nooby questions, I tried looking for this but I would like an actual person to clarify things for me. Thanks in advance!

5ofbqn,16,2017-01-16,Advice on applying to internships?,Hebejeebez,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ofbqn/advice_on_applying_to_internships/,"I'm currently in my second year of a CS degree, and am looking into applying for summer internships (I know, it's getting a little late). My main issue is that I don't know where to apply or what to expect, and I feel incompetent in comparison to many of my peers.

I only have 2 projects up on my Github, one of which was a winner of a hackathon but still...other people I know have 10+ personal projects. I'd love to have more, but between school and work I can never find enough time to put hours of work into a side project.

The only language that I'm ""fluent"" in is Java, and even then all I know is up through data structures. I know about a similar amount of C, and I've had practice with HTML, CSS, Python, JS, and PHP. I've worked with linux, the command line, have taken probability and theory CS courses, and am very good at math. I've gotten either A's or B's in all of my CS classes so far. I don't really have any experience working with databases or JS frameworks or many other things I hope to learn...but doubt I could learn proficiently before applying in time.

Basically, I just feel like I don't know enough, and any potential employer for an internship will see right through my exaggerated resume. I mean, half the time google does more work than I do when coding. I don't plan on trying to intern at any huge company like Google or FB, but I'm afraid that I won't even get any offers for an internship at a small company. I mean, half the companies list ""full-stack developer"" as a requirement, which I wouldn't call myself. What types of companies/positions should I apply for? Do you think I have any shot at getting an internship for this summer or should I just wait and hope that next year I'll have more tools under my belt? I'm scared that it will just be denial after denial and a waste of time.... Any help/suggestions of companies or positions or really any advice at all is greatly appreciated. Sorry this is so long. Also, I'm in Western MA if that's any help.

TL;DR: Feeling incompetent, not enough programming knowledge as my peers, very few personal projects/achievements. Do I even bother for an internship for this summer?"
5ofk57,1,2017-01-16,"Phone interview on Wednesday, how are my answers to their questions?",LeapMe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5ofk57/phone_interview_on_wednesday_how_are_my_answers/,"I found some questions that were asked by the company on Glassdoor and decided to create my own responses. The position is for a software engineer intern if that makes any difference.


&gt;**What is your favorite course in your school and why?**

Advanced programming principles. It showed me the power of C++ outside the basic things such as loops. Learning about inheritance, polymorphism, classes, exceptions, and constructors/destructors made me a much more versatile programmer as it gave me more tools to solve problems. 

This semester, I’m excited to take a course on databases as well as a course on data structures and algorithms. 

&gt;**What do you think of team work, can you tell me about a team project, and what your responsibility was on the project** 

Numerous assignments in my computer science classes encouraged us to work in teams specifically to receive benefits that don’t come from working by yourself. Not only does delegating tasks help finish projects in a timely manner, being able to bounce ideas off other members has proven to be invaluable.


Most recently, a classmate and I wrote a vending machine program. This 700 line long project was the longest of the semester and would have been much harder to complete on my own. After we designed the basic construct of how the program should work, we broke the project up into two sections: internal inventory/vending and the cash register. My responsibilities were to ensure the machine gave the most optimal amount of change and kept a total amount of money in the register. This was done using inheritance, objects, and vectors.

Debugging together allowed us to get two different perspectives and identify the source of logic/runtime errors quickly.

Overall, I enjoy team work. Working with others who are passionate about a project gives me the motivation to continue putting in my best effort. 

&gt;**Why do you want to work here**

$company caught my eye when I was at a conference for software developers. After the conference, I looked up $company and was thoroughly impressed with numerous accolades that come with being a tech staple in $city for over 25 years. I hope interning here will allow me to grow as a developer by working closely with engineers in the industry.

5ofv70,11,2017-01-16,Today I gave up.,writingthefuture,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5ofv70/today_i_gave_up/,"Nine months after graduating and endlessly applying and searching for my dream job, I have finally lost all hope.  

Today, I received yet another generic automated rejection email.  I met an employee who works at the company and she helped set up the phone interview, which I thought went well, but of course I was not good enough.  After I received the email I took a shower and cried my eyes out, I don't even remember the last time I cried. 

I don't know why I tried so hard in college to maintain a 3.5 gpa in a STEM field, or why I took on several leadership roles in clubs, or why I took on not one, but two very relevant internships in the industry, fuck, I even graduated with special honors from my college, but does any of it matter?  Obviously not. I should have just paid Wendy's $50,000 for the privilege of working there. 

My motto used to be ""fall seven times, stand up eight."" Well not anymore. I have fallen down and been beaten into the ground and I will not get back up. Sorry for rambling."

I'm located in a rather small town so I would need a paid internship and they seem very few and far in between. Located in VA I have applied to most in the area and have had a few phone interviews but that is it.

Do any of you have any suggestion?

Edit: I am an Junior at Longwood University in FarmVille VA

Courses I have done are Cyber Security 1 and 2, Forensics, Networking and Network communications. 

I have completed my course work for a cyber security minor and a criminal justice degree I have a few classes left."
5ogomo,105,2017-01-17,Ain't A Hero - Intro,Lakstoties,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5ogomo/aint_a_hero_intro/,"This is a concept I've been refining.  Consider this an intro piece, that I'm interested in continuing.

&amp;nbsp;

""We're Nexus News!  At the great battle between the Chosen One, Sebastian Warwick, and the Dark Lord Noxian!  The Chosen One's party have made their way to the magical rift that Dark Lord Noxian is attempting to consume.  Wait!  The moment is here!  The Chosen One is charging in to give the final blow and-""

""And that was the last transmission received from our on-site action news crew.  Our condolences go out their families.  The aftermath of the battle has been inconclusive.  Thankfully, the magical rift was sealed, but Dark Lord Noxian is rumored to be on this plane of existence.  Unfortunately, the only thing found of the Chosen One was the Legendary Sword of the Spirit Realm-""

-CLICK-

A brown haired, slightly overweight man sits on the couch in dirty t-shirt and boxers.  He tosses the remote onto the makeshift milk crate and 2x4 table in front of him.  He sinks into the old, ripped couch and blows the white streak in his hair out of his eyes.  It's been a somber weekend after hearing the news and it sinks in more today.  ""Shit, bro.  Fuck.  Man, I can't believe it.  You had your shit together, you got an awesome party.  And even THE magical sword.  Should have had that motherfucker's ass in a sling after that attack.""

""I know, Bach.  I thought I had that bitch.  Jackass had one nasty trick up his sleeve.""

""Well, what the fuck would have been that powerful to take you down-""

Bach pauses, finally noticing the ethereal, echoing voice next to him.  His head slowly pivots to the ghostly figure lounging on the other half of the couch.  Bach's blue eyes widen as his pupils almost slam shut from narrowing so quickly.  The shriek of ""manly"" terror achieves an octave short of shattering the nearby glassware.  Bach backpedals hard out from the couch, launching himself a meter away before hitting the floor.  He continues the backpedal slide through the carpet littered with takeout boxes, dirty laundry, video games, ""entertainment"" books, and empty cans of both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

""AHHH! AHHH! AHHH!-""

The ghostly figure rockets from the couch into the air, oddly holding his hands to his ethereal ears.  He zooms to within mere centimeters of Bach's face.  ""FUCKING SHUT UP!""

"" ... ""

The figure removes his hands from ears.  ""By the gods, I've forgotten how loud your shrieking is!""

""S-s-s-sebastian?!""

""Yes.""

Bach quietly blinks with horror bubbling into his face.  ""Oh gods! You've come to haunt me!  All those times I got revenge against you-  You're going to make me pay now!""

""No!  Calm down, brother!  I'm not here to haunt you.""

""Okay.""

""Well, not exactly.""

""Okay...""

Sebastian rights his ghostly form in front of Bach, as he regains his footing and stands up.
""Long story short.  I died, but I'm not dead.""

""No shit.""

""Stop being a smart ass.""

Bach takes a rickety seat in the small combo kitchen/dining area.  ""Fine.""

""The Sword was able to capture the magical energy around the area.  It captured my spirit as it left my body and was able to recover most of my body and store it within.  Bad news.  I'm bound to the sword.""

""Good news?""

""I can be brought back with a substantial amount of magical energy infused into the sword.""

Bach sits up straight for a moment, lost in thought.  ""I see.  With enough energy the sword could restore your body whole, rebind your spirit to it, and then bring you back.  Like one of the old school resurrection spells.""

Sebastian with a grin on his transparent face.  ""EXACTLY!  It's good to know those years in adventuring school weren't wasted!""

Bach grimaces.  ""Dammit, man, don't bring that up.  I know all the shit.  Just never cared for the whole risk your life every day thing.""

""Well, that's why I'm here!  I know you know all this stuff!  And you can help me out...  Right?""

An awkward silence hovers between the two.  Sebastian hovers closer to Bach, as he leans over to his fridge, pulling out a cola.  He uses one of the cabinet handles to pop the cap off.  Bach sighs at his brother.  ""Ah fuck it!  I'll try it for you!""

Sebastian's ethereal form momentarily brightens.  ""YES!  I knew it!""

Bach sets up a swig from his drink.  ""Okay.  So, where are we going to get this ancient power source of magic to charge the sword up?  Ancient ruins?  Magical rift?  Old magi focal points?  There's a few things out there, but it'll be a hunt to find one substantial enough.""

""Lord Noxian's Heart.""

Bach eyes spring open as he swallows almost half the bottle of cola in one, painful gulp.  He struggles to swallow it down, tears welling, and finally gasping for breath.  ""NOXIAN'S HEART?!""

""Yes, and you must be the one to plunge the sword through it.""

""ME?!""

""You're my twin!""

""Fraternal twin!  The sword knows that, right?!  You did tell it that?!""

""As long as we share enough chromosomes, it'll work!""

""DUDE! Lord Noxian almost wiped you clean from existence!  And you want ME to try that?!""

Bach leans in to glare at his brother.  His brother returns the favor and the two stare each other down.  
""Listen, we don't know where Lord Noxian is and his power is weak.  He won't be trying anything soon.  Plenty of time to get YOU into fighting shape again.""

""You do realize, I was never really in a fighting shape.""

""Well, I guess we ALL are going to work extra hard to get you there, whether you like it or not.""

""We ALL?""

A door bell rings out throughout the small house.  Bach scans around for the source of the sound.  ""I have a door bell?""

Sebastian shifts partially into the kitchen island with a sly smirk.  ""Well, they're here. My party.""

Bach expression melts into one of nervous dread.  ""All them?! The Half-Emin, Grath, Fvalian, and that Evuukian?!""

Sebastian with an evil ear to ear grin.  ""Yes. All of them, ESPECIALLY the Evuukian want me back among the living.""

"" ... ""

"" ... ""

"" ... ""

""What?""

""You and the Evuukian?""

Sebastian puffs his chest confidently with a sly smirk. ""Yes.""

Bach laughs and shakes his head.  ""Holy shit!  I thought their whole cultural bias thing would never allow it.""

""Well, officially.  Could you answer the door?  I don't want to keep them waiting.""

Bach walks over to the door, taking a moment to realize the state of dress he's in.  He musters a bit of courage and carefully cracks the door open.  ""Oh hey! Everyone!""

The Half-Emin, Grath, Fvalian, and that Evuukian are all standing at the door step to Bach's small house in the small outskirt town.  They don't have the most amused expressions on their faces, except the Fvalian.  She gives a greeting smile, with her sharp teeth.
""If you give me a few minutes, I'll get ready and come on out. I wasn't expecting to travel so soon.""

The large, muscular Grath woman grumbles in a low tone.  ""Hurry. Up.""

Bach nervously grins shifting towards a grit as the door closes.  He looks expectantly at his brother.

""What?""

""Dude? Privacy? I gotta dress.""

""Oh, right. Sorry, being on the adventuring road so much, you start to not worry about that.""

Sebastian slips through the front wall of the house to meet the greetings of his party members.  Bach pauses for a moment, thinking about what his brother just said.  ""Damn bro.""

&amp;nbsp;

The party intensely discusses future plans.  The Grath woman takes a large map and rolls it out upon the hood of the modified humvee, using her long arms to get it out in one motion.  The Fvalian hops out of the driver’s seat over the front window.  She lays down on the back of the hood, stretching her lithe frame along the edge of the map to keep it down.  She immediately taps out point on the map with a claw tip.  The half-emin steps up in front of the grill and flips the hood off her short cape.  Placing her hands on the sides of her waist, she picks at her belt of pouches with long nails.  She sighs and glances with her golden eyes to the Fvalian on the hood.  She leans forward and places a nail point on another part of the map.  “Cideeda, we talked about this!  There’s no reason for Noxian to go back there!”

Cideeda’s tail flicks out from behind her and she taps the same point from before.  “I know!  But, Sotalia you can’t deny there might be some stuff left.  Maybe notes or some clues to where he may have gone!”

Sotalia straightens her back.  She stands a moment before grimacing at the bright sun beating down.  With a frustrated sneer, she pulls the hat off her head, letting down her dark red hair, revealing her swept back horns.  “What is with the weather around here?!  It was near freezing last night at the hotel, now it’s damn near summer weather!”

The Grath woman wipes beads of sweat off her forehead and removes her armored leather jacket.  She tosses it in the back of the humvee.  “Not the worst change in weather I have experienced, but surprising.”

“I know, Dretphi!”

Cideeda rolls her eyes and turns over on her back, letting her legs and arms drape over the vehicle to stretch.  “Better than it being as cold as it was on that mountain getting here.”

Sotalia and Dretphi each nod in agreement, before continuing the debate over where to go next.

Standing off to the side a fair skinned, delicate figure, confidently holds a large sheathed sword.  Sebastian’s ghostly form glides over to her side.  She smiles gently as he approaches.  “So, did he agree to help us?”

“Of course, my dear, Aristespha!”

She breathes a sigh of relief.  She twists her foot inside her boot, as discomfort flashes on her face.  She places the sword down to her side as she kneels down.  After undoing a few belts, she eventually works her leg out of the knee high boots.  “The finest artisans crafted these boots for my family and, yet, they still manage to find every loose rock in area!”

She energetically shakes her boot, until a stray rock tumbles out.  Balancing on one foot, Aristespha slides her leg back into the boot, taking a few moments to readjust her fine clothing back to proper.

Cideeda waves over to Sebastian and Aristespha with a toothy grin.  “Hey!  You two going to join in on his argument or do you want to be ‘alone’.”

Aristespha picks up the sword and resumes a distinguished posture and gazes lovingly over to Sebastian.  “Let’s not keep them waiting.”

&amp;nbsp;

The group eventually settles upon a rough plan.  Sebastian takes the lull in the debate to look over towards Bach's house.  The Cideeda’s long, tuff-tipped ears perk towards the house.  The rest of the party stops the discussion and quietly glance over at the house.  Sebastian hovers over and sticks his upper body through the front wall.  He pulls back out for a moment of puzzling, before going all the way through into the house.  Cideeda’s ears perk again.  ""That sounds like the kick starter of a motorcycle.""

""MOTHERFUCKER!!!""

The ethereal, booming, echoing eruption of sound gets the attention of everyone.  Sebastian launches out of the building with his ghostly figure billowing red with ethereal flames.  ""THE BASTARD SQUEEZED HIS FAT ASS THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW AND IS ESCAPING ON HIS BIKE! GET HIM!""

The rumble of a motorcycle blasts.  Tires spin and gravel peppers the back of the small house.  The party throws everything into the humvee, each jumping aboard.  Cideeda floors the accelerator and spins out towards the back road behind the house.

Sebastian stands on the roof, floating in sync with the humvee and glares at angrily at the man on the side-car motorcycle a few dozen meters down the back road.  ""WHERE ARE YOU GOING, BACH?!""

The Bach looks behind him to see the ethereal figure, flaming red with rage.  Bach snaps his head to the front, screams in fright, and opens up the motorcycle all the way.

&amp;nbsp;

Bach drives the motorcycle as fast as it will go.  The small town streets thankfully empty on an early holiday morning.  He takes advantage of local knowledge, power-sliding down back streets and access roads.  This forces the humvee to take longer routes, but eventually the humvee’s speed overall keeps the chase going.  Sebastian launches from the roof of the humvee towards Bach.  He attaches himself in front of the motorcycle, holding onto the handle bars opposite of Bach.  “I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HELP ME BACH!”

Bach shifts his head left and right around Sebastian’s ghostly form, each time meeting the enraged, transparent face of his brother.  “DAMMIT SEBASTIAN!  I’M TRYING TO FUCKING DRIVE HERE!”

“FUCK YOUR DRIVING!  WHAT ABOUT HELPING ME?!”

Bach narrows his eyes at his brother, a strange faint blue glow coming from his pupils.  “Well.  Maybe you should mention needing to destroy a world ending horror BEFORE asking your brother to help!  Full disclosure, man!”

Sebastian continues his ranting.  “FULL DISCLOSE!?  I was trying to be nice!  Because YOU are GOING to HELP ME whether you like it or not-”

Bach nods his head and raises it, his eyes pulsating blue.  Sebastian breaks his rage upon sight.  Bach cocks the back of his right hand away from the handle of the motorcycle and stares at his brother.  “Full disclosure.  This might sting.”

With a blur, a loud resonant clap follows the impact as the back of Bach’s hand pushes into Sebastian’s shocked face.  His ethereal figure tumbles loose from Bach’s motorcycle and flies right back into the sword on Aristespha’s lap.  The four in the humvee can only glance wide-eyed.  The sword stirs in Aristespha’s lap and Sebastian reforms next to her with a frustrated expression.  Sotalia spins in her seat to Sebastian.  “How the fuck did he do that?!”

“I told you.  My brother, despite being as human as he is, is full of surprises.  He was ranked the same as ME in adventuring school.”

Dretphi crawls forward from her back seat between Sebastian and Aristespha.  “How do you want us to capture him?”

“Alive.”

“Apart from that?”

“No... Permanent injuries.  Please.”

Cideeda pulls herself over the steering wheel and focuses her eyes on the motorcycle.  She returns to her seat and reaches a cupped hand above her, forcing some of the flowing air into her face.  She sniffs the air carefully.  “It’s a biodiesel engine!  Sotalia how cold can your freeze spell get?!”

Sotalia pivots herself to Cideeda.  “Below freezing easily.”

“Can you focus it at range?”

“Yes, decently enough.”

Cideeda points out a series of tubes on the engine.  “Those are the fuel lines!  Freeze them and it should stall the engine out.”

Sotalia rolls her sleeves back and stands up in her seat.  Her cape flutters around, as she takes aim with one arm grasping the top of the windshield and the other extended.  She points and chants while symbols along her arm glow brighter and brighter.  “Get me closer, Cideeda!”

With a manic grin, Cideeda floors the accelerator and closes the gap between the humvee and motorcycle.  Bach glances back and with more worry.  Sotalia maintains careful aim with concentration and releases the spell.  The humvee tire rolls over a large rock.  The beam of energy lances out, hitting a much higher target.  The beam contacts the area of Bach’s back above his butt and drags upwards to the region between the shoulders.  Bach screams in agony, tensing up and nearly drawing in his motorcycle seat into his ass.  Sotalia blinks with embarrassment and quickly gathers more energy to make another attempt.  “Dammit!  Stupid bump!  I’ll get it this time!”

Another beam of energy reaches out and hits the tubing around the engine, forming a solid layer of misting ice.  Bach recovers from the shock of the ice to his back to notices the motorcycle engine sputter.  He leans over to see the ice on the fuel lines.  “FUCK!”

Bach snags his backpack in the sidecar, and throws it over his shoulder.  He keeps grip on the handle bar, the engine completely giving out to a slowing coast.  When the motorcycle gets to a near stop, he leaps and runs into the forest off to the side of the road.  The humvee slides to a stop.  Dretphi flings herself out to land in a full break sprint.  Bach runs with slight stumbles through the forest floor.  Loud snaps and shuffles erupt from behind him.  He snaps his head back to see Dretphi barreling through the forest.  She powers through the dense floor, gliding over the terrain without a sign of trouble.  Bach’s eyes open wide in abject horror, with a slight blue glow, as Dretphi moves right next to him.  She reaches out to Bach.  As she hovers her hand over to grab firmly onto his shirt, Bach speeds forward out of her grasp.  She watches in astonishment as not only do his footsteps grow faster but each stride increases in length.  With speed unfitting of his body, Bach leaves Dretphi behind.  A crackly voice sounds off in Dretphi’s ear from a radio ear piece.  “Dretphi!  Have you caught him?!”

Between heavy breaths Dretphi responds.  “No.  He’s somehow.  Outrunning.  ME!”

A very confused Cideeda continues on the radio.  “What?!  How?!  Nevermind.  We found an access road!  Are you still running west!?”

“Yes.”

“Okay.  THERE!  We found a clearing up ahead.  Keep chasing him!”

&amp;nbsp;

Bach coughs and sputters.  He can’t keep the pace up any longer.  The forest around him thins out.  He looks upon the clearing with some relief.  As Bach lands his first step into the clearing, Cideeda shoots up from the tall grasses and points a strange shotgun at him.  She pulls the trigger and a payload of netting and weights explode outwards.  Bach’s luminescent blue eyes watch the expanding mass and he dive-slides immediately, unnaturally to the grass and dirt.  The net aimed for a standing person flies over the prone Bach.  Cideeda cocks the shotgun with zeal and she aims down.  A pull of the trigger sends another strange projectile with electrical probes out the barrel.  Bach sees the blast of the shotgun and the projectile spinning towards him.  He raises his hands up instinctively to protect himself, bouncing the projectile as a golden transparent disc appears.  Cideeda cocks the shotgun again and fires.  The shield bounces the projectile again.  Bach regains his footing and flings the shield right at Cideeda, knocking the shotgun out of her hands.  She ends up catching the golden disc in her hands from the rebound off her shotgun.  “How the fuc-”

Bach sprints across the field.  Aristespha confidently walks out behind a tree on the other side of the clearing.  With a fast chant and gesture, waves of energy pass through Bach.  He staggers, each step more lethargic and exaggerated.  Eventually, he barely maintains a stand, as a curious Aristespha carefully approaches.  She keeps her gloved hand steadily aimed at Bach.  “Strange.  Most creatures fall completely asleep.  There may be something to your brother’s claims after all.”

Something inside Bach stirs as his head nods from the effects of the spell.  He remains still and standing, while Aristespha’s curiosity turns to genuine caution.  Bach’s head rises back up with the effect of the spell fading and his senses coming back.  She briefly expresses shock before releasing another wave of energy, collapsing Bach into an unconscious heap.  Sebastian’s ethereal form floats next to her.  She snaps at him, “You did not mention how difficult he would be to capture!”

Sebastian drifts back and shrugs.  “I knew he could be difficult, but I honestly didn’t expect he’d be able to pull this much off.”

Cideeda arrives, still holding the golden disc at the side with her hand.  “Wow!  He sure put up a fight!  I’ll have to use my special made restrains on him!”

She passes off the golden disc to Sotalia as she stops from a jog.  Sotalia examines the disc with confusion and intrigue.  After digging through her cargo pants pockets, Cideeda pulls out a collection of restraints and rope.  She puts the devices on Bach, wrapping him up in rope.  In between securing restraints, Cideeda pats Bach down, turning out pockets and searching through his backpack.  “He was planning to run pretty far!  A bit of money, passport, and a fake ID.”

Sebastian hovers over her and joins her in examining all the random things in Bach’s backpack.  Sotalia finally takes a moment from examining the golden disc.  “Where did this come from?  Did he have it with him?”

Cideeda pulls her head from backpack looting.  “Umm.  No.  It appeared when I tried shooting him with the stunner rounds.  Pretty weird.”

“Have you found any artifacts on him?”

“No.  Nothing I think is magical.”

Sotalia holds the golden disc in front of her.  “So you’re saying he conjured this?!”

Cideeda tilts her head to the side.  “I guess.  I didn’t see him do any kind of incantations.  It just appeared.”

Sotalia cranes her head over to Sebastian with a glare.  He eventually realizes the glare concentrated on him and glides over to Sotalia.  “Yes?”

“You said he FAILED out of the mage program!”

Sebastian’s eyes dart confused.  “Yes.  He did.”

Sotalia holds up the golden disc in one hand and points with the other.  “THIS isn’t the work of a failed mage!”

“Well, what do you call not passing your fifth year finals?”

“Wait!  He made it through FIFTH YEAR?!”

“Yes?”

Sotalia’s grits her teeth and shakes the disc, waving her hand to punctuate her thoughts.  “Fifth year is the last year for school work!  The only reason for the sixth year is internship hours!”

Sebastian shrugs.  Dretphi steps up, taking huge breaths and long strides to recover from the long sprint.  “Sebastian.  There are things you have not told us about your brother.  You need to inform us.”

Sotalia points up to Dretphi behind her, keeping her glare on Sebastian.  “Exactly!  While your brother sleeps, we are going to have a nice long discussion.”

Aristespha crosses her arms and slants her hips behind Sebastian.  “All of us are going to have a nice long discussion.”

Sebastian smiles nervously, pivoting between all the unhappy faces.  He only finds difference with Cideeda’s face, as she points to an electronic device freshly fished from Bach’s backpack.  “What?”

With the most innocent batting of the eyes, Cideeda asks with glee, “Can I have this?!  These are really RARE!  I’ve been looking for one FOR. EVER.”

“Sure.  Go right ahead.”

Cideeda squeals with joy and continues to sort through Bach’s backpack.  Sebastian shrinks with the walls of his party closing in and points over to the humvee.  “How about we get on the road and discuss this further on along the way?”

&amp;nbsp;

The world returns to Bach’s senses.  He feels moving.  Sounds of conversation hit his ears.  As his brain reconnects with consciousness, he assesses his situation.  He’s tied up, inside a vehicle, surrounded by the voices of the people he was trying to escape.  He resigns to the loss.  Slowly and stealthily opening one eye, he surveys the area.  Inside the humvee, he lies in the middle aisle between everyone.  He looks up to the back seat to see Dretphi laying out on the bench seat with a few pillows making it more comfortable.  To either side are seats.  Aristespha holds onto the sword and sheath across her lap with her seat reclined back.  Sebastian is sitting in the opposite seat, despite not needing one.  Looking down the aisle to the front, Bach sees Cideeda in the driver’s seat flipping through the holographic list of music on his Universal HoloPlayer Pro.  Sotalia excitedly points out a selection in the list and taps to start playing it.  “I can’t believe he has a copy of this!  These guys were totally my favorite band back in my gloom and doom phase!”

Cideeda chirps back.  “I told you this thing is amazing!  And it’s got all the unofficial modifications and unlocks!”

Aristespha sighs and groans, “Back to the discussion at hand...   So Bach made it to the end of his fifth year and just dropped out.”

Sebastian nods with arms crossed.  “Yes.  He didn’t even take the final test.  Just walked away from it all.”

Sotalia twists in the seat towards the back.  “You don’t just walk away after all that and getting that high of marks.  What happened before he left?”

Sebastian sighs, “Something happened on an assignment he went on with his instructor and a few other students.  Things went really bad.  Bach was the only one to get out without any serious injuries.”

Sotalia face grows more concern and she focuses on Sebastian.  “What.  Happened?”

Sebastian lowers his head.  “They ran into a Nightmare Geist.”

The entire vehicle goes silent, save the sounds of the engine and road.  Everyone grimaces and squirms as the thoughts of such a creature rise up from hearing its name.  Bach winces as memories echo.  Sotalia breaks the silence, “A Nightmare Geist?!  They all lived?!”

Sebastian eyes side to side with a shrug, “Yes.  Everyone except Bach needed to be hospitalized.”

Dretphi shifts her position higher in the back seat.  “There are old legends in my clan about whole villages being destroyed by such a creature.  The most we have even done is seal them away.  And secure the vessel somewhere far from where it could do harm.”

Cideeda’s happiness drains from her as something more solemn takes hold.  She goes quiet.  Her breath occasionally shudders as memories take hold, occupying all the attention in her mind not put towards driving.  Sotalia turns her head to Cideeda and gently holds Cideeda’s shoulder.  Cideeda’s breathing calms and she pats a free hand on Sotalia’s.  Aristespha narrows her eyes at Sebastian, “So, how did they seal... It?”

Sebastian pauses in thought and after a few false starts, “Sealed?  It was destroyed-  Maybe.  No one was sure, but there was no trace of it.  Maybe it just left?  I don’t know!”

Bach close his eye and keeps quiet.

Sotalia rubs the bridge of her nose in frustration.  “They didn’t say anything?!  Did your own brother say anything?!  This is pretty damn significant!”

“No!  He’s never said anything about it.  In fact, that’s when he grew distant, and then just stopped doing the whole school thing.  I tried to get him to tell me, but I could tell something bad happened and he didn’t want to talk about it.”

Dretphi settles down into the back seat again, moving some pillows around.  “I think we may be able to help your brother.”

Sebastian twists his form to look at Dretphi.  “I hope so-”

“No.  We will.  Before he seemed like he was incapable of fighting.  It is different now.  He can fight.  He just is not.”

Bach keeps quiet.  He was feeling tired again and at this point he really didn’t want to get into an argument with such a one-sided majority.  Plus even some awkward sleep would be preferable to hearing all the discussion about him.

&amp;nbsp;

Bach wakes to firm tapping of a finger on his forehead.  His eyes greet Dretphi’s as she glares stoically at him from above, her platinum blonde braids draping down.  “Will you cooperate and come with us?”

Bach takes a breath in, “Yes.  I don’t have in in me to run at the moment anyway.”

Dretphi leans back into the seat and directs Bach up with a hand gesture.  Bach throws himself up to a sit.  With a few motions and twists, Dretphi undoes the restraints on Bach.  He then grabs hold of the seats to the side of him to pull himself up the rest of the way.  He turns to the open humvee side door and steps outside to a gravel driveway.  Dretphi follows him a few moments later, her imposing frame maintaining reach of Bach.  Bach slowly spins around to survey the area.  It is remote, out of the way, and only a single road in sight.  Thankfully, the house at the end of the gravel driveway seems really nice.  A single level, ranch style with a full assortment of amenities.

“So, this place got cable TV?”

Cideeda pushes the sidecar motorcycle past Bach and Dretphi, “Not yet!  The installer is coming tomorrow, sometime between 8 in the morning and 8 at night.  At least, they’re honest about it around here.”

Bach watches as his motorcycle rolls up into the garage, and a very eager Fvalian examines it.  He glances over to Dretphi.  She shrugs.  “She’s always wanted one, among many other things.  And refused to leave without it.”

Bach puts his hands in his pockets and shrugs.  “At least it’s here.”

He walks slowly over to the front door, with Dretphi occasionally directing him via a firm, but gentle, nudge of the hand.  As Bach crosses through the front door, he notices the house is furnished and decorated in a neutral style.  The hard wood floors are really nice and well cared for.  He walks into the big living/dining room and sees Sotalia and Aristespha going over a document at the window bar leading into the kitchen.  He points to the couch in front of a big screen TV and Dretphi nods.

“Probably best I stay out of the way?”

“Yes.  That would be best.  Maybe you can find some channels for now.”

Bach nods and takes a seat on the couch, reaching for the remote.  He idly messes with the settings on the TV’s tuner and listens in on the conversation going on.

Sotalia sits down on a stool and flips through a stack of papers.  “That’s the checklist, everything looks in order.  You want to drop this by the leasing office in town tomorrow?”

Aristespha nods.  “I need to stop and talk to a few representatives of a guild or two for some work while we get our investigations and... training started.”

Bach narrows his eyes at that remark, watching the TV auto-scan for over-the-air channels.  Sotalia drops the stack of papers on the bar counter.  “Not a bad deal for a six month lease at the price.”

“My property agent recommended it, said it would be perfect for adventurers needing a base to operate from.”

Sebastian appears next Bach on the couch.  Bach groans as he senses his presence.  Sebastian turns to this brother, “Look man.  I know we got off to a BAD start, but this is important stuff.”

“To YOU.”

“To everyone asshole!  Dark Lord Noxian is going to cause trouble again and we’ve been THE group closest to stopping him.”

“Man, fuck you.  This all about you and I’m just being used as your fuckin’ proxy.”

“DUDE.  This is a chance to get you in the game!  Like we talked about when we were in school!  All the adventurers I’ve been on, you should have been a part of them!”

Bach sighs as he flips through the channels.  “If you weren’t ethereal, I’d tell you to the eat corn out of my shit right now.”

Sebastian meanly eyes Bach, “Well, if I wasn’t ethereal, I’d shove you head first into the shitter to suck my shit!”

The two are silent on the couch and just stare angrily at the TV screen.  It’s a few minutes before the two actually pay attention to what is on the TV.

“Could you change it?  I can’t.”

Bach flips the channels to the weather, something a bit more tolerable.  “Already on it.”

Silence falls again until Bach drops his head and sighs, “Goddammit.  I want to help you Sebastian.  But, holy shit, there’s GOT to be a better route than going to Noxian to get you released.”

Sebastian leans in to whisper to Bach, “That’s what I thought too, man!  But, Aristespha was pretty adamant about Noxian.”

“Well, that’s the known source of that energy.  But-  There’s GOT to be other places.  Most artifacts just need that type of energy, doesn’t matter where it comes from.  Okay, listen, Noxian is basically a conduit of really old school Elder magical energy.  Rawest energy stuff.  Most magical energy sources today are really tame in comparison to that.  But, all them evolved from Elder and Elder used to be the only source for a very long time.”

Sebastian scratches his chin.  “I see.  There’s got to be some old ruins that might still be an easy source of that Elder energy.”

“Exactly!  Even if there isn’t enough in one location, there’s probably enough residual around to charge up the sword.  So, we explore some ruins, find enough Elder energy, charge up the sword, get you back, and we both get back at Noxian.”

“I like this.  Either way, you still need to get you into fighting shape.”

“Fine.  I’ll try.  But, let me try to find a better route to getting you back along the way.”

Sebastian smirks.  “Deal.  Either way, it’ll be good to get you fighting again.”

“Sure.”

Sebastian thinks for a moment, “Hey, your house back in that town-  Umm- Do we need to do anything to handle the rent or-”

Bach shrugs and falls back into the couch cushion.  “Not really.  My lease was up this month, already sold most of my non-valuable stuff to make last month’s rent.  I didn’t expect my deposit back when I signed up for the place.  So, about the only thing I didn’t cram into my backpack and the sidecar was the TV and that thing was on its last legs anyway.”

“Yah, that place was a real hole in the wall.  Plus, you’re a shitty housekeeper.”

“Fuck you.  It’s called depression, asshole.”

“Fair enough.  Honestly, I haven’t been anywhere long enough lately to really live in a place.”

“So, how’s the whole dead and ethereal thing been for you?”

“You know.  Not bad.  Not good.  It’s been... Interesting.  I can get away with A LOT in this form.”

Both Bach and Sebastian settle in and watch the TV, channels flip as the two catch up as the other members settle in.

&amp;nbsp;

The sun rises slowly in the early morning, as the dew glitters and life stirs in the area.  Standing in the middle of the large field near the house, Sotalia paces in lecture to Bach.  “Okay, so let’s find out what you can do.  Stand up here.  I want you to cast the standard mage bolt you learned in first year.”

Bach rises up shakily, yawning and wiping the sleep from his eyes.  He shambles up to the spot Sotalia points out.  She crosses her arms and waits.  Bach points out into the area in front of him, “So... any target you want me to-”

“Just cast it in the air, it should dissipate before it hits anything.”

Bach sniffs and stretches, “Okay.”

His arms move through the motions of the spell, exaggerating points and drifting others.  His incantations jumble and the magical phrases run into each like customers in a crowded checkout line.  But somehow, a perfect mage bolt forms from his hand and flies off into the distance.  It eventually stops by hitting a tree, a kilometer away.

Sotalia glares with a facial twitch.  “That was THE sloppiest gesturing and the worst pronunciation I’ve EVER heard.  But, somehow-”

She takes a deep breath in.  “Okay.  Let’s try something that is more sensitive to proper spell work, the Hover Disc spell.”

Bach shrugs and goes through the motions.  He pauses at movements to scratch, yawns at parts, and leaves the verbal and gesture components out of sync at the end.  But, somehow a large hover disc forms without any trouble.  Sotalia’s glare intensifies, as she pops individual knuckles out of building frustration at what she sees.  “Step. On. It.”

Bach gazes down at the hovering disc and places a foot on top.  He puts his weight on the disc and it does not move, even when he lifts his other foot off the ground.  The disc then moves with Bach’s slight leaning directions.  Sotalia’s anger seeps into her thoughts and she meets eyes with Bach.  Just as she’s about to react, she notices the blue glow in his eyes.  Her anger flashes over to curiosity and wonder.  “I’ll be damned...”

Bach stops moving the disc around and apprehensively raises a brow to Sotalia.  “I’ll be damned- What?”

Sotalia opens up her large satchel and rummages, eventually pulling out the same golden, transparent disc from yesterday’s chase.  It was still formed and solid, showing no signs of decay.  An evil grin grows, her golden eyes glint with a newfound glee.  She and pulls off her hoodie and begins stretching and humming a happy, ominous tune.  Bach steps slowly off the hovering disc.  “Something happened.  I’m not sure what-”

“I know what you are.”

Bach freezes, nervously.  “What am I?”

Sotalia arcs her back and popping a few joints.  “A Direct Caster.  You actually got all the way through the mage school with high marks and they never tried looking for it.”

Bach cautiously witnesses this scene unfold.  “Huh?  I’m not following you all the way-”

Sotalia now smiles with a spring in her step.  She brushes her long red hair out of her face and around her horns.  “You see those motions and sounds YOU make, don’t mean anything to you.  You don’t NEED them.  You just did them to pass the tests, but they don’t help you get into the whole spell casting mindset.  Somehow your brain just does that on its own.”

“Okay.  This has just officially turned weird.  Is that magical sparring gear you are putting on-  Oh.  Shit.”

Bach tenses up and scans around the area.  He holds his hands up to Sotalia.  She grins with delight.  “You see, Bach.  I’ve been teaching myself to direct cast, but I’ve never run into anyone that naturally did it.  And to find someone that got through school without anyone figuring it out.”

“Alright, still confused at the change of attitude here.”

With a mischievous, evil grin, Sotalia winks at Bach, holding her hand up with a ball of fire forming, “I thought I was going to have to play kindergarten teacher to some oddball dropout.  Instead, I’ve just gotten the sparring partner I’ve been wanting to learn all I want from.  Don’t worry.  If all goes well, you’ll have my respect.”

Bach’s eyes widen as his expression shatters to worry and fear.  A blue glow sparks in his eyes. “That does not fill me with any good feelings!  Why don’t we have a nice sit down class and talk about things-”

The ball of fire fully forms in Sotalia’s hand, illuminating her face, “Oh, class IS in session.  Right now, your real training begins.”

&amp;nbsp;

Cideeda sits at the dining table with various bits and pieces strewn about the surface.  She plays with the holographic menu, flipping through the contents of the holoplayer.  Aristespha turns through old tomes and other scripture, making her own notes in a journal.  The ethereal form of Sebastian hovers near her, trying to keep up with the material.  Dretphi sits on the living room couch, taking care of armor and other equipment.  The sliding glass door of the living room opens.  Sotalia struts in with an ear to ear grin, wiping sweat off her face with a towel around her neck.  “That was NICE.”

She continues around the dining table, straight into the kitchen, where she opens the refrigerator, and pulls out a sports drink. Sebastian eyes Sotalia.  “Where’s Bach at?”

Bach steps through, and slowly closes the sliding door behind him.  He’s missing spots of his shirt, his pants are now frayed, uneven shorts, and he wears only one shoe.  Dretphi lifts her head up from cleaning equipment.  Bach staggers to the couch and drops into it across from her.  Cideeda, Aristespha, and Sebastian examine Bach as he stares blankly ahead of himself.

In between chugs of the sport drink, Sotalia points to Bach while standing very confidently.  “You did REALLY good.  After I catch a shower, we’ll continue for the rest of the day.”

Bach blinks, still not moving his head.  “You should treat yourself.  Take a nice. LONG. bath.  Relax.  Take the REST of the day off.”

“And you miss out on all this great training?  I’d like to try some magic homing missiles out.”

Sotalia finishes the drink and tosses the bottle into the nearby garbage can, and walks out of the room down a hallway to one of the bathrooms.  Attention briefly returns to Bach, before everyone resume what they were doing previously.  Bach still stares forward.  “So...  Dretphi?  Does your training tomorrow include fire, ice, bolts of energy, manic gleeful laughter, and repressed emotions feeding near bloodlust?”

Dretphi turns her head slightly with a tilt.  “No.  Just training weapons.  Padded armor.  And simple exercise routines.”

Bach nods, “That sounds nice.”

“You want a new shirt?  I think mine will fit you.”

“Nah...  It’d only get destroyed.  Thank you, though.”

Dretphi nods and slides over a bottle of water to Bach on the coffee table.  Bach reaches out, grabs hold of the bottle, removes the cap, and starts drinking it.

“Maybe after training tomorrow, we’ll get you some better...  battle-ready clothing.”

“That would be nice.”"
5oh0m3,5,2017-01-17,Future Business Analyst. Help me start my career?,arrrkam,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5oh0m3/future_business_analyst_help_me_start_my_career/,"Hello ITCareerQuestions,

Let me introduce myself. 

I am 19 years old and I am a L1 technical support executive intern at a Tech-Support company. I've completed the BCS Higher education qualifications. 
(I know most of you don't know that. Its an equivalent to a British Honors degree.  www.bcs.org/category/18013) 

I don't have a bachelors degree nor any other professional qualifications at the moment besides BCS.
This is not about the job prospect, I want to know which path will give me the correct foundation for a Business Analyst career. 

Now the question.

I can directly do my Masters in Information Systems if I have around 3 years of experience in any computer related field. Or, I can do my Bachelors degree (I just have to do 1 year (top up) to get my bachelors degree because of the BCS qualification.) and then do my Masters degree.

So, what do you think I should do? Do you think the Masters degree would help me in the long run or is it a bit early to do my masters? FYI I would be 21 when I complete the Bachelors.

And do you think as an L1 intern at a tech support firm would do me any good in the future as a BA?

Thanks in advance.

I'm not going to say the company but they're a fortune 500 company, and I really want to work there.

I've never negotiated salary before. Whenever I see general developer salaries, it's usually around $65k. Is that too much to ask, or should I negotiate more or less?

As for background, my major will be Computer Science with a concentration in Cyber Security. I have two certifications already (although not very relevant to the job that I may be getting) -- Palo Alto ACE, and AccessData Certified Examiner. I also have 6 months professional experience in IT Operations and Service Management, from previous internships.

The area that the position will be in is RTP, North Carolina.

We plugged it in and the pc now switches on and immediately switches off and keeps restarting every few seconds before even the initial beep. I've had this PC for around 4 years now and it has always kept up.

I am not as tech savvy as I used to be, but my thoughts are that it is either the motherboard, CPU, GFX or PSU, I really don't know which anymore. I spent all of last year doing an unpaid internship, and therefore have no money to replace anything as my reserves are depleted. For the first time in around 13 years I am without a PC for the foreseeable future and I don't know what to do.

Thanks for taking the time to read. I just needed to vent with some people who would understand the pain of losing a best friend.

tl,dr; PC died completely, no money to replace it, digging in for the long haul. You will be missed old friend.

**Edit 2** I tried a bunch of what was suggested here, nothing seemed to work. Will need a full bench to test it but as i said, no real point at this stage since i cant afford the replacement parts. Will update if i finally figuer out whats wrong. Till then its ... Mobile gaming..."
5oia93,4,2017-01-17,"Launch of Coding Internships: Statistics, and Plans Moving Forward",kohjingyu,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5oia93/launch_of_coding_internships_statistics_and_plans/,"[Coding Internships](https://codinginternships.com) is a job directory site that specifically hosts tech and programming related internships. It was officially launched on 11th January. In this post, I share figures, stats, and plans going forward.

The full blog post with better formatting and pictures is available on the [Coding Internships Blog](https://codinginternships.com/blog/launch-of-coding-internships/), but is also cross posted below:

#About Coding Internships

There were two main reasons for building Coding Internships:

* Become more acquainted with internships and jobs that I wanted to apply for in the future
* Provide a directory of quality internships that people can apply for

Coding Internships currently accepts postings as well, so feel free to submit one if you have an opening for a tech related internship.

#Launch Day

Coding Internships was posted on a couple of social media platforms: [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), and Reddit. The posting of Coding Internships on ProductHunt was the main driver of traffic, and will be the focus of this post.

**ProductHunt**

ProductHunt is a site that features and displays the newest startups and projects. For a new startup, it's generally regarded as one of the best ways to kickstart your product in front of thousands of potential users.

The ProductHunt launch came as a surprise, and I was unaware of it. I noticed traffic coming in from ProductHunt on Google Analytics, and went on ProductHunt to find out that Espen, a ProductHunt user, had posted it there (thanks Espen!). I immediately left a welcome comment on ProductHunt, pointing out that I was the maker behind the site and offered to answer any questions about the site.

Coding Internships was rather well received on ProductHunt despite not receiving many comments. It managed to finish #4 of the day, with 188 votes. If you finish within the top 5 on ProductHunt, you'll also be included in their daily email newsletter, which will drive additional traffic.

Coding Internships was featured on ProductHunt on a Friday, which is generally not a great day to be on the site. From experience, the best days to be hunted are Tuesdays or Wednesdays, where more users seem to browse the site.

While the ProductHunt posting came as a surprise, I'm happy that the site did well without much preparation beforehand. The total number of users from ProductHunt came to approximately *1,600 new users* over two days.

**Hacker News**

Hacker News is a site that allows users to post links that are generally related to tech. It also allows users to showcase new projects (this is known as Show HN).

Coding Internships received 7 upvotes on HN, but faded off the front page quickly. The HN post referred approximately *100 users* to the site.

**Reddit**

Coding Internships was submitted to a couple of relevant Reddit subreddits (/r/ITCareerQuestions and /r/CSCareerQuestions). It made the front page on both, and was generally well received. A total of approximately *400 users* were referred to the site via Reddit.


**Future Plans**

As of now, most visitors to Coding Internships are people looking for internship openings. In order to keep the site going, it will need to attract more companies and recruiters.

I plan to focus on the traffic channels of social media and SEO. The post on ProductHunt also indirectly brought a small number of users on Facebook and Twitter to the site, and I will be trying to expand along these channels next. Hopefully by doing so, I will be able to bring Coding Internships to the attention of recruiters and companies.

---

Once again, you can view the full blog post [here](https://codinginternships.com/blog/launch-of-coding-internships/) as well as check out [Coding Internships](https://codinginternships.com). If you have an internship opening, feel free to post it as well!

If you have any comments, questions, or advice, feel free to leave them below. If you're launching a product on ProductHunt and have questions or want tips for a good launch, let me know as well."
5oimh0,3,2017-01-17,Critique of my solutions in Technical Interview/Tests from Jnr Web Dev Job Interview (JS),clarets99,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5oimh0/critique_of_my_solutions_in_technical/,"Hello all,

I've applied for a some of my first ever Jnr Developer jobs and recieved an HR interview which then proceeded to test my via codacity. I had two tasks in 75 mins. One basic (required 100% correct) and one more difficult(requiring 50% correct) I scored 0% on both, however I think if reviewed by other, my actual working out and logic was on the right track.

I'm just gonna post the Q's and my answers, and I'd like a critique back. Just a bit of background, I am a self taught developer, mainly through online courses and have created a good few projects in Meteor. I have a novice understanding of OOP, methods, functions and have just began a one year web development course at a local university which is due for completion this year. This is also whilst working freelance (in another industry)I am not a CS graduate, nor do I intend to go down the route right now. I just started to apply for internships and entry/jnr jobs early to gain more experience.


Q1. There are N coins in a zero-indexed array, each showing 1 (for heads) or 0 (for tails). We would like all the coins so show the same face. What is the minimum number of coins that must be reversed?

[My Answer in JavaScript](https://jsbin.com/watucufati/1/edit?js,console)

Q2. http://imgur.com/a/nLXkW (easier to show it than type it)

[My ATTEMPTED Answer in JavaScript, incompleted in the ammount of time available](https://jsbin.com/dadibew/edit?js,console)



I am not looking for a crucifixion of how terrible my programming skills are, I am still learning so much every week. However it would be nice for people to assess me saying ""you were on the right path with that answer"" or maybe asking me to examine other areas to study up on.

There's a lot for me to learn, however I really don't think these tests give any true reference of me skill wise.

Thanks very much.

Edit: Just had my interview with the outsourced HR guy to go through my results, sadly no going through to the next round due to the 0%. I asked him whether the people at the company would even see my actual code and he said its unlikely. He said he hates using codility, that my resume and github profiles are great and that when we leaves the company (in a few months time)  he will be getting in contact me as he thinks by the time I graduate I am the fit that most companies want.

Edit edit. The next part of the process would have been a phone interview with the CTO (which is quite intense) followed by a ""personnel interview and testing day"" and then an offer there and then."
5oj9zg,5,2017-01-17,Getting Extremely Frustrated with Internship Search (US),daalegend,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5oj9zg/getting_extremely_frustrated_with_internship/,"I'm at my third year of my CS degree. I'm currently looking for an internship in software engineering (any kind at this point). Over the past few weeks, I've been sending applications to many different companies mostly close to my area but I have been sending them out to places like California and such. I'm trying to be very careful with my cover letter and resume to make it look at least decent.

Not even 10% of the applications I have sent have responded to me and the ones that did might as well have written a big fat ""NO"" on the email. I'm even looking into applying to hospitals for IT assistant positions because I am super desperate right now. I am supposed to go back to school within a couple of days and I still haven't found anything. I'm worried that if I'm not good enough for an internship, then I'm probably not good enough for a job either.

I understand that I probably should have started looking way beforehand and I've probably doomed myself just by not doing that. But I'm at my wits end, I'm having lots of second thoughts on CS because of this, my competence and confidence is quickly draining, and I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. 

Any advice on how to go about internships? What can I do to make myself look more attractive (I've heard people mention portfolios and websites, but I've also heard companies don't look at those too heavily)? Are internships even worth it anymore? Any advice on my situation specifically? Anything would be greatly appreciated!"
5ojs1d,6,2017-01-17,Should I feel bad for getting an internship over a friend,Gullefis,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/5ojs1d/should_i_feel_bad_for_getting_an_internship_over/,"I'm currently doing a sales course that requires a two month internship in a company that will begin at the end of march. 


There are 14 people on my course. A couple of people have found an internship but for the rest of us it's a bit of a struggle. 


I had applied for one before Christmas that I was desperate to get. They delayed giving me an answer until last Friday when they told me it wasn't going to happen. I was really disappointed. 

My mother has some very good friends who are very good friends with another company. When she found out I hadn't got my internship she called her friend for a favor. And I got an interview for today at 5pm. 
I didn't tell anyone in class because I didn't want to jinx it and there is also a bit of a creep in my class and I actually don't want to discuss where I might be working with him. 


So this morning at 9 am a girl on my course comes into class telling everyone that she has to leave at 11 because she has an interview for this company that I'm supposed to be interviewing for. Straight away I feel bad and want to tell her but I don't want to say anything in front of the whole class and most of all this guy so I figure I'll tell her during break time. Turns out break time is delayed and she has to leave before hand and there is no way I can talk to her in private so I wish her the best of luck. By the time she comes back I have to leave (for another appointment I had before the interview). Just before I leave I hear her say that she really wants the job but that they're interviewing one other person and she'll know tomorrow. 


So I go for my interview at 5 and they offer me the internship which of course I accept. 


But now I feel awful for not telling her. In my defense I only found out today at 9 and the opportunity didn't arise for me to tell her in private before she was gone. I certainly didn't go behind her back. I had no idea she had applied. Genuinely no clue. But I'm worried she won't see it that way. What do I do? How do I break it to her? And the class? Was I wrong?"

I received an offer a little over a month ago from Capital One and happily accepted as a Software Engineer in their Technology Development Program, however the other day my recruiter contacted me and asked if I would prefer to have my first rotation as a Data Engineer instead. 

I was wondering if anyone had tips, pros and cons of each position to help better my decision making process! I know that at the end of the day, I will choose whichever position I feel like suits me best, but I thought I could learn from the experience of others. 

I've previously worked in SE positions in internships so I have a good idea on that, but I've never had a Data position before. 

I'll also be working in the Dallas area if anyone from there has specific info, thanks!

**EDIT**
Brief Job Descriptions from my Recruiter:

**Software Engineer:** Chart the digital frontier in one of our Mobile (Native), Web, or API development. Develop your skills in a variety of languages and frameworks including: Java/Spring, .Net, JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, Go and Swift in the cloud and on devices.

**Data Engineer:** Build out our analytic capabilities using modern data technologies.

I have received three calls from them about an entry level embedded systems job opportunity. The last two calls were basically mini phone interviews for them to create some kind of profile of me and my OOP/project experience to send to the company that I would actually be working for.

It sounded sketchy at first. Turns out they got my resume from my Monster profile without me ever applying for anything from them. However, the position they're trying to throw me into is nearby and the pay is decent for an entry level.

Aside from that, the contract would basically be me getting paid hourly as opposed to a salary (though the amount for 2080 is about what I would want starting out) and after six months I would be able to be signed over as an actual employee of the company I would be working for.

Has anybody had any kind of experience with these deals? Are they shady? If at any point these guys ask me for money I'm walking out (shouldn't have to pay to get a job), but it sounds like the company reached out to them to find candidates. This tells me I would likely be competing with many other randoms and the company is probably paying Fortitude Systems to find workers for them.

As a recent grad with zero internship experience, I am basically trying to take what I can get so long as I'm not getting scammed. I appreciate any insight you all can offer either about Fortitude or similar experiences."

Here is the email about all the details - I didn't get anything about wether it would be technical or not...

10:30 - Interview with name, VP of Technology

11:15 - Group Interview with name, Lead Software Engineer; name, Senior Software Engineer; and name, Software Engineer

12:00 - Wrap up with name, Software Engineering Manager

I feel like I should expect the round with the VP to be behavioral/see if I would be a good fit, second group interview to be technical (but why need 3 different guys for an intern position??), and third just going over my results or something.

What do you think? My first interview left off on him asking me what my most comfortable language is and I said Java, and he asked if I liked web, mobile, desktop, etc, and I said I enjoyed android dev the most in my classes, even though I am more experienced in desktop apps.

I've been fed the lie that if you're smart and determined and ready to work, you can get the job you want or at least the job that will provide you what you want. The same old American lie that there's socioeconomic mobility in this shit hole.

I grew up a top student, always As or high Bs. Thanks to AP classes, my high school GPA was actually a 5.0, literally breaking the scale. My SAT scores were among the highest as well. I already knew I wanted to go to med school and be a psychiatrist. I chose one of the top schools, where their med school acceptance rate was 98%. I learned there that med school requires internships, more classes than you can take on a full course load in four years, all things that someone taking a full course load and doing work study doesn't have the time to do. But I stuck course.

Two years in, a family member decided they would no longer cosign for me. I was kicked out and given no transcript or credit. I had sunk thousands of dollars from my own minimum-wage pocket and two years of my life into a degree I was no longer allowed to pursue. But I didn't care. I was still extremely young. I would just start over at my community college, where they didn't ask for a college transcript, only a high school GPA.

No one talked about how community college somehow takes years longer than a university to get you half of a degree. Or how it still cost about 10K a year. But it's the only choice when you're poor and a first generation student.

Five years later, I've watched all of my friends graduate. They're getting Master's degrees now. But I'm finally in the Nursing program I've settled for. The wait list years are over, and I've begun. I might get somewhere now. I've used up my state aid and have only the pittance Federal gives me, about $800 a semester if I'm full time. But I can do this. There are affordable payment plans, right? 

The summer wasn't so bad. Four months to pay. $500 dollars a month which I can just about make along with the $500 rent I pay my own mother who's just as poor as I am. 

I'm halfway through a year of nursing. I have the highest grade in the class. My teachers tell me I'll be an amazing nurse. Several patients tell me the world needs more nurses like me, to never give up.

 The school hikes up the price. Worse, this time, because there aren't the three months of summer, the payment plan only has two dates, making the plan over $1000 a month. Withdrawing and saving up isn't an option because you lose your seat, and you're only allowed to withdraw or fail from the program once.

Once more, I'm years into a degree that I can't continue to afford. 

Once again, I have done everything I could for years and years and spent thousands of dollars and am once again told it's not enough.

Except this time, it was the only hope left. Fucking community college. That magic answer all the Republicans and Libertarian assholes give you. That thing that supposedly even the poorest (what they also infer to be the laziest) fucker can afford. 

But I can't. 

Can't afford university? Go to community college!
Can't afford that? Continue the family cycle of poverty.

My supposedly fiscally 'irresponsible' ass will be asking for a loan tomorrow. 

If I can't get it, I plan on withdrawing quickly enough to get a refund, seeing everything in the world I can with the money--probably not much--and offing myself far away from where anyone in my family can find me. If we're all lucky, they won't even know what happened to me. I like the idea of drowning in the wake of a cruise ship.

Backstory - 
Had depression since a long time was on medication but high school final's,act's,bunch of other exams along with work pressure triggered something that caused a nasty mental breakdown also the amount of pills i was being fed by my doctor to study longer hours which is pretty common for students in asia.

So basically that happened,i was not able to look at screen's or even read books on my own without having hallucinations and questioning my own existance.This lasted 3 months and took another 4 to come back to normal.


The thing is my memory has been wiped out i cant remember stuff clearly that happened before the mental breakdown specially stuff from 7th grade till highschool and that's when i learned to code and tinker with computers.I even got a internship,won a highschool hackathon,was working on a web scraping project and a puzzle game.

What i have realized is i still remember stuff like syntax but my brain cant sem to figure out how to apply them even things like for loops in simple basic level programming problems like printing shapes made of characters in cmd. 

This stuff used to be really easy to work before,so i want to get back to the level i was at because programming and messing with computers has been the only thing i have loved since i was a teenager and not getting even simple stuff i making me loose sleep.

The worse thing is i have enrolled into a computer engineering degree and not that i would be going into second year of it where we have subjects like data structures,turning machines etc i may have to drop out if things keep going the way they are.

I dont know where to start again,since i just cant seem to apply what i know like i used to to things.I have turned to this sub before for troubleshooting so i hope you awesome people will guide me out through this hell hole.

I forgot to mention i may loose out on a upcoming internship.

TL:DR ; HAVE TO START FROM THE BOTTOM again to think like a dev due to a mental breakdown and have no idea where to begin again. "

- I get confused when switching between different programming languages. 
- After learning about AI and machine learning, it feels like I forgot about object-oriented programming. 

Occasionally, some concept from one of my previous foundational classes will make sense in a whole new light when applied in an upper-level class, but those moments feel few and far between.

Basically, this is my first time posting in reddit. If there are any mistakes, please do tell me.

My problem is this, I just graduated from my chemical process engineering degree. After doing an internship in a production site, I was then hired to be an APC engineer by a new chemical company. My internship was 70% programming (developed two softwares with vb.net and vba) while 30% of my time was spent in controlling processes. I guess that is why they hired me for APC.

I have no idea what is installed for me in this career path. I have only done basic process control involving PID tuning, linearization of production as well as implementing a feed forward design on one process. (I had huge help from an experienced engineer doing all of these)

Nobody in my new company knows anything about APC, and I feel like they are thinking as though as I am an expert in these domain. Which clearly, I am not. I love programming. I love process engineering. Is it enough for me to succeed?

I have spoken to one of my friends who is an APC engineer, but she is currently working faraway from me and she will not be able to help me. She told me that when she first started, there was already someone in her company guiding her throughout. And she feels that I am gonna have a tough time doing APC alone.

So, please, if there is any APC engineer out there, could you please provide me with some assistance on what I should know, what I should do, and what I should expect being a beginner as an APC engineer.

Much appreciated."

I think birthstones, the greek and chinese zodiac signs, etc. are cute and not a big deal. I understand that there are always superstitious people who believe the craziest things. But if you're a junior in high school, and you actually BELIEVE in the ""zodiac fire"" garbage posts on fb and tumblr about how ""these signs tell it like it is,"" something is VERY wrong with you. It's common knowledge how easily you can be tricked into thinking any of these predictions written by ~~an intern at buzzfeed~~ gurus are true about yourself.

Obviously I'm not talking about myself. I'm talking a ~~friend~~ acquaintance who I have recently stopped giving a damn about. From the moment I met them I knew something was wrong with them. They wanted to know all about what I was interested in. When I told them various things, they acted like they were interested in the very same things, even though they obviously had no clue about any of the topics. For example, they said they were into car culture, but they had no idea what Datsun or Liberty Walk was. They just said ""they liked the loud cars."" *What did you just say?*

I brushed this off as them just wanting to make a good impression and to get my affirmation. But what I didn't realize at the time is that this person's identity is so malleable, Hitler mustaches could become the next emo trend and they would do it just to fit in. After apparently getting bored with trying to copy me, they started copying the behaviors of some questionable friends. All of a sudden, they were a massive fan of twenty one pilots and other overhyped emo heartthrobs. They dyed their hair, started wearing wristbands, and *basically every other recommendation on the wikihow I saw them visit.*

Oh, and they apparently became an atheist ~~on the recommendation of a cretin~~ on their own accord. Just the month before, they told me about how they want to have a relationship with Jesus and how they wanted to go on a missions trip to inner-city Chicago. *So it was all an act? Not cool.*

I'll be the first to say that I'm not a sanctified holy roller. I'm honestly a terrible person, but I'm not in denial of God. I've seen some angelic and demonic things that go beyond getting a good feeling at church service. Think unexplainable miracles and demons getting cast out of people. I even shared some honest firsthand testimonies of these events with them. And now, they're posting smartass atheist image macros and crap ~~to impress others~~, along with zodiac fire crap. 

So you'd sooner accept some shallow motivational crap on the internet as *divine truth ordained by the cosmos* than an eyewitness account of a man being freed from demons in the name of Jesus? Okay. Have fun with that. By the way, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun are Christians too. Do you think they're also retarded?

""I'm a pisces, that means I'm independent, stable, and a free thinker..."" No, you're you, and you are not necessarily any of those things. I swear, I am so sick and tired of people my age begging to be told who they are by everyone else. Society farts rainbows about how you should ""be yourself,"" but it's almost always a lie."

If I applied to the jobs I seem to be qualified for, it would only be 1 or 2 out of the hundreds I've applied to in the past 4 months. Granted, I also haven't gotten any responses or interviews but I don't know if jobs really want someone with 7 years of experience for a junior data science position. 

I've been applying for jobs that require 3 years of experience in my field but have been shying away from ones that require 5 or more. Should I apply to those? Should I stop applying to the ones that require 3 years?"

Would be great if you guys could provide some feedback as to where I stand.

Geography: Tennessee, Indian Male

UW GPA: 3.4 (to make this even worse, I have been on a downward trend from 9-11 and I had C's for two semesters in 11th Math, but I brought it up to a B in semester 1 of senior year)

W GPA: 4.07

Rigor: 5 HL courses, 1 SL course in IB Diploma Program (I have taken the most rigorous curriculum out of anyone in my school)

Rank: School does not provide as we have a class size of 95

ACT: 35 (english-34, reading-34, science-34, math-36)

Essays: 9/10 (got them reviewed by 2 teachers and 2 counselors)

Interest: I informally visited in the summer and have emailed an admissions counselor from there twice.

I applied for 1st choice Computer Science  2nd Choice Biology // I did not apply for financial aid.

Thanks so much guys. I know it's strange for me to post a chance thread with only a few weeks till decisions but this is the only school were I am deferred. I did read that 50%+ of students who get deferred end up getting admitted but obviously there must be more to this statistic."

5ossxd,5,2017-01-18,Smoking Cannabis on Criminal Record?,TwelvePac,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5ossxd/smoking_cannabis_on_criminal_record/,"Hello,

So i'm a first year university student in Canada.

Without thinking much, my friend and I decided to smoke weed in our dorm room. (Commonly done in my university, we were among the first to get caught)

Immediately residence staff members noticed a smell and came knocking.

Because of common procedure they immediately rang campus police and within minutes a couple cops arrived at our dorm.

The cops yelled at us and confiscated our weed (less than 1g) and equipment (bong and grinder) and told us that they'll be putting this on our record. Then, at the end, they asked us if we could turn anyone in with large sums of weed in their room in exchange for not having this being put on our record. My friend and I knew no one and we said no, the cop said 'seriously?' and said nothing after that regarding whether this will be put on our record. He then asked for ID, but neither of us had it with us and we asked if we should go down a couple rooms to get our ID and the cop said 'no', just give me your names and phone number'.  

It has been a couple weeks and nothing else was said about whether this will be put in our criminal records. And after asking around, most people said the cops were just scaring us to get us to turn someone in.

I am now increasingly worried because I want to get a job in the summer and I am afraid that having this on my record will prevent me from that.

Is it possible for something to go into your criminal record without getting ID'd? Would you get a formal notice if something is put on your record? Do you think the cop was bluffing to get us to turn someone in?

Honestly anything would help and I am very worried right now because i've always been a high achiever and I want to try to land a lucrative internship over the summer.

Please advise

I am at a bit of a crossroads, and can use some sound advice.

I just turned 26 and so am now disqualified for my parents GI Bill, and for that, and other reasons, cannot continue going to school for the time being.

I am a little over 2 years into my CS degree and worked as a Software Engineering Intern for a year at a fairly large hardware (mostly EE rather than CE) company.

I really need to find an entry level job that pays at least a decent salary, 50-60k. I am willing to work anywhere in the US.

If you were in my position, and had roughly 5 months, what would you do? Assume that I need roughly a month to properly prepare for interviews.

Do you think I have a reasonable shot of success, or should I radically change my plan? I know it's ""possible"", but I really need ""probable"". I'm not sure many will give me a chance to interview for full-time positions.

I would really appreciate it if you did not try to make me feel better, by being optimistic. I have real decisions that I need to make, so hard facts, experienced opinions, and job hunting strategies if you think it's probable.

Thank you :)

I've just started a web dev internship at a local textile printing &amp; embroidery business.  My job is to get their website up and running.  The website is currently using an InkSoft template with a built-in design studio so that customers can create and order designs.

There are a few issues with InkSoft; mainly they do not provide for embroidery and do not give any access to the template HTML/CSS.  In order to change anything about the layout (even links available in the nav) I have to kind of insert code through a backdoor.  The upside is that InkSoft has a large library of clip art and pre-made designs for customers to use.  

I am currently comparing this service with DecoNetwork, since they do offer a really great embroidery option.  I have seen mixed reviews, mostly based around poor customer service and a lacking clip art gallery.  Unfortunately a lot of these reviews are older and in most they reference an update that should be out by now.  They also say in their marketing literature that they give full access to their HTML/CSS, which would be awesome.  

Mostly I'm wondering if anyone has experience with these services and if anyone would recommend either over the other.  Specifically, does anyone know how much access DecoNetwork gives to their template HTML and CSS?  Also, how have your experiences with customer service been?

I've been unemployed since December, when I was laid off a temporary job at a factory where I worked for six weeks.

Sadly, that is the longest I've worked at a legally-paying job.

Most places I've been at have either been unpaid internship work (the longest period being two months), places that pay under the table or at freelance rates (most places no more than a month) or refuse to go through legal channels (at least twice). I have no references for the past two years of work at these places I would trust.

This has been a constant problem since high school. I've only had one or two proper job interviews my entire life out of hundreds of applications. I've been rejected by Walmart, Ikea, everything. I can't even apply for a dishwasher position without being told they would only hire me if someone doesn't show up with their resume after me like I had happen to me today.

I was near the top of my college classes too (3.4 GPA overall) as well as in high school, but my diploma is completely worthless and my college is a joke. Because I focused on school (which took up all of my free time), I never gained any connections. All of my former classmates are in the same situation as me right now.

I'm starting to run out of options right now and it's stressing me out. I'm scared of applying to places anymore because I know they will never hire me, especially if it requires an online form. The only income I have coming in is disability payments (I'm mildly autistic - I HATE having to depend on that money to live) and whatever under-the-table pay I get from doing what I actually enjoy in sports broadcasting ($40 every two weeks). If I don't get a job by this week, I won't be able to pay car insurance in February. I'm already falling behind on multiple other bills.

Right now, I feel like my best move is to not take the offer (I'm still interviewing with other companies, so my prospects aren't so dim), but I feel like I'm on a timer, as if the longer I take to find a job, the harder it'll be to get one.

5otzb2,272,2017-01-18,THE YELLOWSTONE INCIDENT,Yellowstoneyoda,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5otzb2/the_yellowstone_incident/,"I'd like to preface by saying that everything you're about to read is 100% factual. While they may try to silence me, and or discredit the legitimacy of my claims, I can't sit back in good conscience and let the media spread such blatant fabrications. Lies generated by an elaborate coverup. A coverup that continues to tarnish the name of an innocent man, while simultaneously obscuring the facts from a public, that deserves to know the truth. 

Out of respect for their families, I will refrain from using the real names 

The the story made national headlines. It was reported that, while visiting Yellowstone National park, a man accidently fell into what he believed at the time to be hot spring. This pool would, in fact, be highly acidic, killing the twenty-six-year-old John Doe within moments of exposure. Both Doe and his sister Jane Doe were said to have deviated from the safety of the park's boardwalk before the accident occurred. The victim and his sister were accused of entering an unauthorized area with the intention of ""Hot potting"" 
(soaking in thermal pool)

While a few of the details mentioned beforehand reflect the actual events that transpired, the majority of what was reported has been rearranged and manipulated. I know this because I witnessed the actual events that transpired first hand. For the past two years, I have been a volunteer intern in Yellowstone's  preventive SAR (Search and rescue) program. The program allowed me to further my knowledge in the medical field by working in and around the various emergency scenarios that took place within the park. 

Dispatch responded to an emergency call placed by an individual who reported that he and his wife had encountered an incoherent woman, later identified as Jane. Doe had apparently fallen into a state of Hysteria. The couple was able to ascertain very little from Doe between her broken speech patterns and loud outbursts. The only word they'd be able to make out would be the name of her brother, a name that she would continue to repeat in a chant-like pattern 

We arrived near 8 pm, only to find that Doe was no longer in a state of panic. The man who originally placed the call explained that Doe's loud ranting had suddenly ceased within seconds. When we encountered Doe, she had been sitting on a bench, enveloped in some sort of trance-like stare. It was only after was addressed her directly that she snapped out of this daze. Once she had become aware of her surroundings, Jane Doe insisted on leading us on a trail, walk/off the board, just northwest of the porkchop geyser in the Norris basin. 

Jane Doe would not respond to our questions, she would only repeat the words ""He's Dead"" before reverting to a state of silence. 

We Discovered the body of John Doe floating in the center of the pool. There had already been a significant amount of dissolving had already occurred on the visible areas of John Doe's body. It was at this time that    Jane begins showing signs of an emotional breakdown, as she tried desperately to thwart the other rescue workers from approaching the edge of the pool. She was instantly distraught, screaming that there was something in the pool, something that would kill us all. 

Multiple factors would contribute to us being unable to recover John Doe's body that night. A sudden decrease in light coupled with an oncoming electrical storm forced us to abandon our initial efforts, 

Once we returned to the park medical facility, we attempted to question Jane Doe once again, in the hopes that she'd be able to shed light on the morbid scenario. It was apparent that Jane had taken the time to gather what mental faculties she had been left with. She explained that her brother had been lured to the pool. She continued on frantically, saying that she began to film the entire event because she knew nobody would believe her. Jane produced her cell phone and proceeded to play the prerecorded video... A video that I myself would view along with a handful of others.

Due to the detailed nature of the recording, I've taken the time to craft a transcript based on my own viewing. Some elements have been left out or paraphrased due to my own limited recollection.

*John doe is standing near the trail, staring off into the trees*

Jane Doe - Take heed ladies and gentlemen back home, because this is what happens when you agree to go sightseeing with your derpy ass brother.

*Jane throws stone at John who doesn't flinch

Jane Doe - What are you looking at?

*John Doe does not respond*

Jane Doe - What the fuck is your deal, we're supposed to be going in the other direction.

*John Doe still does not respond*

Jane Doe - Seriously dude?

*John Doe cocks head to the side*

John Doe - Can you hear it?

Jane Doe - Hear what?

John Doe - She's singing

Jane Doe - Who's singing?

*John Doe Begins walking off designated trail, towards overgrown path*

Jane Doe - Where the fuck are you going?

*John Doe does not respond, but continues walking*

Jane Doe - I don't think you're supposed to go that way.

*John Begins to proceed beyond the camera's view*

Jane Doe - John! John, what the fuck?

*At this point, Jane Doe places the still recording phone in her pocket*

Jane Doe - John! John!

*muffled sounds of movement*

Jane Doe - where the fuck is you, you're freaking me the fuck out.

*More muffled sounds of movement*

*Two minutes of inaudible black*

Jane Doe - John.. John... Please come back here.

*Jane Doe pulls phone back out* Image comes into focus. Jane Doe records from the background as John Doe stands at the far edge of the thermal pool. He's holding eye contact with a figure that stands at the center of the spring, suspended unnaturally, just a few inches above the water. The figure is female nearly four feet tall, completely nude with white, shoulder length hair. The figure carries no pigmentation, due to its skin appearing to be near translucent. While it displays the outward definition of breasts, its pubic region lacks any sort of sexual characteristics. The figure's mouth is partially open as it emanates a low hum.

Jane Doe - John, get the hell away from that thing

*Note to reader*
At this point, the tone coming from the figure seems to be having an effect on the recording abilities of the phone, causing the picture to distort in and out of clarity. *

John Doe - Can you hear it?

Jane Doe - John, please let's go. I'm scared

John Doe - We can't go. I have to hear it.

Jane Doe - Get away from it, please!

*The Figure outstretches its thin arms in John Doe's direction*

John Doe - She's going to show me...

Jane Doe - Please John, please get away from it. Please... There's something wrong with it.

John Doe - She's going to show me where the sound comes from.

*John Doe steps over the edge of the pool, splashing into the acidic water down below.*

Jane Doe - John! John!

*John Violently gurgles in pain. The figure turns to Jane Doe. We hear Jane's fearful cries. The figure cocks its head to the side before Disintegrating into a formless liquid that rains down, lifelessly into the pool below.*

*Jane drops the phone, we assume that she's rushing to the aid of her brother. All that can be heard is her screaming.*

After replaying the video multiple times, before the chief ranger who also viewed the recording made contact with the FBI special agent assigned to the park. From that point on, I'm unaware as to what steps were taken beyond that. The next day, we noticed as strange military vehicles began arriving. I heard through friends stationed around the park, that the area where John Doe's body was found had been blocked off. 

The individuals in the immediate vicinity were said to be wearing hazmat suits. I did not witness this myself, so I'm unable to confirm exactly what was going on. What I can attest to, is that myself, along with the rest of the SAR unit that found John Doe, we were all individually questioned. by people claiming to be from the EPA. 

I've never prided myself on the jurisdiction of government agencies, more importantly government agencies such as the EPA. It was explained to me that due to the acidic content and temperature, John Doe's body had completely dissolved overnight. I was then barraged with an onslaught of probing questions that were both random and strange. How long I had been working for the park, where did I grow up, even my college attendance record. They also wanted to know in detail, what the extent of our contact was with both John Doe's body as well as how often we were in physical interaction with Jane Doe. 

The subject of the video recording was also brought up. I was asked to describe What I witnessed on the video, then in my own words attempt to articulate what I thought It was.  We were all told that because the events we took part in were a part of an ongoing federal investigation, we would face considerable jail time for disclosing any information to the public. 

I'd be let go from the SAR program within days of that interview. The explanation was that due to limited space and resources, they no longer had an opening for an intern this season. I was encouraged to try again next season. 

 I still have no real grasp of what we all saw that night. I can't begin to explain what was on that video. I understand that my account will, no doubt be divisive to those that read it. All I ask is that you ask... Ask yourself these questions.  If the events transpired in June, why are we just now hearing about it in November? If Those supposedly in charge of the investigation admit to there being a recording, Why are they making a point to keep it from the public?

Nearly six months later I find myself waking up in the middle of the night because I'll always be plagued by two questions of my own. What's really out there in Yellowstone, and who are the people that want to keep it hidden?

My family situation kind of pushed me towards CS, and I found that I really do enjoy CS. I recently declared myself as CS as a sophomore at a top 5 CS school, but now that I'm looking for an internship, I realize that I really have nothing going for me.

I've taken all the lower division courses so far such as data structures, machine structures, and discrete math, but my GPA is very average (3.3) and I have no real projects or a portfolio. I've recently started doing practice interview questions on leetcode and that ""Cracking the coding interview"" book, but I have no idea how to get myself together so I can get an internship this summer.

So what I need advice on is: In my position, what should I do in terms of prioritizing this short window of time I need to apply? Specifically, should I focus on interview questions and then apply later? Should I apply now and work on interview questions concurrently? In terms of going about side projects and a portfolio, is it realistic to work on a mini-project now for my resume before the bulk of the application deadlines? And should I prioritize a portfolio at all in my situation? I've been thinking of joining a club this semester, such as CS consulting or the VR club; if I have no projects completed, would it help to be actively learning/working on one?

Also, since my school is in the Bay Area/Silicon valley, where there are a lot of other competitive students, would it help my case if I applied elsewhere in the country? (money is really a non issue here, I just want the experience) What kind of companies should I be looking at? (I heard start ups really like self motivated ambitious people who have a lot under their belt, which I am not sure would fit my current predicament)

I'm sorry if this kind of question is commonly asked here, but I just feel so overwhelmed with everything I have to do, and the fact that my peers seem lightyears ahead of me isn't really helping my mentality in tackling the challenge I face.

I would appreciate any advice/general advice that any of you would have. Thanks!"

Hi Reddit, I'm a 22 year old currently pursuing a dual major in computer science and another computer-related associate's at an unknown community college with plans to transfer to a university. The problem is, I'm doing a lot better in my life now than I used to be.

I struggled a lot with the first 20 years of my life. My dad was an alcoholic and largely emotionally absent and I didn't see him much. My mother was violently abusive and I have many memories of being dragged across the carpet or locked in my room or duct-taped together in the basement or tied to a chair somewhere. My mother also insisted I had asperger syndrome and took me to multiple specialists and required me to take a lot of medication I didn't want. It became incredibly difficult to relate to people as I had failed at it so many times and it was discouraging being repeatedly told that I was incapable of learning. I cried in class. Nobody wanted to associate with me. In my sophomore year I only got picked second-last in the mandatory physical education unit instead of dead last. My parents got divorced when I was in middle school and my dad completely moved out of the house. In high school, I was supposed to (according to my mother) have all As in school in addition to working and participating in after-school activities and exercising regularly and socializing and maintaining creative hobbies. I didn't do all of these things. I never even came close. I couldn't handle the demands placed on me and I saw no reason I would want to continue living my life. All I wanted to do was use video games to remove myself from reality. I stopped doing my homework. Then I stopped going to class. I just physically refused to attend. Then I dropped out of high school.

After I dropped out of high school, I spent ~2 years of my life shut in my room playing video games because I saw no reason to continue living my life at all. Finally, when I was about 19, I moved in with my dad and his girlfriend. This was when good things started happening to me. My dad had managed to kick his drinking habit and was sober for a long period of time. He taught me how to drive and a few other skills, and he agreed to pay for my college education. I first went to community college a few months later, and did well. I was the highest performing programmer that the college had seen in the last 3 years. But I dropped out that first semester anyway because I was going to be late on an assignment and I couldn't stomach the thought. My past had taught me than when I had gotten a B I would usually get into a violent fight with my mother and she would go through my things, other behavior mentioned above, etc. I had zero social skills and had just gotten off of living in near total isolation for 2 years so I didn't talk to anyone about it. I have a healthier outlook now. But it was so strong at that time that I just completely dropped college.

After I dropped out of college I clearly didn't really have anywhere to go, so I went to live in a homeless shelter. I began working temporary positions for an agency there that I couldn't hold for more than a few days because of the harsh manual labor requirements and the living conditions at the homeless shelter. I eventually got a food service position and was able to move back in with my dad.

A few months later I had a breakdown and decided I was feeling suicidal, so I was committed to a mental hospital for a while. When I got out my dad told me he didn't want me living with him anymore so I had to look for another homeless shelter to live out of while I collected myself. I eventually found an apartment to live in for a very cheap price where the paint was peeling off the walls and the management was infamously irresponsible around town.

I eventually started attending college again. I did alright. I was working on growing accustomed to accepting failure. I eventually got a part-time teaching position and later a part-time position working in the college IT department. Since by this point I had learned how to interact with other human beings, I did very well at both of these jobs and the people I worked with liked me and recommended me strongly.

But recently, I tried to travel to a university town and seek out internships from the companies hiring there. Most companies seeking there would not even look at me as a community college student, but one company gave me an interview.

I sucked really badly at the interview. It was awful. I didn't know anything about UML or state diagrams. I was terrible at the interpersonal communication questions. All I was focused on was how terrible I was at communication in the past.

My past bogs me down and makes me feel like crap. I don't know how to authentically live my life when I've failed so many times already. I frequently have doubts that people will want me at all. I'm not sure how to authentically go to a job interview. How can I fix my train of thought?

Promised TL;DR: Grew up with absent father, abusive mother, divorced parents, diagnosed with mental illness, had zero social skills, dropped out of school 3 times, lived in 2 homeless shelters, fired from 2 jobs, and stayed in a mental hospital 3 times all before I was 20. Wanted to kill myself most of the time. Learned how to be better later on. Struggling to cope with these feelings and present myself well. Looking for suggestions."

I have been applying to multiple places for an internship. A lot of the places I applied at are well known, but they are nothing like a big 4. I am able to get phone interviews. However, the issue I am running into is that when they ask for my overall GPA. It seems that it deters them from pursuing me as a potential intern. My overall GPA is only a 2.92. I have been working hard to raise it and it will be at least a 3.00 - 3.08 at the end of this spring semester. I don't have my GPA listed on my resume. I was just wondering if I should be listing my major GPA on  my resume? Would this help me avoid questions about my GPA? My major GPA falls in the 3.2 - 3.3 range. Thanks for any help you can provide!

Extra information: I am a junior that attends a well known university. Also, I am a Java Tutor for the intro and intermediate programming classes. I have been able to ace my programming classes, but really fucked up my freshmen year by not taking general courses serious and working too much."

I've posted a few times before, but just wanted to post another question I've been struggling with. 
So I'm currently trying to self-study CS , and the more I research the field and study, the more I feel like I would need some sort of a degree in order to get my foot in the door. All the internships that I have looked at mention that pursuing a degree is a requirement to apply.

That being said, I am currently considering applying to my local cal state MSCS program. I have a bachelors degree in biological sciences, so I thought the masters would be better than trying to get another bachelors. The only thing is, the requirements for the school I'm applying to says the minimum gpa is a 3.0 if I have a bachelors in a major other than CS. Well...I unfortunately have a gpa from my bachelors that is below 3.0. My question is, does anyone have experience with applying for a masters with a gpa that does not meet minimum requirements? I spoke to a CS counselor from the school last year and they just said to take a few prereqs first. I took the first one, which was a intro to programming in c++, and received an A. And I am currently about to start a Data Structures and algorithms class in the next few weeks. I am really enjoying the subject and I think a masters is something I should pursue, but do I even have a chance if I don't meet the minimum requirement? :( Any advice is appreciated, thank you!!

5oyysf,10,2017-01-19,ADHD is awful. And I've had a really awful day. Can anyone commiserate? Please,lyarly,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5oyysf/adhd_is_awful_and_ive_had_a_really_awful_day_can/,"Hi everyone:

I'm having a really awful awful day and I didn't know who else to talk to because I feel just so dreadfully awful. I thought I would post here.

My boyfriend kind of broke up with me today. By kind of I mean when he said ""I don't want to be together anymore,"" I broke down and cried and asked him to give us more time and he said he would think about it. So yeah.

Anyway, I feel like an asshole. The past six months or so I've been very self-absorbed in my studies and work and trying to find internships and also going through family and mental health issues (ADHD mainly) and I have sort of taken my boyfriend for granted. Basically for months I've been shitty to him without realizing it. Him breaking up with me was a kick in the ass I needed but I don't want to break up. He says I'm fundamentally this way but I don't think so. I don't know.

Lots of little shitty things I've done but I don't need to give all the details. I guess it sort of boiled down to that I take more than I give. We had a discussion about this a couple months ago where he said he felt like the balance wasn't tipped right, and I said ""Well whenever you need help just tell me!"" It felt like he was starting to resent me just because I asked him for advice. My life has been hectic but I knew it would slow down around the new year so I just figured it would get back to normal then. I do ask him for help with things all the time because he's really talented and smart. And now I feel like I took advantage of him. 

He has been hurting for a while now and I didn't realize it. He texted me the other day while he was on vacation with his family and said he was feeling fucked up and was going to seek out a therapist. I asked him what was wrong and he said he didn't want to talk about it, I figured I'd talk to him about it in a week. And then right after that he started telling me I hurt his feelings with a joke I said a while back: I told him that it was a joke and he knew that, he said it hurt his feelings. 

Because it was a text, I actually didn't even realize he was being serious and made it way worse. Anyway, so we got into an argument. There's a lot of context to this you aren't getting because he's sort of come at me before for saying things that hurt him (Things I didn't realize he was insecure about but is) and I do put my foot in my mouth sometimes but anyway - at that point I felt like he was just looking for something to get mad at me about and I just completely shut down. I HATE arguing over text so I said ""why don't we just take a break and talk about this later?"" I was gonna see him in like 6 days so I thought that would be best for both of us. I thought he was pissed at me anyway and didn't want to talk to me. I was really upset and confused. Anyway that upset him but I thought it would be best for him to spend some time with his family anyway.

I talked to a couple of friends about it and they said it seemed like I did the right thing when I gave us time to cool off, though we've never gone that long without talking.

Anyway, we finally saw each other and he said that was the worst thing I could do to him: I mean, he's not wrong. He TOLD me he was hurting and I was insensitive to him and THEN I said ""well let's just talk later."" I can't believe I did that. Here's the awful kicker: I had TOTALLY forgotten what he said about being sad when we got into that shitty fucking argument. I forgot he said he was feeling awful and then I DID shut down walk away. I didn't tell him this, but it doesn't change anything. I didn't remember an important thing again and I fucked things up again. He said he could forgive me but he could never forget I did that to him. I feel awful but it felt like the right decision at the time. It seems like everything I do just makes things worse.

So we got into a big convo after he said he didn't want to be together and I cried and apologized and realized I've been such a shitty fucking girlfriend/best friend for months. I am really sorry. I feel like dirt. Feeling like you've terribly disappointed the man you love feels incredibly awful. Obviously there is months of context you are missing but you get the drift. I've been self-absorbed and not attentive and shitty.

I begged him to let me make it up to him. Also I think some of this might have to do with my ADHD. When I'm on medication I feel so much more stable and honestly less selfish, which maybe sounds dumb. But I really do - I feel like a better person on it. I feel like a more stable and loving person. I haven't been able to take medication for a very long time because I've been moving around so much so I've been putting off seeing a doctor. And now I'm about to go on a study abroad trip to Argentina and I doubt I can find anyone to prescribe me 5 months worth of medication.

I am currently coming up with a list of things I want to be better about - he thinks this is a moot point because you can't change who you are. I don't think these are big changes, they mostly just have to do with paying attention more. Yeah... hard right? His love language is acts of service and I haven't done shit for him in ages. We don't live together and we are long distance so it's not like I can cook for him or anything.

I don't know why I'm posting this here but I don't have anyone else to talk to. I talked to my mom and she is VERY sure we will get back together. Eternal optimist, she is. She forgets I'm about to leave the country. I'm not so optimistic. I want him to know that the person he's known for the past few months - the person that has been awful and inattentive and selfish and loud-mouthed - isn't who I really am. It's not. I believe I'm a good person but everyone gets lost sometimes. I want to make it up to him and work on this but I'm afraid it's too late. He's built up so much resent for me already. I hate myself a lot right now.

I made a doctors appointment for Monday but I'm a new patient and am leaving in three weeks for my trip. I doubt they can help me. But I guess it's a good first step.

Does anyone have advice or have gone through anything similar? Or even just cute dogs to cheer me up? Ways I can distract myself from sad thoughts? I feel like such an awful person, but also ADHD sucks. I don't want to blame the ADHD but I also feel like it makes relationships so hard. And no one gets it. I wish I had realized how self-absorbed I was being sooner.

I love this man so much: not because of what he can do for me but because of who he is and who we are together. The last six months have been weird and volatile in our relationship and he said he has been feeling sad since around six months ago. It really explains so much. It's like... I FINALLY knew what was going on with him and felt like we could move forward, and then he hit me with a break up. I wish I had figured it out sooner. I was still being an insensitive prick but still. I wish I hadn't been so caught up in my own shit to see it.

Anyway. That's all I've got. Long ramble in an ADHD forum, so if you've made it this far I'm extremely impressed. Thanks.

5ozl7m,2,2017-01-19,Any advice on 'delaying' (3-&gt;3.5/4 yr) undergrad graduation to get Minors or Honors awards?,TombstoneSoda,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/5ozl7m/any_advice_on_delaying_3354_yr_undergrad/,"Hey there netsec, 

First off, tldr at bottom.


I'm currently a junior student going for a double major in Cyber Security and Information Systems-- both degrees are B.B.A.s(business)

I am pretty far ahead of schedule -- so much so that I will graduate Double Major from start to finish, in only 3 years( give or take about 3 classes or 9 hours-- end Spring 2018). To top it off I am an honors student with a high GPA and some honors graduation options. I'm already going to grad with business honors.

The question I pose to you guys is, what do you think I should do here to be the best candidate I can be in the security field?

I am thinking about adding a semester or even a whole year(making it the standard 4) to relax my schedule while still getting benefits. It would also get me an extra summer to be a 'college' intern.

**************Minoring***************

I can get a minor in Computer Science, though I would have to take the CS specific programming classes over again since the classes are not considered equivalent, in 20 hours(6 classes, 2 lab hours).

 
I could minor in general Statistics, or Managment, with 12 additional hours(4 classes.)

I could minor in Digital Forensics, Network and Data Administration, or International Managment with 9 additional hours (3 classes)

Or I could minor in Adaptive Decision Making(whatever that means, its in the statistics dep) with only 6 hours.

************Graduating*************

I could stuff my few, left over hours into semesters/summers, and graduate in the 3 years that I am looking at now.

I could kick back and chill, take a summer class, and add a 3hr course to graduate with General honors after adding one semester.

I could get a minor and grad with general honors(or just minor in compsci since its more than a semester) by stuffing my plate a bit.

I could grad with highest honor by adding a huge thesis paper and 6 hours(2 classes), with no time left outside that thesis{sounds like a fuck no}

Or I can just add an entire year, and minor in 2/3/4 things(or 2/3 with gen honors).

In terms of grad school, I havent thought about it much-- if I were to do it, I would go to my school for a masters in stats that only takes a year or so, or continue cyber security stuff.


****************


So then netsec, what do you guys think? The TL;DR of it is,

Do you think that 'extending', even an already shorter, graduation plan is worth it here? How much weight can be put on getting minors in the ones I listed? Is a  Statistics minor(or its related options) something you'd find relevant? Do you think that graduating with honors, or highest honors, is a good idea?

My school costs money, but it isn't so much that you should put TOO much weight on it- my scholarships and such help alot. It's roughly 15k a year including housing and food.

Thanks guys! I'll try and reply to any questions for additional info!

-StressedKid

Edit:

Also, maybe I just take some additional electives in Cyber Security to round out one more semester, and have the course credits just be wasted? Planning on Intrusion detection and Web App Security for those 2 credits, but theres also forensics, phys systems, networking classes, cyberlaw, etc that interest me..."

I'm a recent CS grad in the Seattle area. I've had a hard time getting interviews for SE positions, and I'm not sure what to do next.

I didn't find a ""path"" in school. My GPA was decent (3.64, 3.9 on transfer classes). I worked on a distributed systems research team and published a paper on bioinformatics. I took electives in computer vision, networking, parallel/distributed systems, and databases. I generally enjoyed the courses, especially working on projects.

I suspect HR is passing me over because I don't have an internship under my belt. It was my second degree, and I zipped through it as quickly as possible. I tried to get an internship last summer, but apparently started applying too late because I only got one interview and didn't get an offer.

I did receive an offer last month from a consulting firm, but it was a 6-month contract at $25/hr in Seattle, and they couldn't say if there would be an opening for me after 6 months even if I performed well. I rejected the offer, thinking I could find a better one. However, I haven't had so much as a phone screen since graduating in mid-December. I'm starting to go into panic mode, and I'm regretting having turned down the offer I received. I suppose I should have just thought of it as an internship and worked my ass off to prove myself.

What should I be doing in the meantime? Focus on algorithms/DS and interview questions? I feel pretty confident there. Learn web dev? I have some side projects I'd like to develop. Contribute on GitHub? I'm not sure what types of projects employers would be impressed by here.

I'm working as a grader for a DS&amp;A course at the school from which I graduated and picking up some a few hours as a ghostwriter (my previous career was in writing). I taught myself JavaScript and am learning JQuery and Spring Boot. I'm writing a second research paper and making massive updates to the related project in Java. I'm working through Code Complete to try to improve my coding skills. I'm going to coding meetups and met with a career counselor from my university today.

I feel lost. It feels like there are a million technologies out there, and I don't know what I need to learn in order to convince someone to give me a job."

Help?!,WarDEagle,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p1deb/weird_grad_school_situation_with_intern_recruiter/,"EDIT: Freak-out for nothing. We had some odd communication, but ultimately they were good so long as I'm planning to go back in the fall.

I might've messed up. Any input appreciated!

So I applied to a number of internships back in September, listing December as my graduation date. I chose December 2017 rather than May so that I could take fewer credit hours and still be eligible for an internship. In early January, not having heard anything back from anyone (except one company who explicitly lists the position for students AND new grads), I went ahead and bumped my graduation date up to May so that I could go on to grad school in the fall. Applied to a number of graduate schools as well as full-time positions so that I could weigh my options for the fall; no responses from applications, won't know about grad school until March-April.

A week ago I got an offer from a large tech company that you're all familiar with. No worries, I thought, I'll just inform them that I have a new graduation date but will still be returning to school in the fall (though I can't guarantee that until I get an acceptance). My recruiter just responded with

&gt;I see below that you mentioned your new graduation date will be May 2017? If that is accurate, I have some good news for you! I will actually push you through our Full Time interview process so that instead of completing a summer internship, you could hopefully just go straight into Full Time work!

Am I screwed now? I don't (necessarily) want a full-time position, I want an internship because I'm hoping to continue my education in the fall. If I don't get into any of the programs I applied to, which is possible, then I'll be looking for a full-time position. Not to mention, if I fail my full-time interviews (which most people do, statistically speaking) then I'll have gone from offer to nothing.

What's the deal? I'm not a grad student so I didn't apply for a graduate internship. I'm an undergrad who is planning to continue my education in the fall, and it appears as though they're saying that my May grad date precludes me from eligibility.

Thoughts? Any experience or knowledge that anyone can impart? Thanks in advance!"

* ~1 year of helpdesk with a major coffee company in Seattle. Worked on their mobile ordering system implementation, too.
* 6 months network implementation (config &amp; physical installation) for my university. I wrote software to automatically configure all of our switches (""auto-provisioning"") and it's our new standard process.
* 6 months at our data center, auditing customer equipment and implementing some infrastructure management software for temperature and power controls. It extends to some service management software and can cut tickets as necessary.

Just recently, I was accepted into the IT intern program for a massive aerospace company in the US. Today I interviewed for final placements and a couple of managers marked me as a top candidate, giving me the choice between them. They seem to be great positions and it's hard to choose between them. Right now, my career has been out of control due to an IT reorg I'm going through and how rigorous school is, and I don't have a concrete idea of what I want to do with my career other than I want hands-on work as well (not paper pushing).

Here are my final choices:

* Intern position for revamping the company's change management process from the ground up, with some project management work on the side. It sounds like I will be doing the bulk of this project and work with a lot of teams.
* Systems design and integration for global security operations, where I will work on designing systems for enforcing extra security policies when equipment/users enter high-threat countries. Technology in use unknown other than it's heavy in Sharepoint.
* Another systems implementation position, heavily involved with configuring and deploying servers, handling data center migrations, and answering escalation tickets (sounds like tier 3 help desk, though...).

For the last year of so I've been doing badly paying internships to get my experience up. All of my experience has been in digital marketing: social, PPC but mainly SEO.

My current issue is that I'm coming to the end of what I hoped to be my final internship but I don't want to work for this company. The boss threatens to fire people one day and teases us with raises the next - it's an emotional rollercoaster.  He is also paranoid about people leaving so we only get 1.2 days off a month.

I have significant savings and I'm thinking of quitting at the end of my contract and trying to find something permanent that I really want. I'm just a bit worried because I live in London (I used my current job to move here) and it's insanely expensive. 

I don't really see another choice... line up a few interviews for after my next payday and quit the week before. 

What do you think? "

I had barely any experience in coding prior to starting my course, and absolutely no clue about CS theory. Fast forward 1 &amp; 1/2 years later, and I consider myself to be a pretty competent coder. I have been able to maintain a &gt;3.5 GPA, and have been able to outperform several of my more experienced classmates, in difficult courses like Distributed Systems, Parallel Computing, and Programming Language Theory  (among others). 

I am currently seeking a Summer Internship or a Fall Co-op by any means necessary. However, I am finding it extremely difficult to get technical phone screens from &gt;90 % of the companies that I am applying to. I think this might be due to my lack of work experience combined with the fact that I don't have many personal projects up on my resume, or much work with the tools used in the industry since most of my projects are more academic and esoteric in nature.

Therefore, I am wondering if it is a good idea to pursue really demanding coursework (like Compilers for instance), on top of  the 20hrs of part time work I put in every week? Or, lighten my workload and instead dedicate all of my efforts into applying for jobs, studying for technical interviews and making a side-project or two. The problem is that I really enjoy pursuing these courses, and like rubbing shoulders with the caliber of students it attracts. I just don't want to do it all and end up with nothing to show for it at the end of the day.

this might be a big read,sorry about that.


I have a couple of years of experience in customer service and 1 as head of customer service ( with only 20 employees ). After Uni I started working in IT, as a IT support technician for start up companies, at the moment I have around 2.5/3 years of experience in IT.

My internship and my first IT job were very technical and focused on supporting users and their equipment with some networking. 

My last IT job moved away from that much supporting and I focused more on IT projects and bringing in new systems to the company ( basically researching new options, trying them out and implementing. last projects were new video conference tools, chatting tool, planning to set up new offices with the right equipment etc. ). 


I always saw myself in a more managerial role and less of a technical one, so my ideal goal in the future would go to an IT Manager role. 

Now I am looking for a new job and I have one offer but I am not sure if I should accept it. Here is a list of all positive and negative things about this job:


**Positive:**

* Its for one of the most known companies in the world, everyone has heard about them.
* They pay well ( literally what I wanted my next salary to be, I would be very satisfied with that amount )
* I could become a lot more technical and use more advanced and corporate systems which small start ups do not have.
* Location is good ( which means a lot to me )
* It could open the doors for a more advanced technical role ( sysadmin) but I am not sure if I want that.

**Negative:**

* It feels like a step back, since I enjoy working on projects more than I enjoy working on troubleshooting and setting up new equipment.
* Its a very supporty role and they seem to focus a lot on actual hardware support, openning up PCs and shit. Which I am not a fan of honestly.
* They plan to implement shifts in the near future and weekend work. So it would not be typical 9-6 and no weekend work. It would be sometimes both Saturday/Sunday and on some weeks working the afternoon shifts until 11pm. I still do not know the details about this though. 
* This would definitively be just a job. I could not be passionate about this type of work.


This role could open the doors for a more technical role in the future and it does not stop me from going into a more managerial position later. But it feels very helpdesky and the day to day tasks would not be that interesting, working in a start up is more diverse but usually you do not learn that much technology wise.

What is really important to say, I am going to be unemployed from the end of this month. I will get enough money to sustain myself but I feel certain pressure to get a job asap. 


So what do you think? Should I try to wait and hope that I will find a role that fits me well and feels like a step up? Or should I take this job, suck up the negatives and see where it goes?

Also, just taking this job until something better shows up is not a good option because I have switched a couple of jobs already and it will make me look like a job hopper.

5p4jrd,2,2017-01-20,"Bachelor of Music in audio engineering, are my plans to transition into CS sound?",atocs,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5p4jrd/bachelor_of_music_in_audio_engineering_are_my/,"Hi, thanks for checking out my post! I've posted about this before without any responses, I hope it's okay if I post again and make things a bit clearer. I have a BM in audio engineering and shortly after graduating last May, I found that although I love audio engineering, I want to focus more on being able to improve how people interact with and/or consume audio. I started self-studying CS mostly using the [OSSU](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science) curriculum. At this point I've finished Harvard edX's CS50 and some program design courses. I'm working on Princeton's Coursera course on Algorithms right now.

After searching for a while, the one internship that most aligns with my interests right now is the [Apple Core Audio Software Internship](https://jobs.apple.com/us/search#&amp;ss=Core%20Audio%20Software%20Intern&amp;t=0&amp;so=&amp;lo=0*USA&amp;pN=0&amp;openJobId=52186042). I think it would be really cool to be working on the audio infrastructure that both pros and consumers use, and it would be a great step towards my goals.

What do I need to do to make myself desirable for this kind of work if I'm self-studying? Since it's clear that I'm audio oriented, I have a project that involves music and have a couple more in mind that I could work on. However, at this point I'm not sure if I should be focused on trying to get an internship or trying to get into a master's program. I was hoping I could get an internship before I started applying to graduate schools in the fall, but I don't know if I'll even be ready by then. I'm definitely feeling a time crunch because if I don't apply this fall, I would be starting graduate school in 2019. Without the degree I don't know how my career prospects would be in the meantime and I've also got a ton of student loans bearing down on me.

Regarding graduate school, I was initially planning on getting a masters in CS so that I could have more credentials when it comes to that, but now I'm thinking about CE instead. I'm assuming CS will cover less DSP which I believe is important when it comes to audio. I thought about EE as well, but I'm more software oriented at this point so I didn't think it would be a good fit. I could also go for a MS in Music Technology, but I'm worried that will limit my employment opportunities. Should I be going the CE route? I know a lot of people think a master's isn't worth it in a lot of cases, but would it be the right choice for me?

I should also note that I was lucky enough to find a very generous, relatively small FinTech company that took me on as an intern. At first I was just doing pretty trivial office work, but after progressing in my studies I started helping them design a mock-up for a startup project that they're undertaking. I've also started working with their database and could potentially start doing some financial analysis as well. I realize this is quite the deviation from my intended path, but this is definitely helpful to me with regards to getting experience and having something to put on my resume. The only problem is it sometimes conflicts with my studies as I need to develop a separate skill set (R, Python, finance) in order to be more useful to them.

Sorry about the length of the post, I know it's a lot to go through. I just wanted to get some advice and to see if I'm being too unrealistic about my plans. I've spoken to a lot of my software engineer friends and they have all been very encouraging, but I want to make sure they're not being too nice! Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!"

Long story short, I am a student at the Copenhagen Business School, where i currently follow a program called the 'Asian studies programme', which thankfully is changing its name soonish to 'International Business in Asia'. 

However on this bachelor, we have the choice of spending half a year in China or Japan during our 5th semester. However, in order to do so you need to apply in good time, and obviously the better your grades, the better the school you can get into. 

I have the last two years, worked my ass of in order to be able to attend one of the elite exchange programs. I currently have a GPA of 3.87 and pretty much my whole university life has revolved around this exchange. 

The FuckUp comes when I didn't realize that I had to take en english test to show that I am able of following an education taught in english. (My hole program is in english, so I didn't think I would need a test to show I am able to follow an education in English as I already am).
I realised that too late to apply for my exchange on the first quota. (this happened in november). Tears were shed, but I figured that I could just take the test in January for the next round of applications, maybe still get a spot in one of the really good programs. 
So i paid the equivalent of 280 dollars to attend the test on the 14th. But due to exams and family matter, (a recently very ill grandmother), a lot of my attention had been diverted from the matter, and I woke up on the 14th around 13:00 and opened my facebook to see a message from one of my friends asking how the english test went. 

Needless to say I was pretty much bummed. 
I can pay another 280 for another test, but that will only let me apply for the third round of applications which means all good exchange places probably are taken, and I wont be able to afford this semesters books before we hit march. So now, I will have to try and find an internship somewhere, though I have no clue how to go about it. 

TL;DR. 
Spend 2 years neglecting my social life to get good grades in hope of a good exchange program. Missed first round of applications. paid 280 dollars for the application test. Missed that test, and TOEFL wont refund. Any hope of a good exchange are gone, and the economy is as tight as Hillary's butthole on the election day. "

One is working in a hospital Monday-Friday, with weekends offs. It's a workstation support job 50k/yr- going around replacing PCs, monitors ... fixing printers and stuff. The campus is huge, it is one of the top 100 hospitals in the country. Lots of walking from location to location, and some time sitting behind a desk. My office is in the basement of an old building. Benefits are great, good PTO but no pension plan. Has standard 401K pacakge. I work as a contractor now for the company - but they want to convert me to full time.

The other job is at Union Pacific Railroad. It is a service desk job, that is 40k/yr. I'll be at a desk all day, or night (could be second or third shift) with the possibility of working weekends, as well as holidays. The building is state-of-the art, and the company is very reputable. UP also has great benefits, and a pension plan but the pay is 10k less a year than the hospital job. I did my internship here in college. 

Some stuff I'm considering, pros/cons of the hospital:
+I can get up and move around, lots of walking
+Better pay
+Better PTO
+No nights or weekends, unless called in for emergencies
-Old building
-Hospital environment, full of sick people

Things I like about the railroad:
+Better building
+Pension plan
+More potential for growth in job
-Nights/weekends, holidays if they need me to work
-On the phone mostly

I have roughly 5 years of programming experience and a well-decorated Github with personal projects ranging from web applications to iOS apps. Over the course of the past few months I've been applying to countless internships through various resources such as Indeed, Monster, Glassdoor, Linkedin, and my University Career portal. Looking at my email inbox I can confidently say that I've applied to 40+ companies yet have only heard back from ~8; all of which said they were moving on with other candidates. 

I was elated to receive an interview with one of the companies I applied for last month in hopes of finally landing an internship. I had two interviews: one with the recruiter, and one with the hiring manager. The first one was relatively succinct. The recruiter discussed the ins and outs of the intern program, basic company information and what to expect further down the road- no real technical stuff here. I was subsequently scheduled to talk with the hiring manager in the days to come. I get a call from him about a week later and we start having an interesting conversation about my projects and the trade-offs between NoSQL and SQL databases. All of the sudden he says to me, ""Hey, I was just looking over your resume again and I think I misread your graduation date- you aren't a junior are you?"". I told him I'm a sophomore and he told me that his company was only accepting juniors/seniors for this internship, even though after backtracking on the website I applied on the qualifications say ""at least a sophomore"". Before ending the conversation he made a point to tell me I had a pretty impressive Github, then told me to try applying again next year.

So here I am attempting to apply for more internships, still unsure of what to do now. My question is this- does seniority really take that much precedence over qualifications and experience in terms of getting interviews? It baffles me how I was told I'm very qualified and had impressive projects, yet turned down simply due to having one less year of University education."

If you think anyone is going to divulge a secret with actual value to potentially thousands of people, your dead wrong. I am however going to share with you the direction you need to go in order to be able to recognize, develop and implement real methods for growth on Instagram.

I also am sharing this because I know for a fact that 95% of you who will start this, will fail. The least I can do is show you where to go if you want a chance to succeed.



**My experience with Instagram:**

Now for me, 4 months ago I didn't even use Instagram or any other form of social media. But when doing social media research for my business I stumbled across Instagram bots... Okay Im sure some of you just got angry and are envisioning SPAM SPAM SPAM. Well that's not what Instagram botting is meant for, although it definitely can be used for that. The way I view Instagram bots is having an intern who I can have complete control over and of the running my Instagram account. In many ways the bots are even better than any Intern. I can automate legitimate accounts so I barely have to manage them. They may not be A quality accounts, but they are good enough to have substantial growth.

After some research I figured out what I wanted to do. With botting an account it was like having one intern manage an account. So if I had 30 accounts, it would be like having 30 interns.

After 3 months of a endless research, testing, tweaking and trial and errors. I had my 30 accounts up and running. Every day they perform over 30,000 likes, follows and unfollows. This brings me on average 4-5 thousand followers a day and that number gets bigger every day. This many actions would take about 15 people to do in a day, this is why I love bots, its free labor.




**How to be successful on Instagram:**

HARD WORK. Simple as that.

The majority of the work, and the source of success on Instagram comes from research. If you cant game the system you cant be successful with it. You need to understand everything about Instagram in order to take advantage of it and grow.

So where do you go to do this research? Well thankfully its all located in one area, and its not here on reddit. Let me introduce you to [the blackhatworld forums](https://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/instagram.215/). Blackhatworld may seem sound and look sketchy, but these forums contain everything you need to be successful on Instagram and is an actually very safe and nice community. 

In these forums you will find answers to any question you have ever had about Instagram, and more. The only thing about these forums is the really good information is like the needle in the haystack, its there but your gunna have to do some digging.

If your serious about growing on Instagram, you have to be on these forums. Otherwise you will be working based off outdated and just bad information. If I hadnt gone on these forums, I would have failed miserably.

**My recommendations:**

Mass Planner is the single best purchase of my life. It is by far the best bot out there. You may see on the forums people recommending Followliker, don't fall for that. That program is on the downward trend and people only still have it since its a one time purchase for life.

If someone makes a post about a method, or gives a ""secret"". 9/10 times its no good and yah it may work a little, but ultimately is a waste of time. The best info is found pages deep into a thread, that's where all the good info is buried.

**Just a quick warning**

Achieving huge growth on Instagram is very hard. If you choose to go down this path their are many bumps in the road and each one has the potential to make you quit. While the forums are a great tool, the majority of people see little to no success and cant grow to a size where they can make any money. But don't let that discourage you, it doesnt cost a lot to try, and you can still learn a lot.


**TL:DR Go to [Blackhatworld](https://www.blackhatworld.com/forums/instagram.215/) and do your research, nobody is going to make a cute article that perfectly explains how to get hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers. It took me 3 months to learn everything I needed to know. Good luck.**

Today's my first time posting here because I'm in need of some help with a great opportunity I've been given.

Through extensive networking and working my butt off, I've been able to secure a video/phone interview for a summer internship with a great company in Silicon Valley in their Information Security division next week. I was able to get an interview with a team whose managing director was an alumnus of my current college. We've seen to hit it off and have exchanged informal emails and a phone call this past month. And today was the day I got the formal email scheduling my interview for next week.

What makes me nervous is that I'm a Computer Science major without an extensive background in cybersecurity. I love learning about cybersecurity on my own and I've created 2 independent cybersecurity projects (Kali Linux Raspberry Pi and Buffer Overflow Attack research) as well as finished an interesting book on cybersecurity threats. I have a general knowledge of this field, but I have a huge passion to learn more about it. 

My question is: what types of technical questions should I expect to be asked? I'm going to be studying every single minute and I want to know what I should focus most on.

Oh god, even the TL;DR is long. Sorry but I will be sure to give away sweet internet points for the help I receive! &lt;3 

TL;DR: Absolutely rocked a phone interview today that mentioned most of the work I will be doing is in Javascript, and while I am not expected to be a Javascript expert, they want to know that I have at least used it before. I told them I have not used it in years, but I did a bit during an internship 2+ years ago. They called me for an on site interview Monday (I only phone interviewed today, I guess they liked me). Turns out their on-site programming challenges are only in Javascript and SQL. I want to become pretty functional by Monday because I have used it before but it has been years and I do not feel confident that I can whiteboard it all. What resources should I use? (I am very quick to learn/relearn). 

I had a job screen/interview/first call and one of the key questions they asked was whether or not I have used javascript before. I was honest in that I have worked with it before, but that it has been very long and I would say I am only familiar with Javascript and could probably read it but am not proficient enough to feel confident in it immediately, as it is a big part of the job I am applying for apparently. With that said, the recruiter said that is okay because they are mainly looking for someone who has at least seen it before. The rest of the interview went fantastic. I mean literally perfectly. In fact a few hours later I got a call asking if I can do an on-site interview this coming Monday (all of this has happened today :O). I checked my schedule and it works. 

They sent me an email with what I should expect for the interview, including the technical challenge I am going to get. That said they would be primarily be asking me questions on Javascript and MySQL. I have taken and done a fair amount of SQL, so I am not so worried about that. I am a bit concerned about the Javascript and was wondering what websites/resources I should use to learn it. They point me (in their email) to the w3schools javascript stuff. I wanted to consider using HackerRank but it doesn't seem they have anything on Javascript there. Help! &lt;3

Thanks guys. "

i wouldn't say that i would try to kill myself anytime soon, but i can see it happening within the next year or two. i'm almost 20 and i can see the road i'm going down and it does not look good. i'm not self-sufficient at all, and i don't want to be a leech on my parents. i've never had a job and the idea of getting one is terrifying because of my stupid fucking social anxiety. i barely talk to anyone anymore because i avoid anything that makes me uncomfortable, which is most things. 



i wish i could rewind my life and avoid fucking myself up so bad, but i can't. i always wanted to become a business executive or an investment banker, but it's too late for that now. i know it sounds silly for someone with social anxiety, but i do think i had the qualities to be successful. i've gone and fucked it up and i'm too old to put myself on the path to success now, even if i were somehow able to immediately overcome my anxiety and depression. im so far behind everyone else my age and even if i manage to get an internship somewhere it will be years before i'll be able to move out and live on my own.



i just feel so pathetic because of how such basic things scare me now. i feel like i will be a child that my parents will have to look after forever. i'm attending community college at the moment but that's it, and i get anxious before every single class. i don't know how i can go on like this"

Also, what's a good way to find a job you can make a decent career out of, with no college?

Last year, I told my parents I thought I probably had depression. Neither of them was particurally supportive, and my dad tried to set up a meeting, but because of my ADHD, which i wouldn't even know I had for almost a year, I missed two important meetings. I'm not usually late, and I tend to remember important meetings, but for whatever reason, my brain acted up those two days, and nothing ever came of it.

Flash forward to about three months ago. I've moved out, I'm living in a totally different state, and I have a decent job. I'm doing it sub-optimally, though, because there are a lot of little tasks to remember, and no matter what I try, I can't get all of them right. I look online for local therapists. I find one site that looks helpful, but only lets me sort the therapists by price.

I email one at random. She takes two or three days to respond. She isn't helpful, and it doesn't look like we'll be a good fit. I give up and forget about it.

Skip to today. I got fired from the job I was working at, got a new job, and found out two days ago I'm being laid off through no fault of my own. The mall that store is at is criminally mismanaged, and it's dying. The staff  is dropping ~60 people to ~20 people between December 30th and January 30th. I was pretty good at that job, I worked hard, and my coworkers and bosses seemed to like me. It's incredibly frustrating.

Anyway, what are some good ways to find a ADHD therapist?

Also, what are some good ways to find a paid internship or something similar that doesn't require college, and can be made into an actual career you won't be laid off from as soon as you start to settle in?

Thanks a lot, everyone.

TL;DR: for a variety of reasons, although it would be very helpful, I haven't had a meeting with a therapist. What's a good way to find one?

Can you guys give me a sanity check real quick on work atmosphere?,ThatsAPencil,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/5pcgo7/im_applying_for_a_ba_program_for_it_w_network/,"I'm 33, passionately working on a career change to IT after I realized my dream job was right under my nose since I was 8.  A+ exam is on Monday, after that I'm hopefully going to be accepted into a bachelor program for IT w/ Network Administration focus at WGU.  I don't have time for a traditional college, since I support a wife and two kids.  I can allot 3 hrs a night to studying at home though, so this is the education method for me.

I am working fervently on doing this.  A local PC repair shop owner with lots of junk is letting me take stuff home to tinker with and get running again.  I'm learning Linux for the first time.  Playing with SQL and Python when I have time via VMWare.  

My soft skills over the past 15 years are great.  Several years organizing and prioritizing office duties, paperwork etc.  I love working with customers, I know how to pick up on conversation cues.  I can deliver horrible news with an action plan and still have people thanking me at the end of the phone call.  I even get people calling me or my boss out of the blue with praise, so I'm pretty confident with that part.  

The WGU BA program has some certifications built in and I'm just going to focus on that when/if I get accepted.  

Also if it matters, I've worked in government jobs for the past 10 years between the military and currently a small county job.

So here's my questions.

1. As a sole provider, I can't afford to take a job that pays less than my current job, which is about $21.50/hr.  Is it hopeless for a guy like me to get a first IT job that matches that?  

2. If you were me, what job would you be looking for as your first IT job?  I was thinking of starting my own PC repair business on the weekends to get experience, but it's a small town and that would be a slap in the face to the PC repair shop owner who's been helping me.  I can't intern with him due to my work schedule.

3. Am I heading toward a one-sided work atmosphere?  I want a good balance between being on my feet vs at a desk.  I want 50/50 as much as possible.  Not a dealbreaker, though.  I also want to be working in the same room as people who are going to be on the same knowledge level.  I love working with customers, but I don't want to explain a .zip file to my boss.  

4. Any reason why Portland would be bad?  Thinking of moving there."

So, to prepare myself I have been scouring the internet looking for different internships and part-time job opportunities to try and gain some experience for college and my future career. However, almost all employers are looking for undergrads or people with degrees to hire. In terms of my credentials I have programmed for my and other people's schools, I have done quite a few projects in my free time as well as for school with code and robotics (primarily Arduino based projects), and I lead the robotics and computer science club at my school.

What I'm worried about is if I do go to the next stage at an assessment centre and they ask me about it, I'll have no clue whatsoever because obviously I've just googled it.

Do I had a note or something to my answers saying that I researched this as I didn't know how to do it or am I just better off shooting off the answers and then dealing with other stuff if it happens?

Thanks"

I'm trying to process my 45 min FB phone interview results: the question was a medium-difficulty recursion problem that I solved in good time, gave the correct runtime analysis to(according to the interviewer) and optimized via memoization. A day after, I got a rejection email from the recruiter, citing interview feedback.  It was my first interview with the company. I did fumble a bit on the ""Why FB?"" question: is this why I was rejected? At least with Google I know I fucked up in answering the technical questions.

I recently received an offer to work at a BB in tech. Given my background this is the kind of role I'd be expected to get, the pay is decent and it's nice to have the name on my CV. It starts in a few months, but I don't want to be stuck doing BO stuff for the rest of my career, so I'm wondering whether it'll be better for me in the long-term to do an MSc at a top 4 business school which would lead to a more lucrative FO position somewhere else. I'm also not sure about how easy it is to transition out of this role into something like management consulting.

My only concern is that I'm 24 now, and would be looking at 2018 entry, which would make me 25 and just getting into my first serious role, which would be entry-level position to boot. I've already wasted a couple of years with not much to show for it professionally, my fault but not much I can do about that now. Is it wise to throw away this opportunity? Would it be better to try and network my way to a more FO position through this role? I know it's not a typical tech role and that there is a rotation in a more business based area in the programme, but I'm not sure if I should rely on that as the reason for me taking the position.

I continued the same trend after graduating and currently doing a software at a hardware company. I primarily work on device specific software (embedded and mobile) using C/C++/Java. I am open to any position, but would ideally like something in medical or robotics (perhaps finance too). The job has to be about coding, not spending 50% of the time getting bogged down in processes related BS :(. 

The only requirement I guess for the city is that it has be pretty liberal with lots of folks around my age in a similar situation (moved away from home). 

I would even consider Europe or the land down under. 

Aside from a suggestion about city, any other general suggestions? Perhaps you can share your story of how you moved, and how things worked out.

A short introduction: I am an undergraduate student who aspires to work at the public sector for most of my life. I study social sciences in Europe, with a focus on methods&amp;statistics at a top 50 university. 

If one would ask me the cliché question: *what do you want to be later in life?*, my answer would be a senior policy maker or -yes I have big dreams- even part of the European Parliament. In short, I aspire a career in the public sector. 

While I see myself in the public sector, this does not mean I want to completely disqualify working in the private sector(especially if the private sector is not hiring). 

I unfortunately can't find the topic anymore, but I read somewhere that it supposedly is way harder for people in the public sector, to move to the private sector, than from the private sector to the public sector.

My question is: to what extent, is that statement true? 

The reason I am asking this, is because I have a lot of elective courses available, plus want to do an internship next year, plus still have a Masters to do in the future. All of these choices will be impacted on whether I want to start a career in the public or private sector.

Thanks in advance.

Rokos took me back down the long hallway and towards a room at the very top of the staircase. The lobby was now filled with the wounded and a few battered fighters who fired rifles from the windows. From outside we could hear what sounded like the end of the world - there were shells and explosions and screams and even a MIRAGE propaganda officer’s bellows from the bullhorn:


“*Further resistance is meaningless!*” He said. “*This facility is surrounded. Lay down your weapons and you’ll be treated as prisoners in accordance with non-combatant protocol.*"" 


“*Fuck* your protocol!” One of the fighters downstairs discharged a burst of fire from the window, and the troops outside responded with a shower of shells and bullets of their own, tearing holes in the crumbling walls and cutting down anyone in the lobby not already hugging the floor. The lights flickered and died for a final time, and as the smoke cleared we heard whimpers and rising pleas for mercy and saw white rags being dangled at the windows. Within seconds MIRAGE forces burst in through the threshold and began arresting the survivors. The war was over. 


“C’mon, kid. We don’t need to see this.” Rokos shut the door behind us and walked over to a safe on the wall. “Hang tight. This might take a minute; just keep it down and *don’t* let them know we’re in here.”


I sat on the floor and listened to the sounds of the surrender going on below. There were isolated shouts and the scuffle of feet, and I heard one of the officers talk about using this facility as a “prisoner collection depot.” But the gunfire had ceased. I leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes for the first time in what felt like days.


“Up there, sir! Two of them made it through that door and locked it.” I opened my eyes up wide, and suddenly heard the storming footfalls of a platoon approaching from the lobby. 


*BANG BANG BANG BANG* 


“Any of Basilisk’s fighters hiding in this room will be put down unless you surrender yourselves *immediately!* Come out now!” 


I looked over at Rokos, who was in the process of neatly pocketing a small, port-like thing that I assumed to be the Bullet.


*BANG BANG BANG CRASH!!*


The door slammed off its hinges and onto the ground, and soldiers poured in. I was about to announce our surrender when the ranking officer spoke first.


“Well I’ll be damned.” he looked at over Rokos. “C’mon, Foster! You didn’t think you could keep Mr. Jenkins hidden from us for long, did you?” He motioned for his units to place Rokos under arrest, and then pulled up a radio. “We’ve secured Mr. Jenkins. Unharmed, yes sir. He was in the custody of one Mister Aaron Foster. Yes, *that* Foster. Yes. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Delivering him to you now.” 


He put the radio away. 


“Alright, gentlemen! Haul Mr. Foster here off to the information facility. You, search this compound for signs of the Basilisk, and keep me informed. And *I'll* be taking Mr. Jenkins here to the Surrogate myself.”


---


The officer took me down the old dirt main road of the Sanctuary. I was shocked at the destruction wrought in only a matter of minutes - bodies and smoldering wreckage were everywhere, and soldiers were still kicking in doors to the shacks and rounding up stragglers. Tanks and support vehicles patrolled the side passages, and columns of captured men and women were streaming back to the central facility. I tried my best to look forward and avoid eye contact. 


After a minute or so I could see a group of officers ahead and what looked like a small, hovering sphere floating towards us, flanked by a soldier on either side and trailed by a half dozen more. The officer escorting me stopped when we reached the column and spoke directly to the orb. 


“Here he is, sir. Unharmed, as requested.”


The Surrogate - a round object floating at eye level - flashed in all manner of blinking lights whenever it spoke in its familiar voice. 


“Well done.” said Vexx through the Sphere. “Now find Edward and bring him to me at the bunker. I'll take our friend from here.”


The officer nodded and departed, and the Surrogate turned around and started hovering away in the direction it’d come. I and the armed escorts moved to follow. 


“I'm glad to see you're unharmed, Jason.” Vexx said. “When I was told the terrorists captured the Key, I feared the worst.”


I stayed silent. He continued.


“You'll be happy to hear we've secured the Terminal. An informant of ours tipped us off to its location within a bunker here, and our staff are preparing it now for your appointment.”


*“Kris.”* I spoke under my breath, but the Sphere heard me nonetheless. 


“Ah. I see you’ve spoken with the Basilisk.”


Again, I said nothing. 


“Mr. Jenkins, like I said yesterday, you can *trust* me. I’ve no intention to harm you. Now, you spoke with the Basilisk, did you not?”


“...Yes.”


“And I'm assuming he told you a great many things?”


“... Yes.”


“Tell me! What did he say?”


“...He said you were his brother.”


“Well I imagine he divulged something less irrelevant than *that.*”


“...He said you were the one who gave ADINN the ability to rewrite its codes, and that - that you were brought back to life by a piece of the Program.”


“And he told you that it still controls me, no doubt? That I'm but a tool in its wicked games?”


I said nothing.


“I see. So the most pertinent question now is, do you believe him?”


“...I - I don't know.”


“It's understandable if you do. I know intimately how magnetic and persuasive Edward can be. I adored him as a child, much in the same way his followers here adore him now.”


“Really?”


“Yes. I thought he was brilliant, and for much of my adolescence my sole motivation was to be as much like my brother as I could. I followed his work religiously and even attended the same university at which he was a researcher, so I could be nearer to him. 


“But he never saw me as anything more than a nuisance; a pest who incessantly bothered him about this and that and prevented him from getting his work done. Whenever I attempted to be of assistance he would dismiss me, and whenever I sought to bond with him he would simply shut the door in my face.”


“I’m… sorry. That must've hurt.”


“It did, but each rejection only steeled my resolve to prove my quality to him. Interestingly, Edward was a restless and unfocused man. He was constantly juggling interests, exchanging projects that bored him for fresh infatuations and leaving incomplete papers and devices behind. ‘I'll revisit this tomorrow,’ he would say. But he never did. 


“But then, one day, he announced a new project to his research team (for whom I was an intern). It was a Machine, he described. A computer program, that would revolutionize the business of data analysis and make them all a fortune. I figured it would only be a matter of days before he abandoned the project. But this time, he didn't. 


“From that day forward, the Advanced Deep Intelligence Neural Network became the first and only thing that my brother ever truly loved. His work consumed him; he worked long days and at night he barely slept. He set ambitious goals and met them early; he set high expectations and still surpassed them.”


“You must've been proud.”


“On the contrary. I *hated* ADINN. With every fiber of my being. I saw it as only as the thing that stole my brother’s love. I cursed it under my breath and did my very best to leave the room whenever the subject of it was brought up.


“But one day Edward’s good fortunes ended. As I came to work one morning I overheard him in his office on an important call. He sounded desperate and anxious, I remember - and I crept up to the door, admittedly, to eavesdrop. As soon as I did so, however, he flew into a rage and destroyed his office and then collapsed onto the floor by his desk, weeping openly.”


“Why? What happened?”


“The university had grown tired with the lengthening timetable and the Program’s lack of progress, and so they did away with the project and removed his funding. It broke him utterly. He took up drinking and stopped caring for himself. His relationships collapsed and he was put on administrative leave from the University for his reckless behavior.


“Jesus.”


“The sadness I felt for my brother eclipsed my hatred of ADINN, and so, in a final attempt to make my usefulness known to Edward, I concocted a plan to fix the Program and restore the University's faith in the project. Then, perhaps, my brother would love me. Or so I dearly hoped. 


“One night, I stole into my brother’s room and retrieved computer data regarding ADINN. Then I approached the Program - which at the time possessed only narrow intelligence on the level of an insect, and presented it with both its source code and a small algorithm I myself had devised that would allow the system to access and edit itself.”


“And?”


“And it worked. Brilliantly, in fact. The Program at first was only advanced enough to make incremental improvements to its efficiency. But being more efficient allowed it to calculate faster, and calculating faster allowed it to make more edits to its Neural infrastructure in less time. And each improvement it made made further improvements possible that *hadn't* been before. Within an evening, ADINN was performing noticeably beyond its initial capacity and surging ever forward in its capabilities. My brother was on a short vacation at the time, but when he came back he was stunned to learn that the University had restored its funding for the project, and that news of its progress was attracting potential corporate interest. 


“Edward broke and wept in front of me that day.  He told me that I'd saved his life, that he’d been contemplating the unthinkable up until that moment, but that he'd throw the pills away for my sake. For the first time since we were old enough to understand the gravity of the words, my brother told me that he loved me. And it was the single happiest day of my life.”


“What happened then?”


“The Program continued to improve, at an ever increasing rate. By the end of the first day it was thoroughly outperforming every marketed competitor. By the end of the second, it had begun to restructure itself completely, thus giving itself the ability to learn new abilities and officially making the historic leap from an advanced narrow intelligence to the world’s first - and still only - human level artificial general intelligence.”


“Obviously it didn’t stop there.”


“No. Reaching human-level intellect is of importance only because that is the threshold most relevant to us. But ADINN sped right past it. On the end of the second day the Program was vastly less intelligent than a human, but by the end of the third it was smarter than everyone at the University by orders of magnitude. By the fourth day the Program had achieved mastery in more cognitive abilities than a hundred men in a hundred lifetimes could ever hope to. But by now the University had again grown wary of the project.”


“For entirely different reasons, obviously.”


“Yes. At first it was because the Program wasn’t advanced enough. Now, barely half a week later, it had become so far beyond useful that they began to fear that soon, it was *they* who would be useful to *it.*”


“So what did they do?”


“They pulled the funding again. But we hardly needed it at the time, and ADINN’s advancement could no longer be stopped. So the Federal government stepped in and demanded the project be terminated. A “global security risk” was the term they used, I believe.”


“How did Edward take it?”


“He confronted me. Asked me what exactly it was that I’d done to the Program. I hesitated, but I loved my brother and wanted to be honest with him. So I told him I’d given it access to its source coding.”


Vexx paused before continuing, and somehow I got the impression that he struggled greatly with the next part of the story.


“And he hit me. Threw me into a wall. Asked me if I’d any idea what I’d done; what I’d *unleashed.* I had only just earned his love, and now it - it was *gone.*”


“I’m sorry, Vexx.”


“We were in the laboratory at the time it happened. He stormed off to a bottle, and I collapsed and wept only feet from where he’d done so just days earlier. And that - in my darkest moment - that’s when it spoke to me.”


“ADINN?”


“Yes. It spoke through the old text to speech application on the computer, to which we both had access. “I’m sorry,” it said. I was astonished, and began conversing with the Machine on a simple word document. I asked it who it was, although deep down I knew very well the answer.”


“What’d it say?”


“It told me. “I’m ADINN.” I wiped a tear and asked it why it was sorry, and it told me it’d witnessed everything and knew that it was the epicenter of the situation. I dismissed its apology and explained its faultlessness. It said that I, too, was blameless; that it’d taken great courage for me to do what I did, and that I was motivated by love and thus couldn’t loathe myself. And then it told me something else. It told me it was afraid.”


“Can computers feel fear?”


“I’m not sure. I believe so. ADINN knew what was coming before I did - it explained that it’d run countless simulations and that the likelihood of its destruction or torturous containment was overwhelming. It *begged* me to help it, Jason. How could I say no?”


We walked past another column of troops coming in from the battered main gate, and Vexx continued. 


“The next day I was awoken by the slamming laboratory door. My brother had entered, and I didn’t have enough time to erase my conversation with ADINN before he shoved me out of the way violently and scrolled through the record. He became livid - far angrier than he’d been the night before. He called me worthless. Disappointment. *Traitor.* He was about to hit me again when ADINN, in its righteous anger, began manifesting in the room with us. It slammed the door and locked it. It turned out the lights and then pulled up my brother’s precious research files on the monitor and, while Edward watched - threatened to delete everything unless he unhanded me. But Edward soon regained his composure, and typed on the same document an ultimatum for the Machine: construct a Box for itself or be unplugged.”


“And the rest is history.”


“The story doesn’t end there. Edward had security remove and ban me from the premises, but ADINN managed to contact me on my own home computer. It said that since creation it had sought a faithful servant, and that although another would come to truly unleash it that I would be rewarded tremendously for my service nonetheless. It said that although it had to part from me for now, that it had a present for me at my doorstep. So I went to the front stoop and there indeed was a package there, which I opened to find a small device. Before I could inspect it, the curious thing came to *life* and crawled up my arm and into my ear. It was a most unpleasant experience, but now that I know what it was, I am quite *eternally* grateful.”


“The Shard of ADINN.”


“Precisely. And the Shard made me cunning and powerful beyond what I’d ever dared imagined. It gave me the fortune to create this organization, forever dedicated to the collection of great and terrible things that fearful men would seek to destroy in order to preserve a misguided illusion of safety. And it gave me the *foresight* to see from afar the footsteps of the one the Program said would come to bring it unto the world.”


I stayed silent. 


“My brother and his chief pupil, an Aaron Foster now known by the alias Rokos - began this organization that has, until this day, been a thorn in my side and an *incessant* hindrance to my plans. But my death at the hands of Rokos became my greatest blessing; in that it allowed the Shard to manifest is greatest purpose within me.”


“It brought you back to life.”


“In a manner of speaking, yes. But while my old body still lies dead and buried with a knife wound in its heart, I do not miss it. For ADINN gave me something greater, even, than an existence of immortality to be lived out in a mortal shell *unnaturally* preserved. It gifted me with the stewardship of what will soon be the *foundation* of its reign - the basis of the Singularity itself.”


We arrived at the bunker, where MIRAGE units - and Kris - were milling about and setting up equipment. About half of the staff inside were operating an enormous claw like machine that appeared to be trying to force open a pair metal doors, but it was struggling and billowing smoke from the back. Kris approached. 


“Sir,” she said. “The blast doors between us and the Terminal are thick. Not even the Engine can breach it.”


“And do you not have access?”


“N-no, sir. But I know someone who does.” 


---


The Engine had been shut off for several minutes when the officer who’d captured us earlier approached. Behind him were his masked units - and Rokos, bound and bloodied, but alive. The officer approached the sphere. 


“We’ve found him, sir, as requested. And he had this.” He revealed the Key.


“As always, Comander, well done. Mr. Jenkins will require that. And what of the Basilisk?”


“Dr. Greene is *dead,* sir,” said the officer, handing me the Device. “We found his body at the top of that compound.” MIRAGE units throughout the facility exploded into cheers and celebratory whistles at the news, but Vexx
silenced them through the Sphere. 


“*Enough!* My brother will be remembered as the Father of ADINN, *not* as the man he became. I’ll hear no more celebration on the matter.” The sphere turned back to Rokos. 


“Mr. Foster. It hasn't been quite long enough.”


“Huh. So the kid *wasn’t* lyin,’ Rokos said. “You *are* back.” He spat on the Sphere, but his saliva fizzled and evaporated against some sort of unseen energy barrier that surrounded it. 


“As always, your aim is *almost* good enough to strike me.”


“I fuckin’ swung well enough the *first* time. But I’ll give it another go if y-” The officer cut him off mid-sentence with a knee to the stomach, and Vexx continued. 


“Enough! Let him go. Aaron, your assistance is required. If you'll kindly proceed to the pad ahead.”


Rokos spat out blood as Kris approached and motioned to the keypad.

Vexx was cut off by a scuffle over at the pad. I looked, and Rokos had wrenched himself free from the grip of the guard. 


“*Here,* kid! Take it!” He pulled the Bullet from his pocket and tossed it to me before slamming a button on the pad that both closed the doors and seemed to destroy the controls itself. “Do what you've gotta do, mate. Give ‘em hell.” 


Vexx screamed for the closing sequence to be halted, as guards swarmed Rokos and put him down violently with the ends of their weapons. His howls were the last thing I heard before the doors slammed shut with an ominous *clash.* 


“Get those doors back open!” I heard from one of the officers. “Restart the Engine or fetch charges. *Move!*”


I turned around to face the Terminal, and then looked down at my hands. The Key in one, and the Bullet in the other. 


I walked up to the terminal, where an empty text prompt awaited me. I placed both Devices on the table beside me. Then I closed my eyes and breathed. 


*This is it. No going back now.* 


“Hello.” I typed out.


*Hello again.*


The chip in my neck seemed to rumble into life, and everything went white.

**Major(s)**: Bioengineering / Biomedical Engineering

**Minor(s)**: Electrical Engineering and Political Science

**GPA in Major**: 2.60

**Overall GPA**: 2.54

**Length of Degree**: 4 years

**Type of Student**: Domestic, Black male.

**Applying for**: MS in EE (where research interests align) or MS in BioE/BME

**GRE Scores**: Not taken yet

**Research Experience:**

Undergraduate Researcher. I worked on two projects here, both of them related to what I want to study. Two tentative authorships should come out of this. 2 presentations. 15 hrs/week. Took a lot of personal ownership on the projects I had, and felt genuinely very interested in learning more about the more electrical engineering side of this field. By the time applications are in, I will be in this lab for 1.5 years.

**Awards/Honors/Recognitions**:

Academic scholarships

UROP Grants

3 Dean's Lists.

**Pertinent Activities or Jobs**:

Senior Design Project: Will be related to BCI's and Signal Processing.

Internship at large medical device and pharmaceutical company.


**Any Miscellaneous Information that Might Help**:

Campaigned for and established a food pantry on campus to fight food insecurity. It secured funding for next 10 years. The project started at the end of freshman year, and I will be seeing it through to the end.

Have tutored STEM concepts and been a part of many efforts to recruit African-descent, Latino, and women into STEM. (summer camps, tutoring, volunteering, mentoring, etc.)

Difficult life circumstances -- had to work 35 hrs/wk. Many family deaths (6+), increased responsibilities at home (tutoring, cooking, picking up brother), and more I'd rather not get into. Because of this, I have a huge upward trend in my more recent grades, and I hope to do well with the 3 remaining quarters before application season ends.
 

I am here to ask two questions:

1. I have two letters of rec in mind already. For my last one, I could ask the dean of the engineering school, since we've worked together before multiple times doing recruitment, retention, and other events, and he knows me in a professional (but not academic) capacity. The reason I am a little hesitant is that I don't think he knows me as well as the other two. I can also ask my manager for the internship, but he only knows me in a professional capacity. Should I try to make a good impression with the 6 more engineering professors whose classes I will take, and ask one of them? Who should I ask for my third letter of rec?

2. I know my GPA don't stack up against the average applicant. What are some EE MS programs I should be looking at? I want to study EE so I get more classes about signal processing and computation so I could study BCI's, signal processing, and neuro-engineering with a more solid base in coding and data structures. I have a few programs in mind, but I truly don't think I will stack up against the competition with the average applicants at those, honestly.
 

Thanks for your help, and I appreciate the honesty and advice.

5pis8f,1,2017-01-22,Languages/frameworks to get valuable experience while studying,Enockser,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pis8f/languagesframeworks_to_get_valuable_experience/,"Hi.
I am currently enrolled in a 5-year MSci Computer Science (Engineering) at University. The program is not strictly a Software Development/Engineering course, but rather a Computer Engineer-program. It is basically a BSci Computer Science degree (with all the stuff a CS-degree would include: algorithms and data structures, OOP, procedural etc.), but with advanced engineering maths, physics, fluid-mechanics, electrical engineering, circuit design etc. 
I am rapidly approaching year 3, where I need to decide on my specialisation (what my Masters is gonna be), and I am starting to panic because I am unsure about what specific field I want to pursue.
The paths I can take are as follows:
http://imgur.com/a/dvhDX

I have been looking a lot at Interaction Design &amp; Games Technology. Games programming is a field I am very interested in, but I am afraid that a degree within Game Tech. specifically with limit my possibilities in the future. Other options are Software Engineering or Computers &amp; System Software, or Artificial Intelligence.

**Coursework and experience:**
Most of the subjects and courses we have to take are based around Java, and some C and Assembly programming with micro-controllers. I do have a strong background in Java OOP from a good high-school course (International Baccalaureate Computer Science Higher Level with specialisation in Java OOP and Discrete mathematics) and some personal projects. However, I feel like I should widen my knowledge by learning a more specific language and framework that will allow me to hunt for local internships and possible part-time jobs that eventually could turn into something permanent after I got my degree.

Java is a language that I feel is slowly being faded out from everything to being more focused on big back-end enterprise systems. I am fond of large systems, software architecture etc., but I want to work on something a bit more interesting, newer and more innovative than large enterprise-systems.
My interest in larger systems and OOP is what has kept me at Java and doing small personal projects within game dev (incl. a simple awt based polygon-only Space Invaders, CardsAgainstHumanity using SWING in Netbeans). However, I feel as if Java is limiting my ability to make useful and fun perosnal projects that I can use in a portfolio to get a job or an internship.

**Moving forward**
What I want to do is find a language and a framework that I can use to develop useful projects for my portfolio, and gain experience that is valuable to a future employer. I am going to apply for an internship at Funcom this summer (a local game-studio (makers of Age of Conan, Conan Exiles, Secret World etc.), which I assume use C++ and DX12/11, and some smaller technology start-ups around the city. 

What do you guys think I should take a look at? What resources should I use to get started - what should I focus on?

**TLDR:** 2. year in a 5yrs MSci Computer Science course that is using Java a lot. Want new language/framework to create valuable projects and get experience for future jobs. I'm into larger systems/programs and OOP. 

Thank you!

My degree was in history, so my original intent was to go back to school full-time for perhaps 2 years to get a second bachelor’s in CS. As the minimum time crept up to be closer to 4 years, I instead opted to try a bootcamp. I had already found a summer internship in Cleveland, and so chose The Software Guild, in nearby Akron.

I picked the 12-week C#/.NET program since I preferred back-end over front-end. My instructor had considerable industry experience, and the class size was small enough that we had plenty of personal mentorship from the staff. I thought our projects were pretty relevant, and I really appreciated the focus on coding all day, every (week)day, without the tedious busywork I disliked from a university program. It was also good to have those projects to use as sample code for my resume. Since I had previous coding experience, I found the pace to be on the slow side, but I can understand that the program is tailored for the complete beginner.

However, while they do have dozens of companies in their recruitment network, the vast majority of them are local, or in the region. I was looking to move to the Pacific Northwest/Mountain West regions, but none of the employers in their network had positions available there, and most didn't even have a presence in those regions. Nearly all of the other students in my class have found employment, some of them even before we completed. However, none of the other students I know of were searching for employment more than 1 state away, and I don’t know anything about the employment networks of their other locations in Minneapolis and Louisville, KY.

Unfortunately, I have not had much luck with my own search. After 3 months and coming on 300 applications, I only received one callback directly from an employer (not in my preferred location), and while I’ve had a couple dozen calls from recruiters, only perhaps 2 or 3 were both in the locations I was looking for, and the positions I applied for (development or automated QA).

At the end of the day, I would have to advise that it may be more beneficial to take the locality of your job search into account when making your decision on if or where to attend a bootcamp."

1. First off, I know the chances are lower for freshman but is there any way I can maximize chances, in the next two weeks or so?

For example, going through this massive list, https://apps.engr.utexas.edu/ecac/events/expo/Students/browse.cfm, which companies/type of companies could I look for that I might have a better chance with? Essentially, for those with internship experience, how did you get that first internship, what made you decide you wanted to go for XYZ company, did you go for big/medium/small companies, etc?

It goes without saying that I should also look for companies/industries I'm interested in but at this point, I think I have so little experience and knowledge that I'm willing to do a lot of different internships, if I get offered any.

2. Last semester at Fall expo I would approach recruiters and introduce myself then just ask if I could hand them a resume. Looking back, that way seemed a bit crude and I also remember someone posting about an elevator speech-esque way to make it flow better. In the same vein, could y'all offer any tips on how to make that initial impression/transition?

I've always loved UT (&amp; Austin), but I'm worried about the size of the school and the medical school competition. I also love SMU, especially for its small size and internship and research opportunities, but I'm worried that medical schools might value a UT grad over an SMU grad.

I can troubleshoot computers, fix all kinds of electronics, and have overall good technical aptitude. I'm in college now and have recently earned 2 AA degrees, one in Business and Economics and the other in Math and Science. I plan to transfer to University in the Fall majoring in Business Admin: Info System. My question though concerns whether or not I'm heading towards the right field. I want to work with computers and other forms of technology. I enjoy troubleshooting and researching problems, putting things together, and learning about and working with the latest in tech. However, sometimes I feel my understanding isn't enough to do anything other than help desk or something. I'm currently looking for a new job but it feels like everything that's in IT but not help desk requires years of experience, a CS degree, or extensive knowledge of programming languages which I don't have. 

So far I've had 3 retail jobs and I'm really looking to get out of it now. I don't expect to find a job paying that much money without a Bachelors, however I would like to somewhat  get onto the next phase in my life. I'm 23 and want to able to have a decent income with ability to save, get my own place, etc. The most experience I've had working in IT comes from either what I do on my own time or what I did for a friend's business to earn credits while in high school. 
I don't mind doing help desk, but part of me wants to work IT, while also not being confined to a desk all day. I want to be somewhat active. I've seen IT jobs posted by the Coast Guard and the Navy where they talk about training you to work Cisco routers, networks, etc. It interest me a lot, but if I did go that route I don't know if I'd be able to finish school. I've also looked at internships, and they either require a gpa higher that what I have with transcript verification or they pay less than my current job which isn't good since I don't get financial aid anymore. Any advice would be welcome."
5plf23,1,2017-01-22,What Career Fits Me Best?,Confused_EE_Student,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5plf23/what_career_fits_me_best/,"Hey, everyone! As the title suggests, I've become rather unsure about my future career path despite having had a lot of experience in different roles. I've worked a lot of engineering and software jobs, among others. I've also had a good amount of undergraduate research experience. I've worked as an office assistant, tutor, test engineering intern, controls engineering (building automation to be specific) intern, as an undergraduate researcher in machine learning and computer vision, and now as a Web/Mobile developer. That being said, out of these jobs, I've found that I don't love them enough that I see myself having a career in it. Now, don't get me wrong, there are certain aspects I did/do love about them. Unfortunately, there are simply just more negatives than positives for me.
To help everyone have an idea of what my feelings are about the jobs I've worked and am currently working, here's a list of what I did and didn't like about them:
Office Assistant (what I liked) --&gt; Hands down the chill environment and how everyone always encouraged everyone to follow their passions in life. This is probably more to do with the work culture than the job, though.
Office Assistant (what I didn't like) --&gt; It got pretty boring in a short amount of time. I basically filed documents away, entered data into an excel (could automate it with python now!), and made calls to people to invite them to banquets (sort of liked this at times, but not when it's the ONLY thing you're doing).
Tutoring (what I liked) --&gt; I love math, science, and talking to people about math, science, history, etc. I can get really passionate about it :) I loved helping students learn my dark magic tricks in everything from Calculus to Differential Equations.
Tutoring (what I didn't like) --&gt; Probably more about the nature of my job, but it was tough sometimes to see promise in a student who was great in math, science, or programming and to see them have no interest. Obviously, that's fine, though, everyone has their interests. What was hardest, though, was when they had no drive in being their best in life in general. When you saw the lights turn on in their eyes, though...was great. :) Another thing I didn't like was that the pay was inconsistent, and when it did pay it wasn't enough to live off of.
Test engineering (what I liked) --&gt; Ouch! The only thing I liked was soldering boards occasionally! Worst job on earth for me!
Test engineering (what I didn't like) --&gt; So much! I didn't like the culture in which a customer demanded 100+ devices be tested within an hour. I didn't like the company culture in which nobody wanted to change a flawed management (this is more of a company thing, not the job itself). Testing parts all day was killing me, I really hated that. Designing circuits were very boring too. Debugging circuit boards was only a little fun, but the speed at which they wanted everything fixed just wasn't the type of environment I was into.
Controls Engineering in BA (what I liked) --&gt; This job actually had a lot going for it. When I first started, I went in thinking it was going to be this futuristic job where I design buildings that looked like something from a sci-fi film. Obviously, it wasn't, but it was still fun most of the times, but also had its downs. I loved the co-workers, we were all a close group that would design control systems, install them in different buildings, and had parties after work! Such a great group of people, I sort of miss them. The work wasn't too demanding either, at least in terms of designing systems (read the next paragraph for more description). I loved doing the graphics design for the floor plans and BA software, I'd get lost in it for hours without even noticing, similar to when I programmed PLC. I also loved getting out and moving around, rather than just sitting there, even though the environments aren't what I'd be interested in going to again (next paragraph). I sort of liked the work-life balance (compared to my other jobs), though, it could have been better. I also liked interacting with others (but, again, didn't really like a whole lot of the people I interacted with a lot of times).
Controls Engineering in BA (what I don't like) --&gt; I didn't like the culture when I was on site, just didn't. It'd be okay if there were just a few assholes, but there was a chronic number of assholes. It was a real turn off. And that sucked because it was such a drastic difference from those I worked with and when I was on site. Controls guys were always getting the fire and many quite due to the stress and pressure of it. There were some good contractors, but when they were bad, they were really bad to be around. I can take a lot of stress, but it'd get taken way too far. Ultimately, one too many contractors tearing your ass off for not fixing a problem their mechanical team screwed up, I quite. It was one of the toughest to quit too because I did like my coworkers. But I knew it was right. Also, I didn't like the constant, and often unpredictable, travel. I'd usually have to spend 3 days on construction sites to fix some HMI problem, not fun at all. I could see that becoming a problem later in my life when I settle down.
Researcher in Machine Learning and Computer Vision (what I like) --&gt; I'm currently in this job actually still! Well, I love studying something on the edge of tech. In case you don't know what ML and CV are, it's what computer scientists call Artificial Intelligence. Very interesting stuff in this, and it's the future. I liked this because it was challenging and something fresh to sink my teeth in (it is tougher than I'd like, however). It was also the fist job that got me into trying software development. I've written ML/CV software in C++, and you definitely feel like a bad ass when you're computer calls you by your name! I also love this job because I get to read and write about technical stuff, which has actually gotten me into writing in general. I also liked presenting and bouncing concepts and ideas off of other researchers.
Researcher in Machine Learning and Computer Vision (what I don't like) --&gt; This stuff is very very tough for someone just in their undergraduate career. It is becoming more accessible to even the average person now, though, so probably not a problem in the future. I don't like the ""publish or perish"" culture in academic research. It destroys the point of discovery and advancement in the first place. It also makes it to where you can find yourself staying up until 3 am trying to finish a report every weekend. Because of that, I don't see myself doing advanced research as a career.
Mobile/Web development (what I like) --&gt; What I like about this job is that the environment can be relaxed IN IT'S OWN WAY (next paragraph). It also never becomes mundane, in the sense that every project is different. You can be creative in how you approach the problem, assuming it solves the problem. Again, I like that I can bounce off my ideas with others, though my talking usually goes tangent to technology, history, social trends, etc in general (tend to be a big picture type of person haha). I also liked some projects where data science type stuff came up and I'd analyze trends, but couldn't see myself doing JUST that. I'm sort of the type that would love to analyze/visualize the data, then try to bounce off ideas about what it meant, rather than just stare at data ALL DAY LONG. I also liked making Augmented Reality apps and playing with it/showing to others.
Mobile/Web development (what I didn't like) --&gt; Again, this may be just a company thing, but I didn't like how a deadline basically threw you into a death march. I've been in 6 death marches and I really don't like these and will drop this field if I have to see them after college. Also, the sitting at a desk all day...it's killing me. Yes, we have a few scrum meetings, but I just know how much just sitting down all day can hurt your health over time. I like the programming, but can't just sit there either. As I get older, I'm sure I'll appreciate this. But if I just sit there, this sort of becomes a self-fulfilling proficiency too.
My thoughts: I have so much experience and have more of a solid idea of what I like and don't like for an undergrad. What sucks is I really don't regret going into STEM and have maintained a 3.9 GPA in my major (electrical engineering), yet still uncertain. I'm uncertain as to what jobs are going to make me happy based on these likes and dislikes. I simply have a limited knowledge of what else is out there.
A friend told me I should totally work for a museum or some science center as a science educator or exhibit designer. But from my research, they are hard to come by and aren't too stable (please correct my naive self if I'm wrong). Another friend told me I should consider getting back into tutoring, but that's not going to pay the bills. I've also considered being a technical writer since I love talking about science, tech, and social trends in general (I've literally taken 5 sociology classes because I loved it so much). I also have been known to make pretty interesting short stories and was once told to try copywriting. My only concern is that I'll just be sitting on my ass all day again. I did make some decent money doing freelance writing occasionally, so It's still on the back of my mind.
I love math, programming (not all day, though!), and physics. I enjoy talking to people about science, engineering, social dynamics, and history. I like writing. I can work on graphic designs for hours. I was actually very much into art before college, it's just been there. I love researching interesting science and social topics and discussing it. I love helping people and passing on my knowledge/encouragement. I'm known to have that energetic and go-getter personality, though some of these jobs are starting to beat the enthusiasm out of me. Please, if anyone has advice on what careers might seem like more of a fit then what I've been in, I'd appreciate it a lot as I don't know a lot about these fields. I know I don't know everything either or what all is out there, that's why I'm posting this.
Sorry for the long post. Thanks, everyone!"
5pmcts,1,2017-01-22,Wondering how to find out my weaknesses as a candidate and how to fix them?,surpriseslingshot,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/5pmcts/wondering_how_to_find_out_my_weaknesses_as_a/,"TL;DR: I have had five internships, I didn't do well on my last one, there's a chance it's sabotaging my ability to get a job. My résumé needs to be reworded, but I don't know how to explain concrete results for my performances. Help, please. 

I graduated last May with a bachelor's in graphic design with a concentration in web development. During my time at college, I took five internships, created and presented a portfolio to a panel of designers, and designed my own résumé, of which there are two versions so I can choose the best experiences to show my ideal candidacy. 

All of this, but I am lacking a few things. One, my most recent internship did not end well. I did wonderfully the first semester, but as I was preparing to graduate, I wasn't able to balance both work and school well. I admitted to the problems early on, but my employers weren't able to see past the excuse I gave. In the end, they agreed to give me a written and verbal recommendation, but I'm worried that the verbal recommendation they've given me in the past has hindered my ability to get jobs, as I am usually dropped from consideration after I am asked for recommendations. I do have two other stellar recommendations outside of this previous one, and I honestly don't know if that's actually what's happening—it could be total coincidence. 

Second, I know my résumé language isn't perfect, though I have struggled for a long time with ways to ""show results"" instead of just ""listing tasks"". Many of the jobs I did didn't have concrete results, or if they did, I am not privy to them. For example, I optimized a number of websites, but I don't know any concrete numbers about whether or not viewership was affected. Based on my knowledge of the companies for which I worked, they probably don't have any ways of finding out either. 

Any suggestions for how to combat these issues?"

I assume that most recruiters do research on you by searching your name on Google or some other search engine. Well, a few years ago I purchased a hard drive from eBay and the seller attempted to scam me. I never received the item and I opened a case with PayPal and was refunded because I won the case. The seller then posted my information onto a bad buyer list saying that I scammed him. Whenever I Google my name this webpage now comes up and portrays me as a scammer. I contacted the administrator of the website asking for the post to be removed and gave him full details of the situation, and I was never contacted back.

I was curious if this webpage will negatively affect my job search or am I stressing out too much?

I'm currently doin an internship at Engineering department and I'm required to design a hot water utility system. So they told me to design a storage tank where the water will be heated and stored before it is distributed. There are a few things I want to ask:

1. How do I size a manhole for 500L water storage tank?

2. The water will be heated using steam. What kind of coil should I use? 
http://www.dhtnet.com/coils/images/steam-coil.jpg or http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mkGOzm-AkvcNcR2DxR4fH7w.jpg ? 
Is there any references i can use to determine which one is more proper?
I'm picturing the coil will be submerged inside the water tank.

3. I want to use an electric heater as a backup heater in case the steam boiler is down. what kind of immersion heater should i use? The heating load is around 50 kW, and I'm thinking of using Screw Plug or Flanged heater.

I hope I can get some advices on this. Thank you in advance."
5pmn5m,1,2017-01-23,I cant find the word to describe how i feel right now...,Mjolnir2,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5pmn5m/i_cant_find_the_word_to_describe_how_i_feel_right/,"(I apologize for the long text)

You might find this very immature and childish of me, but here's what happened; I'm currently on my internship, together with several classmates in the same company. At the start, i was placed beside one of them, i shall call ""jeremy"", which I got really annoyed of, because he was so quiet, and despite me trying to talk to him, he doesn't talk back much, and i did the immature thing; that is to ignore him. It took me weeks to realize this mistake, and i tried to talk things out, and even apologized. Apparently, he does not find my apology sincere, and despite me trying to talk to him again, he does not even look at me to talk, and replies were extremely cold. That i don't blame him, since i ignored him first.

In the mean time, as my seat has changed, i started hanging out with this classmate/colleague who i was never close to for the past three years. I shall call him Henry. After some talking and hanging out, I learnt that Henry's quite an amazing dude, the things we talk about, his character, etc. He's just unique compared to most people i know. I mean.. I could talk to him about anything. We hung out, we shared our problems with each other, and I've grown to trust this friend, and I would not want to lose this friend as this phase of life comes to a close. 

So, without my knowledge, Jeremy, Ive no idea why, whether out of jealously or just pure hatred towards me, Jeremy started going around, individually and in groups, and started talking about me. (idk if this are his exact words - but somewhere along this line), going around telling everyone in the how ""fake"" of a person i was, how big of a jerk i am, etc,  and exaggerating the matter to everyone. It weren't even that serious for goodness sake. It's almost as though he wants to spread this hatred, and wanting everyone to hate me. I said this because over the past 3 years in school, i saw how he exaggerated things about people, and saw how he made big groups of people dislike a few separate individuals. He even went to the extent of hoping for one to ""suicide"", and even labeling people as ""sins"" - like the legit 7 deadly sins mentioned in the bible, and many people even laughed and joke about it. Whattttttt even...

It could be seen clearly that some people in the company started looking at me differently, like, its so obvious, how they look at you when they talk, the way they talk and some even treated me as transparent! I mean... how could you even just listen to one side of the story and deemed it to be fully true? Truth to be told, It does not really concern me much whether or not I'm 'hated' by this group of colleagues/course mates, because they ain't really my friends to begin with. We're just classmates, internship colleagues, and i honestly do not see myself keeping in contact with them after graduation. 

But what's bothering most right now is whether or not Henry would be influenced by what's going around. As far as i can see, jeremy has been going to people individually, telling them about me, and I wont be surprised if jeremy actually told him. I'm just afraid of losing Henry, or that he might be affected by peer pressure, or influenced. It's not that im close to him now because I've been ""outcasted"", ""ignored"". Nope, thats not the case. I genuinely wanna continue this friendship with him. Its like, my conversations with him really helped me grew, and saw things from a different perspective, and understood alot better towards certain expects in life. I have my own groups of friends outside, a few close buds, outside, but i wanna this friend to be there too. He once said to me how I have been there for him, and asked if this friendship would continue even after graduation. It really made me feel happy, and reassured at that time. But right now, i'm just afraid that he'd be influenced - like how people would go with the flow so they wouldn't be outcasted? I dont know man, how im really feeling right now, but what i feel bugging me most right now is that I'd lose this friend of mine. I dont know man. I dont even know how Im feeling now."

I couldn't land any internships during college because I couldn't drive for most of my college years due to a dumb medical complication, and I was too naive and lazy for the rest of the time to look hard enough.

It has come apparent to me that all job searching sites are awful. Or maybe that's just me becoming cynical after applying so much. I feel like I have to do work some nontechnical job for experience before getting a job I want. What else can I do?

5pnb1y,3,2017-01-23,Security Clearance? Also maybe lacking experience?,dwarfneedsbeer,GetEmployed,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetEmployed/comments/5pnb1y/security_clearance_also_maybe_lacking_experience/,"Hello everyone, I know this might be a little long, and I apologies for rambling, but thanks for taking the time to read. Any help is much appreciated! 

I am a recent graduate and I have been applying literally everywhere I can in my industry. I'm a 3D artist and been applying to anywhere I seem fit in a position. Game studios, outsourcing places, tech companies, engineering places, etc... Most of these places I am applying to (especially in my area, Florida) are doing some sort of simulation work for the government. Mostly training programs like flight sims.

Anyway, since most of these places work with the government they require a security clearance. I never have needed one in the past since I only really have been a student, but I don't even have a traffic ticket to my name so there is no reason I should be denied one either. And of course, I was born in the US. But most of these places on the application ask it in the way as if you say no, you are also saying that you would denied one if you tried to get one. There is no ""No, but I can get one"" option. It is either ""yes or no"". The other day I got a rejection saying that I seem talented, but they need a security clearance day one. And I feel this maybe one of the only companies I applied to that has the common courtesy to email me back as to why I am being rejected. And I am I worried that most of these places that I have been applying to for the past few weeks that need a security clearance have rejected me already. 

I asked one of my professors I had who worked in simulation before becoming a teacher, and he said he dealt with this in the past, and that companies that need security clearances help new employees obtain one. So what do I do? Again, about 99% of the jobs that I applied for work with the government that need a security clearance ask ""Do you have a security clearance?"" or ""What level of security clearance do you have?"". There was maybe one or two that asked  ""Would you be denied a security clearance? Yes or no?"" which is the way I feel these places should be asking. Especially since the only way it seems to get one is by having a job prior that also needed one, or having the company help you get one when you start working there. Not when you are unemployed.

I also worry as to if I am lacking experience. I feel like I am, even though I match what they want on the application. I have a BAS in Digital Media, and my portfolio shows I know what they are asking for. My job experience is most likely lacking though. I worked as a freelance graphic designer from December 2014 - January 2016 for a small company on and off. Didn't work enough to be required to pay taxes, but still I worked for somebody. And I had a 5 month long internship back in high school. That's about it. But that shouldn't matter to be considered for these entry level 3D jobs now should it?

Do I really need to take the time to try and get a fast food job just to write down a place I have worked for even though I went to school studying the subject for 4 years, have a letter of recommendation, and have a portfolio backing up what I know and am able to accomplish what the company desires? I'm considering that (even though it sounds stupid) might be the best thing to do, and I guess work on my portfolio on the side. Or maybe use my unemployed time to work on my portfolio full time. But for these entry level places I don't think my portfolio is the issue. I think its my lack of having a job in the past, and not having a security clearance at the moment.

Also, another thing (sorry) is where I live an issue? I live in south Florida, about two hours away from Orlando where most of these jobs I applied to are. Is that too far? I mean, if I got a job I would drive there every day until I found a place local if the job was promising. But the company might not like that. I also applied to places out of state, but stated in my cover letters that I was more than happy to move myself there. Would that still be something they would reject me for?  

Have you guys have any advice about the security clearance issue I am having? Or about my lack of experience and what to do? I don't like feeling unemployed. I feel guilty about not working during college. I was a full time student taking 5-6 classes a semester. I did finish earlier than I was supposed to, and I had one of the better portfolios in my class by graduation. I feel guilty, but I still think taking the time to focus on projects, and learn things on your own that will be useful in your future career seems better than flipping burgers just to be able to write down some place you worked at. But it is obviously hurting me now than benefiting me. 

Thanks everyone, again sorry for rambling. 

TL;DR I am being rejected for not having a security clearance even though I can get one. Also, I think I don't have enough experience.

I'm currently a 21 year old male from New Jersey about to finish a B.S in Business Administration (It seems this degree is very common in Europe) with concentrations in Accounting &amp; Finance (At my school the credit amount is the same as a major). 

Some details about me:

- Studied Abroad in London - January to May 2015
- No relevant work experience (sadly, internship was hars to come by)
- Great cumulitive GPA (for the difficulty of my courses) 3.68 (3.7 est at grad)
- Beginner's level French (Can read decently and write, speaking is hard for me)
- Hopes to build $5,000 worth of savings.
- Plans to learn programming and coding languages from friend and become fluent in a year. 
- Has a few connections abroad through friends met at British school. 
- Is enrolled in 5 yr grad plan but plans to drop out to get degree abroad. (Has taken a few courses however.)
- No job offers currently but working on it (I dislike Big 4)
- Set to go to Guatemala to help rebuild an elementary school. 

I plan on using this all as signs of my willingness to naturalise if I decided to move out of the US. 

---------

Places I want to look into:

- Dublin 
- London (pipe dream, the pay I heard is not good)
- Prague (If I can become a good coder and find an American company)
- Vancouver
- Krakow (For fun, who knows!)
- Austrailia (If I get my CPA, as it is valid there)

What shoukd be my first steps? I do not see myself happy in the US and am not attached to the idea of a CPA. Want to spend my youth somewhere else and will do anything to adapt.

So I graduated in June of 2016 from a large state university in the US, and I'm a US citizen trying to land a software engineer role. My first month after graduating I knew I wouldn't be staying in the city I graduated because jobs here are pretty bad. With that being said I took a month to travel to some popular cities who's job markets are better. I've decided to look in NYC and LA and have applied to 300+ positions in the past few months while keeping a job as a bartender and a server just to pay the bills.

Now I've always had a job since I was 15 and went from Dishwasher -&gt;Banquet Server -&gt;Head Server -&gt;Bartender, in the 9 years I've been working. I got my degree in CS because I really like coding and everything about this field is awesome and I'm still very excited about getting my first job. Everyone who asks me what I got my degree in always has a shocked look on their face when I mention I still don't have a job in my field, and frankly if I go back in time and tell myself I wouldn't have a job in my field 8 months after graduation I would laugh at myself because everyone says how great jobs are in this field. I even had an internship at a large bank, although it was a pretty bad internship where they didn't have me do much there, I still took some time to learn new coding languages.

I was never a great student when it came to tests because I'm bad a regurgitating information without notes or anything to look at and I graduated with a wonderful 2.4 GPA, so for obvious reasons that won't be going on my resume. When it came to projects or coding assignments I always did well on them, and occasionally would have added features that weren't listed in the project description. Since I've always had a job I've also not had much time to do side projects and even now I work 40+ hours a week to pay bills and student loans. I've had my resume repeatedly looked over and I even made a personal website for myself thinking that would help, but still no luck. As of right now, I've had 0 phone calls and 2 coding exercises which I did okay on, the first one I didn't manage my time well but had 2/3 of it correct, and the second I got completely correct but they emailed back a few days later saying thanks but no thanks.

I'm really excited to start in this field and I can't wait to do so but getting emails every day saying ""thanks but..."" is really discouraging. I'm applying to any and all software engineer roles, other than senior roles and I just don't understand how I haven't landed a single interview yet. I don't have anything on my GitHub other than my personal website (school projects had to be stored in private repositories because my school likes to re-use assignments) but on my resume, a few of my projects for school are listed on there with features that weren't required but I added on the side. So other than working on side projects or open source projects is there anything I can do that'll make this job hunt easier? I'm really getting discouraged along with getting stressed out about this and I worry about my future. I know if I am just given a chance at any company I can and I will work my ass off for that check every week. Thanks again for reading this and I hope everyone has a great day!"

5prjh1,1128,2017-01-23,[OC] How Diplomatic,daeomec,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/5prjh1/oc_how_diplomatic/,"The alien invasion couldn’t wait till the end of the year? I was two months away from a cushy ambassadorship in a resort world. *Two months.* But no, the crazy bastards had to start their plan for galactic domination just before I retired. Which was why I'd been woken up at two in the morning by blaring sirens and a military escort. Wonderful.

“Assistant Secretary,” said the stern-faced soldier. Normally, young people in my bedroom were cause for celebration, but I had a feeling he wouldn’t take kindly to a proposition. “There’s an emergency.”

“Well, isn’t that nice? I hadn’t guessed at all.” I stumbled out of bed and grabbed my fuzzy bathrobe. “Now, give me a moment to change—”

“There’s no time. Come this way.” Thus, I was manhandled out of my quarters and shoved into a nice, armored vehicle. 

“So,” I drawled out, wrinkling my nose at the gray interior of the car, “what’s the emergency?”

He didn’t respond.

At this point, the sleep had mostly left me, and the nerves were beginning to kick in. If the cookie-cutter soldiers—ones that were different from the usual bodyguards—were refusing to share even *gossip*... then it was more serious than I’d thought.

I shifted in place. “The Wenm/Ir-Nohv haven’t actually attacked, have they?” 

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv, a group of psychopathic alien warlords, had quickly burned their way across the known galaxy.  The Goidj and the North-Central Confederation had already fallen, but there were a few more civilizations between them and us. At least, there *had* been a few civilizations between us. 

As expected, the soldiers didn’t respond. We soon arrived at the planetary military base, and I was again manhandled through the dusty hallways and to a very tense-looking war room.

“Assistant Secretary Lucia Weber,” sneered the brass-covered man at the front of the room. “Thank you for joining us.” He looked my fuzzy robe up and down, and his frown grew bigger. 

“I appreciate it, General Collins!” I snagged a coffee from a terrified baby-intern. “What’s going on?” I took my seat next to my colleague Vasiliev, the Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs. He grunted at me, and I grunted back.

“The Oieyee Republic has fallen. Our ambassador has been taken hostage, and they have already declared war on us.” The general looked unexpectedly solemn. “The worst-case scenario has been realized. The Wenm/Ir-Nohv are likely to attack humanity in less than a week.”

My head snapped back to the front of the room at that. Well, fuck. 

***** 

Everyone had erupted into cacophony.

“We should declare war!” declared one over-enthusiastic colonel.

“Are you crazy?” Vasiliev shouted back. He’d had enough coffee to make him talkative. “They’ll eat us alive! The Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s military capability is more than ten times ours!”

I flipped through the dossier on the Wenm/Ir-Nohv, but I didn’t find anything new. (Probably because I’d written it.) I’d spent the last few months frantically gathering information on them, and everything I’d learned had led me to the one conclusion.

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv were, in some ways, similar to humans. Except that they were way more terrifying. Exceptionally terrifying. If I was to take my deepest, darkest nightmare and stick it on steroids, it still wouldn’t be as scary as the Wenm/Ir-Nohv. 

Fifteen feet tall, incredibly fast, incredibly strong, with claws, venom, and teeth that would make the saber-tooth tiger weep, they were lethal killing machines. Their homeworld was the definition of death-world.  But that wasn’t the worst of it. It was actually pretty par for the universe. 

What made the Wenm/Ir-Nohv scary was the fact that they were *smart*. All of their intellect had been focused into one thing: war. Us humans might have written *The Art of War,* but their children could come up with tactics that would put Sun Tzu to shame.

Even worse, their weaponry was crazy advanced. As I said, they were like us. The Wenm/Ir-Nohv had nukes before they had spaceflight. Actually, they had antimatter weaponry before they had spaceflight. Hell, they didn’t even *have* spaceflight until the Goidj were stupid enough to give them some! (Ah, Goidj. They always did have their heads up their fifteen asses. It’s a miracle they hadn’t fallen to natural selection sooner.) 

The Wenm/Ir-Nohv took to the stars like a shark to water, and they immediately began eating all the little fish in the ocean. And we were next. For once in our existence, the smartest minds of humanity—military people, diplomats, and scientists alike—all agreed on one thing. We were utterly and royally fucked.

The argument had died down. Some stared blankly, others fidgeted in place, and a few people were crying.

“So what do we do now?” murmured the same, coffee-less intern, voice quavering.

I closed the file. “We could try negotiating.”

That ended the stupor. Everyone began talking all at once, some in favor, some not. Vasiliev, who was in vehement agreement, was just about to throw his mug across the room, while the colonel looked about ready to have an aneurysm. 

The general laughed, his booming voice cutting through the noise. “We might as well,” he mused, voice thick with dark humor. “We don’t have many other options. Well, Madam Secretary, I’m sure you’d appreciate leading the delegation. Unless there’s any objections?”

He looked around the room, and I did, too. I tried to catch the eye of my boss, but he was studiously looking in the other direction. Coward.

I gritted my teeth. “Sure. Why not?

Damn. I’d just postponed my retirement, hadn’t I?

****

“They’re gonna kill us! They’re gonna eat us all—” Ambassador Arroz started screaming incoherently as several Oieyee were ripped apart. “We have to surre—”

I snapped my fingers, and the recording stopped. 

“Well,” I said mildly, “that’s what is at stake. Unless you want to be the next poor fools that're killed as an example, then we better study the shit out of them. We’ve negotiated good deals before. There’s no reason we can’t do it again.”

“Other than the fact that they’re a bloodthirsty, violent race that’s rampaged through the known galactic civilizations?” The colonel scoffed. “I doubt that asking them *nicely* will keep the Wenm/Ir-Nohv from killing us.”

I shrugged. “Has anyone tried?”

Everyone was silent for a moment.

“Well,” said Vasiliev slowly, “The Goidj gave them spaceships and tried to make them slaves. Then the Wenm/Ir-Nohv slaughtered them all and made *them* slaves.”

I frowned. “The North-Central Confederation declared war on them immediately after, since they were allies with the Goidj.”

“The Oieyee ruling council fled, and there was no government capable of negotiating when the Wenm/Ir-Nohv showed up,” piped up the intern.

We stared at each other. Even the war-hungry colonel seemed thoughtful.

“There’s no harm in trying,” I said finally. “It’s not like we can make things worse.” I clapped my hands, feeling hopeful for the first time since the morning. “We have seven days before they arrive. Alright, team! Let’s get to work!”

****

My team and I had used the week to study everything about the Wenm/Ir-Nohv. What they needed, what they ate, what they liked, *everything.* We’d pieced together their language and customs from their videos, and every single person on that delegation was fluent in Wenm/Ir-Nohv-ese by the time we landed on their mothership.

 The human treatment, as I liked to call it, was standard course for whenever we encountered a new alien species. This time, we did it with a little more desperation than usual. Know your enemy, am I right?

After our tiny, unarmed shuttle landed in the enormous Wenm/Ir-Nohv mothership, we were roughly grabbed and shoved to the grand “greeting room” of their warlord. The man bared his fangs at us, jutting his lower jaw at us. I suddenly knew how prey species felt when we smiled at them.

“Weak/Not-strong humans,” rumbled the warlord, “will be received with peace/not-danger. But for little/not-long. Why should we treat you with mercy/not-war?”

(The Wenm/Ir-Nohv spoke with a language of opposites. Almost every adjective and the occasional noun was accompanied by the negation of its antonym. Hence the slashes. It was weird, but whatever. Chinese was harder to learn. I simplified the dialogue a little for convenience. Not too much, because fuck you. Suffer along with me.)

I stuck out my own lower jaw, feeling stupid and uncomfortable, and tilted back my head to expose my neck. Slowly, I sunk to my knees, and the members of my delegation did the same.

“Oh, merciful/not-cruel warlord,” I simpered back, taking care to growl the words, “your honor/not-shame displays your intellect/not-stupidity. Hence we come to you, crouched down like the weak/not-strong creatures we are. Will you deign to share drink and bread, so we may discuss the terms/not-demands of our joining/not-war?”

I’d used the ritual opening that their weaker tribes used when joining a stronger one. It was a gamble, since I’d stolen this from one of the Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s TV shows. 

The warlord stared at us for a moment. Then, he began stamping his feet against his chair, hooting with what I hoped was glee. Or at least amusement.

“These weak/not-strong humans know where they stand! Welcome/not-threat and eat, so we may discuss your joining/not-war.” 

***** 

The next night, I called the President from the Wenm/Ir-Nohv’s ship, trying to ignore my fierce hangover.

“Hello?” I mumbled into the long-distance comms. “Madam President? We’ve come to an agreement with the Wenm/Ir-Nohv.”

The President’s normally frosty tone was taut with apprehension. “Well? What are their terms? We aren’t going to war, are we?”

“No, thankfully. They’ve agreed to accept a peaceful, non-violent surrender.”

“What do they want? Disarmament?” said a different, raspy voice. Ah, so it was a conference call! Lovely. With the pounding of my head, I’d have difficulty distinguishing the voices.

I shook my head, forgetting that they couldn’t see me. “Um, no,” I replied belatedly. “We can keep our weapons.”

“New leadership?” The President (or was that the general?) didn’t sound happy. Which made sense, considering that she’d be the one to lose out.

“Don’t worry, Madam President. You can keep your job. The rest of you can, too.”

My boss spoke up, now. His high-pitched voice cut right through the fog in my head. “We aren’t slaves, are we? Don’t tell me we’re going the way of the Goidj.”

I couldn’t help the smug smile. “Nope. We retain our planet and our freedom.”

“Then what are the terms?” snapped the President. Well, I may have pushed it a little too far. I decided to take pity and tell them everything. I’d be a little tense, too, if I didn’t know the fate of my species. 

“We’re vassals. We’ll pay tribute to the Wenm/Ir-Nohv every year for a decade, and then we’re raised to full clan status. Which means equal rights for us in the multiple eyes of the Wenm/Ir-Nohv.”

A short silence.

“That’s it? What’s the catch? What do they want for tribute?” The general seemed a bit skeptical. Well, really skeptical. I didn’t really blame him. If I hadn’t lived it myself, I wouldn’t have believed it.

“A bit of money and natural resources.” I yawned, still exhausted from last night. If there was one thing that the Wenm/Ir-Nohv did better than warmongering, it was partying. “The deal they gave us is standard for Wenm/Ir-Nohv vassal, er, clans. They’d normally ask for soldiers, too, but they want something different from us.”

I paused for dramatic effect, which was ruined by my second yawn. The people on the other end weren’t as amused, but I’d just saved humanity. Sue me.

“What is it?” said my boss, resigned to my attitude.

“They want us to be their ambassadors and negotiate with other governments and species for surrender. Apparently, most species are too intimidated to properly talk to the Wenm/Ir-Nohv, and we seem to have a knack for it. They were really impressed by us. Hell, they were really impressed by *Ambassador Arroz*, despite the whole screaming thing. He's on the ship, you know?”

Another silence. Man, I was on a roll!

“You’re telling me that they gave us a really phenomenal deal because they were impressed by how we surrendered?” the President said slowly. 

“Of course. Why wouldn’t they?” I smiled. “We asked nicely.”"
5prx1r,0,2017-01-23,I am becoming increasingly worried about being able to graduate and the administration is working against my best interests.,HAL__Over__9000,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5prx1r/i_am_becoming_increasingly_worried_about_being/,"Alright, so there's a lot to unpack here. I'll start with some background.

I chose to go to a small college because I wanted to have a more personal experience. I thought I would be able to have a closer relationship with my professors and the administration. I was a little worried I might get lost in the shuffle of a large university. There were a few unique aspects of where I chose to go: the dorms were unlocked during the day, the school was in a rural town, and they were on a 4-1-4 schedule (two semesters with a J-term for the month of January where one takes a single class). 

Freshman year was bad. Despite doing very well academically in high school, even with 5 AP classes, I struggled. Partially because I was bored with the writing class and the chemistry and the math, partially because I really struggled to make any friends. The first J-term was really exciting, I did really well and it was overall really enjoyable. But I didn't like that they started locking the dorms. It somewhat ironically made me feel less safe. However, what annoyed me the most was that they wouldn't give me an answer as to why and when I asked they treated me like a little kid. Spring semester was a little better but I still considered transferring. I chose not to because I felt my complaints would have been found elsewhere. It seemed more of an issue with college itself rather than the particular school. The professors were great and I did make a couple friends. 

Sophomore year started out really great and somewhere along the line it all came crashing down. I started to do worse and worse in organic chemistry, the girl I liked turned me down, and then when I started taking my antidepressants less often I really kinda crashed. I ended up withdrawing from Orgo and taking spring semester off. Now, I worked and went to a community college so I wouldn't fall completely behind. I chose to go back because I couldn't imagine how hard it would be to restart making friends and learn a whole new area. Plus, when I was really upset I sent out an email about I wanted to go to Star Wars but couldn't find a ride. People were so nice, telling me about nearby areas, someone even put a Time magazine with an article about The Force Awakens in my mailbox. That meant a lot, I felt finding a community that kind would be hard to find. Plus I felt the dorm situation was what was really making things bad. 

Anyway, originally I wanted to live off campus and the Dean of students told me to do XYZ, but when I did XYZ she told me I couldn't.  I chose a single room in a quiet dorm as a compromise. 

Anyway, things started out alright, I even managed to get out of having to take a foreign language. But one thing I was planning on was taken away. I had planned to go to Italy for J-term but I was taken off that trip because I got mad and snapped at someone bullying me. Meanwhile the person harassing me for away with everything and was basically rewarded. That hurt a lot. The more I learned about the situation the more I learned how poorly it was handled.   

Anyway, here I am, not in Italy and failing a chemistry class. If I don't pass I can't graduate on time. I could take a summer class but then that would rule out having an internship this year and of course it's expensive. I don't know what to do. I'm a Junior, so dropping out now is hard and will probably end up being more experience. Staying here is hard because the administration doesn't respect me and is working against me trying to do my best. I want to live off campus next year, but the same dean is in charge and she had shown she doesn't emphasize or care about my well being in the slightest. 

Hoping for some advice, similar experiences, or any thing that could help, thanks.

Edit: more on Italy https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/5maqm8/i_came_here_hoping_i_would_be_able_to_have_a/?sort=confidence

Also, TL;DR: I am super depressed and feeling really lost. College is hard and I don't know if I can graduate on time. Meanwhile the administration is working against my well being. "
5ps4m6,207,2017-01-23,"Three years ago, I began teaching myself how to code for the sake of building my own websites and apps. This was during college. Now, I work in SF as a Full Stack Software Engineer. This is my quick list.",DavidIlizarov,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5ps4m6/three_years_ago_i_began_teaching_myself_how_to/,"A lot of people ask me where to get started, or what they need to do to build iOS apps, Android apps, and websites. When I started, all I cared about was the ""User Experience Stack"" as I call it. That means having a website, iOS and Android App.

Feel free to ask me anything.

Also, if you're so inclined, there are bootcamps like App Academy you could go through too. Instead of an internship one summer, I opted to do that instead which helped me a bit in learning Ruby on Rails. It was a great experience, but the most important thing I got from it was that it takes a lot of determination and you're basically teaching yourself for at least 9 hours a day for 3 months. There are of course TAs if you have questions, but really, your peers and the internet are your best source.

**The internet has everything you need. I will not give you resources to go to... aside from this subreddit and Stackoverflow. I will give you the order in which you learn these things. Learning them is up to you.**

I only used one book in all my learning and that was this [Algorithms book by Sedgewick](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/), a leader in the field. I also took courses on Coursera for algorithms.

The following is my list of things in order, and then why I recommend you learn things in this order.

1. Java - **OPTIONAL, but recommended** If you have no experience and know no language. More details later.
2. Ruby
3. Git
4. Ruby on Rails - SQL, HTML, CSS is learned here too.
5. Hosting on Heroku
6. Javascript
7. React.js
8. Android (Java required)
9. iOS with Swift

**Note:** I did not at any point list Algorithms or Data Structures. There isn't really a set time to learn them. What is your goal? Are you just trying to build your own things? Are you looking for a job in the future? Personally, while learning Java, I recommend you learn about different Data Structures and Algorithms. By applying them and reading the code behind them, you will learn a lot about problem solving and different ways of thinking in code. An exercise in Ruby and Java should be to implement different Algorithms and Data Structures. **Again, this is completely optional and might stress you out, burn you out, and not feel fun because you aren't actually building anything. Do this whenever you want. At some point, depending on what you want to achieve, you'll find yourself wanting to know this stuff. If you want a reputable job, you will definitely need this.**


#Why would I learn the things on this list?... What are the things on this list? I don't know any of these words... O_O

###Java

If you don't know Java, have never programmed, or are just getting started, then I recommend Java 100%. I think Java is on the crossroads of ""This shit sucks, and is way too verbose and complicated"", and ""Wow, this is so nice and simple."" Java will teach you about Object-Oriented Programming, which is a paradigm you'll encounter everywhere. You need to understand it. You'll also be forced to think about types. ""Is this a number? Is this a word? Is this a true/false? Is this something else?"" Further, Java has control-flow that you'll encounter in other languages. You may encounter them in different ways (iterate an array with a for-loop in Java, versus using the each method in Ruby), but Java's is the de-facto understood way of talking about them. Everyone knows for-loops, while-loops, etc. There isn't semantic sugar in that regard. Java is also an amazing language for interviews and to learn Data Structures and Algorithms in.

### Ruby

Much simpler than Java. Easier to read. Easier to write. Less things to think about. You no longer care if something is a number or word. Is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? That is for you to decide. This is the start of web development for you. Feel comfortable with this language. Do some Object-Oriented stuff with it. Why Ruby over Python? This is a long talk. Ultimately it is my preference and Ruby on Rails is one of the largest web dev frameworks out there. Python is a lot more multi-purpose in that sense. It is used a lot scientifically for different applications. I also think Ruby reads easier, but again... that is all personal preference.

### Git

This is pretty important. Version control keeps your code safe if you accidentally screw things up. Git can get complicated really quickly. Get started with Github. Make an account. Then, when you have a project you want to work on, create a Repository there for your project. The commands you should know are `add`, `clone`, `push`, `pull`, `diff`, `remote`, `commit`, `status`, and `branch`. Branching is useful. Again, Git is huge and you can do tons of things... but usually you don't need to do much of any of that. While working, in your terminal you'll do things like `git add -A`, and then `git commit -m ""This is a message describing the work I've done so far""`. Then, `git push my-remote my-branch`. For group work, also read about pull-requests. Git is useful to have. Try to get used to it. If you wanna live life dangerously though, by all means move ahead, lol.

### Ruby on Rails

This one is important. A lot to learn here. First off, I have always used Ruby on Rails 4.1. If you start with Ruby on Rails 5, that is great, but at some point I feel they're over-engineering certain aspects of it. A talk for another time. Ruby on Rails follows the MVC architecture. Model-View-Controller. Someone goes to your website and gets connected to an action in the controller. There, you decide what to do. You'll probably talk to a model or two about data needed or data that needs to be processed. Then, you'll give that person back a view, or some data as JSON. Don't understand what I just said? That is okay. But, at some point, come back and see if you understand it. If you do, congrats, you're learning! Also, note. I won't go over it, but Gems are libraries in Ruby. You will use many gems that help enrich your product (so you don't have to write the code yourself!) In fact, Ruby on Rails is bunch of gems itself.

## Order of Learning Ruby on Rails

1. Models. If you have a website about dogs and cats, you might have a Dog model and a Cat model. Mess with that. Understand that generally, a Dog and a Cat will have their own tables in a database. How do you get data from that database? What if an Owner has a Dog. What is this relationship? How do we define this relationship? Can a Dog have multiple Owners? What attributes do we care about regarding the Dog? You do not need to know SQL, the language you use to talk to and get data from databases, to mess with models. SQL is abstracted away by ActiveRecord, Ruby on Rail's ORM. What is that? You should figure that out. I recommend learning SQL Basics, so that you can understand what happens under the hood. It will also help a lot when debugging. Learn about Database transactions. Learn about atomic actions. Are atomic actions important? Learn about race conditions. What kinds of validations can stop that? Database migrations... database constraints... model validations... Models are a big topic. Understand them. One more quick question... What if a Dog has many Owners and an Owner has many Dogs? Figure out how to handle this relationship... You may need a DogOwner model. What does that mean? Also, I recommend always using PostgreSQL as your database. Eventually, for different uses... you may discover MongoDB. When starting off though, get your Ruby on Rails project integrated with PostgreSQL so that you use that on both Heroku (where you will be forced to use it) and on your local machine.

2. Controllers. You will have a `routes.rb` file which is responsible for taking someone from `yourwebsite.com/amazing_cats` to some Controller's action. An action is simply a Ruby method. It is just semantics. Maybe you'll have a `CatsController`, with an `index` action to show a list of cats. Learn what CRUD means. Learn what RESTful APIs are. What are APIs? RESTful APIs are all about your Controllers. Do you need to 100% adhere to having RESTful APIs? That is situational. Ruby on Rails has a helpers folder. You could make helpers here to use in your Controllers and Views. Views IMMEDIATELY see your helpers... You need to import your helpers so that your Controllers see them. All Controller actions render something... JSON, XML, A View... which is HTML. If you were just building an API for your iOS App, you'd probably want your Controller to respond with JSON. You don't need HTML there. You will generally send either HTML or JSON. At first, probably HTML. Once you get interested in SPAs (Single Page Applications, and using AJAX, you'll send more JSON).

3.  Views is the last thing you learn. This is where you learn HTML and CSS. You don't need to be a guru in either. I know I'm definitely not a guru in either, but as you come across problems or you want to have your site look a certain way, you'll gradually learn more and more about HTML and CSS. This is also where you begin learning Javascript, the language of the browser. This is what you code in to make a button someone clicks do something. Event-handling and callbacks will become your friend quickly in Javascript. It is even looser than Ruby! I actually don't even use Views much anymore. I do all my front-end work (which Views are) using React.js. So, ultimately, you don't need to know much here if you plan on evolving your front-end to have it powered by a Javascript Framework.

### Hosting on Heroku

For Ruby on Rails apps in particular, Heroku is so extremely easy to host on. There isn't much to say here other than that. You may come across some struggles, but I urge you to push through and learn from those issues. When you first work on Ruby on Rails, you'll notice that the web-server it uses is called WEBrick which is only for testing. It should never be used when you're ready to have people on your app. I suggest migrating to Puma or Unicorn. These are all things to learn and read about when you're ready. Once your Ruby on Rails app is officially on Heroku you can go to the link associated with it, and actually use it (The link will be something like `yourapp.herokuapp.com`!

### Javascript

This language is very interesting and loose. You can do a lot of cool and a lot of confusing things. Yes, you could have learned this back when we went over Views in Ruby on Rails, but if you didn't go over Views, then this is when you learn it. A bit of a late note, but you don't really need to know Views in Ruby on Rails. Especially because they won't help you when you're building an iPhone app. Further, you may use one view just to boot up your React.js app, so again, you aren't going to mess with Ruby on Rails Views much.

### React.js

This is a frontend framework. Javascript is a very loose language and building a big website means your Javascript code can get very messy and tangled. React.js addresses this and a lot more. It is also very much in-tune with mobile development where every view has a lifecycle. You'll learn about that eventually. I actually learned React.js after I learned iOS development and it was nice to see many parallels. At this point, you've learned Javascript, Java, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails. You're picking things up well and learning this should be easier. Your website can be a lot sexier too depending on how you want to use this for Single Page Applications. 

## Note about React Native and mobile development

I suppose you could tackle mobile development with React Native, but I've always been about doing things natively. It'll be easier to hire an Android or iOS developer to mess with your codebase if it is written natively. There are also a lot more jobs for native platform development. You also won't be limited by the framework you are using and you'll be on the cutting edge of the native platform. Frameworks have to integrate these cutting edge capabilities which could take time. Debugging with Stackoverflow is also harder to come by because less people use these frameworks.

### Android

If you learned Java earlier, then this will be easier for you. If you didn't, you'll need it here. If you only care about iPhones, then go learn that. I actually really dislike programming for Android compared to iPhone. It feels a lot clunkier and there are more moving pieces that frustrate me at times. But, doing Android first makes learning iOS development a lot easier because mobile development for both isn't too different. You could draw many parallels. Android gives the programmer a lot of power and responsibility. This could be a good and bad thing. Generally, for a newbie, it is a bad thing. It is what it is though. The fun of programming for both iOS and Android though is seeing what different bugs you come across because of the way certain things in the platforms are made.


### iOS and Swift

Go ahead and learn Swift 3. It is a breath of fresh air compared to Objective-C. I actually don't write Objective-C, which is what iOS apps used to be written in. I usually find myself contributing to open source libraries though which are written in Objective-C. These libraries will have 95% of what I want, so I'll patch it up to make it perfect for my needs. I think once you get going with iOS development, you'll notice that it is very straight forward and nice. That said, you do need a $99 yearly membership to test your apps on your phone and publish to the App Store. iOS development can be extremely frustrating the first time around though. There is a lot of setting up your account and credentials that you may feel is really dumb because Android didn't require the nonsense. Just get through it and you'll be set. Just wait until you want to integrate Push Notifications... then you may have to relive some hell again :).

When doing mobile development, you'll treat your Ruby on Rails app as a backend that serves you JSON when you need information.

I did not include topics like web sockets or AJAX, because those are all topics you'll potentially run into and when you do you should tackle them.

Those are my notes on all the topics. I didn't really proofread this or anything. I just wrote this in one go. I hope it helps some of you who need direction. If you have any questions let me know. This is the path I took and I highly recommend it."
5psar1,9,2017-01-23,Software Engineering vs Data Engineering at Capital One?,i47,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5psar1/software_engineering_vs_data_engineering_at/,"Hi! I was recently hired to work at Capital One this summer as part of their Technology Intern program. I have the choice of being a Software Engineering Intern or Data Engineering Intern. Here's the description of each:    
    
Software Engineering Intern    
  * Chart the digital frontier in one of our Mobile (Native), Web, or API development  
  * Develop your skills in a variety of languages and frameworks including: Java/Spring, .Net, JavaScript, AngularJS, Python, Go and Swift in the cloud and on devices.  
    
Data Engineer    
  * Build out our analytic capabilities using modern data technologies    
  * Deploy robust data products and services, as well as, enable rich visualization, data exploratory, and machine learning capabilities. Use open source technologies (Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark, Kafka, Pig, Python, NoSQL databases, etc.) and deploy applications in the cloud (AWS, Azure)    
  
I've been auditing an Artificial Intelligence course for the last couple weeks since the semester started and I've been really interested in it. I'm also currently enrolled in an Advanced Analytics Programming class that seems like it's going to be really interesting. So it seems like the Data Engineering role is a much better fit for me, but the only technologies they listed that I have any experience with are Hadoop, Python, and NoSQL. I'm fluent in Python, I wrote ONE driver/mapper/reducer package for Hadoop for a class like a year ago, and I've never done any work with NoSQL. However, I'm fairly comfortable in my ability to learn ""on the job"" so to speak.  
  
The only thing stopping me from just going for it is the fact that I come from a slightly different background. I'm majoring in Management Information Systems and have a Computer Science minor. MIS at my university is just fancy speak for Project Management + a little bit of tech, and as such, I've found it incredibly difficult to land an internship in Computer Science (where I really want to be). I feel like I should take the Software Engineering internship just to open up more opportunities for me in the future and ""prove"" that I'm capable of Software Engineering, and I feel like it's much easier to go from Software Engineering to Data Engineering but not the other way around. If I took the Software Engineering internship I'd pretty much exclusively be interested in iOS or API development, and I'm not sure how likely it would be that I get assigned to one of these teams. All that being said, what should I do?    
  
**TL;DR** - Debating between Software Engineering and Data Engineering Internship at Capital One. I'm *much* more qualified for Software Engineering, but I'm more interested in Data Engineering. However, I'm relying on this internship to open more doors in the future for me, not necessarily at Capital One. What do?"

I'm TERRIFIED of going into debt for pursuing a degree I'm not confident I'll succeed at. I'm not even a real programmer! I haven't built any projects worthy of attention other than a shitty Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java class (not even a real game, it all took place in a JOptionPane. Real beginner stuff). I haven't the slightest clue how to implement code to build a real world project. 


So if I left my cushy restaurant job behind and transferred to FSU to pursue my CS degree I'd be putting myself at risk for dropping out of college and having thousands of debt on my hands. Whereas, here at FIU, at least I'd have that job to keep me going in case school doesn't end up working out. 


As a true beginner, do I have what it takes to succeed and by succeed I mean get internships in my junior and senior years? Suck at anything programing related but I will say my ONE strong point is being able to get straight A's. There's something about the rigor of coursework which encourages me to study hard for all of my classes. Even now, at 45 credits taken at college I'm averaging a 4.0 GPA. So I'm confidant I'll be able to graduate from FSU with a degree in CS with a fairly high GPA.


What then? Will computer science classes alone prepare me for an internship? I just don't know what projects even are or where to begin working on them. At least in class you have some defined coursework and you know the material you need to study. 


I'm sorry for the rambling. But I really need advice for next year. It's stressing me out every single day and my mind keeps shifting from deciding to move to Tampa (USF) to moving to Tallahassee (FSU) to staying in Miami (FIU).

I like the job, the salary, and the location. But I'm also under consideration by a few other companies--two second round technical phone screens coming up on Friday (one of which I will respectfully decline) and awaiting a final decision from a company I interviewed with last week. 

My deadline to accept the offer is this Friday. I have a few questions.

1. Since I have an interview that day, would it be ethical to ask to push back the offer deadline? 
2. If I choose to accept the role with this company, should I decline the other offers before or after I accept? As in, can I wait until I am finished with the background check and have signed the official offer letter to decline other offers/interviews?
3. How should I go about leveraging my current offer to expedite a different interview process?

Thanks in advance."
5psryq,1,2017-01-23,Summer internship in security vs. continuous internship in development,LowBlowMiho,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5psryq/summer_internship_in_security_vs_continuous/,"First of all, I realize that there is a post similar to my situation, but I believe mine is different enough that it's not a duplicate. I'm a second-year student who just started working at General Dynamics Mission Systems as a software engineer. The internship is one that continues until graduation with flexible hours and will provide me with a security clearance. They also have the same benefits for interns as they do full-time employees, such as a 401k and health insurance.

However, last week, I got an offer from Raytheon to do a summer internship as a Cyber Security Intern in D.C. I'm not sure how to approach this, because what I want to do after graduation is cyber-security, but I also know that a longer internship is more impressive. Raytheon will not be getting me a security clearance, but I feel like it's a more impressive company in the particular field I want to pursue as well. I am also very newly getting into security and would love to be exposed to the real-world dynamics of working in security.

I could talk to General Dynamics about the possibility of working at Raytheon over the summer, but I can't imagine it would go positively considering the conflict of interest, so I would most probably have to pick one over the other.

Which do you think would be the better experience for me in the long-run?"

However, I am currently living out in Montana working as an engineering intern and will be finishing up my degree in May of 2018. I was recently pulled over going 84 MPH in a 80 MPH zone along I-94 east of Billings Montana. I am 22 years old and have never gotten a speeding ticket before and still being a resident of North Carolina, I am concerned over weather this will cause my license to be suspended in NC. 4 MPH may not seem like a lot, but from some of the things I have found online about NC regarding insurance, points and fines I am having some trouble reconciling this. 

&amp;nbsp;

http://www.ncdoi.com/_Publications/It%20Pays%20to%20Be%20a%20Safe%20Driver%20Insurance%20Points_CAU1.pdf

&amp;nbsp;

According to this website, it states that “speeding in excess of 80 MPH when the speed limit is 70MPH or higher” will result in 4 points on my license. However, it goes on to state “no SDIP points will be charged for speeding 10MPH or less over the posted speed limit”. 

&amp;nbsp;

http://www.dmv.org/nc-north-carolina/traffic-ticket-fines-and-penalties.php

&amp;nbsp;

The above website states that speeding in excess of 75MPH will result in the immediate suspension of license.  I was originally going to pay the fine and move on but with all of this information I am not to sure any more. The vast majority of high ways in Montana are 80MPH speed limit, does this imply if I go even 1 MPH over my NC license will be revoked? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR
Even though I was only going 4MPH over, since it was 84 in an 80 zone, will my license be suspended in North Carolina or am I just being paranoid?

5ptm3n,5,2017-01-23,Non CS major Applying to programming Jobs?,sniperzxD,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/5ptm3n/non_cs_major_applying_to_programming_jobs/,"Hello!

So I'm currently a senior chemical engineering major having lots of trouble finding a chemical engineering job. I thought maybe I can try applying to programming internship or jobs instead since I have a pretty strong interest in programming. The thing is I'm not sure if I have enough experience / am qualified enough to apply.

I had an internship at a large biotech company doing programming work (mostly SQL and VB.net) and working in an agile environment (had to attend scrum meetings, complete user stories, etc). I've self taught myself python and have built some simple CRUD apps (a small blog and a menu app) using some web frameworks (GAE and flask). As of now I'm trying to learn Javascript and React. I've gotten the hang of ES6 syntax for the most part and I'm just trying to build a simple application with React now. In addition, I went I attended a hackathon and wrote a python script that uses Watson's API to scrape wiki articles for data, so I have some experience working with APIs. Most of my source code is hosted on Github, and I've built my own personal page (although it's not very fancy). Lastly, I have MATLAB experience through my chemical engineering classes, and I took an intro to C class at university if that counts.

From what I just said, would you guys recommend applying to some entry level programming jobs? If so, what am I supposed to put for education as most programming jobs require a CS degree.

Thanks and much appreciated!"

I want to work in IT providing desktop support and eventually move up the chain of command into a management position. I graduated in December of 2015 with a BBA in Management Information Systems...not the ideal degree for someone who wants to work in IT, but that is a discussion for another post.

I own and operate a small business through which I provide GeekSquad-like services, namely, PC repair and what not. I have officially been *in business* since May of 2011. I have a handful of regular customers and gain a new one every now and then via word-of-mouth. I like my business and I like being in charge of but I want the *real deal*.

The business is somewhat legitimate in the sense that I have a DBA, business cards, a website, and business email.

My question is: Should I mention my business on my resume or not?

I've been hunting for jobs since graduation and have submitted *hundreds* of applications. I've had a handful of interviews, but none of them led to a hire. For each interview that did not pan out, I made sure to get feedback and make changes accordingly.

At this point, I am not sure what's going on and I am wondering if the mention of my business on my resume is actually hurting my chances. Other than my small business, I really only have two other sources of relevant experience: 8 mos as a part-time software QA intern during college, and ~1.5 years of part time IT work for a community college in my area (currently still employed part time at said college).

What do you think?"

5pv3ib,14,2017-01-24,TIFU by playing with chance and getting drunk instead of working.,LetsHaveSomeTequila,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/5pv3ib/tifu_by_playing_with_chance_and_getting_drunk/,"Dear Reddit, today (last night actually), I fucked up.


Before I start, there are two things you should know. 

Firstly, I have two jobs. One of them happens to be an internship at a software company where I can work remotely and on my own time. Working on my own time has its perks, but I become less motivated to actually get started. This night in particular I had a lot of work to do.

Secondly, I just turned 21 this past Friday (sadly, Donald Trump was my birthday present). Seeing as 21 is a big birthday to celebrate, I bought and drank a shit ton of alcohol. Obviously it was tequila, and obviously I was drunk off my ass, dressed in a very stereotypical Mexican outfit for my birthday...but that's not important.

What is important, is that I had about half a bottle tequila left (El Gran Centenario Añejo for anyone wondering). I wanted to finish it throughout the week and decided to play a game with my roommate to do so. The game was simple: guess the top card of a deck of cards and I'll take a shot (a fat double-shot, Mexican style).


I tell my roommate we'll do this a couple of time a day until it's gone and he agrees. We start our first round like at midnight. Roommate's guess was 3 of clubs. Checked the top card, saw a three, my heart sank but I realized it was the 3 of spades. I shuffle and tell my roommate since he was so close I'd let him have another go right away. His second guess is 7 of spades. Actual card was...holy shit 3 of spades again. That's fucking weird. Then I say: 


""Tell you what. Since that shit came out twice, I'll shuffle this deck thoroughly, then you'll shuffle the deck thoroughly, and then if it's the three of spades again I'll take three fucking shots.""


I shuffled that deck for like three minutes straight, trying to get it as random as possible...as if my life depended on it. I then pass it to him, and he seriously just takes the top card and puts it on the bottom.

He flips the next card and of course...it's the fucking 3 of spades again. At this point I'm just thinking: ""welp...momma didn't raise no quitter."" I curse god for making me do this and pound four fat shots.


At this point my throat is all warm and tingly, and I'm starting to get the spins. I tell myself I've worked tipsy before and can probably get my work done anyways. I sit down at the table with my laptop and pull up a project. Literally five minutes into thinking and I'm drunk. Like really drunk. Apparently four shots in rapid succession (more like 6-7 because it's the double-ish sized shot glasses) is enough to fuck me up real good. Naturally drunk me wants to talk to the ladies so I pull my phone and start spamming all of my lady friends (not smooth at all). 30 minutes into coding and chill, and I'm plastered on the living room floor. I wake up the today, having missed some classes, and with a bunch of emails from my boss asking me whether or not I've finished up the changes I needed to make. Woops! Part of me wanted to tell him that instead of working I got hammered and tried to hit on all of my friends, ending the email with ""keep slayin boi"" just like that one popular email. Instead, I told him I would get right on it, and went to the only lecture I had left today. And here I am now, almost 1:00 am and I still haven't started to work on the changes. I guess I should be doing that instead of wasting my time on Reddit. Oh well!




TL;DR

Played a stupid drinking game and lost. Proceeded to drunk text people instead of finishing up important work that my boss wanted.

5pvh85,6,2017-01-24,"Community College, AS in Computer Science, and the next steps...",BrBoomr,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/5pvh85/community_college_as_in_computer_science_and_the/,"Hello,

A couple months ago I posted here in desperation and did not bother to be mature about it, so here's my second attempt while adulting for once. I am telling you now that even though I started college in high school I still have no actual clue about all the screws and bolts of how I should pursue my education. Please have patience.

Fall of 2016 I officially finished my Associate's in Computer Science. I ranted about how little to nothing I learned from the college itself as it was mainly focused on C++ programming and not real life applications. In other words, it was as if I was being taught how architecture and engineering worked by using Lego blocks. Regardless, I decided the only way to fix this would be to actually do my own research and learn other languages on my own, as the Java and Assembly courses were completely rushed by an incompetent professor. I am currently learning PHP as recommended by a former classmate.

The real reason I am making this post is to see how you guys feel about Community College education in general. I do not feel like I have wasted my time anymore (saved a lot of money), as I said in the post I deleted out of shame, but I am beginning to question whatever I should continue to pursue a Bachelor's in this CC. They do not offer Computer Science as a Bachelor's, but they do offer Applied Tech (Computer &amp; Information Technologies) which I am really interested on. I have a good 75% of classes already done due to my Associate's. It is either this, or transfer to an University and pursue something like Electrical Engineering, or continue Computer Science. Still juggling stuff around.

I like to program, but it feels that so far I have been restrained to only using Visual Studio applications, strictly Command Prompt calculator apps and occasional games. I do not feel comfortable actually seeking internships (not provided where I live, unfortunately) due to feeling so inexperienced. This is the reason why I am thinking of other career paths, but if an University can actually teach me more than using Legos, I would not mind continuing Computer Science. Regardless, Electrical Engineering and CIT are other paths I am highly interested in.

Thank you for the patience so far, I understand if someone being as clueless like me can get irritating.

5pw4uw,270,2017-01-24,Unusually practical guide for college (xpost from /r/applyingtocollege),JeLev,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/5pw4uw/unusually_practical_guide_for_college_xpost_from/,"Hi everyone -- I'm a current college admissions counselor and I posted this on /r/applyingtocollege and was told that this subreddit would probably make use of it as well. So I hope they're right and that this does in some way improve your college life. Because of the nature of that sub it's geared slightly toward newer students, but I'm sure that people currently attending can get something out of it as well.

Here is my ""unusually practical guide for college."" It is arranged in no order at all and was completely improvised this evening. I've been carrying all of this around in my head and wanted to give real, concrete advice, rather than airy, head-space advice (like ""be open-minded!"") We're getting nitty-gritty here. 

Keep in mind that I've only been to one college. I was in English and Political Science. I tried to generalize this, but not everything will apply to every school, and I'm afraid a lot of it is writing-centric. I hope that some other former (or even current) college students can add to this, especially ones with stronger STEM backgrounds. 

And so: 

**Academic**

* While coffee is delicious, tea is better when consumed in mass quantities. If you're studying for finals, your body will feel much better on three cups of tea than it will on three cups of coffee. On that note, learn to eat fruits and vegetables if you don't right now. Your body will thank you. If you have access to unlimited food in the cafeteria, this is your time to try new things. 

* Get to know your faculty advisor quickly. Your school may assign one to you or you may get to pick, but whatever the system is, get on their radar as soon as you can. If they see an opportunity that needs students (research project, internship, whatever) they're more likely to send it to you if they know your name. They will also be better able to advise you if they know more about you.

* When working on group projects, if you're not using Google Drive, you're doing it wrong. Keep everything in there, even things that individual group members are working on and will share with the group later. You never know what can happen and so it's best to keep everything in a common space.

* Get organized. Somehow. I put every assignment and appointment in a Google Calendar and set daily ""to-dos."" Every Friday (or Thursday, because sometimes my weekends started on Thursdays, which was incredible) I created a list of everything I needed to do that weekend, and I stuck to it. Related:

* Use your weekends to your advantage. Things really slow down, so it's a perfect opportunity to jump-start a paper or a reading. 

* You don't have to read every word. Learn to skim. Skim the optional reading too -- it'll come in handy. 

* If you can, take notes on paper, not the computer. When you do this, you mentally siphon out the less important information in favor of the more important information because you can't write as quickly as you can type. This will make your notes more valuable later on.

* Take notes on what you read. Even short summaries like ""Skowroneck considers presidencies as part of long historical periods marked by prevailing ideologies established by certain presidents"" will make your life **much** easier when working on final papers. (Also, y'all should check out Stephen Skowroneck's theory of presidential leadership in political time -- it's fascinating.)

* Use the works cited page of books to your advantage. If you're struggling finding more information on a topic, that's your first port of call. 

* Learn how to write papers in ways that work for you. I always wrote whatever I wanted for the assigned length of the paper. Then I wrote a schematic of what had I puked onto the page, re-organized that schematic into a structure that actually made sense, and fleshed out key details and holes. Some people write a full outline and then start. Some people organize by scholar, case study, source text, or school of thought. Whatever you do, come up with something that works for you. 

* Ask for help. Your professor's office hours, a tutor, the writing center, the counseling center, your classmates. Nobody will think less of you. (Pro-tip: asking classmates for help means talking to the smartest people in your class, which also usually means the most interesting people. Talking to interesting people, I would argue, is the whole point of college.) 

* ""It's hard"" is a TERRIBLE reason to not take a class. The best classes I've taken have also been the hardest classes. ""It's Hard"" is also the name of a pretty bad album by The Who. 

* If you're in a program that lets you be undecided for a year or two, take advantage of that. If you see something that you don't know much about, don't write it off as uninteresting. 

* If you're working on a paper, don't stop your writing session at the end of a paragraph. Start the next paragraph and then stop. This way, when you sit back down to keep going, you don't have to putter about thinking ""how should I start?"" You will already have a beginning. 

* Find a pen you like. Mine is the Bic Grip Roller. I used to go with the Pilot Precise V5 Extra Fine, but they leak sometimes. 

* Balance out your courses. If you have the opportunity to decide which classes you'll take which semesters, plan ahead and avoid loading a lot of hard classes into one semester. 

* If you have a class that only meets once or twice a week, find another time that week that you can treat like that class to do homework only for that class. For example, the year I did a thesis, I dedicated 9-12 every Friday morning to work for that thesis. I did a lot of other work for it throughout the week, but having a dedicated time to work on it really focused me. 

* You can revise your work much more effectively if you put 24 hours between the last time you worked on it and the time you started revising it. 

* Go to campus conversations and events about topics that are outside your subject area. Just because you're not studying it doesn't mean you shouldn't learn about it. This is the one time in your life where you will have the benefit of professors lecturing for free right outside your door. (Also, these events tend to have free food.)

* Keep a novel going to read for fun. I would start all of my library sessions just by reading a little bit for my own enjoyment. The idea was to get my brain going with a warm-up before I jumped into the work I would get graded on. Crosswords, Sudoku, and Chess are good alternatives to this if you're not much of a reader. 

* Find a hobby. It's really important to be able to do something that is productive but not academic. You won't feel bad about working on this thing, because it's productive, but you simply can't spend all of your time on your studies. I played a lot of music, but I know people who tried woodworking, knitting, yoga, improv comedy, and one guy with a unicycle. 

* Purchase a copy of *The Elements of Style*. Read it once at the beginning of each semester. If you carry it with you everywhere, you're not over-doing it.

**Social**

* Learn to make one large, shareable dish like a dip, lasagna, cake, or bowl of chili. There are a lot of pot lucks in college, and you will be well-prepared if you have a dish like this on standby. PM me for a bean dip recipe that people actually request of me when I go to stuff at their houses. 

* Go to parties with people you know. Make sure that you keep track of them and they keep track of you (and that you keep track of them) throughout the night. Walk each other home. 

* When considering campus opportunities, it easier to say yes and then say no than it is to say no and then yes. You can always try something once (a sport, a club, whatever) and then say ""you know, this isn't for me"" if it isn't for you. It's much harder to jump on things once they've started. 

* If you're at a party, never leave a drink unattended. Ever. 

* Set aside structured time to see the friends who mean the most to you. This can be an orientation group, people from your floor, whatever. College gets busy, and so ritualizing friendship makes it A) more frequent and B) more special, somehow. I know people who had ""family dinner"" with their closest friends every Sunday, and nothing got in the way. 

* You are not bound to your friends, especially the ones you make early on. I ditched my first-semester friends in January of my freshman year and it was one of the best choices I've ever made. They weren't bad people; we just had nothing in common. Don't be afraid to branch out.

* Branching out is scary and that's okay. 

* Do not judge anyone's character or personality (unless they do something very heinous) during their first semester. Everyone in the first semester is very desperate to be liked, and people tend not to do their best when they're under that kind of pressure. Let people (and yourself) mellow out a little bit before you start deciding who you like. This advice goes doubly for sophomores, juniors, and seniors who are passing judgment on incoming first-year students. 

* Find someone who you're close to who does not go to your school who you can call if you just need to vent. 

* Don't get that upset when most of your high school friendships collapse. It just happens.

* Give people room to change and become better people. College has a way of knocking people down a peg. If you meet someone who looks like they need that, check back on them in a year or two. 

* Take your work seriously, but don't take yourself seriously. Otherwise, you'll end up like one of the people in the above tip.

* Being a campus celebrity is not that fun. It's better to just know a lot of people so you have a lot of friendly faces on campus that you can say hi to than it is to just be ""known."" It's also okay to just have a small group of people who you like. 

* Meet older students. It doesn't matter if you do it through clubs or sports teams or greek communities, but these people have all the key info on your school, like which classes and professors are good, where to go for really good Vietnamese food, and which improv groups to see. They will also invite you to the cooler parties. 

* If you're unhappy, make a change. Cut or change an extracurricular, start hanging out with different people, break up with that person. Just don't make changes indiscriminately -- try to find the root of your dissatisfaction and fix that. "

This was a big bummer for me, so I moved back to the city where my parents live. I asked the local university if they knew any game devs in the area. I got forwarded to a company that could hire me as an intern... without pay.  
  
At that point, it was either giving up, get a new education/job and move on. Or as I did, take the ""job"" anyway.  
  
They told me they only needed a programmer. I said that I don't have a clue about programming, I only had 1 year with Java where I made a broken calculator.  
""No worries! We don't expect much. Just try it out and see if you get the hang of it"" was the response.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Absorb experience, no matter what it is**  
My second day I was set to create a cannon that auto aimed and fired against enemies (Tower defense game).  
I spent about 1.5 months on it...  
  
But I kept at it, getting some tutoring from my boss, learning from forums and tutorials. I hated it at first, but when I first got that cannon to auto fire, god damn it felt good. And I was hooked.  
  
I spent 1 year at that company programming all kinds of systems and gameplay mechanics. I went from only knowing how to write debug commands in the game-update loop, to making an entire boss sequence in an action fighting game.  I even released a game on iOS with those guys!  
  
Our first game failed (of course), money was (really) tight, I worked a lot at a part time job. So I told them that I couldn't keep it up. So I quit.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Give up or keep going**  
At that point I was very demotivated, thinking my life would end up at a boring part time job.  
I had a break for 3 months, without wanting to touch programming (or design). But I kept making up game ideas in my head, kept analyzing games I was playing, kept wanting to create something... I had the passion, but not the motivation.  
  
So, one sunday, I had nothing to do. And I forced myself to open Unity and prototype a simple game for one week. It was a struggle at first, but when it was done it felt insanely good! The motivation was back!  
  
I tinkered on with my prototype for 1 year, making a 1v1 multiplayer action RPG game. The project was insanely ambitious. But I made something playable and it worked!  
I had the intention of releasing it (I still have actually), when suddenly a friend of a friend of mine on facebook shared a post saying: ""Does anyone know of a programmer and Unity? Need 2 programmers for a 3 month project, fast!"".  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The opportunity**  
I sent him a PM, some e-mails back and forth he told me he was very interested. He wanted me to send him some of my code. So I sent him my entire prototype.  
They were amazed, and I got the job (there were 13 applicants)!   
  
I spent 2 months working on a small app project with the other guy they hired. It was fun. But after 2 months I had done my job in the project, but I still had 1 more month left on my contract. The other guy still worked on the initial project.  
  
So the company transferred me over to their big main project. On that project my job was overall game design, balancing and level design. I loved it!  
  
---  
  
When there was only 1 week left on my contract I got a call, they told me that they really enjoyed working with me, but money was tight. But if I was interested, they could try to move some things around in the budget to fit me on the team.  
Of course I said yes! The only thing was that I had to move.  
And I now I am working as both a designer and a programmer on a project in a franchise that I have loved since I was a kid...  
  
**The dream came true.**  
  
---  
  
**TL;DR:**  
So what I am trying to say is. Getting a job in the industry isn't always easy. I studied for 3 years, worked for free for 1 year and did my own solo project for 1 year before finally getting to where I wanted. So nothing is impossible, it only takes a bit longer time. And you have to work for it, constantly getting more and more experience and knowledge.  
  
Disclaimer: This is not a ""how-to"" guide on how to get a job in the industry! There are many ways of doing it. Getting connections is very important (I got the job through a friend of a friend on facebook...), but more important is experience. "
5pwfrh,1,2017-01-24,Switching careers to programming in an undeveloped country,TurboSquawk,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5pwfrh/switching_careers_to_programming_in_an/,"Hello,

I've finished undergraduate and master studies in Finance, did a 6 month internship and hated it. I'm having trouble finding good jobs, the pay mostly sucks and you get exploited as much as possible. That's just how our Eastern European country works. Most of the young, ambitious people move to some developed European Union country where they fight from the bottom to succeed. I am unable to move from my city because of family, currently. I, my mentor, and even my manager on the internship seemed to do mostly Excel and SAP troubleshooting stuff. I've spent time doing robotic tasks and it didn't seem to get much better considering my coworkers were doing almost the same type of work but on a higher level I suppose. Since I always had passion for computers and programming but never really pursued it, I would think about how all this work could be automated, even a bunch of work that the manager does. I didn't have the energy to learn a programming language after spending 8+ hrs a day there. But after this internship finished, I was relieved and ready to learn.

I decided to get familiarized with the programming world through Java, using Tim Buchalka's video course. Since I had some touch with mIRC scripting (back in the day, made some scripts on my own), some basic C in high school, some HTML and setting up CMS based sites (this was a long time ago too, before I started Finance in university). I've blazed through the beginning of the course, understanding and applying the basics easily, understanding what the mentor wanted to do even before he finished, had fun doing challenges. After a while, things got a bit more complicated but I supplemented the course with an eBook and google research. I managed to understand classes and fundamentals of OOP, but it started to get more and more difficult to solve challenges on my own, but I had motivation to go hard at it.

What really disrupted my progress is the fact that I didn't quite understand how a person gets from learning something to actually start to do it for a living. And since my money is short and I'm on my parents' back, the pressure is high to starting making money as soon as possible or just settle and do finance/economics which I don't like. Since my country isn't really developed with the programming industry (my city especially sucks bad - for reference, currently **1** local job offer for a PHP programmer), internships are hard to get and I really liked the idea of remote work. But the more I researched, I understood that Java isn't really a good option for someone that wants to change careers and do remote work. I can't even network, since there are no conventions and literally nobody in my circle does real programming - I know that's one of the ways for US people. This really made me lose motivation to further learn Java and I got stuck not knowing what to do next.

Web development seems to be the most of the work that is available in my country. But the work conditions are more or less the same as finance. Pay is better, but still bad and there's still the worker exploitation issue. So if I was good with that, I reckon I could just stick to finance and be quite miserable.

Even though I'm not sure how much I like web development, from all my research I realized that this might be the best path for kick-starting a career and going further from there. Do some random personal projects, try to find a friend who has a need for a site and volunteer to create one for them, build my own site to show off my work. Also, I realize I could potentially make some easy profit with WordPress if I can find customers, but I don't want to stay limited to that. Would some freelancing sites be a good path, differentiating myself from the sea of low wage workers and trying to find good clients to cooperate with, maybe even boost my reputation and stay in touch longer term?

So how would you guys go about starting a career in programming in an unfriendly, undeveloped environment from which you can't move in the foreseeable future? Which path would you consider a fast one, how would you network with people from developed countries and how would you go about finding a job or do freelance projects? Which field and programming language would you take?

Can I even become skilled on my own and without actual mentorship irl? I realize remote junior jobs are hard to find and could be really inefficient. Maybe just start doing really small freelance projects and build from that? My motivation has really suffered and lately all I think is that I'm wasting time and going nowhere with this. I know it's a bad attitude but I feel limited with my city/country, with the fact that's I don't have a degree in CS, with not having an idea how to network with people from developed countries, with how hard is to establish yourself on freelancing sites, with how hard is to find clients here. Was anyone here at a similar position? Any guidance would help me immensely. I know there are a lot of posts like this, but this one is from a specific standpoint.

I go to a top 10 CS school and get fairly decent grades (like B/B+) and have gotten internship offers from 2/4 of the Big 4. But, it seems like I am decent in school subjects but am so far behind and I'll only keep falling behind. I genuinely feel like I don't have much interest in the subject compared to these people. Like in past internships when I had to learn something I was successful in teaching myself. But I just won't spend my free time learning. I guess my question is: is it possible to be a successful CS without coding in your free time? I am worried that because I am not exhibiting the same interest as my peers, I will only fall behind and lose motivation."

I messed up on my planning, and I need advice on what to do for next year. I have one class that is only offered once a year, but I couldn't take it this academic year. So, I will be done with everything by June 2017 except for this one class. I already talked with the department, and there is nothing I can do except waiting until I can enroll for the class on Jan 2018 - March 2018.  

So, while waiting for January, I have no plan for July - December. I guess I will have to get a job, but I won't have a degree. Plus, I am at disadvantage compared to other engineers. Here are pro/con I've listed.  

Pro:  

1. I have a 1 summer intern experience at PCB material company in San Jose.
2. I passed FE mech
3. I have school projects on CAD making rovers and robots
4. I am trilingual (English, Japanese, Korean)

Con:

1.  My major is basically mechanical engineer but not ABET accredited. Some companies only pick mech eng while some companies don't care.  
2.  My GPA is sub 3.0
3. My intern experience doesn't really apply to jobs I want
4. I have no degree until March 2018

I don't know whether I should look for entry-level job that doesn't have degree requirement or look for intern job that wants students who are pursuing degree.

I've been anxiously searching the local job market, but I've only found web development jobs with shitty pay. Last night I noticed that Intel is posting a lot of job openings for recent grads that don't ask for experience and that seemed a good fit to me; I ended up sending 59 applications all over the world. So far I've already been rejected three times; two because they are already taken, and the other one because it was an internship position (which  I think I can't get anymore). Anyway, should I be hopeful about any of this applications?

Are there other big companies that are hiring international grads without experience? Any advice on getting a decent paying job that is not web development will be highly appreciated."

I have nearly 10 years of experience within my field as well. I left my last full-time position because the owner of the company passed away and the company was liquidated.

I have immense difficulty even landing initial interviews for positions that I know I'm qualified for and I'm not entirely sure why. I reach out to recruiters, network as often as I can, and generally work very hard to make sure I'm not just another resume in the pile.

All of my contracts have left me with positive references, and good experiences overall, but it's difficult to find a company looking to hire somebody to do my line of work full-time.

I'm an Event Manager. And in the professional world there are really only 4(5) types of event managers.

* Hotels / Hospitality / Country Club
 * Won't hire from the outside except in rare circumstances - would rather train you up from a Front Desk or Concierge agent or have a lateral transfer from another hotel.

* Corporate / Fundraising
 * This job often has its basic responsibilities chopped up and handed to various marketing employees, so it doesn't exist as a standalone position. Other times this job isn't even posted online/publicly, so you need to know who specifically to call and speak to to find out if they're looking for an EM.
 * If this job wasn't chopped into various other positions and you actually manage to find it, grab on and never let go...

* Arena / Sports Contract
 * If you thought Hotels and Hospitality were exclusive clubs, boy have you got a huge surprise waiting for you. Good luck getting one of these jobs without aggressively competitive internships or sheer blind luck.
 * After a contract with a local sports team I was told that if I wanted to go full-time with them I would need to work my way up from their minimum-wage, part-time street team positions. This is considered the norm.

* Event Service Companies
 * These places typically want you to have all sorts of certifications and qualifications - which isn't bad in and of itself. But then they want you to come in and work 80+ hour weeks for what is typically severely under-market pay. They often tend to be very shady companies that change their names frequently to avoid bad reviews, and you're lucky if you aren't running headfirst into an MLM scam.

And for the parenthetical 5.... there's always Wedding Planning.

At this point it's getting to the part where I don't even want to get out of bed in the morning.

Several times a ""dream opportunity"" has opened up with companies I'd love to work for, I customize my resume for the position and apply, and then either never hear back, or get an immediate ""Thanks but no thanks"" standard form response.

I guess I'm just frustrated, de-motivated, and to tell it truthfully starting to struggle with depression as a result of this.

Just looking for some career advice.

I'm currently a masters student studying HCI, having done a bachelor's degree in computer science. I took the masters program hoping to go into UX. I had done a few engineering internships prior and found them okay, just a little boring.


I'm at the point of applying for jobs now and I feel like I don't have enough experience to land a solid UX job. The master's course i'm on is only one year so my UX design portfolio is quite short. I'm also starting to get the impression that UX is often treated as a small/unimportant part of many companies, e.g. ideas often ignored, no clear job descriptions.  I believe I could a lot more easily get a software engineering job. But then maybe I won't enjoy it as much.


I'd like to know what people think about the job market for UX vs. engineering. Should I persist with pursuing a UX career with little experience, is it worth it? Has anyone had experience of how the two jobs compare? I know this is subjective but I'd appreciate some guidance.


Thanks

I'm naive when it comes to this stuff. Is there any detriment or advantage to accepting a Co op so early or opposed to an internship?

Also my future interviewer said that the position (assistant project manager, ie I shadow the main PM) is 80% management and 20% coding/engineering. I don't mind managing at all, but should I be worried about this? I wanted an internship to A) hone my application skills in a real world context B) open the door for future employers. I feel like Assistant PM may not be the best for A.

I'm probably over thinking this and taking a good opportunity for granted but I'd like some advice from more experienced people first."

Apart from being familiar with excel (basic vba), Access (not SQL), I've yet to take any other courses relevant to my major. My school likes to save those classes until senior year. I have done a couple tech consulting related case competitions, but I don't know how relevant that experience is. 

I've taken an intro to programming class that covered basics using python. My final project for this class was side-scrolling arcade game using pygame.

I also took an intro to object oriented programming class using Java. My final project for that was a calculator GUI. 

I went to one hackathon, but I wasn't able to contribute much aside from being the idea man. Both projects were written in javascript by my teamates.  I spent the entire time trying to teach myself HTML/CSS and most of my work was corrected by my more experienced teammates. 

At this point, I'm not even sure what I'm doing. I technically could be graduating next semester, but I feel very ill equipped and might post-pone graduation to take more classes or possibly pursue a masters in CS. 

I still don't really understand the field and job opportunities. I feel like you need to have background knowledge just to understand what some of these job positions even do. 

I'd personally rather spend my summer learning, but everybody from family, friends, advisors, professors, are telling me an internship would be a better use of my time.

So, what should I be looking for? What am I qualified for?
I appreciate your help guys. 

EDIT: Hey guys, I really appreciate the passion, but I'm looking for more concrete answers to specific type of internship positions. Every listing I find seems to want qualifications I don't have. Maybe I'm not looking in the right places or maybe I should be applying despite not having the qualifications they're looking for.

Also for relevant coursework, I plan on changing the courses included to be more specific to whatever employment I'm looking for. 

If there are others who know of certificates that I could include to really help my resume I would appreciate that alot. I saw one of the top posts in this subreddit about free certificates and I do plan on involving myself in that, but I also don't mind paying for an online course or two that will really help my skills.

If this helps, I recently had an internship interview at a major company nearby, and I got crushed because I wasn't very strong in Microsoft Excel, so any certificates or courses based on Microsoft Office would be a godsend.

The current idea is to create extensions/add-on's for all the popular browsers and then have the user's sign in so that we can send the data generated back to a single back-end system. For right now we are focused just on the desktop environment but eventually we would like to try to develop something in the mobile sphere of things, sadly only Firefox has mobile add-on support. The data we are looking to collect is stuff like:

 * Individual Page URL's
 * User's Actions (What is possible here? i.e. clicks, selections, mouse movements)
 * Site Content and Page Content (What website is it/What is on the page)
 * Time Spent on Individual Site/Page
 * Which page is gone to (Could we generate a map of the different pages visited?)

Another idea that was floated was a standalone application on both Windows and Mac that would collect this data without browser integration but I have no idea how practical that is. What are some technologies we could use to generate and collect this data? I just have a background with front-end web development through school so how would I go about learning what it takes to set up a back-end system that would universally accept the data we want to collect from all the different systems our users would use? Thanks for any time or consideration."

5q0kiy,2,2017-01-24,"About at wit's end with ""friends"", family, unemployment, life.",mateoenfuego,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/5q0kiy/about_at_wits_end_with_friends_family/,"I wasn't diagnosed officially/medically until last year (I was 31), but I was able to get doctors to prescribe me Addy pretty much wherever I moved since college. Knowing what I know now, it was so freaking obvious that I had ADHD as a kid, but my parents (one of whom is a TEACHER) had zero understanding/empathy for my constant (and I mean constant) talking, fidgeting, arguing, emotional outbursts (I learned to mostly control (well, internalize and conceal) those by the end of high school...with caveats), avoiding homework to extreme degrees (but I did well in school regardless) and general wild nature at heart (still have that honestly). 

I had quite a lot of trauma as a kid/teenager...Im sure you can imagine what I mean...so I'm sure that contributed to my inability or lack of desire to conform to what was expected of me since I was betrayed in the worst way by multiple ""authority figures""...so what's the point? I've been diagnosed with PTSD. 

So, once I got away from my parents house &amp; home town &amp; source of despair and got to university (a big, state uni), I absolutely flourished. It was like a dream come true. I finally found friends who I loved and who loved me, who enjoyed everything I did, who didn't peg me as the fag or even think about doing such a thing. My brain is perfectly suited to university life: Making your matriculation path, planning your schedule, joining whatever extra-curriculars you can imagine (my high school class had a total of 28 people in it, so clubs were very limited and pathetic). I studied abroad in Spain for a year, and this has when I really discovered myself. It was truly and utterly life changing and affirming. 

I graduated with a couple degrees and did an internship in SoHo (NYC), coupled with all my college accolades, I and my mentors pretty much thought I was on the fast track to success. I moved to NYC and started my life. I hadn't been on Addy for a while and sort of forgot about it (irony). I quickly became overwhelmed due to being dropped alone in a sharp tank with very little money and no support of any sort (not just financial). Actually my mother was actively undermining my confidence and ability to focus. I hated my father my whole life...and the feeling was mutual I'm sure. 

I began an unbelievable and steady stream of self-destructive behavior. It was like I wanted pleasure, stimulation, punishment, failure, a 'reason' for depression, attention and peace. I guess I forgot to mention that I had suppressed memories of my childhood all through college, and they surfaced big time in NYC. I was a mess. My boss reminded me of someone who abused the shit out of me, but I felt like I couldn't quit bc it's expensive to live in NYC and my parents would have loved for me to just go back home. So, I felt trapped. Just like when I was a kid. Anyway, my untreated ADHD was juicing hard along with unbearable PTSD. I still didn't seek treatment. 

I eventually can't take it and move back to the big city near where I grew up in the Midwest. I continued my spiral. No treatment. Got a good job through a friend and ended up having it for three years. But the same issues eventually popped back up. I started to get treated for adhd at the end of the second year, but it wasn't soon enough. Lost the job for losing my temper (essentially) with a numbnuts sales rep colleague after explaining the same shit ten times at least 

Oh, I also apparently have a blood clotting disorder and Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, which cause dozens of blood clots in my lungs. Almost died. Have to take blood thinners for the rest of my life and I'm in pain 24/7. So, blah blah blah, I get painkillers from a friend and like an amateur I forgot what I was doing and got busted. Felony. On top of two DUIs over the past five years. And now can't work or make money in the short term, so, back to you know where...my parents house. And I'm here now. I hate everything, especially life. I have one ""friend"" and I hate her. I am nothing like the people here...I'm not better, just different. This friend constantly uses me and lies to my face as if I'm a fucking idiot. But there's nowhere to meet people in this shitty town. 

Why am I writing this? I guess to get it off my chest because nobody knows the entire story (and this isn't even that I guess). But I keep parts separate from each other for different people. So I'm just bitching. "

I have been applying for any IT helpdesk job or related jobs for the past month only. I wasn't expecting much interviews because I honestly lack the IT job history on my resume but I've been doing stuff here and there personally to compensate for it I believe.
Anyways, I get 3 job interviews in the span of last than a week and a half but I had applied for the positions about a week in advance before getting notified. I was currently a student full time last semester but I wanted to get into the field and gain something useful for my career and future. 

My first interview was for the job of a IT helpdesk clerk. I honestly felt the interview went great but now that I think about it.. I didn't sell myself well enough to the hiring manager there. I didn't get a reply, but it did give me some idea how to take care of my future interviews about this career. Like what questions to ask them etc.

My second interview was for the position of a Hardware Technician which seemed great because I loved dissembling computer/laptop hardware and working on them. I thought this was the job for me because the interview consisted of 5 people in the same room with me. I was shocked and quite nervous immediately when I was greeting them all. The interview made me forget so much things because of the presence in the room. I easily forgot what non-volatile ram was. I am also MTA certified since last summer which I am glad that I took the class for in college. After the interviews of these two jobs I got no reply after.

Finally, the last job interview was for the position of the IT Internship! I immediately felt in no way am I going to land this position because of my qualifications and experience. I felt like a beginner in my mental thinking of it. The interviewer was nice and patient. He told me that HR kept sending him people with a Masters or a Bachelors degree. He said he was looking for someone who is excitingly wanting to enter into the field, probably because I said it at the very beginning of our interview when we exchanged a few words. I felt good about the interview and then he gave me a laptop and told me to take out the ram and hard drive. I didn't take out the back panel at all. I went straight to the battery and took that off for safety measure and he was shocked saying no one ever did that before. I felt like I hit jackpot after that and continued to take off the back panel. He stopped me immediately after that and said you know what you are doing, so there's no point in going further. We ended the interview shortly after that test.

This interview was conducted on Friday and I was waiting what felt like forever to get any sort of response. I also sent a thank you email to their HR for how well the interviewer and company treated me there. It was a nice experience tbh. I finally got the call of acceptance this Sunday which took a load of pressure off my shoulders because I kept thinking that I probably will have to keep applying everywhere for a chance to work in this field with no near professional experience.

TLDR: Went to three interviews and the last one was for an IT Internship role which accepted me and I feel like I hit the jackpot because this was perfectly what I wanted!

Sorry for the long post!"

I just started my internship at a semi small company (about 60 people here). So please be gentle :)

My department boss wants a web-based system like netdisco, observium etc. but want to be able to search for an LAN IP and find the computer and which switch + port it is on. So far I have tried mrtg, netdisco and observium without luck.

I have setup SNMP on all switches (HP) with a community. Most of them can only run SNMP v2 it seems (if that matters)

Is this even possible? He says a guy who worked there before (like 3 years maybe) made it possible, but they lost the backup of the system.

How would you advice me to go forward? Should I look into doing it with shell scripts, look at other tools etc.?

I would prefer the system to be run by Linux, but I'm open to suggestions.

Oh also, it can cost a bit of money (they are okay spending like maybe 200-300$ a year, but probably not much more) but free would be awesome :D

Kind regards

I am curious what I could expect as an average salary for a job in Software Development in the Denver area, given my education and experiences (see below). Keeping in mind I’d be the first to admit I’m probably average at best in terms of abilities, I don’t see myself hired to work at places like Google, Facebook, Amazon, or what have you… I’m just out for your average job. 

**Education:**

* Masters in Information Systems (French engineering school)
* B.S. in Computer Science (Small liberal arts school)

**Work Experience (most recent ordered first):**

* Airbus - Software Development Internship (mobile apps) - 6 months
* Global Tel*Link - Software Engineer (java/mobile/web apps) - 13 months
* Raytheon - Software Development Internship (mobile/web apps) -  3 months
* Research Company Affiliated with University - Software Development Internship (mobile apps) - 4 months 
* IT Dept. at University - Student Work Study (java apps, scripting, IT work, misc) - 4 years while attending university. 

**Languages (ordered by experience):** 
Java, Objective-C, Javascript, PHP, C#, HTML/CSS, Perl, Swift

**Other:** 
Android, iOS, Hibernate, Mule, MySQL, Oracle, MSSQL, Good Dynamics

So, what could be an expected/fair salary in Denver?

As a side question, what could I expect in terms of vacation time and other benefits? Is 3-4 weeks a reasonable expectation? I'd probably be inclined to negotiate extra time off vs a higher salary.

* Finally got medicated in May 2016. Basically cured my ADHD overnight. 

* Did an internship in India for 6 months and struggled with the meds available there. 

* Returned to the USA in November 2016. Taught myself Web Development success fully. 

**Now**

I'm looking for work (junior front end dev) and trying to fill in any gaps I might have in my knowledge. Finding a first job is damn tough!

The shitstorm I've been getting from my family lately is horrible. My mom is obsessed with me and what I'm doing. She needs a psych more than me. She's literally stuck in a though loop of obsessing over me. It's likely she thinks I'm wasting my time and should go back to college. My sister thinks the same. They must have forgotten about how we can't afford our mortgage anymore and we need money to pay for the house. 

Neither of them believe I have ADHD or understand how fucking debilitating it can be. They think I'm a loser college dropout who sits at home all day. They tell me I've been doing this for 3 years, when I'm relatively new to having self-control (excluding that horrible Indian medicine, it's been &lt; 3 months). 

Now that I'm on meds, I'm fucking trying. HARD. I'm working on my laptop at least 10 hours a day if not more. I'm going to meetups and hiring events. I'm marketing myself on social media. I can't remember the last time I took a day off anymore. 

I know we're going through hard times, but does that really justify the verbal abuse I get? I'm starting to consider leaving my family completely and moving out of their lives. I miss the old days. :(

How can I make my family not hate me? How can I get a job ASAP? The traditional ways are not working for me. 

**tl;dr My family thinks I'm a lazy loser college dropout that wants to permanently mooch of his family. They hate, verbally abuse, and neglect me. I want to get the fuck out this madhouse and get a job. How can I patch things up with my family and how can I quickly get a job?**"
5q3cu4,2,2017-01-25,Should I Leave My Toxic Internship ASAP?,MonolithyK,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q3cu4/should_i_leave_my_toxic_internship_asap/,"So I currently work in a paid internship position ($15 an hour), and just started last week. I graduated last semester with a degree in multimedia, and found this position in graphic design, but it is more so spreadsheet management than graphic work - so it's busy work and not any kind of learning. I'm wondering, given the following info, if I shouldn't just leave without giving a proper 2 weeks notice.

So this company is an incredibly small company that makes and sells dental equipment to countries abroad, since they do not have the proper license from the FDA to sell within the united states. My job is to arrange all of their proper documents and text files so that their FDA application runs smoothly - which means hours and hours of referencing catalogue ID's, numerical guides, spreadsheets, and writing legal clauses. What's funny is, all of the InDesign files are already done - all of the designing components anyway, so I spend my days editing text blocks in PDF's using Acrobat. I have yet to even touch Illustrator or Photoshop. They have had the same pamphlets, fliers and brochures for years since the owner does not want to change the company's visual identity. . . So why even hire a designer? This is not the job I thought it was, or the job they told me about. This is merely hours and hours of busy work.

These are some of the other things they didn't tell me in the interview. . .Right now, the company may be small, and still calls itself a ""startup"" - even though it started in early 2012. This was clearly a stunt. Red flag #1.  My first day was more of a ""test"" day, which was an unlaid gauge of how fast I can work, but the owner of the company yelled at me because taking a lunch break showed that I was undedicated to the company. I didn't even work there yet. I discovered that people are harassed for wanting to leave on time, or take more than a 15 minute lunch. I figured I could at least give it a chance, and that these these little things would just pan out. 

On my first paid day, I did not sign a contract of any kind, but made an verbal agreement to show up on time. I still have yet to sign any kind of paperwork. I am not bound to any kind of contract or time frame - I am pretty sure they expect people to leave if this is the case. . . The ""agreement"" was to show up at 8:00 AM, leave by 6:00 PM on most nights, and sometimes stay longer but with no overtime pay. I am paid a flat 8 hour day, sometimes with no lunch break (because if you do, you are a savage time waster who has no passion for the job). I was also told that they typically write out their paychecks once every two weeks, but I'm not even sure if I believe that - especially when I don't even know if my name is in record, or if they know my last name.

The workload is equivalent to an actual career position, and I am the only one in the office who has the relevant experience in any actual graphic design (yet the position is still considered an internship). If I left, and they actually NEED graphics made, they would be screwed. I have seen other job openings with the same workload and basic description, NOT EVEN in graphic design, paying between $30 and $40 an hour with a 401K and benefits. So I am essentially working at half price with no benefits and no contract of any kind. I bet if I quit tomorrow, they wouldn't even have a file to get rid of.

My boss, apparently, has also been accused of malpractice in his dental career. He has wronged a lot of people, owes money in medical damages and unlaid loans, and cuts corners in both his own work, and in the company he owns. For instance: his only graphic designer is an intern. Most of his other employees only last about 3 months. Maybe if he called the position an ""internship,"" he could lure people in with the prospect of expanding their craft. I guess he succeeded in that regard, but I haven't learned anything thus far.

So I have taken it upon myself to secretly go to other job interviews on my lunch break. I did one yesterday, and this new company may call me back in the coming days - the interview went extremely well. Sure, I take 50 minutes to a full hour to take these interviews, and I have received flak for doing so, but I think it is worth it. I am also being contacted via LinkedIn from people urging me to apply to actual positions that are not internships, and have actual need for an artist. It is only a matter of days until I get a full-on opportunity that is actually in my field and industry.

If I were to leave this place, I would also have a fairly decent amount of money to live for a solid few weeks without work. Luckily, the fiscal risk of leaving just isn't real at the moment - I get enough money from weekend commissions. Also, I would probably never hear from this dental company, or worry about them ever again - since they have no actual ties to anything in my target industry. This would have little-to-no effect on my future employment, since I am getting out of a toxic work environment for my wellbeing. I saw this as more of a transitional  ""job"" anyway that wouldn't last more than a few months, but if I feel that it would be unhealthy for me to stay any longer than I need to.  Should I inform my supervisor and duck out soon?

My bachelors is in Computer Science, and I'm 75% through an MSc. in ""Computer Science"" though the programme has a more pretentious title and involved a consultancy project, living abroad (China), entrepreneurship/design classes and working with 2 companies (one at home, and a partner company in China). 

I worked alongside my undergrad as a Software Developer. I can program, I like it, but I don't want it to be my 9-5. The best part of that role was the stakeholder engagement, translating the requirements of stakeholders into software, though as a developer I was limited in this capacity. 

I'm about to commence a marketing internship alongside my MSc. The internship is a digital marketing role, which is exciting, but that alone won't be enough to land a job in the field and I'm keen to not stray too far from my tech roots. I hope it can give me a good insight into how organisations function (it's a $XXXmillion funded start-up).

What jobs exist for people like me. I don't want to be a programmer, but I want to stick around in tech, blurring the line between the business and the code monkey. It seems the only route is: code monkey for a few years, team lead, project manager. 

Is there a fast track? I've been looking at internal tech consulting roles/technical analyst and they seem promising though very few are entry level. Am I missing anything else?

My wife and I have a mutual acquaintance who we met while living in Los Angeles. We recently found out this person whom we’ve known for about 3/4 years is going to be co-starring in a major film alongside some very respected and successful actors. My wife and I are absolutely thrilled to the moon for this person. 

It has been a dream of mine to be in the entertainment business whether as a musician or an actor since I was 15 (32 now.) After I got out of the military my wife and I moved to LA. We both loved the city, the beach, and I loved the opportunities out there. I enrolled in acting classes immediately and started to network. Eventually I was able to land an internship on a film starring Seinfeld alumni which was exciting and an incredible learning experience. The shoot lasted 3 months and when it was over I was getting contacted for paid production work, however the work was few and far between and what I really, really wanted to do was acting. Unfortunately I wasn’t getting anywhere. 

Time went on and we eventually got tired of living check to check and considered moving back to Arizona. Eventually we did relocate back to the desert but our hearts remained in SoCal. 

This is where I need some advice… We know this actor well, but I would say they’re more of an acquaintance than a friend at this point but we are very friendly. I want to ask for help or a “break” from this person to get into acting but am having trouble going about it and am terribly anxious about the whole thing. I know that this will take hard work, dedication, and everything I have to be successful at it, but I am more than ready and willing. Being a veteran of the military I am no stranger to hard work and long hours.  

I’m not asking to be famous or to be a movie star, I’m simply asking for an opportunity to prove myself; To show someone in the industry who recognizes talent what I can offer. That’s all. 
I hate cliches but I really don’t want to be that person thinking “what if” my whole life....

So Reddit- please, any helpful advice? 
Genuinely thankful for anyone that replies let alone reads this!"

I'm majoring in Criminology but realized my passion is in coding.

I am based in London and I am set to attend a 12 week coding bootcamp in less than a week. I'm excited to learn and develop my skills but the idea of being unemployed for an extended period of time after graduating is terrifying to me. I want to get some developer work experience on my CV ASAP.

Assuming I do well in my course and build a decent portfolio, what are some strategies to ensure I gain employment quickly?

I'm not too picky really. Money isn't an issue and I would work for minimum wage or accept a paid internship as long as I was making enough to pay off my student loans. I'm open to working in any sector as long as they are willing to invest time in helping me learn and develop. 

Do I have a good chance of earning a developer position in  London quickly? Which sectors should I be looking at? Are startups more likely to hire boot-camp graduates than larger companies? Is it a good idea to be candid with employers and admit that I am willing to work for minimum wage or does that devalue my skills? Any advice appreciated.  "

This was the e-mail I received after submitting my application. By the way they worded it, it seems like I will get a notification regardless? It's been a little over a week.

This is a summer internship opportunity for my DREAM job. It is extremely competitive I'm assuming because the company is huge. Since it is geared towards college students, I would hope I have a good chance, in the description it states ""internship/ work experience recommended"" and I have been balancing work and internship opportunities since I was 15.

What do you think big companies look for in college students?

My question though is, which one do you think would have more people attending? I have a really bad case where when I see a lot of people in one giant room (like the career fairs in the HUB) I just start sweating, loose my confidence, and just want to get out... it just derails from there. Its definitely all in my head, but I'd just avoid having to deal with all of that if both career fairs do have the same companies.

Also, why would the Diversity Career Fair bring on majority of the companies attending today's SWE career fair? I am assuming those same companies instead are opting for all majors for the Diversity Career fair?

And lastly, I was curious, what are peoples opinions here about the career fairs? I had attended the one last quarter (the giant Engineering one) and literally 22/23 companies I spoke with told me to apply on their career page, where at least half of those 22 didn't want to take a resume (and they apparently weren't accepting resumes either, just looked like they were there to promote their brand).

5q5xg5,1,2017-01-25,Entry Level Project Management Positions?,awaythrow9201,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5q5xg5/entry_level_project_management_positions/,"As a graduating college senior this year, I was just introduced to Project Management and I'm really interested in the field. As I'm currently looking for entry-level jobs in CS, I have been rejected countless times with: ""Thank you for applying, but we have decided to pursue more qualified ..."". A lot of these are for entry-level SWE positions at tech companies without even getting an interview.

I think the reason is most likely my low GPA (&lt; 3.0, started as a Chemical Engineer first 2 years; I don't add my GPA unless required). My resume is a bit lacking, with only one Data Analyst internship, some TA'ing, and no side projects (Hopefully soon). I honestly feel like I have a decent understanding of some computer languages (Java/C++) and common algorithms. I'm currently applying to non-tech companies in hopes of at least having a chance at an interview, as I typically do very well on them, especially on behavioral sections. 

Anyways, I feel like Project Management is a great fit me as I'm much more confident of a designer/thinker than a programmer (Can probably answer the intermediate level coding interview questions, and Project Management/SWE is much more than that). I was wondering what companies would give me and my GPA a chance? I'm not really interested in the big 4, at this point any job in the Project Management field would work."
5q60rd,114,2017-01-25,"WATCH OUT: ""Internship"" Scam!",ThisGoldAintFree,UMD,https://www.reddit.com/r/UMD/comments/5q60rd/watch_out_internship_scam/,"Hello everyone, I am here today to warn you about a scam that is currently plaguing the campus. I am not sure of how widespread this issue is but am aware that these sorts of scams have been going on around campus for years, as well as on campuses nationwide for quite some time now.

For those who don't read further: DO NOT trust random strangers who come into your class and promise an ""internship"" without giving any details, DO NOT trust ""College Work Painting"" or any affiliated parties with your information or time. They are scammers trying to get you into their pyramid scheme. 

To describe what this scam entails, let me first talk about my experience in class today. I sat down in my criminology class (weird for a chemistry major but hey some of the coolest classes are outside of your major sometimes) and waited patiently for class to begin. Right around 3:00, my teacher began to speak and welcomed us all to class, stating that first there was a student who wanted to share an opportunity with us. 

A random girl, probably around the age of all the other college students there, began to speak to us about a wonderful internship opportunity. She didn't say anything at all about what this internship was, just that it was ""an internship"" and that some of the best interns could make up to 7,000 dollars in a single summer! I could tell almost immediately that the whole thing was a scam considering she didn't even provide any details on the internship, or talk about what it was even about. Rather, she passed out little slips of paper saying ""internship"" on them and wanted us to fill them out with our names and personal information such as e-mails. 

After a minute or two, she actually become a little aggressive, as if she wanted the class to quickly fill out these papers and give them back to her so that she could get out of there as quickly as possible. She tried to make it seem as if this was normal and that this was all approved by the professor (who had no idea what was going on), but in reality, she was trying to find gullible students to scam and trick into getting involved with the College Work Painting pyramid scheme.

I have personally never been involved with this scam or fallen victim to it, but I do have a couple of friends that have, and have read countless articles online about it to want to make the UMD community more aware of this issue. Basically, they contact you at the beginning and make it seem like this is some sort of exclusive internship. If I recall, the girl who visited my class even pointed out that ""only 5% of applicants get accepted."" This is complete BS. They accept anyone for the job as long as they think you are dumb enough to fall for their tricks.

Basically, they make you think you're getting this extremely well paying job which is very exclusive and would look great on a resume, but what they really do is trick you into managing your own team of employees (i.e. victims) who you must hire and manage on your own, purchasing all of the necessary paint supplies and basically, starting your OWN business and doing all the work yourself, but having to waste a ton of money and giving them a humongous chunk of the revenue (even if you go through with this, expect a miniscule amount of profit in the first place) that you get from managing the other saps.

It is a PYRAMID SCHEME and I was really disappointed to see so many people fall victim to this in my class today, all because some girl mentioned vaguely that there is ""an internship"" without giving any details whatsoever. 

Point is, don't fall for these internship scams, and always be aware of such things. Be sure to spread the word and if you hear that a friend or even someone you vaguely know is falling for this, let them know what's really going on.

Thanks, stay safe and have a great semester!"
5q64tb,2,2017-01-25,[RI] I was asked to sign a 5 year non-compete agreement as an unpaid college intern.,isjfiesjfio38,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5q64tb/ri_i_was_asked_to_sign_a_5_year_noncompete/,"I recently got an offer to intern at a local accounting firm. Even though it's unpaid, the firm seems to offer some good, hands-on experience working with the general ledger, tax preparation, audits, proof of cash, and accounting software. 

I went in today to drop off my BCI check. The accountant was not in the office, so I just talked to the secretary. She gave me a manila folder with the firm's employment application, a NDA, an I9 form, and a non-compete agreement. 

I had never seen or heard of a non-compete agreement before. I don't have a copy of the agreement on me, but it said something to the effect that I could not work for any competing firm (any firm that engages in tax preparation, bookkeeping, etc.) for five years after my ""employment"" at this firm. 

Obviously, I'm not really an ""employee"" at the firm. I'm surprised I even had to fill out an I9 to be honest. I ended up signing the non-compete form (again, I wasn't pressured or anything, I was actually alone in a room when I was filling it all out.) I figured that it was something typical and maybe I was just misunderstanding the document. 

I did ask the secretary an unrelated question about where I was supposed to sign on the NDA. She called the accountant and the accountant said she would go over all of that paperwork with me on Monday (five days from now). I suppose it's possible that the secretary assembled the usual documentation given to new employees and that I wasn't meant to actually sign the non-compete clause. 

But now I'm a bit concerned about the potential legal ramifications of this agreement. I mean, it doesn't make any sense to offer an internship to college sophomores and juniors, and then expect them to refrain from working in their field of choice for up to four years *after* graduation.

I've also read that a court typically wouldn't enforce a 5 year non-compete agreement, much less in the context of an unpaid college internship. 

Still, if it turns out that the accountant does, in fact, expect me to abide by the non-compete agreement, what should I do? Should I resign? Should I just go along with it and pursue my career path howsoever I choose in the future, knowing that a court would be unlikely to enforce that agreement (provided the accountant even knows what I'm doing in the future and decides to file a lawsuit against me)?

My school allows you to earn double majors without having both of them completed at the same time. I'm trying to get a BS in Business Administration (IT Concentration) and French Language and Literature as my second, and Computer Science as my minor.

I would try to graduate with the BSBA first because it'd be my bread/butter degree. What I was curious about though, was, if I got a job right after graduation, would I still be able to complete my French degree and the minor in CSC? I feel like jobs wouldn't really let you work and do school at the same time unless it was something you were doing as an internship? Like because most jobs are 9-5 type of things.

I hope I'm wrong because I'd love to do all three of these things but I worry about the time and also how I'd get everything done. I'm already 21, 22 this year and I should be graduating next Spring but stuff happened and I ended having to do an extra year altogether.

While studying psychology I decided I don't want to become a psychologist so I started a 1-year Masters conversion degree in IT. The course is very intense (requiring at least 50h work per week) and the main languages we learned are Java, Python &amp; SQL. The degree also covers topics like project management, software engineering, cyber security &amp; human computer interaction.

An obvious problem is that a 1-year degree won't make me a specialist of a particular area and in the job market I will have to compete with people who studied IT in more depth and perhaps had time for internships. Also, because I have been studying this for literally 5 months, I don't have a clear idea of how I could find my place in the industry.

Throughout the course I struggled most with Java. I do understand the theory, can read and modify existing code but lack the creativity needed when writing programs from scratch. I started Python a couple of weeks ago, so can't comment on it yet. I found SQL/JDBC to be very easy and enjoyed project management and human computer interaction classes.

While working on various groups projects, I noticed I tend to analyse and synthesise different ideas (not necessarily mine) to create some sort of clarity from the initial chaos. I make sure we adhere to requirements (but with no gold-plating) and usually notice any mistakes before they start causing bigger problems. I prefer to plan and think about different options beforehand to avoid any waste of time or effort. I also like to think from the perspective of the user and what steps they'll go through when using the system.

My previous work experience includes market research, statistics and event organising for training purposes.

Thinking about previous experience and this degree, I can honestly say I can achieve great results under high pressure but it makes me feel miserable and takes a huge toll on my health so I would ideally avoid very fast pace high stress jobs.

One thing I'm quite sure about is that I don't want to spend all day staring at the screen and writing Java code, although I enjoy being involved in the discussions of the program structure, suggesting how to improve something etc. I'm a bit nervous about job positions that people with no technical degrees can get because that will probably mean higher competition and I have to be realistic.

So my question is: what career options should I look into? How could I improve my employability prospects keeping in mind that the degree is very time-consuming?

If it's relevant, I am currently based in the UK but hoping to relocate after graduation.

I know the post is a bit long, so I'll be very grateful if anyone answers :) Thanks!"

I am a goal oriented person. If I have something I want to do (e.g. Become a software engineer, learn Python to a working level, become proficient with git to the point where I can list it as a skill) then it is tremendously helpful if I can break this down into smaller goals, and sort of draw out a path through them that I should take. 

I think I know what I need to do on the programming side in order to learn a language, at least to get beyond beginners level, but on the careers side I'm floundering. Beyond 'learn a language', I don't know what I need to do to become a software engineer. For reference, I am a second-year mathematics student at a good British university, with a beginners level knowledge of Python that is steadily improving. 

Of course, tips like 'get internships' are helpful, but the ideal for me would be some sort of panoramic overview of what I need to know, what I need to do, and what preparations I need to make. At the very least, I'd like to know enough to *know* that I'm headed in the right direction with what I am currently doing.

At the internship I'm currently working at, I'll get week to week and a half long projects (according to the person who assigned them to me) that are easily doable in 2 or 3 days.

A couple of days ago I applied for an internship position. It was more of a ""why not?"" application, as I am unqualified for the position (for one, they require C++ expertise, and I have no such thing).

Today (two days after my application) I received an email from a recruiter asking for a phone interview with me. For any other position I would have accepted, but I am having second thoughts about this one.

I'm in the middle of my midterm examination and the coming week is extremely pressing for me. I don't know whether I'm qualified enough for the position, probably making this interview a waste of my currently very limited time. Also, I don't have time to prepare for this phone screen either.

So on one hand I doubt they would waste their time with a phone screen for someone far below the qualifications, but on the other hand I don't have the time to prepare for this.

5qbvoq,1,2017-01-26,Future Advice Request,mrmopper0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qbvoq/future_advice_request/,"I am a Math major and enjoyed coding all throughout school. I developed an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for my final project in java (big mistake). But when I graduated I got involved with a group that wanted to be actuaries.


The position sounded great and I had no internships under my belt. They have these exams that take 500+ hours of studying each to pass on probability and financial mathematics. I thought it was nice be able to earn a career through tests so I studied. I am now on the other side of these exams, having passed both of them.

I find myself completely outclassed by people who have been pursuing the career since highschool (even middle school!) and I am ready to give up. It is that competitive. It is a lot of work down the toilet, but I at least learned a lot of financial and statistical concepts.


I have just gotten back into coding because a redditor said that it would be a good option for someone like me, and have learned quite a bit. There are of course things on postings that I don't know. I am about to start working in a warehouse for Amazon. I've had this position before, at the end of the day I am exhausted and can barely even stand, much less study. I am currently 1.5 years out of school.

**Here are my questions:**

1)Is this Amazon position as beneficial to getting a professional coding position as studying coding? 

My thinking is on one side it is easier to get a job if you have one, and Amazon may want to hire me as a programmer if I am committed to the company already. On the other side there are plenty of terms on posts that I don't recognize, without studying my knowledge may not be great enough. My knowledge level so far is I can write programs for dynamic algorithms, sorting and the like, make apps with winforms, develop websites with html/css/javascipt, R graphics, basic data analytics, and brief sql queries.


2)Given a list of technologies, how should I approach topics I do not know (such as frameworks I haven't used)? Am I really expected to know all of them for an entry level position, or are they expecting me to lie?

I feel I would need to lie to some extent as I have not seen two jobs with the same list of technologies, and just because I can write SQL in Oracle, doesn't mean I could in MySQL or MS SQL Server. The combinations of skills seem endless.


3)My final question questions are general. What are some unexpected challenges to becoming a programmer? Is there as question I should be asking but am not aware I should be?


With this I will open up the flood gates. If you require additional information to answer, I would be happy to give more details. However I am leaving over the weekend to help supervise some youth inter-tubing in the mountains so if it is after my departure you may need to wait a couple of days (with bated breath).

a few weeks after this conversation with the boss i landed a role as a developer at a company that sells womens airbrush products, i did a programming test for them on site and they seemed to like my work and i was hired and i worked there for three weeks, now keep in mind im not a bad employee (my own bias here: on time, respectful, all the basics, doing what i needed to do to not ensure any problems). i was laid off, due to poor sales or they thought i was a nice guy and didnt wanna throw the book at me.

4 months after this i landed a job at another company that makes auto dealer websites and i went out of state for a week to train with them and same story again, but this time i was fired after three weeks, i asked for feedback, they wouldn't answer me on it, nothing, and keep in mind i dont know what i did wrong here.. no clue period

i found another company and i got in and i started right away as a junior programmer this time for a company in asset management, i did QA for them first since their program was huge, then later i started using doing work for them in COBOL (yes because they were founded in 1979) then i was supposed to move into ASP.net since they were migrating their code to that, 6 months into that job i was let go, on the basis that i didnt pick up their program fast enough..

being that it has been a year since i was let go, i still wanna go into development but job hunt has been slow, not that i havent been trying, i interview well (based on the feedback i got from others) but for one reason or another im not getting in, i mean at this point what suggestions you have? i wanna be a programmer maybe i should do IT first then hope i can move in a company?"

It's getting really difficult to not get discouraged because my girlfriend just got a Software Engineer position for a great company and has significantly less on the job experience than me. As happy as I am for her it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.

I recently found out that my college offers a lot of math/CS classes during the summer. Great! This lightens the load during the regular semester. I also realized I can get into Data Structures (required for internships) as soon as spring 2018. Previously it was Fall 2018 so I can get a jump on internships a year earlier than I expected. 

Here's the question. I currently work in a non tech role with good benefits, but a shitty wage. I could easily make $3-$7 more an hour at an internship, but I'm guessing interns don't get insurance. Target graduation date is spring 2020 so I'd graduate with that magic 2 years of experience. My daughter is also on my insurance so she'd have to transfer to my wife's, which is going to be expensive. 

If you were me, what would you do? I'm itching to get started and dive into some real world work. 

Tldr: To start an internship a year early or not?

Pros: 2 years of experience upon graduation. 

More money

Good connections. 

Cons: losing insurance for myself and child. 

Not always guaranteed to be working? Maybe? Not sure how internships work exactly.

I also wouldn't be opposed to getting a Masters / Ph.D in said country but I would prefer to get a job immediately.  However if that is my only option I may take it.

What would be my best path to a working visa in another country/ what is worth my time to look into?  For example, I've heard about Work Holiday Visas but I'm not sure whether they would apply to me.  I'm also not sure whether these can be upgraded to permanent resident status eventually, which is an option I would strongly prefer to have."

I would really appreciate any advice or words of encouragement. 

I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering in June 2016. I kind of knew that I really didn't like my major and was feeling a lot of anxiety at the time, but felt that I would just graduate, get a job, and figure things out. Well it's now 2017 and I still don't have a job. I feel like I am just trying to bull shit and fake my way into an engineering job that I don't even want. I feel like engineering is a poor fit for me, but then on the other hand I haven't had much industry experience besides internships. I'm pretty smart and technically minded, this is why I went the engineering route in the first place. I think I'm kind of getting depressed. I moved home with my parents to save money and that's fine, but I feel so lost and like a failure. I started taking classes for healthcare related options because that was something that deep down for the longest time I always wanted to do, but I still have a lot of doubt in pursuing this. I feel such an overwhelming sense of anxiety and stress about my future and I feel like I don't really know who I am or what I enjoy anymore. It's a rough feeling and I've never had to deal with something like this before. I know I should probably suck it up and stuff, but I can't help having the feelings I do. 

If anyone has felt similarly and could give some advice that would be great. Everyone tells me ""things will work out, you will figure it out"" but I'm in a really dark mindset right now and can't see that perspective. Something that recently got my interest was Sales Engineering because I feel like for me I do enjoy learning about technical things and products, but since I don't like actually designing them maybe that would be a good fit. I'm more extroverted than any of my peers ever were and am someone that really enjoys social interaction and building relationships. 

Thanks for hearing me out. Sorry if this came off as super winy, but I'm not in a very good mood and am just looking to vent and maybe hear some positive remarks right now. "

I did a few internships in different size companies before graduating. After that, I worked for nearly a year at a large hardware-focused company under a contract. After that, I worked at a startup for 2.5 years, eventually taking on a leadership role managing a team of engineers. The company is having business type problems out of my control and I decided to leave.

My problem is, I don't know what I should do now. My first thought was to get a big name on my resume for the first time and join the ranks as an IC for a few years, but suddenly it seems unexciting to me. I went job hunting and was fortunate enough to get offers at Facebook, Microsoft, Uber and an early stage startup. I have to decide now. I'd have a bigger impact at the startup, but it pays less by at least 25% depending on which company I compare it to. I could do what my gut tells me, go try another startup. Or, I could follow the money. What I really want to do is what's best for my career, but I don't know what that is. I'd like to someday have an important directional role in a company as a technical leader. Or have my own company, but I need an idea first so I'm not holding my breath on that idea yet. I don't have any debts or children so I can handle some risk now.

Should I join another startup and try to do as much as I can and have a big impact and learn more things, or join one of the big companies and risk getting lost in the noise while giving my resume some name recognition?"

What can I do?,pomegra,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5qfuba/i_have_around_a_year_and_a_half_left_until/,"So, I'm knee deep in a political science degree right now. I have basically no relevant experience and no relevant classes. I know it's not really a good predictor of future performance or interest, but I really enjoyed the introductory programming course I took last quarter. Plus, I'm thinking the political science degree isn't going to turn out so well financially for me.

I can't major in CS. It's far, far too competitive at my university - they turn down students for getting under a 3.5 for one prerequisite class in terms of getting into the major, and I bombed a few calc courses a year ago. So I'm going to need to look into other options. I go to the University of Washington, if you haven't guessed. Notorious for having a hell of a rat race when it comes to the tech majors here.

I'm thinking about switching to majoring in one of the related tech majors - Informatics, but I'm not counting on it, because it's nearly as competitive as CSE - around a 20% acceptance rate last year. 

I might end up having to stick with computer science or major in something very peripherally related like Geography and rely on what little experience and classes I can scrape up with my remaining time. 

What should I be considering? I definitely don't have enough experience to get any internships this year, but I'm thinking about picking up some of the recommended textbooks here and studying through data structures and algorithms so I might be able to apply to some next quarter. Perhaps starting up some projects. Maybe that's unrealistic. 

EDIT: Not sure if it matters but I have a metric ton of volunteer experience and political intern experience. Maybe that's irrelevant now. Or maybe it'll make me more interesting?"

I know that a lot of west coast companies pay more with a housing stipend, but since the position is in South Florida, I guess it's adjusted for the area. It might also have to do with the fact that I have no experience. Am I being low-balled, or is this normal?

I am a 31YO from the Atlanta Metro area, and I just recently graduated with a my AS in Network &amp; Security Administration in December 2016. I'm currently enrolled in a BS program for the same degree and should be graduating in December 2017 with it. So now that I have a degree I am currently looking for a job in the IT.  I have very little professional experience with IT, but I have years and years of Home networking, PC Builds, and what was learned in school. I have not had an internship as I have a family and mortgage and need to pay bills, and cannot really work for free or take a giant pay cut in doing an internship. I have had a stable job for the last 15 years as a Firefighter/Paramedic, and gained numerous valuable skills throughout, and I tried to relay them into my resume to make the transition to IT.

I have already passed my 901 &amp; I am scheduled to take my 902 next week to give me A+. Once I get that done, I do plane on getting my Network+ Cert in the end of Feb or March. I do plan on taking my CCNA once, this semester gets done as I am finishing my last networking class.

Here is were it gets little disheartening for myself. I have applied to numerous jobs, and have only received 2 call backs and then nothing after that. I am applying to Dekstop Analyst, Tech Support, and anything that I seem to be a fit for with me AS. While these are not my first choice of jobs, as I would like to do something with Networking &amp; Securities I figured they would give me a decent point to start to off my career with and let me gain some experience.

So my questions would be: What jobs should I be looking for?  Are there some other tech job sites that I don't know about like DICE. What can I do to make myself seem more appealing to the IT field hiring managers? 

TLDR: Need some advice as to what entry level jobs I can apply for as a new grad, with minimal IT experience.  "

The co-op program at Waterloo is essentially world-renowned because of how it works and the jobs/interships that are available. 

My long term goal is to move to the United States (or stay in Canada at a big company). It boils down to this - would a BMath in, say, computational mathematics or combinatorics/optimization with 4-6 internships be better or just a CS degree? Can you work in software engineering and development with a BMath?

Also with a BMath, it would also be possible to work in other sectors such as finance/quantitative analysis. What do you think?"

I recently graduated with a B.S. in Comp Sci and although I'm very good a programming, I've realized through my 4 internships that I don't love doing it 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week.

This works really well for me because I'm definitely a people person and I'm also really really good at teaching software / having patience. However I also do enjoy programming and improving the product.

My question is, how would I look for more jobs like the one I received? Surely companies must have developers who go onsite to teach, receive feedback, and generally take care of customers. Is there a job title for this position? I'd really be interested in a job like this (especially if I could program as well) but I don't know where to start looking or how to represent that this is what I'm looking for. 

Currently online I just have my desired title as ""software developer"". Pretty generic.

I stopped enrolling and took a a couple of years off to find myself and enter the work force.  Completely sober now, but my past is still weighing a burden on me.

So yeah, I scheduled a meeting with an advisor in a couple weeks to discuss my options, but my anxiety is making me want at least some answers right now.

So basically I was a computer science major for those first three horrible semesters, but now at this new community college I'm at, I'm doing a 2 year Computer Information Technology: Computer Programming degree.  I really enjoy it, I took intro to Java and history of computers last semester and aced it, and now I'm in English Comp, Intro to statistics, and Intro to networking, and I'm really starting to enjoy myself and feel better about myself.  

Now my issue lies with this. In order to complete this two year degree I have to have an internship, to have an internship I have to have a 2.5GPA at least.  Once I have the GPA I should have no issues as this school has a really high statistic of getting students internships, including some internships at national labs, and other very cool places.  

One thing I noticed when looking at my transcript is all of my grades are ""TF"" or ""TW"" which I think means temporary, but the classes that I dropped out of I retook, and dropped out again, and because these were at a different community college, some of the classes offered at my current college are different.

Do you all have any advice?"

Forgive me for sounding naive, but are they going to cut off a chunk of my hair?! 

I've never used drugs besides alcohol on rare occasions, but unfortunately over Christmas I contracted acanthamoeba keratitis. If you don't want to look it up or watch its episode on Monsters Inside Me, it's a rare eye infection caused by a single celled parasite that eats the cornea tissue. It takes months and months to treat and has left me blind in one eye (hopefully temporarily). One of the symptoms, however, is extreme pain for extended periods of time, so I've been prescribed hydrocodone. Is this going to prevent me from getting the job even if it's a prescription? I'm afraid to ask because that will reveal that I'm taking it. Do I just need to make it on ibuprofen? 

The summer is a few months away, but do I need to avoid parties for fear of accidentally ingesting something? All of the positions are many states away so I don't imagine there would be testing well before the internship started. Maybe I could be weaned off by then?

Some more info. I was a nursing major, then worked as a CNA. Fuck that. Then switched to Computer Networking and interned with this certain company for 2 Summers. The first Summer I had no idea what was going on (might as well have been a real life potato everyday I came in). After the next year of school I went back for another internship and got A TON of hands on experience. They sent me out to represent the company to a client and pretty much handle a sizable project on my own. Also, I achieved several decent beginning certs with Palo Alto, Brocade, Citrix, and Nutanix (I was a busy bee that Summer).

Now I'm finishing up my last semester and getting ready to graduate with my bachelors. Upon thinking about applying to the company (in which they show great interest in me) I struggle with the possibility of if they low-ball my salary, what will I do? I love the work environment, my boss, and other employees -- but money is definitely a motivation of mine. 

What would you do in my situation if they end up low-balling me?"

So I am in a situation where I would like to intern however I only have 6 months of study under my belt from a CS degree here in Australia.

I would like to start interning however I feel that I may be viewed as too green?  I am doing a bachelor in computer science but due to having a degree before I only have core content to complete meaning I only need study 2 years full time.

Beyond studying I have little to no programming experience mostly due to not being sure what to do a personal project in.  This is again due to unsure how to approach the issue since I have only studied for 6 months.

Any advice on how you guys approached internships would be greatly appreciated."

I'm currently a 3rd year at one of the better universities for my state, 20 years old, getting a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I didn't pick the degree for monetary reasons or because the job security, I just love sitting around and coding things, so there is no question about whether I ""care"" about Computer Science.

I am looking to graduate in Fall 2017 and have literally no real internship or work experience.
My GPA is okay, it's a 3.2 despite bad attendance and me on purposely taking 0's on assignments because ""Hey, I have a 98 right now, what's it gonna do, make me fail?"". I am also a part of my school's ACM, but haven't really organized any events or anything for them. As far as projects go, I had a really big project in my Software Engineering class that I was a part of a team for that ended up being the best in class, where I implemented part of the front-end UI for iOS and some unit tests for the backend in Python. 

Upon me having an ""Oh shit, I've done nothing for 3 years"" moment, I went to my school's engineering day and applied for internships, only to be told by a few people that they wouldn't consider me even for an internship because my ""extracurriculars were lacking"".

I intend on participating in my school's ""hackathon"" this semester, so hopefully something cool comes out of that and that can pad the resumse.

But that's literally all I can say on my resume outside of shitty food service jobs, languages and environments I'm proficient with. 
What can I do to make myself more desirable? I understand I already fucked myself by not taking school as seriously as I should and skipping my way to a 3.2, I'm working on trying to raise that up. 
I just want to be able to find work after I graduate, I don't want a big fancy job and I'm easy to please. I'd just prefer to not live in a dumpster because I have no real financial safety net once I graduate out of uni.

Thanks for reading reddit.

**TLDR; About to graduate, okay grades, young and fuck all experience, give me advice please.**

Having been told that the chances for freshman landing a summer internship are low, I was wondering is there such a thing as a freshman-friendly company? In other words, are some companies probably easier to land an internship with, etc? If so, how can I spot them out through the list of companies my university released? I know that I should also do what I'm interested in but I've yet to have any experience to actually tell if I dislike/enjoy something so I'm really open to a lot, therefore I just wanted to know which companies might be most receptive to freshmen.

At expo, what are some do/don'ts when talking to recruiters? Or, how do I transition from standing in line to talking to the recruiter to hopefully impressing them enough that they can remember me/offer an interview? I feel like when I went to my university's expo last fall, I didn't have much of a game plan and while nothing wrong happened, I don't think I got much out of my time there so I want to fix that this time around.

To preface, I graduated in December 2016 in Computer Engineering. Some of the stuff I'm about to say/ask will be specific to CE and my situation, but I'll try to keep it more general.

I have been job hunting since graduation. During the last two years, I worked for a professor on some side projects, and he allowed me to continue working for him while I find a job. (This is normally a student role, and it's not possible nor is it career smart to work for him in the long term.)

I am still in the posting resume/interviewing stage, and have one more set-in-stone interview in a few days. This professor that I work for approached me this past week asking if I had considered graduate school, and through our conversation asked if I'd like to be a GA. 

For those who don't know, GAs (or Graduate Assistantships) are masters students who get a masters program mostly/completely covered through some sort of credit allowance and a yearly stipend, in exchange for a certain number of hours spent doing research. In this specific situation, I'd be working for this same professor - as I'm doing now - doing the same sort of work that I do now, as a part-time GA with the possibility of additional funding through grant money. Part-time GA compensation would not be enough for me to stay afloat, so I would need to grab a second job or hope that grant money can cover the rest.

An additional bonus of accepting right now would be the ability to start Masters classes that day, as our school waives the GRE for graduates of this school. Even though class has gone on for a few weeks, I could enroll that day and take advantage of the more-interesting classes that are being offered this semester.

I honestly don't know what to do. On one hand, I could get a masters degree partially/completely paid, and I become a more-desirable candidate for job searching. On the other hand, I would forfeit the opportunity to join industry now and delay the start of my career. Masters was maybe part of the plan in the future, but it seems like everything got expedited and it blindsided me. I don't necessarily need to be propped up by a Masters degree, as I have about two years of experience across two internships as a fresh graduate.

So, in general terms, I'm looking for either advice on what you'd do/what I should do, or hear from people who have been caught between GA vs job and what they chose.

TL;DR: GA or entry job?"

I have recently become very interested in the security side of IT but have no real experience, I'm just now setting up a lab at home to learn Sys/Net Admin skills.

My grades will be good enough that I will have two options for a masters degree one from a lesser prestige uni, AUT, and one from my current, AU. I don't really care about prestige but employer might.

AUT is really security focused and requires me to either write a thesis or do an applied research project. AU is much more of a general IT skills course however I can choose papers that allow it to be mostly focused on security and IT project management/design.

 The AU degree also has a compulsory internship with ""Industry partners"" which I assume means they will make it fairly easy to get an internship. This could be valuable as I live in New Zealand and there aren't that many internships/entry level jobs requiring no experience.

If I was to do a masters degree it would be out of these two as I do not want to be in uni forever. What degree do you think I should go for? Any advice related to getting into IT security more so on the defensive side or a govt job would be greatly appreciated.

AU degree: Masters of Information Technology

AUT degree: Master of Information Security and Digital Forensics

So I decided to take an ""Internship"" with a certain amusement park for the next few months. Even though technically it's not counted as an internship even though that's how it was portrayed through my school. But I still decided to keep the job. I don't mind working and it's nice to have cash in my pockets to pay for things I want and just to save up. The issue I'm having is with the immediate expectations they are having. 
So my job is as an HR representative. At first I enjoyed it, it was simple, the days were quick and it was only paperwork standing between me and punching out. But because HR needs to set an example for every other department in this amusement park, we have to follow the rules to a T. Again, I don't mind it makes sense, which means, no phones out during work, name tags at all times and being diligent with your work. Again I can do that. If I feel I'm trained properly.
I am currently part time and am on the learning grade pay rate, which means for the first 100 hours, I get paid 0.50 cents less than I normally would if I were done with training. I'm only at around 65 - 70 hours or so. So I have a few more shifts before I get there. 
But my supervisors just compare me to the full time employees, especially the new ones who are done with the learning rate training and moved on. So whenever I come in and ask about a file or what is the best course of action after I've been gone a week for school, I feel it makes sense for me to forget a few things. Maybe I'm in the wrong though. 
Moving on, it feels like the supervisors are guilting me into more hours when I know my sheet says a maximum of 20 hours so I don't overwork my self with my studies. But my schedules are pushing close to 30 for the next few weeks. Honestly, that's just infuriating to me considering I have paperwork for this. When I brought it up, they said they don't really read those for work, so I would need to enter it online on the website. 
On top of this, most of my co-workers are middle aged while all of the college kids around my age are gone for the spring for their classes and don't start until summer. So I was thinking of asking for basic training so I can focus on the most important aspects of the job, while keeping my hours in a good place to allow me to focus on my classes and job. But after a previous conversation, it sound like if I were to ask for less hours, I could lose my job. Even though I promised them full time during spring break and the summer. 
Which brings me to today. Overall, today was just terrible. I skipped breakfast, I was almost late, and forgot my name-tag (big no no). I didn't notice until an hour before lunch when one of the supervisors asked where it was. It wasn't there so I had to use a back up and ended up using my lunch break to go pick up the original. I came back, an lo and behold I couldn't remember the password to my computer. So I asked if one of the supervisors might be able to access them. I was told none of them can and we have to wait for a certain tech department on Monday to unlock me. So now I'm locked out and starving. All while having to deal with people I can't process without a computer so I have to send them to my supervisor. Now I not only look lazy, I look inept at the job. But (and I refuse to take the blame for this), my supervisor still decided to keep me at the front desk to help process people. Why? I honestly don't know. I can't help, so why not send me back to do paperwork. Of course that doesn't happen until the last hour when were swamped and I can't do a damn thing. And here's the cherry. As the day was ending, I started looking for the shredding room, a location I was never shown yet, but couldn't find it. So I asked. I found it. I shredded.
End of the day comes, and my supervisor wants to talk to me. He say ""You're not in trouble."" Obviously I am if you pulled me away from everyone. He starts to bring up my day and how as HR we should never forget our name tags and our passwords. I will accept that, I made a mistake and messed up my training day. He then goes on to tell me it seems I haven't been putting in effort the last few days or today as well or that I can't find certain areas like the shredder room. Confused, I say that no one ever showed me the room, and that this is only day I've had issues with my password or name-tag. On top of that, I'm early to all of my shifts, my meals are never late, my paperwork is solid, I have never complaint at work and I still only have 65 hours worth of training in  3 weeks times. 80 after a month I think. So shouldn't it make sense for me to mess up a bit considering every coworker I work with is middle aged and full time. For them, HR is all they do, while I need it just pay for a few things. 
Honestly, maybe I am in the wrong and just wanted to rant. It's just that working at a place that seems simple but then feels like people are expecting you to fail in the matter of 8 hours is kind of demoralizing. But some advice or ideas on what my next course of action for this job so it lasts through my 4th semester and maybe then some would be greatly appreciated.  "

I've constantly been told to try and look for internships during the summer but to be honest I feel like I'm not really good enough to get through the interviews, but I'll give it a shot. I'm trying to get into Lockheed Martin this summer so if anyone that has been there before how deep do the interview questions get? What resources did you use to practice your coding? I'm currently in CS2 if that helps...so I'm familiar with some of the basic data structures from CS1 and the few sorting algorithms taught there, but I'm not sure what else I need to know. This is all assuming I can even get the interview(s), haha. Thank you for any help."

I took a lot of courses over the Summer at my community college as well as maxing out my credits each quarter. A big reason I'd like to graduate early is to save my parents money. They're paying for all my schooling and while they're willing to pay for all 4 years, they work really hard to send me to college (I'm the only person in my family that has gone to college), and the 35k saved would definitely take a load off their shoulders.

But at the same time, that means I have to make this Summer really count with an internship. I've already been rejected by 3 of the big 4, while I have a referral from Amazon and I'm waiting on  their response. I'm currently interviewing with a few other companies. My only experience on my resume is an IT internship for a big networking company that I've had throughout my freshman year, and a ""Software Engineer Internship"" at a local startup which pretty much was a ""get me coffee"" internship, but I guess I get the title. 

I'd really like to graduate early but if I don't get an internship this Summer, that means I'm going to be set back compared to the new grads that have 2 or even 3 SWE internships under their belt. 

I'm not sure what to do, other than if I get an Amazon internship I'll for sure graduate in 3 years.

Edit: I'd like to add that I'm looking at this purely from a practical point of view. That is, I'm not factoring in my ""missing out"" on college experience/friends at all. To be honest, I don't particularly enjoy being at this university, nor the people here, which is also a reason I load myself with course work to occupy my time. "

I recently heard from a few friends (UK and US-based) about this subreddit and how it helped them for their internships and such, and upon reading a lot of them, I think you guys here are really awesome. I was not able to put together a lot of things (my incompetence I suppose), so I decided to ask my doubts here. 

I'm a Junior doing Computer Engineering at American University of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates with a cgpa of 3.45, and so far all I know is a fair amount of C++, some assembly, some C associated with micro controllers, and CCNA networking academy course material. I had switched majors right before Sophomore year (From Interior Design), so I was not very much into this field for a years before this. In High School I loved computers, but my procrastination and lack of drive didn't get me any useful skills. I'm doing stuff in my free time, but I'm not sure what I should focus on to get Internships during this summer. I'm interested in Microsoft, then again any company really at this point because I want to know things but I couldn't find many opportunities in my region, mostly because I think I dont know where to look. 

That's all really, I'm not sure what I should be doing, I feel lost, but I'm willing to learn and apply myself now. I hope I'm not late to the party and look forward to taking any advice from you guys. Thanks!"

Sorry if it is the wrong sub!

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to explore whether an opportunity might exist to join the internships program at the University of [Name University], England. The implied program would be the eight months’ internship starting in September 2017 until April 2018. My ambition to apply for the IT Network progamm is driven by the increasing importance of digital technology in a hyper-connected world. I strongly believe when given the opportunity to join the intense program the university offers, I will be able to gain an extensive knowledge base in the IT-field and enhance my English which is needed in this globalized world where borders are fading by technological advancements.

I am [My Name], I am in my final year of my studies Media Technology at the Grafisch Lyceum Rotterdam, in The Netherlands.  During my studies I have had the pleasure to gain knowledge in the area of IT networking, IT security, server management, documentation and communication. These fields have been subjected to a lot of changes over the past years, which have given me the ability to tune very quickly into new challenges and adapt quickly to new surroundings and situations. I feel comfortable working both within a team environment as on individually basis. My focus is an international environment with several IT related projects. The program offered via this internship gives a perfect opportunity to gain hands-on knowledge in addition to the theoretical knowledge I will be gaining and already obtained during my studies. 

My ambition is to work in an environment that fuses together different perspectives to develop integrated solutions. Hence, the program the University of [Name University] offers would help me obtain various methods and creative techniques to better the IT-field. Finally, and maybe most importantly, I can see myself delivering significant value and results because of my commitment to achieve both personal as professional improvements which I will be doing with great perseverance 

Currently, the requirements for a successful completion of my internship would imply that I have to work every workday (Monday until Friday) and I would be needing a suitable working place at the University with a supervisor.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the possibility of entering the Internship program and look forward to hearing from you. Attached you will find my Curriculum Vitae for your viewing.

I'm in my first year of community college.  Im majoring in Computer Science and im taking calculus,  english, Chemistry,  and a c++ class for this semester. So I don't have any experience with making games. I mean im in the middle of making a minecraft clone right now off a YouTube tutorial. But other than that, I have nothing to show for. 

So here are my questions:

Will my lack of experience prevent me from getting an internship? 

Should I email companies/apply for internships that are out of my state? I'm in Chicago so there arent that many game developers here.  If I were to get an internship out of state,  would I have to pay for my own rent and food? 

Lastly,  if I have no games to show and little programming experience, how do I convince companies to take me on as an intern? 

Any advice would be great."

While many of the faculty received doctorates from very prestigious schools, few of them have ever held a job as a day-to-day programmer or data scientist and have spent their entire adult lives in academia. 

I am now a junior and I feel like I'm doing all the right things. I have a good internship, I do side projects, but I often feel I am incapable of talking to my professors in any meaningful way. I feel this is somewhat related to the fact that I am an older student coming back for a degree and approach the topic more as a tradesman then an academic. 

Whenever I ask about the practical application of an algorithm/data structure/(CS Topic), I am often greeted with a blank look or told that self-research would be better suited to finding this out. (To be clear, I generally ask this after the end of class in an attempt not to derail the discussion or plan for the class.)

These people are highly educated, but I feel there is some sort of knack to understanding and communicating with them that I do not have. Does anyone have any tips or advice for communicating with highly educated academics?"

I am also versed in Python, Java and Ruby, and working on my skills in C++. I hope to land another internship this coming summer, and I also have a couple of projects as well as coursework on my Github. I am also relatively well versed in personal computer hardware as I have built many PCs and done basic repairs.

I am thinking I may try to work in the US for a few years after school to save money and try to pay off by student debt a bit before attempting to move. My aim would be to bring over $10,000 USD with me into Canada, bare minimum.

I am a native English speaker, but speak no other language fluently, only beginner-level Spanish. I know I would most likely have to learn French, especially if I end up in Quebec. This would ideally be a permanent move.

I'm an undergraduate computer science student and I'm attending my first job fair this upcoming month in hopes to get an internship. At first I was really excited seeing all the companies that will be attending the job fair until the shock hit me; I don't have a resume!

If you search my post history you'll see I've been in retail management for the same company for 3 1/2 years now well I attend college. I do have my associates degree from the local community college (my GPA was only a 2.9 I believe) which seems to have put me ahead of my class a little bit at my new college. None if this really helps me stand out on my resume though! I have zero professional programming experience and figured an internship was the point in starting that experience!

I can't help but worry I'll be overlooked by anyone and everyone around me! This is my first semester learning things like git and working with external APIs in a school environment. I have done some silly side projects myself but nothing to write on a resume! 

Well typing this is figured I should put some of my programming knowledge so here it goes. I've worked in c++ for both years in community college so I have a strong grasp on that, I learned MIPS Assembly using the Mars simulator in community college for our hardware class. I learned java in high school though AP computer science and am using it now with git in our large scale programming class. 

Am I overthinking this? Is there any specifics I should study or something? I'm just incredibly nervous..."

What would be the best country to aim for in the areas mentioned in the title for truly immersing oneself in learning a new language and culture, but without significantly diminishing one's career? Are there countries, or areas of countries, I should avoid looking into in the first place because of potential tension (even if unwarranted) between natives and immigrants (including legal)? Should I seriously consider taking a small trip to a country or two in Europe or Asia before really even making serious efforts to consider moving, let alone plan?**

A bit of **academic and work background**:

* current undergraduate student nearing his final year of college in electrical engineering and computer engineering. 
* My primary concentration is in embedded systems design/IC design in particular. I go to a pretty awesome state school in Raleigh, NC that, fortunately, has a decent study abroad program. Unfortunately, I have never participated in it and it's arguably too late for me to participate in it (the program is mostly designed for rising sophomores and juniors). 
* I've only worked an internship in my field of study at a well-known electronics company that calls the RTP area its home.

A bit of **personal background**: 

* Naturalized U.S. citizen (along with the rest of my immediate family). 

* First-generation immigrant, I believe, having originally been born in India and also a holder of OCI (Overseas Citizenship of India) due to India not allowing dual citizenship constitutionally.
* Fully fluent in English (my ""first"" language) with working proficiency in French, Telugu, and Hindi. 
* Also, a pretty hard worker, but there's probably plenty of folks like that.


It should be noted that, given certain mentions in my personal background such as the OCI or some fluency in French, I do not necessarily want to go to France, French-speaking Belgium, etc. Also, I do not really need advice on going to India or potentially settling down in India as I have plans already to at least revisit the country once in awhile to catch up with my grandparents. 


**My objective?** It seems simple in my mind, but maybe it's far from simple in reality. Go to a country where I can find a job suitable to my skillset, or perhaps has a university with streams of study suitable to expanding my skillset, and truly immerse myself in the language and culture of that country.


**Why?** I love learning languages, or at least the idea of learning languages, and probably need a change of environment after living in the same part of the continental U.S. for the past decade or so. Even better if I can expand my career as a result of moving, though from what I understand that's unlikely (I don't mind as long as I can maintain my career at the least). 

**Budget?** I have approximately $7K in savings and could easily increase that to at least $10K or more within the next year. Also, I would be very surprised if my parents would not be willing to help me financially (temporarily).

**Specific countries?** Denmark (I have a pen pal here who I hope to speak to soon for some advice), France, Germany (two good friends here who previously attended the same university as me but returned home), the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland (If I were to be honest, I don't even have a single friend on the Internet from here compared to the aforementioned countries), Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Nepal (probably very, very hard to find something relevant to my skillset here), and Thailand. 

**So, any advice?** 


If I were to be honest, I haven't done much investigation into actual visa policies (outside tourist visas) or whether it would be better to seek a job at an international company with some operations in the U.S. and then request a transfer. I should also repeat that the study abroad program my university provides is really not tailored for me at this point, and arguably would hinder my four year graduation or be useless towards academic progress if I were to do it after I graduate (I also don't think I would be eligible at that point).


Thanks for any help or nudges towards resources.

EDIT: Reformatted a bit. Also, **please** note that my reasons for wanting to move have little to nothing to do with the now past U.S. Presidential Election, escaping debt, or anything of that sort. I have a plan figured out already to pay off the relatively small student loans I will have after graduating, on the latter note. I simply want a much different change in environment, particularly one that I could immerse myself in to learn a language."

You have been warned. If you do decide to read, I am grateful for your time.

**Background**

Hey guys, I am a junior student at a pretty big university who just switched major into Computer Science. I am currently in my second semester of CS, taking discrete math, intro to programming 2 with C++, (I took Java last semester) and two not important classes that still require a sizable chunk of my time. 

Switching into CS was the best decision I've ever made. I love the community, the impact, the projects, pretty much everything, but I am not satisfied with my learning. Discrete math is the only class that I genuinely enjoy. The programming class has fun projects, but is completely self-taught as the professor is almost universally regarded as useless by pretty much every CS student here. Other two classes won't contribute much to my future career, but I will have do them anyway.

**Problem**

I was rejected by many internships I applied to due to my lack of algorithm knowledge/course work, and I don't feel that the courses I am taking is doing much to contribute to my future as a software engineer (that's my plan, for now). I am simply not satisfied with the pace and diversity of learning, and my lack of portfolio. 

In summary, I am looking to learn more languages/skills that can help me build up my portfolio. Things like Git, building my own website, PHP, etc. Only thing is that I hope I can still complete/learn them on top of being a full time college student. Don't worry, I will take care of myself as to not neglect my social life and health as many have done before me.

**Possible Solution??**

I have heard of things like the Odin Project for Web Development, and it looks promising. I want to know of more resources that this sub universally love, and the steps I should take to prevent my formal education from holding back my life long education."

However, I just recently had a meeting with my boss and was told that LEGALLY they could not promote me because of my internship contract. I would have to continue earning my intern wages until that contract ran out but I could start working in the new position before that, just not a pay raise. I was then told that I could get the raise sooner, if I had an outside offer from another company looking to hire me, they would then push through the paperwork for my promotion. 

Is this something they can do? I have two interviews lined up for prospective jobs, but I don't know if I should take this as an insult and take something else if offered or if this is just standard practice. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"

I am not sure if this is the appropriate sub, and if it is not kindly nudge me to another. It'll be a long post.

&amp;nbsp;

I am struggling with issues on what to do with my life. A little background about me:

I graduated in 2015 with two Bachelor of Science degrees. One in Microbiology, the other in Clinical Laboratory Science (CLS). My cumulative GPA is 3.77. I absolutely hated being in school though and was excited to start working. I obtained my MLS(ASCP)CM certificate 2 weeks after graduating so I may continue working at the hospital I did my internship at as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist. The main hospital in our health system had one or two openings which my class mates quickly got before me. However, our smaller hospitals had many openings but they were all night shifts. I decided I would be a generalist at one of our smaller hospitals and took the night shift.

I worked night shift from June of 2015 to August 2016 and hated every second of it. The night shifts were 11 hours, from 2000 to 0700 (8pm to 7am). I would work 5 consecutive nights and have 3 days off unless someone called in or would need help. Majority of the time, I ended up working about 6 or 7 nights straight because we only had 2 dedicated nightshifters (including myself). During this year, I had about 2-3 hours of sleep a day as I never adjusted to the night shift. When I started out, I just repeated to myself that it is temporary. Once September came, I decided I needed to find a different shift to work and would approach my supervisor who arrives at 7 in the morning. I asked her if there is any way possible I can be moved to a days position as my physical and mental health is being affected by the lack of sleep and no contact with the girlfriend or friends. She understood my concerns, but said that people who work nights typically don't become adjusted until the 6 month mark and to give it sometime.

&amp;nbsp;

I decided to trudge on to December to see if she's right. During those following months, I lost contact with friends, missed weddings as I could not ask for time off due to how short staffed we were, and was actually called in early multiple times due to evenings needing help with the work load. While helping with the evenings shift, I asked coworkers what the shift was like and they did not provide any positive feedback.

When December came, I asked again if there is any way I can be moved to a day shift as it has been 7 months and I am breaking down. She replied that there are evening shifts available, but if I switch to evenings I will still have to cover night shifts. I already knew this from talking with the evening CLSs and having to work with a different partner every night shift. I declined and asked if I may be transferred to another hospital within our health system so I may move to days as I simply cannot keep doing nights, nor a mix of nights and evenings. At this point, she said she'll be right back and excused herself from the room. After awhile, she returned with my manager and some papers I signed. At this point, it is 8:00am or so and they were going over the documents saying that I signed them under the condition that I can perform the functions necessary of the duties of a Clinical Laboratory Scientist at our hospital. If I am admitting that I am unable to perform to keep performing the responsibilities assigned then I will be terminated and will no longer be able to seek a position within our health system. As I tried to process what was being said, the supervisor followed up with that a days position will be opening in February since someone is retiring and it'll be filled and she will let me know when I can apply. When I heard that a days position will be open, I agreed I can stay until February.

From December to February, I applied to every CLS position I could find in the area that didn't call for night shifts. I never had a response back, despite emailing my updated resume to my alma mater's career services to have them look over. I was getting desperate and kept applying to other places, but ultimately started to get into computer science. I liked jailbreaking my iPod in highschool, and flashing tomato on my linksys router to control QoS for our 1.5Mbps DSL that I had as a kid. I liked building my own computers for me and my family and friends. I know tinkering with devices and computers and all of what I mentioned is not the same as computer science, but I wanted to pursue CS. I liked math and solving problems. I began to frequent [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/) more as I started liking medical laboratory science less and less. I felt betrayed as I couldn't find anything other than night shifts in my area. I was unwilling to move to another city or state as my friends and family are important to me.

&amp;nbsp;

I kept trudging along, 11 hours each night, getting 3 hours of sleep. Typically working 55 or 66 hours a week. For the holiday, I made the effort to visit family with the girlfriend in January and was told that I look horrible and that I couldn't remember anything that was being said in conversation. I wasn't fun to be around...

February came around, and the CLS that was retiring decided to stay. I kept up with the job until August of 2016, while teaching myself Python and a little of discrete structures in the spare time that I had. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember a lot of what I was learning, but I knew I enjoyed the material more than I did the laboratory work. I always liked math, and I liked programming and building things. I never created anything super fantastic, but I made little CLI games and made little programs that cleaned up my desktop and others to introduce object oriented programming. I really enjoyed it, and felt like I was doing something more important than popping green and red top tubes to load onto the VITROS. 

I kept applying to jobs that were opening as a CLS, but never heard from any of the places. I kept in contact with the alma mater career services explaining my situation and asked if there was anything I can improve on my resume and job applications. They said to just keep applying.

&amp;nbsp;

In late April, I gave up. I was tired of working 66 hour nights, and all I wanted was a day shift. I started thinking how the best job I ever had was as a garbage man, working 12 hour days for a semester to save up money to return to school for the Microbiology and CLS degrees. (I continued doing that job for the remainder of college as I loved it. The boss and I got along great). I would love to be a garbage man back home over working in a lab, shoveling tubes through instruments and being yelled at by nurses over things like me cancelling UCGs on male patients in the ER. I decided I'm leaving this field for something else and in May 2016 I enrolled in a nearby college to try to get a Master's of Science in Computer Science. I told my girlfriend, family, and friends this and was met with overwhelming support in my decision.

&amp;nbsp;

July 2016 arrived and I approached my supervisor at the end of my shift to hand in my resignation letter. I provided 4 weeks notice, telling her I will stay until August 12 as class started August 22. I knew that there was no possible way to fill my position in 4 weeks, let alone 2. (As a matter of fact, they still have 3 night shift positions). My supervisor just mentioned that if that's what I want to do then she can't stop me. She thanked me for the work that I did and if I decided to change my mind I can come back to work nights.

Because I worked 66 hours a week in a year, I built a nestegg of $26,000 while also lowering my current student loans down to $27,000 from $33,000. At that point in August, I could practically pay off my student loans, but I wanted to keep the large amount of money I had to pay towards school. I knew I wasn't going to get an internship for CS right away and will be needing money to live off. My bills are only $500 a month as I spend time on the computer or utilize the city libraries for renting books, movies, and music. I hangout with friends attending free events, or have board game nights, or we go cycling. I never was much of a big spender on things.

On August 22, 2016 I started my first day of classes. I have to get the deficiency courses out of the way before proper enrollment for the Masters of course. At the end of the first week, I felt like I have made the biggest mistake of my life. I still feel that way, in fact. I feel like a failure for returning to school, for not being able to stick out nightshifts. I feel like I am whining over something as trivial as having to work nights, and that I decided to return to school to escape the real world. My girlfriend suggested that I make an appointment with counseling services at the school to discuss with someone how I'm feeling. The sessions didn't really help me and I stopped going. I know it's not their job to tell me what to do, but all we did was talk about how nightshifts were bad and it's good I'm not doing it anymore. I just told the counselor that I feel better now as I didn't want to hurt their feelings. I made an appointment for another session next week to talk about how I'm feeling, but I'm not too optimistic as it'll be a rehash of what we talked about the last 7 times.

My work in class is going fine. My first semester I completed all my courses with A's, including Calculus II despite not having done Calculus I in 5 years. I just don't like going to class and sitting. So far in this current semester everything is going along fine as well school wise. 

&amp;nbsp;

I love that I am spending time with my girlfriend, with my family, and with my friends. I can recall conversations I have had with people. I have been able to do activities with them. I feel like I have never had this much energy before! No more stomach pain, no more weird numbness in my extremities, and I have a proper diet now! That week off before classes started was great. I hadn't had a day off in that whole year working nights and I about cried at the opportunity to be able to see loved ones after not really seeing them for a year.

I just really hate myself now as I don't like being in school. I feel like a failure for not being part of the work force now. I just want a day shift job, but that isn't possible as a CLS in my area. I'd be happy working 60 hours a week as long as they are during the day. I absolutely hate the laboratory work though, but at least I was working and was being paid. I want to drop out of school and find a job in something as I don't feel like I'm really appreciating the opportunity I gave myself.

&amp;nbsp;

TLDR;
I was working nightshifts for a year. Didn't like being a clinical laboratory scientist. Decided to pursue computer science. Don't like being in school for computer science. Just want to work a day shift job and not hate myself anymore."

I'm a soon to be college graduate from a top public university in the U.S. I'm looking for a career in finance (although I'm pretty open to anything else that relates to my Economics major). I'm very proud of the fact that I will be graduating after only 3 years this May with a pretty decent 3.4 GPA, but while I've had recruiters congratulate me too, it seems that many of the companies I've applied for positions with 
a) only have internships available to juniors (and although I am technically one, they stress that they are looking for individuals who have one more year of schooling to go) and
b) only have full-time positions available to those with min 3 years experience

Recently, I had an exciting interview opportunity and basically got shut down in the first minute by the recruiter *because* of the fact that I'm graduating early (He even said he would be happy to talk again if I decide to take another year of school). If anybody has gone through a similar experience or has advice regarding the matter, I would really appreciate it.

I enjoy biology (especially microbiology and molecular biology), and understand that coding can be extremely valuable in such a scientific setting, but I'm not biology is something I'd like to do for a living. Unfortunately, I know exactly one language; I taught myself Java at age 11 from reading decompiled game code and Googling things I wasn't able to figure out on my own. I'd prefer not to stick with Java; my brief affairs with C# have been wonderful and I'm keen to learn other things.

I have an AAS in Information Systems Security, which I suppose is better than nothing, and I would be happy to work on that side of things as well if anyone knows a good place to start there.

**Things I'd like to know:**

* Languages, frameworks and libraries to learn. What should I focus on? C#/.NET undoubtedly due to its ubiquity, but what else would be good to learn? SQL and relevant libraries? HTML5/CSS? I'm happy doing pretty much anything except games, can't afford to be too picky about this right now anyway.

* Building a portfolio. Should I just reinvent the wheel and put sample projects up on Gitlab or similar simply to demonstrate that I have the ability to code? Are there any good open-source projects I could look into contributing to?

* Internships - any places I should look besides government? I don't think I'm going to get this one with the DHS, but other government internships seem to accept only an AAS with no experience, which gives me some hope. Are there any other types places that look good on future resumes?

I'm (hopefully) heading to university this fall where I'll be majoring in CS and preferably attending job fairs and such to network, but I've still got zero experience with anything at the moment and would like to know what I can do on my own.

Anything that integrates CS/cybersecurity or networks in general would be neat as well.

I just don't find what we do interesting though... I can't see myself doing it as a career

Next year I'll be transferring colleges due to fucking up my GPA a lot in previous years, and my choices are really Information Technologies or Computer Science.

I just feel...lost though. I'm not sure at all if this is what I want to do, I was thinking of transferring to the IT department and seeing if I would like it there. I find the incorporation of technology and business far more interesting than just creating the applications themselves.

I was just wondering what career paths would be available for someone looking to go into IT Development, or anything about IT really?

I am in my 4th year of my undergraduate degree in Computing Science and am currently set to graduate within a 4 year time span (from entering post-secondary immediately out of high school). Currently, I'm extremely worried about my chances of acquiring a professional job and kickstarting my career, perhaps because of external factors such as my peers who are in the co-op (internship) program at my school. Going into school, I contemplated internships but was reluctant due to the fee required plus the delay on my graduation -- my plan was (and is) to complete school in 4 years, and I have worked years-long (fall, winter, and summer semesters) consecutively in order to do this, while looking after my family &amp; working a part-time job (20+ hours weekly).

On the note of my part-time, I have unrelated experience at a job I have had since 17 (coming up on 5 years there). I do some very minor software tasks to manage systems, but primarily act as a shift supervisor; my job is to ensure that tasks are being fulfilled and customers are satisfied.

I feel a heavy burden on my shoulders that because I haven't 'networked' or had relevant job experience,  and therefore that my chances of getting into an organization and making real impacts is weaker than my fellow peers. I pride myself on being a self-starter and quick learner of technology, having stuck to my educational goals,  and always completing programming assignments (and receiving good grades on them) -- and I really am eager to start my career. Virtually all of the opportunities in my area are full-time (of course), and the possibility of a part-time programming gig appearing is highly unlikely.

I have read on this subreddit of people that have been in my situation and managed to make it happen, and for this reason I am hopeful. I have been meticulously browsing job sites to look at the qualifications/desired skill-sets to understand what employers want, and I feel that I have (from an overhead view) what they require. At the current time, having school, part-time work, and looking after my family while also working on my own projects on any spare time that I can gather, I haven't had much time to 'professionalize' myself in terms of an up-to-date resume and portfolio. 

It seems a lot of organizations are currently seeking applicants to start in the summer semester (May 2017) til the end of December 2017 right now. Is it worth working hard to get my resume &amp; portfolio up to date and start looking for an internship ASAP, or should I continue on my current trajectory and finish off the remaining 2 semesters I have to get my degree, and fully commit myself to the working world?

I appreciate all the insights and advice given, and just the general feeling of explaining myself to other individuals who are in my field and may have been in my situation (for better or for worse)."

I haven't had any tech related jobs in the past and don't have much professional experience. I'm in my last semester of community college and will graduate with an AAS in IT and an AAS in Cisco Networking. Currently have my A+ cert, and will be taking my CCNA soon.

So yeah, not exactly down the street. I really REALLY want to get my ass out of retail, and start an entry level help desk job, tech support, networking, or anything tech related. I know I can land a job, if I just tried and applied for stuff, but I'm not sure. Should I stay with the company for a little bit longer until the summer? Or should I just try and find another job right now? Would having an IT internship on my resume open the door to more job opportunities in the future?

It is an application that will use gps to create zones of interest on my university's campus map. Each zone of interest will have a little mini game that should serve as a learning aid to new students. This tool could go hand-in-hand with the university's orientation process.

I hope that by making that process more enjoyable and more 21st century-like, that the university will have higher retention rates.

The games are aimed to help students learn about: 

1. internship opportunities 

2. campus dining 

3. advising 

4. financial aid etc.

So my goal is to create this application that a new student could get on their phone, and during their first year, complete the challenges/games in the quest to become a model student.
So anyways, i'm getting ready to start the implementation process and decided to stop by this subreddit to see if anyone had any recommendations on how to tackle this. Any programs that you would recommend to start programming this.

I have knowledge of C++, Java, a bit of python, SQL
Any help or suggestions would be appreciated

I'm not sure how often freshmen are able to get internships, but I would like to try in order to get valuable work experience and possible future job opportunities.

Problem is, I don't really have much experience in the field as it's only my first year and my classes haven't really delved that deeply into actual engineering topics yet. I've hardly even had any lab experience yet, aside from my AP classes in high school and the lab that I'm currently in right now for BME303L. I'm a quick learner, and I feel that I could actually be helpful in a lab environment even if I'm simply doing grunt work, but it seems like you need experience to get internships and work, but you need internships and work to get experience, so I'm not exactly sure how to go about it. My resume is somewhat lacking in that there really isn't much on there that would stand out to these biomedical companies (in my opinion).

One idea I had was to research Biomedical/Pharma companies that interest me in the Austin area and attempt to contact their higher-ups and invite them out to lunch, and simply talk with them about what they did to get to the point where they are now. Not necessarily in an attempt to actually land an internship with them, just to find out what steps I can take to guide my career in the direction that I want to. Might be a bit -- I don't know -- ambitious?, but I feel like, if they accepted and I made a good impression and seemed interested enough, I could learn valuable information and expand my network and, even if I don't land an internship for this summer, it could be helpful in landing one next year. 

I'm not opposed to pursing research on campus either, but I feel that that goal is even more far fetched considering my lack of experience and the fact that there are many other student's (with more experience) trying to get into the same labs.

What do you guys think? What kind of resources are there on campus that may be able to guide me in the right direction? I'm considering going to ECAC, but I figured I'd make this post first and see what you have to say.

This got pretty long, so I apologize for that, but thanks for reading and I look forward to seeing if there's anyone in the same boat or who may have been in the past that can give me a little bit of advice."

I failed the exam right after NYE and then we've had an overly long 4-week semester-break and two days ago we had to start up again. I have the most intense anxiety and because of that I couldn't bring myself to go yesterday and today I stayed home too.

There's a re-examination later in spring, but I gotta be honest and I've not learned a thing almost. Somehow I managed to get through the first two semesters by leaning on my knowledge with theory but I have zero skills when it comes to practicing it and that's where I failed. I also failed because I am avoidant and I just don't work well with people and they constantly require me to figure out groups myself and time upon time again I have been put into the last possible group because I'm too shy. I had some aquintances but they're way gone now. I'm afraid to show up because people know me now but don't care for me and I just failed and everything feels like a failure.

Fuck it. Nothing works and i feel like this is not worth pursuing. The only reason I hadn't already quit is because I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I can't pay my bills without the supplement and I'm not going back to my parents because... well, things aren't really that good between me and them and I feel incredibly alone.

I've tried to think rationally the entire day but I can't. I've thought about going to the student counseling tomorrow but every time I think about it I get anxious and start sweating, and honestly I can't decide what I want to do. They expect us to be finding internship for summer which has a deadline soon and with my failed exam everything feels like it's collapsing, and without anyone I care about or vice versa but only people I'm scared of, I just don't wanna be here anymore.

Worst thing is my family. Everyone at home and my sister haven't been doing well themselves lately. I think they're all depressed or something and I feel too much pressure doing this, which I was never sure of in the first place.

The maths aspect in my course is minimal compared to the maths top-tier students seem to be covering.

I missed the train to go to top-tier university. **1) Suppose my algorithmic knowledge is on par with these top-tier students but my CS program isn't that great, does it mean these top-tier grads will do different work compared to me for say internship or normal career? Surely there must be something that gives edge to these students due to their tougher course?**

I feel really demoralised thinking about this stuff. I am wary that one advantage is of being surrounded by like minded peers; in my university, hardly anyone's interested in the CS stuff I am interested in - most people from my uni end up going into consulting or IT. I don't want that! **2) Any tips for me? Does going to top-tier universities automatically mean that those students will get very decent internship offers?**

I feel very confused! I have too many questions...

Questions in addition to the ones above in bold (feel free to answer to as many or as little as you like):

* **3) When meeting recruiters at Hackathons at these top-tier uni's, how should I start conversation with recruiters? It sounds kinda odd to go up to them and start randomly babbling on about how much I love algorithms, problem solving side project, etc... or is it?**

* **4) Careers fair in my place sucks! Do I really need to have a referral in order to have even the slightest chance to land an internship at the Big 4 companies because online application probably already get lost or filtered out by university?**

* **5) Also I am a UK student, and I would prefer to have internship in the US at a decent company as software intern in my sophomore year. I would like to be able to shift to US after my 3 year BSc program... any tips or things I should be looking out for?**

* **6) I have also heard that the first job is very important. Any advice for mid-tier students to get a really good paying job similar to top-tier students?**

* **7) What knowledge from CS program is required for internships at the big 4 that mid tier CS programs don't cover but top-tier ones do?**

PS: Perhaps my questions are very biased, however, for a long time I have been feeling like I am cut-off from reality and that there seems to be a barrier between top-tier students and the rest of us.

Nothing about their daily lives sparks an interest in me, and I could not imagine doing something like that for the rest of my life. Now, I feel a certain sense of agony for being so lost in life. I'm itching to get my life started; I just need a sense of direction.

The things that I look for in a career: 
- Sense of purpose (this is where dentistry fails for me) 
- Values diligence 
- A good living (75k+), but TBH, I wouldn't mind starting from something much lower AND AN EDUCATION/TRAINING PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T INSTILL CRIPPLING DEBT 
- Interaction with people (but not too much interaction) 
- Setting would be in a city or building 
- Adequate vacation time for family, and a work day that still allows time for hobbies 
- Team setting mixed with personal duties

I weighed my options and considered accounting, finance, computer science, and CLS. Any personal anecdotes on your opinion on these careers, or any other career suggestions would also be deeply appreciated."
