1rvbce,1,2013-12-01,I always think about my parents being disappointed in me.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1rvbce/i_always_think_about_my_parents_being/,"I'm 18 and my first quarter of college is coming to an end.  

I've always been very focused on school because my parents put a great deal of emphasis on it, but I've always needed some sort of crutch.

I went to a private high school that my parents were very proud of me for going to (it was their dream that I went there) and I did very well, and I got into a good college (they wanted me to go here very badly, just like my two older sisters).  The only problem is that I've always needed some sort of crutch in my life.

In high school, I drank basically every night.  I rarely got drunk, but usually I got a nice buzz so that way I could go to sleep.  This started my sophomore year and it continued for the rest of my high school career.  Contrary to what you may think, my grades didn't go down at all, and I was still in the top 10% of my class without difficulty.  

Now that I'm in college, my crutch has been transferred to marijuana (my roommates would find it strange if I drank nightly, while daily marijuana use is socially acceptable; also, marijuana is much more accessible than alcohol on a college campus).  

I smoke multiple times per day (3-5), and although I have no physical dependence (I have no trouble ceasing use when I go back home) I still find that it helps immensely in relaxing me enough to do my homework and sleep at night.  I go through about 1/8th an ounce of marijuana a week (which is probably considered heavy usage) which I pay for using my own money (I am currently employed in an internship and I also use the money I made from my internship throughout high school).

I find that I’m generally honest with myself, and I truthfully believe that my marijuana use helps me.  It relaxes me enough that I can talk to people without any difficulty, and this, in turn, has enabled me to make a lot of friends – and, I feel as if I’m generally liked by people now; whereas in high school, I was somewhat of an outcast and I had very few friends and, to be quite honest, people didn’t really know who I was.

I’m much happier now that I’m in college.  I have friends, I managed to get a rewarding internship very quickly in the year, and I find the classes I take to be quite interesting.

My grades have not suffered in college either.  Although I procrastinate (mostly due to hanging out with friends when I should be working), I have still managed to get nothing below an A on every midterm and essay assigned (I still do all my work and study regularly).

However, at the end of every day I think about how disappointed they would be if they saw the way that I live every day.  They both are strongly opposed to marijuana and alcohol use (largely due to my mother’s side of the family being littered with alcoholism and suicide), and, although I personally feel that there is nothing inherently wrong with using either substance, I regard my parents very highly and value their opinions.

My parents always say that they’re proud of me and it makes me feel even worse every time I hear it.  They tried their best while raising me: they always supported me in everything I did, encouraged me, and paid a great deal for both my high school tuition (it was a private school) and my college tuition.

I honestly wish, more than anything, that I was able to function without any crutch.  When I go without marijuana, I can still do my school work perfectly fine, but I’m simply not happy -- I’m too uptight,  have more difficulty operating in a social environment, and, most of all, I have a lot of difficulty sleeping (insomnia is common in my family).

My question to you redditors is do you find my substance use justifiable?

1rv5k5,7,2013-12-01,Advice on PHd Subject Areas within CS,richard248,compsci,https://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/1rv5k5/advice_on_phd_subject_areas_within_cs/,"Hi, I am hoping someone will be able to advise me on my aspiration to do a PHd in computer science. 

I have an undergraduate degree in physics with astrophysics (2.1) and a taught conversion masters in software development (high distinction) from a Russell group university. As for experience, I carried out an internship at a small big-data focused startup, and am currently working for a large multinational company doing software engineering. For research, I carried out a research-orientated masters dissertation working on a distributed parallel computing framework in C++, and have a good relationship with my supervisor and have been told my work may be tweaked and extended into a published report with me as co-author. 

I am looking to start a PHd in computer science in a year or two, and to this end I am currently trying to explore some possibilities and areas with the aim to come up with a good research proposal to apply with.  I understand having no formal CS 'fundamentals' education sets me back against other candidates, which is why I am hoping to develop a strong and worthwhile research proposal (along with self learning the underpinnings of software). However, I am finding it difficult to get an understanding of what areas are in need of work, aside from 'Big data', 'Machine Learning', 'Cloud Computing' etc, high level areas that are hard to know where best to start.

I am interested in continuing with high performance computing, compile-time or runtime parallelism etc, but it seems like any ideas I think of are already extensively well researched. Does anyone have any knowledge of a few more specific topics that i could look further into? It is quite daunting at the moment, so any advice on even sensible methods that I should be using in order to find that niche is much appreciated.

Thanks, I realise that a PHd is very much self-directed, but feel a little lost in the sea of seemingley disconnected research papers at the moment! I am hopeful that there are some PHd students in compsci who have gone through a similar situation. 

Edit: on my phone, and not quite sure of how well formatted this is, my apologies if it's a little hard to read."
1rv3yg,2,2013-12-01,Opportunities in Construction Management,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1rv3yg/opportunities_in_construction_management/,"I am a junior civil engineering student with one internship with a large construction firm. I was in the field for the whole time checking road grade and doing some foreman type duties. Before my internship I also worked with general contractors doing commercial construction and I gained a lot of experience in these jobs.

I am now at a bit of a crossroads where I am trying to figure out if I should continue on the path I am on and pursue more opportunities with big contractors and similar type firms or if I should try to branch out into other areas. It would be pretty easy for me to continue on this path, I have some awesome references and I know the industry well already, but I would like to hear some input on what I can expect when I graduate. 

Can I expect this type of work to remain stable for the next 15+ years, how is the pay compared to design work and such, how does advancement work and what type of work do executives and other ""big shots"" do for these companies? "

[Prolific meth usage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqumi7?context=5)|Me? No. Never touched drugs and don't plan on it. However, a lot of dancers like to use various drugs, including cocaine, crack, meth and molly, when they come to work because it ""gets them in the mood"".
 |Personally, if I want to be in the mood to show my junk, I just have sex before I go to work.
[How long do you see yourself doing this job ? Is it a stepping stone to paying for college or is this something you have always wanted to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqums3?context=5)|Actually, if you had asked me a year ago if I could see myself doing this at all, the answer would have been ""HELL NAW"". However, it is paying the bills and keeping me fit. So, no this isn't something I've always wanted to do, nor do I want to do it longer than necessary - I work with women who are in their fifties and can't keep doing this much longer, but have no real job history so they can't go anywhere with their lives. I don't want to be them.
 |I'm currently studying Forensic Science as a background for my Private Investigator's and Criminal Detective's certification(s), which is my dream job. I will be doing this during the school year because of the flexible schedule, but over the summer I have internships lined up. 
[This is your future.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvt0b?context=5)|I forgot how to detective.
 |I just laughed so hard, I swear I almost cried.
 |Well played, my friend.
[Forensic Science? Criminal Detective? I can totally see your later life made into a TV series.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdquyh2?context=5)|I get that a lot! :)
[Any funny stories while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtl3p?context=5)|Here's a good one: I was working at the Silk Stocking in College Station a few months back and this guy kept staring me down. He wouldn't do anything - even shooed our lovely waitress away -, he just stared. So I go onstage and the guy starts looking at my face (okay, let me just say: when you're practically rubbing your boobs in their face, it's weird for a guy to look at your *face*.) and then promptly gets up and walks outside to the smoking patio. When I get off-stage, I get dressed and turn the charm up to full volume. I go outside, spot him and say, ""Hi there, would you mind if I sit with you?"" to which he responds. ""First, can you tell me if I'm wearing these right?""
 |The poor guy had black pumps (heels) on with regular socks underneath - and had planned on dancing for amateur night. 
[Do you enjoy your job? What made you pick being a stripper rather than being a cashier, waitress, or something? Very curious, because I'm 18 myself and I couldn't even imagine doing something like that. More power to you though! As long as you're happy doing it :\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqup8m?context=5)|I enjoy certain aspects of it, and others I don't - just like any other job.
 |Well... $200+ a night, sitting around talking to people and listening to music for eight hours; or, $200- a week, sitting behind a cash register for eight ours? Easy choice to me. :P Actually, I used to waitress, but the hours were killing me and my schedule was not at all flexible for school, so when I talked to my mom about how well she was doing at her club, I figured I'd give it a shot.
 |**Always have a backup plan**
 |Things could start out slow, then you'd be stuck in a tough space. Always keep a part-time option available. 
[What's your favorite part of the job?  What's your least favorite part of the job?  How are the customers?  Who are the best customers?  Who are the worst?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvm6n?context=5)|My favourite part has got to be being onstage and dancing, doing pole tricks; my leaset favourite part is table dances. The guys always want to grab, grab, grab, touch, touch, touch.
 |The customers vary, person to person, but I have to say that men that tip really well while I'm onstage or ask me to sit with them when I get offstage, and women are the best customers - at least for me; the worst are the ones that sit in their seats, nursing their five dollar beer and just when they're about to leave they come up to me and bitch about how I didn't sit with them. Dude. Really. Get off your ass and spare a dollar, I don't work here for free.
[Do you have a lot of female customers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdsertz?context=5)|I used to, especially when I first started dancing. 
[How much money do you earn off a night of dancing? What's your weirdest experience with a customer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtqiy?context=5)|Typically, anywhere from $50-$500. You never know who's going to walk in that door.
 |My *weirdest* experience? That's a tough one. I had this one guy, when I first started out, ask me to pee in his mouth for $600. My answer was a big ""HELL NO"", and I was so confused. I started out very naive and I had no idea that that was a fetish.
[Yep, that's defiantly weird. $600 though! I can't believe some people would pay that. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtw6z?context=5)|This guy... I'm not gonna lie, he was kinda gross to begin with, that was just the icing on the cake.
[Least and most money you've earned in one night?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqufjb?context=5)|This is embarrassing! The least I've ever walked out with was $6. It was a slow night and there were more dancers than customers. The most I've ever walked out with was roughly $700.
 |And I say ""walked out with"" instead of ""earned"" because most clubs in Texas require a house fee and nightly tip-out; the house fee is what we pay to work, and the tip-out is a certain amount or percentage of your earnings from that night to the DJ, bouncers, managers, bartenders, waitresses or whoever they require be tipped-out. So what I earn and what I keep aren't always the same thing.
[6 Dollars.  Sounds like someone made it hail!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr7v23?context=5)|Also take into account that I paid over forty dollars to the club that night, too.
[As a strip club DJ in another part of the country I have to ask, what are your favorite songs or sets to dance to? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvwbz?context=5)|Ahhh! It usually depends on the crowd, and my mood. Sometimes it's dubstep/skrillex - a favourite being Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"", Mutrix Remix. Normally, though, its Taking Back Sunday, Rob Zombie, 30 Seconds to Mars, Kill Hannah, Fall Out Boy, Def Leopard, Warrant, etc. The mix is energetic, so it catches people's attention.
 |My favourite set of all time is My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark by Fall Out boy, Lips Like Morphine by Kill Hannah, and Makedamnsure by Taking Back Sunday. The mix of genres makes people look twice, from what they've told me. :)
[Def submit some kinda proof. I've a couple questions. One, 18 is young, by any standards. What got you into dancing so young? Does your family know? Not putting you down, but just curious :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtkgt?context=5)|I'm not entirely sure what kind of proof to give you, I could list the places I work, but that would be just as dangerous as giving my real name while at work.
 |And yes, eighteen is really young - I don't make as much money as others because of it, but I turned eighteen in May and was supposed to be attending Texas A&amp;M in the Fall, so I had to pay for it; my mom had been dancing off and on throughout her life - even raised my oldest little brother and I, and put herself through nursing school doing it - so I figured I'd give it a shot.
 |And in case that didn't answer your second question, yes, my family knows and is very supportive. My mom even sends old customers my way. 
[Is that ever awkward, having the knowledge that those customers also know your mom? Also, thanks for your answer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtrak?context=5)|Not really. I mean, I'm a horrible conversationalist, so the more we already have to talk about without me thinking something up, the better.
[How is being 18 a negative?  I would think the ""barely legal"" angle would work as a positive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvuhr?context=5)|Customer: ""Can I buy you a drink?""
 |Me: ""Thank you, I'll take a coke.""
 |Him: ""Don't you want something a little stronger?""
 |Me: ""I'd love that, but I'm eighteen.""
 |Him: ""Oh."" *Awkward silence ensues*
 |Me: ""Oh?""
 |Him: ""I was going to ask for a dance, but the age throws me off. Sorry, you're like my daughter's age.""
[Picsoritdidn'thappen.  But seriously, what is something that you dislike about your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtiia?context=5)|Oh, I could write a book with the things I don't like about it, but it all boils down to one thing: drunk old men. Yeah, talking to them can be fun, but they can go from sweet guy to rapist in 0.02 seconds.
[If you don't like it, why do you still do it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqtmek?context=5)|Because for every little thing I hate about it, there are two things I love about it. I make my own schedule and I don't have to tell **anyone** what it is, I typically make good money, I meet lots of fun people and make lots of connections with people in high places, and I get to lose weight, build muscle *and* dance.
[Have you had any close encounters of the sexual abuse sort? How did it go over?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqty67?context=5)|A couple. The worst being some cocky guy thinking he was above the rules of that particular club and decided that he was going to ""make me his woman one way or another"" and kept trying to fondle me, grope me, and slap me until the bouncers threw him out.
[What do you mean you make your own schedule and you don't have to tell anyone about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdquu01?context=5)|The club I danced at for the very first time (May) is in Dallas, too far from where I moved. However, I walked in the door just a couple weeks ago and no one said a word, despite the fact that they hadn't seen hide nor hair of me for months.
[Wow, I did not know this. Very interesting. Is this totally cool with the managers or is there some sort of unspoken agreement to give them a heads up about schedules, even if you aren't tied to it? If not, how do they know if they will ever have dancers when they need them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqvngl?context=5)|You see, the club I'm working at now is small and we have around two hundred dancers, and they are always hiring because they don't have to pay them. So, they are never left hurting for people to work.
[*they are always hiring because they don't have to pay them.*  Are the dancers working solely off customers' tips and not wages, or am I misreading what you're saying? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqznio?context=5)|No, that's completely accurate. We are tips/commission only. This is why, when you go into a club, girls will *frequently* ask you if you want a dance.
[Do you get paid a wage plus what you get in tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqu4md?context=5)|No, entertainers are private contractors, so we are only paid what the customers pay us. However, there are usually set rates for things like table dances.
[Do your parents/loved ones know you have this job?  What do they have to say about how you make money?  (I'm kinda jealous- I'm recently out of college and have HUGE bills to pay, sounds like you do decently well\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr4sux?context=5)|Actually, my mom was a dancer for twenty years, and she is the one who got me started. My whole family is really supportive because it takes care of me and I enjoy it. :)
[Hey! im also interested in this sort of work. I feel like I'm decent looking enough. I just suck at dancing you have any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdquyjb?context=5)|Don't judge your dancing style. The best thing to do, would be find a guy friend that you have a good relationship with, and ask him to give his opinion on your dancing.
 |Step two, go into a club for Amateur Night - almost every club has one.
 |Step three, find a club that you are comfortable with and get to know some of the girls - be careful who you trust, though - and ask them to teach you a few tricks. You'll learn faster this way.
 |**Always have a backup plan. ALWAYS.**
 |You do NOT want to end up without a fallback. If you need help with anything else, feel free to message me.

[Alright lol. By amatuer night do you mean any one goes up or how does that work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrao7a?context=5)|Usually clubs have one night a week where anyone (of gender for that type of club) can go onstage and do their thing. Usually, there is a cash prize and the amateurs keep all tips earned. 
[Ooooh thats sick then. And how did you apply did you just go to amatuer nights until they picked you up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdraumz?context=5)|I went in for amateur night to see if it was something I could do, then I spoke to the manager about a job. They contracted me immediately. 
[Are you ever attracted to any of the male clients?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqu3sk?context=5)|I'm not gonna lie, I've seen a few really attractive guys come in, but their personalities turn me off almost instantly.
 |To clarify; most of the attractive guys that come in are looking for girlfriends/fuck-buddies and that's what turns me off. (I.e., ""so, what are you doing when you're done here? Want to come to my place?"")
[Tentatively speaking, what are you looking for/wouldn't mind in the personalities of such attractive guys?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqwixq?context=5)|Go ahead and laugh at the innocence of this response,  but... I love it when a guy can make me genuinely laugh and smile until my cheeks hurt, hold an intelligent conversation, and above all, be respectful of me and considerate of their surroundings.
[The laughing part is easily handled but how do you expect to hold an intelligent conversation at a club when you're practically rubbing your boobs in my face? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr4hrr?context=5)|Easy, - and that's the problem I run into a lot - I am just another human being. I have feelings and thoughts, and I bleed red, but some people don't seem to see me that way just because I'm dressed in a sexy outfit. I've had plenty of intelligent conversations at work, it just depends on if the customer is considerate or not.
[By considerate do you mean that most people are just cold and insensitive to you as a human being ? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr5fjf?context=5)|Precisely. People like our friend Chicago here, seem to think that because I show my tits, I am an insensitive and unfeeling creature and not a human being.
[There are more people like him? What assholes.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdr61px?context=5)|As long as there are people growing successful in the world, there will always be people like him.

 |And yes! A guy once proposed to me with a sapphire engagement ring. In front of the whole club. I told him no and he wasn't terribly upset, but he told me to keep the ring because it was a gift.

[He's definitely old enough to get in, but probably not a good tipper. I've met him.

Has a customer ever recognized you during your day-to-day life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqxtfc?context=5)|I already attend Texas A&amp;M University, and that is why I am working this job. As soon as school is done, so is this occupation. 
[What has been your favorite experience while dancing/stripping?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdqv5z6?context=5)|Honestly, meeting my co-workers. I was home-schooled my whole life and I didn't really have the opportunity to make friends, and now I don't exactly have a lot of friends, but I have a few that mean the world to me. I wouldn't be moving forward if I hadn't met them.

[How commom or uncommon is that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rtu1i/iama_eighteen_yearold_exotic_dancer_working_in/cdrhau9?context=5)|It's those girls that make the rest of us look bad.

Its always a hit or miss. Lately I've been walking out with maybe $80 and I haven't been able to work much as its almost end of semester. Also, its the holidays (boo). For other dancers, it depends on the girl. Some make what I make, some make less, and some make way more. I know girls that walk out at the end of the night with almost a thousand when everyone else made a hundred or so. To be honest, it has less to do with dancing experience and more to do with conversational skills.

I mean, it did at first, but I had several people clarify for me and now I understand how it got it's name: It's been sitting in the same place, like a dirty sock, since before I was even born!

My second would be, if you tip a dancer onstage or buy a dance, ask her if it's alright to touch, because some of the girls are too bashful to say anything if it bothers them. Third tip, have fun and enjoy the view! And they also serve mixed drinks at topless clubs, but be warned: nude clubs are BYOB, for the most part.

1rul67,121,2013-12-01,"[Build Complete] David, the Goliath Slayer",beefJeRKy-LB,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1rul67/build_complete_david_the_goliath_slayer/,"Hi everybody. I've been following this sub for the past 6 months or so, planning a build. When i discovered that I'd put my grad school plans on hold, I decided now was the time to use the money I made in my research internship last summer to get a new PC up and running.

Now, I live in Lebanon, and yes parts are expensive, but the bigger issue is more the lack of choice than anything. Cases are limited to older Cooler Master and Thermaltake parts. Motherboards are generally either MSI or Gigabyte, only in ATX. Really hard to find unlocked Intel CPUs and AMD is non-existent. You get the drill. So last time I built a PC (my first time actually), I managed to get a number of parts from Canada and got the rest from here. But this time, I just used Amazon mostly and a package forwarding service Borderlinx. The only exception is my PSU because I didn't want to ship anything that heavy and something local was good enough and my case which a friend added to his own Newegg order (no Paypal = no Newegg or other sites). Even with the relatively high price of shipping and customs on my parts (totaled about $300 for everything), I did save some money. The GTX780 is sold here at $850 equivalent for example.

The name of my PC is something of a recent habit of mine of naming PCs after biblical figures. First off, my previous build is being passed on to my brother temporarily before he builds his own and then will be relegated to the summer house. That PC was Goliath because it used an enormous Thermaltake Armor+ Super tower. It was only fitting to call mine David then.

Without further ado, specs:

Some notes about the build:


* Mini ITX is difficult to build in, but the result is marvelous.
* Core i7 + 16GB of memory because in addition to gaming, I will be doing some photo editing and CUDA programming
* If the Node had bad airflow, a Titan cooler would have made sense, but the Twin Frozr is a pretty good cooler for this one.
* Looked up the power supply and it lacks multi-input voltage (110-220V) and that's why it's not 80 Plus Bronze though it's within spec for efficiency
* The monitor I received about a month ago, and I highly recommend getting your own VESA mount because the flimsy plastic one it comes with is pretty shaky and annoying. Might eventually get another ~19"" 1440x900 IPS monitor to put in portrait
* I almost fucked up my BIOS but the clear CMOS button on the back of the mobo is an awesome tool.
* Couldn't hook up the fans to mobo because some didn't reach so I'm using the case fan controller and it's fine.
* Haven't overclocked yet, but intending to soon.
* Going to throw in a 4TB HDD by next week as well.
* Also wanna get a new keyboard and webcam.

The job listing seems to be a mass recruitment for several disciplines so they do not specify a lot on the skills/requirements or job description. Also I don't have any work experience besides an internship. Thanks in advance.

Letter:

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the &lt;Job Title&gt; position (Job Number &lt; &gt;) which was listed on the &lt;Company&gt; website career opportunities section on the &lt;Date&gt;. &lt;Company Abbreviated&gt; is of particular interest to me due to the opportunity to be involved with a company known for its wide range of businesses, offering world renowned engineering technologies and services. I believe my academic background, skills and experience make me well suited for this opportunity and will allow me to make an immediate and valuable contribution at &lt;Company&gt;.


I have completed both my Master’s and Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the &lt;University&gt;, &lt;City&gt; with high academic achievements (M.Sc. GPA &lt;&gt;/4.0 and B.Sc. GPA &lt;&gt;/4.0). Throughout my academic studies, I was involved in traditional coursework and team-based projects covering Chemical Engineering topics with special focus on the Oil and Gas sector.


I have developed both my group oriented and communication skills thanks to the multicultural and diverse community at the &lt;University&gt;. I have consistently shown strong leadership when I was in charge of several projects. The largest team I was involved with consisted of seven members, including myself, for a project that spanned over one year in which my team was able to score the highest grades among the class. For this project I was responsible to oversee the work of my colleagues, assign work according to their strengths, schedule regular meeting sessions to ensure deadlines were met and to address any issues which came up. Furthermore during my Master’s, I was able to carry out independent research work, learn to operate and maintain different equipment, and collaborate with different research groups on their work.


Based on my knowledge and skills I am enthusiastic about this opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and serious consideration.


Sincerely,

I studied computer science, and most classes involved exercises of some kind (programming, math problems, etc.). After I had completed a problem or taken an exam, it felt very good to have accomplished something.

After my graduation, I'm now doing my PhD and I find difficult to find the same incentives for work. I now need to work fixed hours and have to do more exploratory work - i.e., think more creatively, pursue several potential research directions and decide which are going to be useful. I've also done internships in software engineering, and felt pretty much the same way about work.

How do you motivate yourself for a job that is not based on specific goals and concrete problems to solve?"

However I wish to be an SDE. Since I have a large educational loan to clear and support my family, I have decided to graduate and work. I couldnt get much interviews due to time constraints in searching for the job. The SDET role is an average paying job of ($105k) in the bay area in a reputed company.

1. How does it affect my career as an SDE?
2. When should I change positions and what are the strategies I must pursue.
3. How to prepare for the change?

EDIT:

I have come out here as being as not open minded. But I have to make that correction. I have been an intern at this very same position and I enjoyed it a LOT. It was fun every day once the work started it did challenge me. My team is very cooperative and I got along very well with everyone. In fact every one was happy with my job and asked me to join back (and ofc I know that there was a requirement too). I donot hold any sense of superiority, and infact I am humbled by my mentors who have over a decade of industry experience. My Job is 60% coding with 10%of manual testing and the rest spent in meetings.

I do want to try SDET position and really give it a shot. But how much of it will affect my ability to switch to a SDE/Dev position is my main concern. Whats the sweet spot (1yrs? 2yrs? 4? ). I may be over exaggerating my concerns.

Also How is my base salary level ($105k) comparable for the bay area ? I have no full time experience. However my profile is above average, but not exceptional.

Thanks."

I have two interviews two weeks from now. The first one is at a well-known tech company for a summer internship, and the second one is for a small local tech company for the upcoming spring semester.

I'm wondering if it would come across as rude or obnoxious to mention that I had an interview for a summer internship at this big-name company earlier in the week at my other interview. I would make clear that it's for the summer.

What are your thoughts? How could I approach this? Could anyone play devil's advocate and tell me why this might be a bad idea?

Thanks very much for your thoughts and opinions."

Original Post:
""I've burned out early this semester which sucks because I have 4 exams and 2 projects in the two weeks to study for and I'm rethinking my motives for wanting to major in Computer Science or a different type of engineering because I am just being way too hard on myself (I'm in community college hoping to transfer somewhere besides my local state school so I can't just be content with passing classes with a C).
On one hand the math gets interesting once I've put in the time to understand how everything works, but I don't see any real benefit of making myself take all of these hard classes. I don't even want to be an engineer, I'm just terrified of not having a good job to out of school since I've lived my entire life in low-income family (when you live with money problems for as long as I have, soon its the only thing you can think about when it comes to something like this)
I started the CS major because I really liked The Social Network and bought into the glamor of the tech internet startup space but there have been many times this semester where I have been miserable playing catch up with the rest of the class. I do have fun programming sometimes, but it's so hard to get started because of the whole ADHD/procrastination thing and it's not really something I dedicate a lot of time to get better with on my own
If I had to pick a major for fun it would probably be industrial design with a minor in accounting (or vice versa) since those are skills that would help me pursue my interests (starting a business, designing products and user interfaces, etc. etc.), but I also am too proud to think that I don't have what it takes to be an engineering/CS student. I've always been a visual person anyways (been drawing since I was a youngin) but to me there's no point going to college if I'm not going to be a doctor or engineer
This may not be ADHD-relevant per se but I've seen some horror stories posted on here about people who are in college for six years not close to graduating and switched their major X amount of times- or dropping out altogether -and I just don't want to be in that position""


my response was:
I am studying Product design, which is essentially interchangeable with Industrial design, and minoring in Business. I have to say I think it is the perfect combination for me, but there are often times I wish I had something more engineering focused, like mechanical engineering, but then I wonder if I would have been able to keep up with the rigorous math courses, because that has always been a problem for me. That's why I think design is great, because you get to build and create things, but you don't need to take as many math classes in school. In the real world, it will really come down to who you network with, and if you can convince a company that you are the man for the job, it becomes less important what you actually studied in school, as long as you can prove you can do the job they need you to do. I know many people who have studied things like architecture, but ended up getting an (slightly better paying) IT job, that would normally be a position for someone who had studied CS. I would worry less about the title of your degree and more about the knowledge you amass, and how you can prove this knowledge to future employers. try to network and make as many connections as you can with people in powerful positions, and you will be able to get a job where you won't have to stress out about money all the time.  if you want to get into design, use your computer skills to learn how to use programs like the Adobe Suite (photoshop, illustrator indesign), CAD software like Solidworks, AutoCAD, Rhino. if you learn how to use those, and create a portfolio of good work, you could easily get a good internship an a design company, or a design internship at a manufacturing company, and these internships are your key to a job in the industry, and they will like seeing someone who is that good at something they didn't even major in because you now know more about CS than other strictly design applicants, which can be useful.
Good luck, and do what you enjoy!

[Hi Alex, I just wanna say thanks so much for doing an AMA!

[How did you get the attention of Eminem and Dr. Dre?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxfdn?context=5)|A guy called Riggs who works for Eminem heard my music and played it to Marshall, then Marshall heard Airplanes and showed it to Dre. 
[Hey Alex,  Thanks for your time today. I have a question on how you select layers to develop sounds - is the final sound of your mix almost exactly what you came up with in your head before creating in the studio of how you wanted the song/instrument to sound, or is it developed in trying different samples and seeing what fits during the creation process? How much of it is your say vs. the band/artist?  Also, how long did it take for you to become comfortable, confident and satisfied with your mixes?  Love your work, keep doing your thing. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxcda?context=5)|It's definitely trial and error 90% of the time. When you're in the creative part of writing, I try different things and some make sense and some don't.  My mixes, it took me around three and half four years. 
[ off, huge fan Alex. How did ""Wicked Ways"" come about on the new Eminem CD?

I make a track which can take two or three days, then we write to vox which can take a day to a year and then we record which will take a couple days. and then we take it to Manny Maraquin to do his mix magic (SHOUT OUT TO MANNY!) which takes a couple of days.

[Would you ever consider releasing stems of your mixes? or, better than stems, full PT files for prospective producers and engineers to see your process and get a little insight. I'd absolutely love to see how you created your drums on the Imagine Dragons stuff, they're huge. Assuming you own the rights to the songs, since it's your label, is that something you'd be interested in sharing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1rxnqp/i_am_alex_da_kid_multi_grammy_award_winning/cdrxs0w?context=5)|HELL NO.

1rxynu,1,2013-12-02,How to get started in the CS field?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rxynu/how_to_get_started_in_the_cs_field/,"I am 22 and 4th year sophmore at a pretty good public university. It is one of the top 10 CS schools in the Southeast I believe and is located in a major city. I have been undeclared up till this point, but I am at a point where I NEED to pick a major and start taking core classes. 

I am wondering if a career in CS is right for me. I have been browsing job listings over the last year trying to find a career path that interests me and I have found I am most interested in software development, web development, and app development jobs. The office environments seem pretty cool, I think I could be good at it, and the pay is attractive, plus there seems to be no shortage of jobs available (PS, am I right about all this?) 

I am an average programmer. I understand the concepts but I have a lot of learning to do. I don't think I could code anything from scratch at the moment. I took a java class in high school, and I did really well in Intro to Comp Sci last semster (Python with robots), and I've made a couple basic websites for myself, but that's the extent of my experience. If I were to pursue a degree in CS (it may take me about 2 years to finish), realistically how soon could I start working in the field? What positions would be available to me, and how could I pursue them? Would I be able to find an internship within the next year?
 
Please be as thorough as you can, and if you know of any books, article, etc that may be helpful to me please post a link. Thanks!"
1rxsd8,1,2013-12-02,Should I do a Senior Capstone project,thefutureofCS,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1rxsd8/should_i_do_a_senior_capstone_project/,"I'm graduating in June, and I'm debating taking the two quarter long capstone project offered by my school. I don't know if its the same for other schools, but basically 7-8 companies come together and ""donate"" problems for a team of undergrads to solve.

Why I want to take it: I don't have any internship experience. I was pretty sure I wanted to get a masters, and wasn't confident in my abilities to get an internship.

Why I don't want to take it: It's a pretty big time commitment, and I still have four more CS classes to take, two per quarter. Two tough courses, a GE, and a project course seems a little overwhelming, especially as I continue my job search, and interview prep.

Any advice?"
1rxpep,2,2013-12-02,To include ACT score or not?,Skoodilypoop,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1rxpep/to_include_act_score_or_not/,"I'm a junior in college studying CS and Statistics and I'm applying for an internship this summer at a company that makes supercomputers. I'm wondering if I should include my ACT score (I got a 33, which puts me in the top 1% of test takers and top 10% of my university). Some people have told me to include it because it is fairly strong, and if I don't include it, the people looking at the resume will assume I did poorly (the same way recruiters get suspicious of resumes without a GPA noted). Other people tell me that while the score is okay, there are lots of smart people in the company, so it'll just look like I'm bragging about something that isn't that noteworthy."

My background; I'm at a top-10 university in my program, I have a 3.3 GPA and 8 months of internship/co-op experience. I have an interest in controls engineering, but as I apply to jobs, I am not discriminating the type of work I apply for.

That said, I also have an interest in developing keen programming skills. I am considering applying to a computer science program in the area near where my parents live, in the hopes that I can get another B.S. while living at home and working as an engineering intern or something part time. Ideally it would take no more than 3-4 semesters, if transfer credits and all that jazz works out.

What would be the career benefits of holding two B.S. degrees, one in MechE, and one in C.S.? Can anyone offer insight into a specific field or job that would utilize both skill sets? I am also curious about details like salary, career trajectory, etc.

I greatly appreciate any advice, anecdotal information, or opinions. Thanks! "

I'm an Illinois Resident transfer student who was admitted to UIUC's CS program for Spring 2014. I've also been accepted to UIC's program and I wanted to get your opinion on weather's UIUC is worth the extra ~20k I'd pay in housing/food/driving over 2 years.

I would basically be paying no commuting costs for UIC because I am in a unique situation where my dad works downtown and I could drive with him everyday and live at home.
I know the top companies recruit from UIUC and UIUC's program is ranked 5th in the country whereas UIC is 57, but I've heard from other that where you went to school doesn't matter after you 1st or 2nd job. Also based on UIC's COE career fare page it seems like Microsoft, Motorola, etc also recruit from UIC, but no Google/Apple like UIUC for internships.

Can any Target School CS students and alumni advise me on if it was worth the extra money going to a top school or if I should just go to UIC and save the extra money (how have you seen the unknown school CS alumni fare in the career world compared to yourself and other top school alumni?).

When you guys were doing your internships, did you see many no-name CS students as well?

I would go ahead and apply now, but I'm always working on personal projects/open-source contributions to better my portfolio, and over winter break I plan to spend a lot of time working on bigger projects that would really be beneficial to showcasing my skills. So the question is what is the usual deadline for internship applications? I know it's different for each company, but if there's a general consensus I could get a good idea. If it's the end of the year I might as well submit now, but if they're going to be open till February/March, I could spend all that time working on things, which would defintely help strengthen my applications. 

Some example applications with no deadlines so you can see what I mean:

I considered using a throwaway in case you all agree, but then I realized I just don't care anymore.

I'm set to graduate with my B.A. next year and have a good job in a flourishing industry lined up, but I have absolutely no motivation to see it all through. Nothing about doing these things sounds appealing anymore. In fact nothing sounds appealing any more, my life is at a dead stop and I have no idea what road to take. I think about just dropping everything and running away on a daily basis, and sometimes things get darker but I'm always able to blow those thoughts off as an unrealistic action that I would never follow through with....but lately my internal voice has been a bit less convincing and the darker thoughts coming more frequently. I have no idea why I am typing all of this to you, you are all people with your own worries and issues and probably don't genuinely care what the person behind this username ends up doing with his life. The only reason I can think of is that everyone that know me in real life doesn't really know me. I want someone to know the real me just in case that voice cant convince me one of these days.

I was raised in a small, extremely conservative rural town (less than 2000 residents). The nearest Wal-Mart was a 45 minute drive, and if you wanted to go the movies theater you had to be up at 7am to make it there and back before 7pm. This was the type of small town where opportunities were based on the importance of your last name. If your weren't Catholic or your last name wasn't seen on at least 5 gravestones in the Catholic cemetery, you weren't really part of the community. It took me a while but by high school, I had been more or less accepted by the kids who had roots in the town, in particular a pair of individuals that I will call David and Kate. David's family had a hand in almost every part of the town; his father was on the school board and his mother was a secretary for one of the town's few major businesses. His family is very large and very Catholic. David lived to excel, he served in various roles within the church and was known an loved by almost everyone that he deemed worth knowing and is very handsome. Kate's is a similar story except she rejected the whole ""I'm -----'s- daughter, treat me special"" idealism that is the town's life blood. She and I were a lot more close than David was to either of us. Then there was me. I was always interested in things that were seen as ""stupid"", ""gay"", or ""pointless"" by my friends. Things like video games, reading books for pleasure, asking questions about things that contradict certain beliefs; all of these things were considered social suicide. Because of this, as time went on I developed two persona's, there was the me that enjoyed big trucks, Sunday mass, drinking copious amounts of shitty beer in some pasture that David's uncle owned, football and all of those types of things. Then there is the me that played MMOs, read Terry Brooks novels and wanted to know why Jesus seemed to have no problem helping Tim Tebow win a football game but had a bit of difficulty with the whole Africa situation. My family, friends, hell even my coworkers only know that first me.

When we graduated high school David went to the state's big conservative university while Kate went to the more liberal university of the state. Both of them received enough scholarships from an agricultural program in our school to go to college two times over. All three of us were leaders in this program and were heavily involved throughout high school. We all applied for the same scholarships with the assistance of the teacher that was head of the program and had similar GPAs, however unlike them, my parents were not able to pour large sums of cash into the program . I was not awarded any scholarships. Because of this I find my self at a second tier satellite school seven hours from ""home"". 

I spent my first semester of college in a deep state of depression. I was living in a huge, strange city surrounded by more people than I'd ever seen in my life. I knew absolutely no one, and my roommate didn't seem like the type of guy my first persona would associate with. I spent most of my free time locked in my room playing video games and the rest of it sitting in the back of a classroom alone trying to figure out what the professor was talking about. I didn't get to see David and Kate as often as we had hoped when we all went off to school, but we still kept in regular contact and would coordinate our weekends home to hang out with each other.By the end of the semester I was 10k in debt and had no grades to show for it. I took responsibility for my failure and managed to get straight A's the next semester and have done pretty decent since then. However that by failing those classes in my first semester I pushed my graduation date back by a year. 

Over the last three years Kate and I have developed a sort of dysfunctional relationship. When she is sober we are just friends, that go to parties and social functions together and I would be perfectly fine with this if that was all it consisted of. However, she has developed a drinking problem since entering college. When she drinks she says romantic things to me that she never says when she is sober. A typical night involves showing up to a gathering and socializing for about an hour before I realize i don't see her anywhere and go searching. Usually i find her either passed out, throwing up, or surrounded by several guys looking for an easy catch. Each time this happens I have to remove her from the situation and take care of the after math. Keep in mind that we only see each other maybe one weekend a month, so I'm sure during the other three weekends there are things happening, but I'd rather not know about them. She is graduating this week and informed me over Thanksgiving break that she is moving to Los Angels to pursue a job at a social media company after Christmas. I fear for her, and its really hurting me in a way I've never felt before, but there is nothing I can do to stop it.



I had a realization back in August and since then I have begun caring less and less about life as a whole. By the time I am done with school next year I'll be 60 thousand dollars in debt and entering a job full time (currently I am only an intern) where for nine hours a days a week I will sit in a vanilla office building with a bunch of people who are just as miserable as myself, plucking away at a keyboard so that I can help maintain some CEO's standard of life. I will do this for around 30 or 40 years, retire, and spend the rest of my days as a middle class retiree whose name will be forgotten in just a few generations. And thats assuming I am continually employed and the government doesn't self destruct before then. Its an unimportant, meaningless existence and I just feel so insignificant in comparison to the rest of reality. I'm in my fourth year of college and find lacking friends, motivation and an excuse to wake up in the morning. I know the same amount of people at my university as I did the day I walked on to campus, and this semester I've sank back into my old habits. I find myself sleeping 12-15 hours a day, only getting up to go and sit in class and pretend like I'm paying attention. I go to the library almost every day to catch up on work I know I need to do, only to leave after 20 minutes of looking at Facebook on my phone and wondering how everyone can smile so much. I spend every waking hour hating myself and wishing I could just close my eyes and let go. The real kicker is that everyone that people usually go to to talk about these things has no idea I'm even capable of thinking this way. David graduated last May and has entered seminary school to become a priest. We haven't talked much since then, but we still see each other every now and then. I told David some of this over Thanksgiving break and his only advice was to stop being a selfish asshole and put my faith in God. 

Thats when the other half of my brain kicks in and I think about the millions of people all over the world that are dying of starvation, or being bombed because some fucker needs to fill his SUV up and drive his five kids to soccer practice, or the people being put into forced labor camps in North Korea, or those four people that died on their commute home today in New York. I think to myself, ""What the fuck are you complaining for you spoiled fucking bastard?"" 

All of these things are happening and all the rest of the world can focus on is whatever bullshit headline the media machine can churn out for the day. I am powerless to do anything about these things, but hey at least I can help Frank in Engineering find a purchase order for some flanges that were supposed to be at the job site three weeks ago but got delayed because the biggest typhoon on record stalled the shipment in the Philippines until January, so there is that.


I doubt anyone has made it this far. If you did I thank you, and truly hope you are one of those people who still has the ability to smile.

1s0ji0,3,2013-12-03,"Loneliness, among other problems",advicethrowaway07,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1s0ji0/loneliness_among_other_problems/,"Alright, I’ll try to start at the beginning.


I’ve been going to college out of state for a year and a half now, I’m a sophomore. I had a pretty close friend group growing up, we did everything together and I’m still friends with most of them, we talk through VOIP software and play games nearly every day despite being 200 miles away. But at college itself, I’m lonely. I made some friends the first year and lost them just as quickly, or I should say they just kind of faded away. 


After the first year I was getting bored. I started trying drugs. Weed and some psychedelics. Most of my friends back home smoke themselves, so sometimes we would chill and get high over the breaks. I found caffeine improved my mood, so I started drinking a lot more coffee and just consumed more caffeine in general. 


There’s a group of people down here that will occasionally invite me to big get-togethers, and I have a good time. But I don’t REALLY know any of them. They’re little more than acquaintances. We see each other less than once a week, minus passing hellos in class. My friends are at home. My roommate is more of a loner than I am. We haven’t said words to each other since the beginning of October.


I was able to keep my weed habits secret to my acquaintances at college, that is until a few weeks ago. One of them, a nice guy that I was hoping to get an apartment with next year, found out and acted ambivalent at first. Ok, fine, I thought. Until I found out from someone else that he was having doubts about getting an apartment with me in light of that. Haven’t talked to him about it yet, keep putting it off. But the time to sign a lease is fast approaching. 


And as it tends to do, the gossip that I use marijuana is now all over the group. People treat me differently. I’ve become the punchline of certain jokes. “Haha, oh advicethrowaway07, are you sure you weren’t just high?” So I just smile and laugh along, and they don’t see that it hurts me when they give me that look, that derogatory, condescending look, and what pisses me off most is that they never would have known if they weren’t told. I never mix weed and going out with them. But now I’m the group stoner.


Now, heading back after thanksgiving break, I nearly had a breakdown. A combination of needing to talk to the person closest to a friend I have at college about an apartment, a lot of stress related to final projects, realizing that I’m going back to a practically fucking mute roommate and a fucking box of a dorm room, leaving the family that I love and feel I’m becoming more distant from. I’m seeing the people I know down here less and less. I’m realizing that I’m not even halfway done with college and I don’t seem to have a passion for my major. I’m going through more weed than I used to, feel tired if I’m not on caffeine, and I’m legitimately scared that I won’t even able to get the motivation to work on everything that needs work. I missed a deadline for a summer internship already.


I’m a kissless virgin that has never had a real girlfriend, and I’m scared that I’m not interesting enough, not attractive enough for one. I’m scared that I’m going to go through college without experiencing intimacy with another human being, just like I went through high school never experiencing teenage love. And then where are the opportunities after college? I’ll never have a chance to find a significant other as good as this again.


Today I wanted to lie on my bed and scream that I didn’t want to go back. I didn’t want to go back there, where I’ve lived virtually entirely on my own for 18 months with breaks in between. I don’t want to live like this. I’m supposedly smart, but I can’t figure out how to fix my goddamn life. 


I want to be able to make friends, enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning without having to ingest more caffeine every 5 hours, and get high responsibly when all my work is done and not feel judged for it. I want to have sex and be able to hold her in my arms, knowing that the person I just made love to loves me back. I want to enjoy my major and what will probably be my career.
Most of all, I just want to feel normal, like I’m not three steps behind every other person on this fucking planet. Everyone seems to KNOW how to do things. I don’t. I don’t have fashion sense, I don’t know how to flirt, I don’t know how to make new friends since I haven’t had to do it since middle school. I don’t see my path changing. How am I supposed to grow as a person when I can’t bring myself to leave my room for anything other than class, exercise, and the occasional social get-together? Where would I even go?


I’ve already written a giant wall of text and feel like I could write more. Sorry if this is rambling on, I’m not sure what advice I’m really asking for here. More than anything I think I just need to get this off my chest. But, if any of you can offer advice, please do. On anything. Thank you for reading.

(sorry if I'm vague at any point, but I need to protect my offline identity)

WALL OF TEXT:
I graduated from an Ivy this year and I've been searching for a job almost constantly to no avail. My majors were in environmental/earth science and political science. I have a lot of technical course work, two papers published, and some relevant internships. I've been applying for jobs in environmental consulting in the US and abroad because I only have a bachelors and anything else seems to require a PhD. (I wanted to work before doing grad school since I have no idea which part of my majors I would continue and it seems like I'd waste even more money just randomly doing something.) I have several job applications pending with the government, the UN, and in various places across Europe. Mostly though, I've had rejections. I am still actively searching every day. 

Right now, its difficult to even find openings in my field so I make sure I apply to a job if it seems I might be even remotely qualified. Still, I honestly thought I would have a job by now, and I'm kind of shocked that I don't. I've gotten so many rejections because I'm overqualified or under-qualified or they just won't take someone from the US (this has been especially true of UK positions - a shame because this is the country with the most opportunity for someone in my field starting out). I'd been having trouble finding openings I'm qualified for in the US (am I looking in the wrong places? I'm not saying no, but the career services at my school tried to help and had the same problem). I don't have a car and can't afford one, so I'm limited to looking near cities for a job. So, now I'm applying anywhere in the world that I might be able to qualify for. I just didn't expect it to be so hard to get a job abroad. (As for applying abroad, I've looked at positions that want English speakers mostly, but I've also freely applied in Germany because I have family there and speak some German.)

Now, this week, the bills started arriving for the student loans I took out, lets say a round $100,000. I need to call and see if I can get a deferment but that still only gives me another three months. And the main problem of not having a job remains. I am currently living at home to save money but my parents definitely can't help with loans while paying for my brother's school. 

So what do I do, reddit? I've been looking but am having trouble finding a job. (I have some interviews coming but they're unpaid internships) I have bills arriving for loans that I cannot pay off. I have no clue what to do. I am stupidly overwhelmed. 

TL;DR Graduated with BSc from a really good school, can't find a job (anywhere in the world), and have student loan bills coming in and no clue what to do.  Please Reddit, I need your advice.  "

I'm an undergrad CS major and I've already completed my first internship. I'm interested in completing my second at a different company and I wanted some feedback on listing the newly gained experience on my resume. 
GPA is 3.0. Currently omitted, but I'll be adding it later.

Questions:
Are the experience/project descriptions worded oddly? 

I opted to list the user functionality (User can do X, Y, Z). 
I've read that you should write ""Accomplished X by implementing Y, which improved Z"". I'm having difficulty wording it like this though, as I've coded everything in both projects.

Is the listed project too trivial? 

I just wanted to back up my listed skill set and show that I'm proficient in it. I'm slowly adding new features while tracking my changes with version control. I've also included the github repo incase they'd like to browse the code.

Finally, would you hire me based on this resume? 

Obviously you would have to test my knowledge in an interview, as well.

Thanks!"

1ryl3n,3,2013-12-02,How do I properly counter offer?,gutupio,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1ryl3n/how_do_i_properly_counter_offer/,"I recently received an offer from one of my top prospects. I'm stoked, but I'd like to extend a counter offer. Here's the story:

Last January I did a week long project for a company. After the project they extended an internship to me. Meanwhile while waiting for summer to come, a friend of mine applied for an internship to the same company and was accepted. We worked the summer together and even carpooled out there most days. After the summer our internships ended. We both received notices from the company asking us to apply for new grad positions. 

My buddy applied and was offered a position. I got really busy working two jobs and taking a full course load and never found time to apply for the company. A few weeks ago, the recruiter for the company who had set me up with both the project and the internship called and asked me why I hadn't applied yet. We had a conversation and a verbal offer was extended with the promise of a formal offer coming after thanksgiving break.

I received the offer today, and it's for a decent amount. I do have qualms with it though. My friend was offered more than me but I feel as though I have more to offer the company. I have a higher GPA (by almost a point) and more experience with the company. Plus the company recruiter is clearly interested, since he called me. My other qualm is with the length of time for the offer. The offer expires on Dec 20th, in only 18 days. My friends offer was valid for 60 days. After the conversation with the recruiter I applied for a few other companies, and I would like a little extra time to see if any other companies extend offers.

So how should I go about counter offering? The formal email was extended as a letter sent over email as an attachment. How appropriate is it to ask for an extension on the acceptance date? I don't know if I'm comfortable suggesting I know my friend was offered more, but how acceptable is that as a reason if they ask me why I believe I deserve more? Is there a general format for counter offers? 

One last thing of note is that the company uses a 'wage calculator' to determine the offer. They claim it makes if fair for all incoming new grad positions. Has anyone had success or failure in counter offering with this situation? "

1ryhj8,4,2013-12-02,Tips for reducing clerical errors?,mrbazooka,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1ryhj8/tips_for_reducing_clerical_errors/,"Hi there /r/AskEngineers,

Something that I have always struggled with ever since grade school is making very small clerical errors. A simple example of this is saying that 2+3=6. Now, I KNOW that 2+3 is actually 5; no one needs to remind me how to do basic arithmetic. These small errors, however, are causing me some enormous trouble.

For example, I had a Fluid Mechanics test the week before thanksgiving break. I started studying a week ahead of time for an average of about 2 hours a day. I went over all the homework problems covering the topics that were to be presented on the exam, and met with a study group the night before the exam for 3 hours to discuss any difficulties we might have had.

Unfortunately, things didn't pan out so well. I got a 76%, which is just barely good enough for a B. Had it not been for a clerical error I made on one of the problems, I would have gotten an 84%, and my professor is unwilling to negotiate on his grading methods. 

Student services set me up with a tutor for this class. The tutor told me what I already knew: I know the material just fine, it's just the tiny clerical errors that are the problem.

This is a big deal for me because I need a 3.0 in order to be eligible for the internship I want this summer. Right now, I have a 2.99. The fact that I am also considering grad school makes it even worse.

Are there any exercises that I can do so that I may get better at catching these mistakes? I'm convinced that I can get at least a 3.5 cumulative GPA if I can reduce the frequency of these mistakes. Any help is appreciated.

TL;DR I make lots of tiny mistakes in calculations. I otherwise know the material very well. I am looking for exercises to do so that I can reduce the frequency of these mistakes so I can bring my grades up. Any help at all is appreciated."

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  In my third year of undergrad with offers for 2014 summer software engineering internship at MSFT (Bing Ads) and FB (not sure, but backend services).  Obviously this is a good problem to have, and I probably can't go horribly wrong either way, but I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding.  Would appreciate any input, especially from those have worked at one or both.

Specific questions:

1. Is the culture at MSFT as corporate, political, and bureaucratic as it's made out to be?

2. Which has more interesting work and responsibility (especially as an intern)?
3. Maybe a silly question, but which company has the better name/reputation?  That is, which company would set me up better for the rest of my career? I imagine it's a wash between the two. But I've also heard criticism that Microsoft's hiring bar has suffered in recent years, and a lot of top talent has left. 

Any other input of any kind would also be much appreciated.  Thanks! :)"

Right now I am in my university's second CS course out of the major which deals with trees, linked lists, recursion, Dijkstra's algorithm etc. My question is, in your opinion, will this research/publication help me to secure an internship in the near future. Right now I'm planning on staying with them through Summer 2014 and start looking for more SE related positions fall 2014. Thank you.

I've done some research and came across bitmap images (bmp), which would make sense for this application. I was going to initially start with an arduino to construct an n x n matrix but it's limited by its 14 digital output, which would ultimately correspond to a matrix location. Now, although that would be a good start, it seems rather straight forward and just come down to programming some code. There's also the arduino mega with 54 outputs, but surely there a less straightforward way then individually programming each output.
I would much rather skip this limitation and proceed to a higher n x n matrix, but have no clue to the hardware that could ultimately achieve this.. I've pondered in regard to perhaps using a series of muxes to differential between the individual LEDs and increase the refresh rate (if that's even possible with an arduino) so that it would appear as a full matrix to the eyes (which I just learned is known as multiplexing). Ultimately I'm trying to figure out how to differential between LEDs and colors. If someone could perhaps steer me in the right direction in terms of hardware or anything else that would be useful, I would be forever grateful..

Lil background.. I'm currently a junior in EE in some-would-say ""prestigious"" university with a &lt;3.0 GPA and have no engineering experience beyond my curious nature toward engineering or internships [yet] so I'm hoping this would be a great project to set me a part once I'm on the market."

This is my first semester in grad school for Computer Science. I'm deciding if I should register for classes next semester. I'd like to start a career in application development, but I'm a little afraid of getting overqualified and don't know how needed it really is.

I went straight from my undergrad in CS to grad school. The only CS work experience I've had was a couple years at the university helpdesk. I'm currently doing a data entry internship. I honestly kind of hate the job, not because it's hard, but because of the environment and my co-workers. That said, it waives my tuition and gives me a $1,000/month stipend for 20 hours of work per week.

I've been applying around for all kinds of work- internships, contract work, and permanent jobs, but haven't had much luck. I'm not sure if I should list that I'm a grad student on my resume or not; if I got a job, I'd probably continue grad school later down the line. 

Also, a little unrelated, but should I list my GitHub on my resume even if it only contains two small projects? I don't have a huge portfolio of projects, to be honest. A lot of my undergrad work was in networking until I decided I preferred programming right near graduation, so most of my projects are pretty basic demonstrations of data structures and not big, useful programs. I haven't done any academic programming this semester in grad school either, oddly enough, so nothing from there to put on it. Just my personal projects.

There's a few other factors involved, but since this is the CS career questions subreddit, I'll leave it to that. Any advice?"

I'm not exactly sure how to describe my role, 'everything electronic,' should do it.

One of the duties that is not outsourced to another group is setting up new workstations to company specs, and so far it has been handled by previous interns by just manually installing everything and calling it good. I am cool with that, but I want to expand my experience and learn a few new tricks. Plus, they are having me write a step-by-step IT Manual to be used by following interns, and a one/two step process would be easier to write.


So far I have thought of the following:


**1) Setup a group-policy in Active Directory for all workstations with the baseline programs needed.**

-My concern about this is how it would effect existing users, I don't want to break something in the process of making something faster.

-Never done it before.

**2) Create a baseline image from an existing workstation, and use it every new workstation that is added to the fleet.**

-My concern on this, there is no uniformity in hardware here, just buying whatever is available at a given time. Hardware differences could cause problems right?

-Also, I have never done this before. I got this position on being eager to learn and a CS major.



This position is not out of my league, but I feel woefully under prepared. I am basically learning everything I can about networking, sysadmin, and stuff.

Thoughts and advice?

(Essay, but there is a TL;DR below)

I'm an intern in a rapidly expanding media company. I've been here three months and I enjoy the work but the workload and deadlines are immense. I came in with the understanding I would spend 6 months improving my video editing and graphic design skills. After that I would be introduced to project management, with a view to be overseeing projects by the end of my first year.

The company's client list is expanding rapidly (great news) and the work is piling in. I was started managing projects for international clients within my first month. And not just one project, **I was given multiple projects to be delivered simultaneously with little training or experience.**

Now I'm an intelligent, hardworking guy, I know I am getting valuable experience and I'm being tested in a way I haven't before so I've thrown myself into it. I've pulled late nights, weekends, 60-70 hour weeks to get shit done. I've also had to put any of my own media training on the back burner over and over again.

I just delivered the first two of my projects. One of the other editors called it the best stuff they'd ever produced but I didn't get a response from my manager or my boss. Not positive or negative, but nothing. I'm not looking for balloons and a cake but after managing a team of six guys for 2 months to deliver something huge for a big client I expected some sort of feedback.

**I earn about 200 bucks a week, I have quit my other commitments to make time for the job and I feel undervalued, unguided and out of my depth at times.**

The boss took me aside last Friday because he is concerned that I don't know how to handle pressure and that I'm looking stressed. I am a positive, upbeat influence in our production team and I have managed to deliver the projects earlier than deadlines. I don't think that he gets to see me enough to make a judgement like that but if he said it then it must be apparent every now and again.

How can I deal with mounting pressure in work? I work hard to keep things in perspective and to take time away from work but I am having a hard time keeping positive and managing effectively. I haven't been able to improve my editing skills and I rarely see friends or family.

How can I balance my work life, my social life and training myself in the craft?

**TL;DR: I'm under pressure in work, not getting paid for 60 hour weeks and I want to know how to manage the pressure and the workload, be a positive and effective asset to the team.**"

I'm quickly earning the reputation of Excel guru at my already technically savvy company. I enjoy writing VBA, but I know it can barely even be considered the tip of the iceberg. I took a class each on VBA, VB, and Java in college, but that is about the extent of my education. I've started the Stanford C-Objective course on iTunes U in my spare time.

That's just a bit of background. Basically, I'm enjoying the technical aspects of my job. I know it is still very early on (only 6 months in), but I can't help but see myself more and more interested in programming. I currently work from home once a week, and I enjoy the independence.

1sazk8,1,2013-12-07,Time for other things?,the_slender_whale,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1sazk8/time_for_other_things/,"I hope this is the right subreddit, sorry if it isn't.

I'm currently a freshman in engineering, looking into electrical/computer engineering. I attend very highly ranked school, I'm doing well with my grades, and I'm not worried about my job prospects when I get out of college, the opportunities will be there if I keep my head on straight, I know that.  But, I'm really scared of something else.

Ever since I got here they tell us how we have to have an internship, a co-op, research opportunities, everything possible to make us stand out, every single summer and off-semester.  I had to have a resume three weeks into school to attend a giant fair and sell myself to companies, but I didn't even have any skills to sell yet. It's just what is expected of us, that every moment of our lives is dedicated to preparing to get us into grad school, or a job in the future.

For the most part, that's ok, I like the hard sciences, I find coding fascinating, and the idea of me designing things and helping to better the world and all that is an attractive one.  But its not all I want.  I don't want to only live looking to the future.  I love backpacking.  I want to travel.  I want to meet people and go places without necessarily knowing where it is I'm going or what exactly I'm doing.  I would love to do these things when I'm still young.  I had to pass up a 45 day backpacking trip in Alasksa with some of my best friends this last summer, because I would have missed the first week of college and didn't feel I could afford to get behind.  I regret that decision more than any other in my life, and I know I'll never get another opportunity like that one again.  

I don't want to make that same mistake twice.  I don't want to throw away all these other things I want in life.  You can't make a living backpacking and traveling, engineering is a practical solution.  I'm lucky that I enjoy it.  Still, its not everything I want.  

I know this is a little rambling, but I guess what I want to know is, with how competitive engineering is, and how time consuming, how do you have time to do the things you really dream about? The traveling, the stuff that really sounds like living, making you feel really fulfilled?  Don't get me wrong, I like where I am and what I'm studying, but I just can't shake this feeling that I'm going to miss out on everything else there is out there.  

Sorry for the long post, but its an important question I think."
1sav1n,3,2013-12-07,Internship with a small company or large well known company?,Jakor,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1sav1n/internship_with_a_small_company_or_large_well/,"I know any answer to this will be very opinionated, but I am reaching out to get as many opinions as possible on my situation.

I am a junior in Mechanical Engineering, and I have just been offered my first Internship to work at Cummins. Additionally, one of my bosses got me an interview with a small local Engineering contracting company (about 70 people in the facility). I am almost certain I will get an offer for this one as well, as in the interview they told me multiple times they look forward to working with me, and they don't typically do internships from what I gathered.

For the smaller company internship, they expressed to me how they really wanted to make sure I spent most of my time doing hands on work, so that I can learn as much as possible while I'm there, with minimal paperwork and looking at drawings, etc. They all seemed like great people who were very laid back, and they even had an archery range in shop the owner and some others would use occasionally to relax a bit. They do both research and production of their products, so I could have the chance to see both sides of my field of interest (thermal energy systems). They also gave me quite a list of projects that I could expect to be helping out on

However, I also just got an acceptance offer from Cummins as a Thermal Fluids Performance Engineer. I don't know as much about what exactly I could expect to be working on, but the pay is plenty fine, my college resources provides reviews for internships with them that were overall pretty positive, and I know that Cummins typically uses an internship as a chance to find full time hires.

One (very slight) decision that sways me is that the smaller company is only about two hours away, so I could come back on weekends to see the girlfriend and friends and whatnot. The other offer is in the headquarters of Cummins, about a 6 hour drive away. 

So here is my question:
In your opinion, is it better to have an internship that may give more hands on experience and (maybe) make me a better engineer, with possibly references I would get to know better, or should I accept the offer of a big company name to possibly make my work experience on my resume look more recognizable?

TL,DR: Small company internship or Big Company internship?

Thank you for your time!"

However, I definitely don't feel like I know enough to be useful to anyone. I have learned the amount of C you can learn in a college class, and I've been teaching myself Python through codecademy.

What should I do to get that internship for the summer and/or next year?

The restaurant is sort of a classy place, so the website also needs to be visually appealing (I assume I would just use a WP theme to help with this). My questions are:

* Is WordPress the right choice for this kind of thing?
* How long would it take the average developer to build a basic web site like the one described? (I have experience with ASP.NET MVC and Ruby on Rails, but I've never used a CMS like WordPress before as my framework)
* What is a fair total price, or hourly wage, to ask for?  I'm still a student, but I've been employed as an intern web developer in the past at a local software company and at that point I was earning $22/hr. Would that be a fair amount?
* Does the owner even need someone like me to set up this site for him, or is WordPress simple enough that he could do it himself?

Loved every second of it.  Almost.  Anyways, about 6 months into my internship I was given the opportunity to lead a PC replacement/Windows 7 upgrade project.   I basically created the Win7 image, decided how/when to deploy, contacted users, etc.  By the time this story occurred, my team and I were rolling through replacements.  We set everything up at the shop and the users pretty much watched us swap their PC, logged in, tested their apps and they were good to go.  

So...we get to this one department, everything is going fine until we get to the secretary.  We will call her G. I had seen her a few times before, she was always pleasant, and seemed really easy going when I told her it was time to replace hers.  In about 10-15 minutes time I'm ready for her to log in and start testing.  Here's how the conversation went:

Me: ""Ok, G, you're all set let's just have you log in and test out a few things.""

*she types in her username and password* 

**Username or password is incorrect**

Me: ""Hmmm, ok try again.""

*she types in her username and password* 

**Username or password is incorrect**

G: ""It's not working.  What did you do.""

I lean in and with my specialty eyeballs I can see a big ol' glaring space right before her username.

Me: ""Looks like there's a space before your username, why don't you try typing it in again?""

She slowly highlights her username...and then..

G:"" WHAT, YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TYPE?  I PUT IT IN RIGHT.  YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED MY PASSWORD.  WHAT DID YOU DO.  SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH IT.""

Me: ""Ok, why don't I try logging in to make sure I can get in.""

I do this for two reasons.  To prove nothing is wrong with the computer, and to erase her username so she has to type it in again.  It works fine.  However, this somehow is proof to her that I changed her password.

G: ""IF IT'S WORKING FOR YOU YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED MY PASSWORD.""

I consider explaining that I am an intern, I don't know her password, I don't have rights to change her password, and I have **no reason** to change her password.  But I simply say:

""Why don't you just try it again...""

She does.  It works.  Proof that I didn't change her password.  Or not..

G:""I KNOW I TYPED IT IN RIGHT THE FIRST TIME.  YOU CHANGED IT SOME HOW.  I KNOW ABOUT COMPUTERS TOO.""

I kid you not, she insisted that I changed her password (for no reason), then magically changed it back WHILE STANDING OVER HER SHOULDER.  She then proceeded to refuse to let me touch her PC and called the Help Desk to complain about me.

I have been fairly proficient and interested at programming since middle school, so when it came time to graduate high school and move on in life, I decided to study Computer Science in college. A year and a half in, I became discouraged with book work and not being able to do well on tests, while at the same time, doing fantastic on lab projects. Around this time, I discovered I had a knack for IT related projects (fixing and exploring new hardware, building systems from scratch, etc), so I focused on getting by in college, and using my co-ops doing IT jobs (helpdesk and net-sec). When graduation came around, I had no problem finding an IT job, both with my degree and experience. Cycle around to today, three years later, and I hate working in IT (it's a great hobby!) because there is little room for creativity in this field (things have to be done a certain way to work with other things), and I am completely burnt out basing my day to day work reactively, instead of proactively. On top of that, having to be aware of all issues 24 hours a day, 7 days a week is really getting to me. I want to go back to programming. However, this poses a few issues:


* I have zero professional experience programming other than some simple bash/perl scripting, writing Nagios checks, and crafting Puppet modules, none of which are very high level skills that would help me get a programming job.
* I was discouraged from book learning in my Comp Sci classes (hey, I was going to have a great career in IT right?!), so my knowledge of related topics is not very in depth. I understand basic fundamentals like object oriented design, classes, recursion, etc, but I remember/understand next to nothing about higher level things such as algorithms and data structures.
* I don't do well under pressure. Deadlines and completion dates for projects are one thing, but every time I have to sit down and complete a task for a test (i.e. interviews), I freeze. This has only happened in my programming interviews. Every IT interview I have been on has been a great, comfortable discussion between the interviewer and myself.


What I do have going for myself is that I am a very quick learner. I picked up bash scripting within a week (to the point where I understand the layout and functions of the language, I still require reference for the syntax about 60% of the time, but that gets better the more I do it), same with Nagios and Puppet. I also love learning new things. I currently have a CentOS box sitting in my living room that I use to host game servers that I built from scratch for fun, just so I could learn the ins and outs of the OS and what it takes to get things to run in Linux.


I know I am not doomed to be stuck in a IT related position forever, however, I have no idea what my next steps are to get out. I also would like to do it as soon as possible, I am planning to move away from Boston to either New York or San Francisco as soon as possible, hopefully using this career change as the final catalyst to push myself to move. I understand that I could look for more internships, but unfortunately I am stuck in the loop of extremely high student loan payments, so that is financially unattainable. I also understand that I could move to a place that isn't as expensive as where I have my sights set, but mentally that won't work (depression is a cruel cruel bitch).


**TL;DR: I am 26 years old, burnt out from working in IT already. Graduated with a CS degree from a decent private school three years ago. Want to switch to a career where everything I do isn't reactionary on a day to day basis, preferably in software development. I don't know what to do to get there. I am hoping this subreddit can give me some advice/point me in the right direction on my next steps.**"

Wrong school?,whatitdo54,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1shvo6/did_i_pick_the_right_major_wrong_school/,"I'm a 3rd year Computer Information Systems major and I keep thinking to myself, did I pick the right major? Some background: I have never been great at C++ programming. My introductory comp sci course was in C++ and I understood most of it and had an easy time until we got to some of the more complicated stuff like arrays, still passed class with c+. My intermediate programming course I struggled in a lot and got a lot help from a friend who was at the time in upper division CIS. I relied heavily on his coding and became reliant on it by the time I made it to my advanced programming course, data structures.

I have had two internships at the same hospital every summer so far doing some light .NET and ASP.NET programming as well as some web work - HTML, CSS, and some database work. I picked up HTML/CSS relatively fast and I really enjoy making web pages. On the other hand it took some mentoring from a coworker at my internship to learn .NET and databases since I hadn't taken any courses in either yet. After about a month or so I was a lot less reliant on my coworker, and understood databases fairly well. I'm not great with C# but I can manage. I will most likely have an internship there again this summer and start my career there after I graduate.

Fast forward to now and I work at the university I attend as a part-time web developer, and I enjoy my work and got a pay raise within the first month I started work. I'm currently taking a class in assembly language and digital circuits and I'm not doing so hot. I didn't have too much trouble with assembly language but I struggle with sequential circuits, flip flops, you name it. I'm also taking a networking class where we've had to do a few projects in C++ and again I have relied on my friend who is now almost graduated, however, I do really well on the tests in that class and will most likely pass with an A.

So basically, I suck at C++, digital circuits are not my thing, I'm ok with C#, I enjoy web developing (HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript), and I know what I'm doing in regards to databases. My main concern however, is that my university bases many of the courses on C++ and my friend won't always be around to help me when it comes to C++. Did I pick the wrong school? Wrong major? (business courses that go with my major come easily to me so their not an issue)"

Basically I recently graduated from University with a Master's (I think Master's degree has same meaning in Europe and the US ? Basically five years in University and now my studies are over) and now I'm looking for a job. Many (if not most) of the ads that I've seen on various sites require at least 3 years of experience ""in the field"". That makes me sad because obviously as a ""just-graduated"" person, if I'm being honest I have at most 6 months of experience (my end-studies internship).

But still I've worked on university projects as well as personal ones, so it's not like I've ""never done anything"". How ""flexible"" are those requirements ? Is it pointless to apply for something that requires, say, 2-3 years of experience or is it just their way to ""try to attract good candidates"" ? Obviously I am not going to apply to any job with ""senior"" in the title because that makes no sense, but honestly I have seen perhaps one job title that explicitly said ""0-2 years, intended for people who want to break into the industry"" (not going to lie, it's the videogame industry since I have a programming and AI background, if I can't get a job in this industry though I'll broaden my search for other programming/developing jobs but... I know I'd get crazy or depressed if I worked for something like a bank)

Side questions since I know at least half of Reddit is from the US : how low are my chances to be hired by a US-based company as a European (French) citizen ? I've seen some company explicitly mention that it is possible (such as Riot Games), but most don't mention it at all.

1sgpq0,2,2013-12-09,Id like to map and frame my roadtrip as i move cross country.,DEEPfrom1,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/1sgpq0/id_like_to_map_and_frame_my_roadtrip_as_i_move/,"Hi, I'll be moving from NY to CA in 21 days. I have ARCgis on my pc (still learning it). 

I am curious how I would go about mapping my road trip so I am able to print and frame it? Is the ARC iphone able to do this then import in to ArcMap?

Any ideas a here would be great. My summer internship I mapped catch basins but used a Trimble Juno, which i no longer have.

I think this will make for neat art and great memories. 

Thanks!"
1sg68b,6,2013-12-09,Software Development internship/apprenticeship without being in school,xormancer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sg68b/software_development_internshipapprenticeship/,"I'm interested in doing a software development internship, but I'm not currently a student, and I have a Political Science BA. I'm willing to do/work with anything when it comes to fields/languages, though the only language that I currently have any sort of competency in would be Ruby, and I would still consider myself a novice.

I'd just like to know if anyone could recommend a place to look for an internship or apprentice program if I'm not currently in college. I'm willing to relocate to just about anywhere in the country. I'm currently in Southern California.

I'm currently working on learning Chef and systems engineering/automation, so something relating to that would be ideal, but, as I said earlier, I'm open to anything.

Thanks!"
1sg1xw,1,2013-12-09,How should I prepare to get a web development internship at Mozilla?,pydude,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1sg1xw/how_should_i_prepare_to_get_a_web_development/,"I'm a amatuer web developer and I'm in love with Mozilla. I would really love to intern at Mozilla and experience the awesome culture while working with those great people. 


I'm somewhat experienced in Python. I have contributed to several opensource projects and have participated successfully in Google Summer of Code in the past. I'm also contributing small patches to Mozilla's webdev projects.


I would love some advice on how to prepare for a web development internship at Mozilla. Somehow I always feel that I'm not that good a programmer to apply. I would really like prepare myself well enough to feel confident about applying."

I am on the second year of CS and im an intern at a company where we use basically php for every web based system. This days we will have another system to implement and i can have a real chance of building it the way i want to (the others programmers there have more important things to do) so i want to move away from php.

The reason is because i think php is messy, and everything we build on it end up messy as well (we use wordpress and yii). I am not saying it is bad, maybe we are just to lazy to make thing the way thay should on php, but i would like to make this new system in another language/framework. So where do i should look? Ruby? Python? Or just use another framework for php?

Sorry for the long post."

So here's my brief story: I recently decided to leave the field of finance to pursue what I believe to be my true career interests: either nonprofit or fashion merchandising. Since I have no experience, I was looking to build experience by volunteering/doing unpaid internships. In order to support myself, I was looking to work part-time (20-30 hours a week) in an office setting, perhaps in an admin assistant role. 

Can anyone assist or connect me with someone that can? As stated above, I have a background in financial planning &amp; analysis, in addition to IT, Operations, administrative assistance, event planning, and accounts receivables. Computer savvy here with heavy Excel experience.

1skrqv,1,2013-12-10,I am taking next semester off. What can I do to improve myself?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1skrqv/i_am_taking_next_semester_off_what_can_i_do_to/,"Hi friends. I am currently a first semester sophomore CS student. I am taking the Spring semester off for personal reasons. Although I plan to get a job (part time or full time), I'll still have plenty of time that I think can be used productively. I have only taken Computer Science I, and we learned C++ (we stopped at two dimensional arrays). I liked it and got an A.

I was thinking of learning a language or something, or continuing with C++ with a book. I was not really sure since I am leaning towards web development as an interest. But I was also thinking about learning more abstract but crucial subjects such as Algorithms/Data Structures. Or at least trying to get a basic understanding of them. I really do find the math behind CS to be interesting and useful. Anyway, sorry for rambling. What am I asking here is for resources/books/ideas of how to make the most out of the semester and summer I will be off, so that maybe next school year I can land an internship or at the very least have a better résumé and knowledge of computer science.

Thank you!"
1sklyq,3,2013-12-10,Are internships or github projects more beneficial for a computer science undergrad?,AManWhoSaysNo,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sklyq/are_internships_or_github_projects_more/,"I'm sure this has been asked before, but I can't come to a conclusion. I'm going into my sophomore year as a Computer Science major, and I've looked around the subreddit for awhile now and 90% of the suggestions for people seem to be either: ""Look for internships"" or ""Start some gitHub projects."" So I was wondering which of these would help me to learn more of what I need to know. I suppose pursuing both is an option, but I've already got a part-time job and school, so I'd rather just focus on one to keep me from being stretched to thin.

I'm leaning more towards just starting my own projects, because I feel that I would lack the necessary knowledge to gain/complete an internship. I'm only 3 semesters into my Comp Sci Degree (My Gen Eds are finished though.) and to make matters worse I'm attending a Community College, so I'm worried that what I've learned so far is inadequate (I've only learned C/C++/Python). When I actually type this all out, it actually feels silly to even consider an internship, but I had to ask. Any advice is greatly appreciated because as an inexperienced 19-year-old, I feel like I have little to no direction at all right now. I'm also terrified of not being able to have a job (compulsively), so I'm more than willing to do anything at all to better myself in this aspect. Thanks in advance."

[How do you feel about Rupert Murdoch buying a stake in Vice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdye11e?context=5)|It was actually 21st Century FOX that bought 5% not Murdoch directly.
 |The great majority of the equity is held by the founders and they control the company still. I'm a big fan of Shane and think he knows what he is doing.
 |With VICE I get to do better work in further away places and I don't think this will change.
 |As a journalist I try to avoid the politics and business and just stick to reporting honest information, nothing will ever change that either.

 |Like most uprisings more people come after police get violent. If they try to evict by force or attack protesters more people will come.
 |Also, if the rumors are true that Yanukovich will sign/ has signed a deal with Russia to join the customs union, people will be angry.
[I know it's extremely early to start placing this in its historical context, but to what extent do you see the Arab Spring providing impetus or context for this uprising? Do you think we'll come to view this as an extension of that turmoil or more as another chapter in the conflict between ""Russia"" and the former Soviet states?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd0l9?context=5)|Short Answer from a local.

But it seems recently that the police have backed down a bit. There were some clashes this morning and last night but today the police were calm.
[Why is Vice's website filled with stupid, weird articles alongside awesome stuff like what you're doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygifz?context=5)|Different strokes for different folks!

 |I take questions and direction while I'm live! You can ask me to check out certain areas and interview people!
[The Ukranian protesters seem to have gained the government's ear in a way that American protesters have not. When you consider, say, OWS, do you think the contrast is due to the underlying urgency of the issue, a more effective approach to protesting, or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdycwpy?context=5)|The protesters here have support from some of the political opposition parties. Three parties formed a coalition a while ago and are backing the protests.
 |Most people seem to want new elections immediately. Many people Ive spoken with see politicians as the experts who should take care of the politics.
[Thank you so much for your work! Been following since your excellent live feed from OWS during the November raid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd9wb?context=5)|I think the role of the journalist is to collect as much information as possible and share it with the world so that they can decide what they think is best. There are a lot of gray areas with context and such, but I really think that if we have informed people we are more likely to get successful decisions.
[What do you think of the new journalistic project led by Glenn Greenwald and backed by Omidyar, and where do you stand on the debate about the value of (non-\)bias in journalism? (Some great quotes to reference in here: Link to www.nytimes.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd9wb?context=5)|There is no objective journalism, but there is integrity. I would never use lack of objectivity as an excuse to lie or omit information.
[As an independent journalist who has previously worked for little to nothing, how do you feel about the practice of unpaid internships in news media organizations? Do you feel they are a form of worker exploitation? Would most news media organizations be able to survive if they had to pay their interns minimum wage, and if so, should they?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd9wb?context=5)|Unpaid internships exist so people can learn not so that you can get cheap labor. They shouldn't be doing vital work ad if they do, pay them!
[Do you think the impact of OWS helped to elect NY mayor elect Bill de Blasio? Do you have hopes for him to follow through on his campaign promises on taxing the 1% and stop and frisk?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyd9wb?context=5)|Dont know enough about de Blasio, sorry :\
[How much support do the protesters want or expect from the outside world? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydny0?context=5)|Not so much from individuals but from the EU.
[How hopeful are the protesters that this sort of action can bring about real change in their country? How likely do you think it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygcnf?context=5)|Its hard to know, but a few people have told me ""we are passed the point of no return"" and that there will be some change no matter how minor.

[Hey Tim,  Have you, at any point doing your coverage, felt that your life or well being was in danger?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydubn?context=5)|When people start shooting things it gets scary but you have to be alert, you can't panic. I always make sure I know what is happening around me and where my exists are. Being brave doesn't always mean you aren't scared.
[Have you gotten any Pulitzer worthy stuff over there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydtam?context=5)|I dont know how that stuff works. Im just honored to be here witnessing history!
[Does it seem as if the general population is in support of the protesting? Or is more of a group of people going rogue to the disgust of the populace? The media coverage is rather sparse in the USA if what is actually happening.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfl0u?context=5)|To me yes, there were 400,000-500,000 people here in Kyiv on Sunday. It definitely seems to be a popular movement. 
[From what you've seen already being there, is it possible it may ever escalate into some sort of civil war like Egypt had/has? Also, what's the most violent course of action that's been taken thus far?

If so, how are they being received by the crowds?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyex3n?context=5)|There are some people here who Im told are affiliated with Golden Dawn. Short answer is yes.
[The far-right Ukrainian nationalist party Svoboda has been orchestrating fascist riots amidst the demonstrations, defacing public and private property, beating up ethnic minorities, etc. etc.  Do they have a strong presence amidst the uprisings or are they just a fringe group of crazy?  What are the chances these fascists might seize power or gain popular support?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfaly?context=5)|From what I understand its not likely Svoboda wins, but there are many different nationalist organizations that are influencing the protests, particularly the information center and security.
 |Im told there are some far right protesters starting fights as well.
 |Its important to know that no one thinks they are fascist though.
[The one time I visited Ukraine it appeared to be run by gangsters everyone else appeared to be struggling to get by.  It also seemed to be closed to the western world I saw no other tourists.  Are there still overt signs of the mafia running things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyf59a?context=5)|I dont know about a mafia, but Im told by many people that money runs Ukraine and many people are corrupt. Students pay teachers so they dont have to take exams, etc.

 |If you need something money gets it, whether legal or not.
[Have you seen any network/infrastructure problems that may be the result of tampering or government shutdown?  Like what we saw in Tunisia or Egypt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydh7j?context=5)|I've heard reports that they have shutdown cell service but haven't experienced it myself. They use CDMA here which surprised me!
[Simple Question: Why do you think the Ukrainian Government backed out of the deal?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydkdx?context=5)|[Link to instagram.com](http://instagram.com/p/hwKjsoL5s7/)
[Ignore the haters, I'm interested in what you have to say.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfb9u?context=5)|Its a mix of everyone from activists, ordinary citizens, and the political parties.
[By and large, who has been responsible for organizing the protests? Any particular opposition groups involved, or has it been more spontaneous than that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfb9u?context=5)|The opposition parties that back the protest are: Freedom Fatherland Punch.

Though many feel like the EU can help end the corruption.
[Besides the riots, how do you like Ukraine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfi3p?context=5)|I wouldn't call them riots but other than that the food is really great!
[Even if the protests bring about new leadership, do you think Ukraine can ever leave behind the culture of corruption left behind from the Soviet Union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdydte7?context=5)|Its hard to say, many people here hope that the EU will wash away the corruption.
[Would you say that Ukraines past experience as a satellite state of the USSR is a major influence on the anti-russian sentiment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfxan?context=5)|There are a few signs that say ""no to occupation, yes to integration"" and the word occupation has the sickle and hammer on it and blood dripping from it.
 |Personally I would say that sentiment is definitely here, but how pervasive is hard to say.
[How did you get involved working for VICE/VBS? I've been trying to find a way to contribute as a videographer, and ever since my hero Tim Hetherington was killed, I want to do it more than ever. I love your work. Stay safe.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyftfk?context=5)|I just started covering news on my own through social media, eventually people took notice. Don't lose focus and don't give up, as long as you keep producing work eventually people will find it.
 |Might not be the best answer but there isn't a secret other than work+sacrifice+luck.
[Thanks for the ama! Do the Ukrainian protesters, in general, seem more upset at missing a chance to become a part of the EU OR are they more upset about the government appearing to cozy up with Russia? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyfo90?context=5)|In the beginning it was about the EU but it seems now its more about corruption, less about EU or Russia.
[How does this compare to men in Colombia having sex with donkeys? That's the last Vice report that I saw. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyhdwb?context=5)|Donkey sex isn't my beat, I usually cover technology and conflict.
[I can't recall where I read this, but is it true that there is a not so small presence of far-right, nationalistic and possibly neo-nazi groups involved in the protests? Golden Dawn-esque type?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyh16t?context=5)|Im told there is a group here affiliated with the Golden Dawn. In terms of nationalistic, many people here are singing the national anthem and waving the Ukrainian flag. It reminds me a bit of Tea Party rallies.
[How is this different (or similar to\) the protests in Turkey?  Meaning that this seems to be a protest of the current generation; does it resonate at all with older folks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygp64?context=5)|Well for one political parties are backing the protests here.
 |It seems due to the politics there is a standoff, police aren't being as aggressive but protesters are building up barricades/tents fast.
[So many of us take this for granted but seeing a thread where someone is essentially broadcasting live from a news location and receiving feedback in real time is incredible.  In my case from someone with a phone in a pub.  It drives home how far tech has come and how versatile it can be (over the last ten years certainly, but I'm 40 and things have moved apace all my life\).  So the question is, how do you foresee advances in tech making your particular role even more immediate or relevant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyjday?context=5)|Right now I'm working on drones, smartwatches, mobile apps, and Google Glass.

[What was your career like before you worked for VICE? I'm a freelance journalist myself, and I've applied for a few positions at VICE. What advice can you offer me?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyiy5g?context=5)|The people here corrected me many times, they want it spelled Kyiv. Also on google maps its spelled Kyiv.
[Also why did you choose to title this using the Ukrainian ""Kyiv"" instead of the more internationally recognizable ""Kiev""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyiy5g?context=5)|Before VICE I was just roaming about the US and Europe(a bit) reporting on events I saw as important. I also work on technology and have a few apps in development.

 |The government wants to hold its ground and wait for the protests to fizzle out.
[Is it just stylish for us to start spelling Kiev as Kyiv now?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdygxb1?context=5)|People here have asked me to stop typing Kiev and start typing Kyiv. If you look at Google Maps it says 'Kyiv'
[Have you talked to or seen any really nationalist people who do not have a problem with it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyemvo?context=5)|At least here, most people support the protests. But I'm told its divided elsewhere. There are a lot of nationalists here that sing the national anthem and wave flags.
[As a student studying anthropology and journalism, what do i need to get an internship or after graduation a job at Vice? What you are doing is basically my dream of what i would like to do in my life.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sk4lx/hey_reddit_tim_pool_here_reporting_from_the/cdyld7y?context=5)|I just went out and did it. For two years I was living off of savings and crowd funding to travel and report news. Best advice I can give you is to get out there and do what you love. Not sure about specific hiring though I just report.

It looks good and pays good for an average internship.  Plus it's in a field I wanna continue.  
But I've been taking hard classes and working 15 - 20 hours a weeks.  I was already a busy person.  Involved in a club and intramurals.  It's killing me.  My GPA took a good hit and I failed my math final so I probably will get a D and have to retake it.  I'll pass two of my CS classes will a C and one with an A. I'm pretty stress out since I'm probably retaking my math course because of a test.  
Anyways my GPA was a 3.5, after this semester it'll go down to a ~3.0.
Fuck."

We're a family of 4. me, my sister, my mom, and my dad. My mom and sister are at home. My sister is in high school. My dad has been working overseas for years (10+) and me and my sister have not seen him in almost 5 years. My father has also been trying to start a successful business for years, however unfortunately it has not always worked out as currently we are in debt, house is mortgaged, and the the only source of income in the family now is my mother's minimal wage job that does not provide consistent hours (sometimes don't even get to work during a week) and my part time internship (pay is good but i am only working two days a week until march of next year before my contract is over). So there's a huge need of me finding a solid entry level job to support the family, as there will not be any income coming from my father the next few years. This felt like quite the financial burden for myself to have to support my family right out of college (aside from that i still have my own college loan and still need to get a car) money will be very tight at least for the next 5 years or so.
Although the money money has stressed me out, i've just accepted the fact that things were going to be like this and i was going to be ok with. 2 days ago, my father called my mom from overseas. Last night my aunt called me, and told me the details of the call as i belive my mother still doesn't want me to worry and be able to focus on finals and job search. But my aunt told me that during the phone call, my dad told my mom that the financial situation of his business is so bad its operating at a loss. If he can't figure it out he would go buy life insurance and go suicide. my heart dropped as i heard that. i don't quite know how to process this in my head. I think i'm leveled headed enough to know that i need to stay productive and focus on my finals and job search but... it's hard.
I've always put a blame on my father in my mind that if he would be willing to go come back home and work a lowly paying job that's more consistent rather than lose money trying to start businesses that our life would be better. truth is that i really just wanted him to be here, as i grew up, he wasn't here for any graduation or really any significant event in my life. i feel like i don't even know him as a person. However, i don't care how poor we are, I just want him to come home and so we can struggle together instead of apart...."

the build should have been an exact replica of a build on youtube (which works), but the shop where i ordered didn't have the graphics card of said build. therefore they offered me to upgrade to another graphics card for the same price, and they upgraded my powersupply too so the new graphics card gets enough power.

i leave you with the parts i picked and hope that one of you has a clue where faults may be:

Intel Core i5 4570 4x 3.20GHz So.1150 BOX

8GB (2x 4096MB) Crucial Ballistix Sport DDR3-1600 DIMM CL9-9-9-24 Dual Kit

--------
-i checked that the mainboard is short-circuit free. i tried out the mainboard + 1 RAM stick + the graphicscard + the intel chip outside of the case (so the minimal components inside the mainboard), powered it up, and the on-and-off-turning-problem still remains.

things i checked/noticed to solve the problem:

-i checked that the mainboard doesn't get short-circuits from the case.

-the graphicscard AND the RAM-sticks are perfectly in place. yes, they are completely pushed in.

-all fans are turning when it's ""on"" for a short time. when the pc shuts down the front fan of the case stops first, then the fan of the powersupply, then the rest of the fans stop. (the case has 3 fans, the chip came with one fan to cool it, the graphicscard has 2 fans an there is a fan inside the powersupply)

-i kept myself anti-static during while working on the pc

-the intel-chip was put onto the mainboard with caution. no pins are damaged on the mainboards chip slot OR the chip.

-CPU power cable is plugged into the right spot on the top right of the card.

-i checked the ram sticks in all possible configurations with both a single stick or both sticks. the pc stays much longer ""on"" when only one stick of RAM is in the RAM slots.

-the fan that came with the intel chip is properly plugged in (i heard it can cause short-circuits) and receives power from the right mainboard slot (i heard some PCs don't turn on when the CPU-fan isn't powered).

questions i have:
-what faults could i have made with the wirering of the fans/HDD/DVD drive? could this be the problem?

-is my mainbard broken maybe?

-is the 530W of the ""BeQuiet!"" Powersupply enough for my Graphicscard? On Phone i was told that the upgrade i got would be enough. did they trick me? 

-is there something i could have done wrong elsewhere? i read the manuals off all the parts, but still, may i have wired something wrong?

-could the problem be a short-circuit somewhere (if yes, where could they occur?)

PS: sorry for the wall of text :S
PPS: i am german, my english might not be perfect. the youtubevideo i mentioned is on german too.

1sju5s,6,2013-12-10,Having a lot of trouble trying to start a career in development; getting my first job. Is it better to have knowledge of many languages or high proficiency in a one or two?,Ziberzaba,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sju5s/having_a_lot_of_trouble_trying_to_start_a_career/,"I just turned 30, and received my BS on physics last spring.  I did a 2 year internship that involved learning Python and MATLAB in my last year there.  This is where I discovered and fell in love with programming.  I find it to be an excellent mesh of creativity and problem solving.  I have been trying to find an entry level dev job since August, and so far am having very little success.  When I do get call backs they ask about skills/languages I never listed on my resume or stated I knew in my cover letter.  They then thank me for my time and tell me I'm not what they are looking for.  
  
This has happened probably four or five times now, and it is getting really frustrating.  I have continued to improve my Python skills; and am becoming very proficient, but recently I've been dedicating my time to increase the number of languages I know.  I've learned SQL, HTML / CSS over the past two months, and I'm about to start either PHP or JavaScript.  The problem is that while I'm learning syntax and commands, I'm not really ""working"" with these languages.  So my experience remains very superficial.  Should I be worried about this?  
  
So I here are my questions.  Is it better that I dedicate my time to becoming an excellent Python developer, or should I continue down the track of learning as many languages as I can as quickly as possible at a more superficial level?  Secondly, where should I be looking for these types of positions?  I've been applying to dev jobs on Dice, Indeed, and Sologig, with little success.  What are some other options?  Has anyone had luck finding entry-level work through consulting firms?  I'm really becoming scared that I won't find anything."
1sjn88,0,2013-12-10,Any advice for a recent graduate? Am I being pigeonholed?,nice_apple,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1sjn88/any_advice_for_a_recent_graduate_am_i_being/,"Ok. So I graduated in July with a 2:1 in Archaeology from a top ten university in the UK and basically since then I've only had a 3 day a week internship (which I only managed to get through nepotism). I've been looking for part time jobs in retail and such to help me get experience and enough money to live but I never get even a single reply or interview.

I feel that my background involves too much archaeology and that employers just cannot see it as relevant to them. I was very good with my money throughout university and because my family is poor as fuck I got huge amounts of extra grants and bursaries, I didn't need extra money so I didn't need a part time job. Thats not to say I wasn't busy, I was sailing in the university first team and was their bosun almost from the start of first year. I helped to found and edit an on campus technology and science magazine, hacking my way through red tape every step of the way. I took extra lessons in Russian and can hold short conversations.

In addition to this rather than spend my summers sat on my ass I got involved in a massive archaeological project going on long periods of excavation and doing well, some very physically and intellectually demanding work. In addition to this I continued to help the project during  term time through finds processing, lab work and quite a bit of messing with maps using various programs, in short I've been involved, done a lot and pretty much filled my days, reaching a ridiculous 70 hour week during my third year (I remember a time a long time ago when bank holidays and weekends were a thing).

I havn't done badly with larger companies and grad schemes, I have assessment centres coming up with IBM, Thales, Accenture and the Foreign office, however I'm very aware that my chances of actually getting a job from these is slim at best. 

For part time work no one will take me to even an interview, not even to work over Christmas in some shop, I have got nowhere with applying directly for entry level roles either, is stacking shelves for a few months really worth more to people than anything I have done or do people simply see ""He did archaeology, he isn't relevant to me""? and another thing, why do the larger companies not seem to care so much about a lack of work experience? Why am I less successful trying to get a job serving coffee than serving in the diplomatic corps?"
1sjegh,62,2013-12-10,It's your fault that it's broken!,cowbeef01,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/1sjegh/its_your_fault_that_its_broken/,"Hello everybody, first story yada yada yada you know it.

Bit of a backstory: I intern at a hospital as workplace manager. I fix computers and everything associated with computers. It's a fun job but the users can be insane.

So a few days ago we got a COW (computer on wheels, a laptop inside a cart) that was broken. The cart was broken, the computer was fine. We send the cart away to get it fixed. A day later we got a message saying it couldn't get fixed. We prepared a new cart for the users to use. This cart is a bit different compared to the old cart though, since you can't turn it back on easily. You have to unlock the cart to turn the computer back on. Of course there's a warning on the cart indicating that you should NOT turn off the computer. Anyway we deliver the COW and everything is great.


Skip forward to today. I got a call saying that the cow turned off... of course it turned off. I arrived and turned it back on and asked the people around if they could send an e-mail to the departement asking if they would not turn it off. I was about to leave when a doctor came and he was shouting saying that this system sucks because when you take away the note you couldn't see the message indicating that you shouldn't turn off the computer. Of course there was another sticker that you really have to force to get off the cart indicating this but the doctor wasn't satisfied. He went on ranting and demanding that they get the old cart back. I simply tell him that we can't do this since the old cart is broken BY THEM and we don't have any spares. He goes back into another room while shouting all sorts of things.


Call closed, mistake by user.


EDIT: Got a phone call from the head of the departement. He calls this situation ""Not possible to work in"" and demands something to be done with... Re-directed him to my boss/internship manager to deal with. (best we can do is drill a hole in the cart just so they can squirm their fingers in when they miss easy to follow directions."
1sjamp,13,2013-12-10,Am I asking for too much money as a young web developer?,webdevthrow,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1sjamp/am_i_asking_for_too_much_money_as_a_young_web/,"I'm 17 and currently have a job as a Front End Web Developer for a software company. Here's the facts about my position:


* I wasn't hired as an intern.
* The CEO reached out to me in an email with the subject ""Front-End Developer"", after that my title was never discussed. 
* I was hired at the beginning of last summer but in a few days I'll have been working for them for six months.
* I replaced an adult who had this job.
* I am a full employee with benefits, 401(k), all the amenities my 30+ age coworkers have, etc
* During the summer I worked full time (12ish hours a day) in the office but I now work from home on a computer they've provided me
* Two or three times during the summer (some time after I was hired without mention of internship) I was introduced as ""the summer intern"" or ""intern"", which was off-putting and worrying because I did not think that was my title.
* Before this job I had 2-3 years work experience, mostly in web development, some in android development. I came into the job with ample experience, there was never a big learning curve or a feeling of being in over my head.

Despite all this my hourly pay is $15, or roughly $31k. 

Indeed.com says the average salary in my city for a Front-End Web Developer is $85k or about $44. I understand that being 17 and without lots of experience means lower pay, but I feel like $15 is still too low. I've done contract work for $35 which the client was very pleased with.

The company isn't exactly strapped for cash either. The whole office is Macs, the CEO has a house worth between $5M-$10M, we use $500 a pop stock images, etc.

I have a feeling part of my low pay is how I slipped up in the interview and told the CEO that my parents would match anything I save for college which means he doesn't need to pay me as much (he even made a joke to someone else in front of me about how he did this). The problem is that I no longer plan to go to college (he doesn't know this).

When he told me my hourly pay he wrote it as ""I would like to start your pay at $15.00"" which I feel like implies the opportunity for it to go up later.

Would I be asking for too much by requesting a raise to $30/hour?

Because my major has nothing to do with music supervision, I'm anxious to get my degree and get out of here. I've come up with two plans:


**Plan 1:** Get an internship in the entertainment industry during the Spring 2015 semester. These are really competitive though, so I can't count on landing one. If I do get an internship, I'll graduate in May 2016.  

**Plan 2:** Stay in school for the Spring 2015 semester, and graduate the following semester (in Dec.) instead of May 2016 with the rest of my classmates.

* I could get school credit. Some places only offer internships for college credit. I won't be able to apply for those internships after I'm graduated.  
* I might be able to continue into the summer, thus accruing more work experience.


**Pros for graduating a semester early (Dec 2015):**  
* I'm not going to be making a lot of money after college because of the career I'm choosing, so I'm taking things like affordable housing into account. Apparently, apartment leases are cheaper in the winter because demand is less.  
* I get to be closer to the industry sooner.

I've had my first year in a real office position. In that year I've been promoted from intern, to Marketing Analyst, to Project Manager. With each move I expected something more satisfying but only discovered how depressing and unrewarding my career path has been; I want to correct my direction ASAP. The reality is that I'm over worked, under paid, and don't like what I'm doing. 

*What works*


In the past I've been a political campaign manager, landscaper, and security guard. I like being outdoors, interacting with people, and also helping in some way. I want a job where I'm doing something I'm passionate about(helping people/environment), and that also keeps me moving physically. I'm a hands on person and like to be able to do things rather than plan and coordinate. 

*Things I'm considering*


I'm having a hard time finding a job that would utilize my abilities, experience, and education. I've considered a construction management, but was off-put by much of the planning. I've thought about being a Park Ranger or going into Law enforcement but am uncertain about committing to something I might not end up liking. 


I'm really interested in others input, but it also certainly helps just to get this out there. Thanks. "

My astronomer friends snap a photo for me every once in awhile but there is no plan for a dedicated science campaign.
[How did the idea of a sample return mission from an asteroid came about? What is the inspiration behind it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|The OSIRIS-REx concept originated with Lockheed-Martin, who is always looking for new Principal Investigators for their planetary science missions. They approached Mike Drake, the original PI, in 2004 about collaborating on a sample-return mission. Mike invited me to be his Deputy at that time - which I gladly accepted. Mike and I worked on the mission concept for seven years before being accepted by NASA. Mike passed away in September 2011 - four months after winning the contract. I was promoted to PI at that time.

However, we need to not only get to Bennu - but also go in the same direction at the same speed. Thus, if we get there more quickly, we need giant rocket engines and a lot of fuel to slow down for the rendezvous.
[What is the story behind the name Osiris Rex and its Egyptian theme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|I came up with the name based on the mythology of Osiris as the bringer of life to the Nile Valley - Bennu represents the type of object that may have brought the seeds of life to Earth. It is also a crazy acronym - which fits in with the way NASA names their missions,
[What will happen to Osiris Rex after it return, will it remain in orbit or crash or an extension mission will be planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx will eject the sample return capsule four hours before the spacecraft hits the top of the atmosphere at 27,000 mph. The spacecraft will then perform a deflection burn and be placed into a stable heliocentric orbit that will not intersect any object of astrobiological interest (planetary protection requirement). It may be available for an extended mission at the discretion of NASA.

Thanks in advance. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw1gq?context=5)|We have fragments of Chelyabinsk in our lab at the University of Arizona and are actively studying it. It snuck up on us because it came out of the Sun and it was a relatively small object - we are mandated by Congress to detect objects 140-m in diameter and larger - the Chelyabinsk bolide was ~20-m across.
[Awesome work! I'm wondering, how and why was Bennu selected for this mission? Do we know if we will be able to even retrieve a sample from it? (ie: do we know the composition of the surface? Are there enough small rocks on it to collect?\) Also, as a current U of A undergraduate (Aerospace Engineering\), what's the best way for a student to become involved in this kind of work/field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwys9?context=5)|Target selection for OSIRIS-REx was originally driven by engineering constraints. First, we decided to use a Lockheed-Martin heritage spacecraft. That meant using solar power and trying to keep the thermal control system relatively simple. Using solar power limited how far out into the Solar System we could travel - setting a limit of 1.8 AU on the aphelion of the target's orbit. The thermal control limit constrained how close to the Sun we could go - limiting the perihelion of the orbit. Together these two constraints defined the semi-major axis and eccentricity of potential targets.
 |The next constraint was the total energy of the mission. We needed a target with relatively low delta-V (total change in velocity). We also needed a trajectory that limited the re-entry velocity of the Sample Return Capsule - since we are using a heritage design from the Stardust mission. These parameters limited the inclination of the asteroid orbit to less than 10 degrees.
 |These orbital constraints rapidly collapsed the number of potential targets to around 200 asteroids. The next constraint was on the size of the object. It turns out that asteroids smaller than ~200 meters tend to be rapid rotators - some spinning once every minute or so. We used absolute magnitude as a proxy for size - dropping the number of potential targets to about 20.
 |The final criterion was driven by science. We wanted a target that was likely to be rich in carbon and water - a carbonaceous asteroid. Of the twenty or so targets that met our dynamical constraints - only five were known to have low albedo and therefore likely to be carbonaceous. Bennu rose to the top of the list based on the extensive ground-based data set - particularly the fantastic shape model information that had been obtained from the Arecibo and Goldstone Planetary Radar telescopes.
 |There are three lines of evidence that constrain the average grain size on Bennu. First, in addition to the shape model, the radar astronomy also provided information on the radar polarization ratio. Basically, we transmit a beam with a specific circular polarization and measure how much of the returned energy comes back with the opposite polarization. These data show that the transition to radar roughness occurs at a scale smaller than lowest radar wavelength - 3 cm.
 |Next, we used the Spitzer space telescope to determine the average thermal inertia of the surface. Lower thermal inertia values mean smaller grain sizes. These data suggest that the average grain size on Bennu is on the order of a millimeter.
 |Finally, the asteroid shape reveals a prominent ridge at the equator - suggesting that there is loose material moving around on the surface and collecting at the geopotential lows (the valleys of Bennu) - which lie at the equator.

[What's the biggest challenge in designing the reentry capsule? Also could I get an internet high five?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwhoz?context=5)|The good news is that we are reusing the capsule design from the NASA Stardust mission. The only modification that is required is on the main deck to accommodate our sample collection device, which is different from Stardust. This is a minor modification - the SRC is one of the easy parts!
[How do you hope to tie in your investigations at Bennu to those of Dawn at Ceres? If so, what are your plans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw8ju?context=5)|Ceres is a C-type asteroid - so slightly different spectroscopically from Bennu. However, we will have data that is comparable to the Dawn VIR instrument, so that will be an interesting study. We are more spectrally similar to Pallas - which is a B-type asteroid like Bennu. We have no plans to perform the comparative study - sounds like a great opportunity for a participating scientist!
[Did your mission engineers take any cues from the Hayabusa probe? What steps are they planning to take to avoid computer glitches during the sample collection phase?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxw8ju?context=5)|We have studied the Hayabusa mission intently. Our main take away messages are to 1) allow enough time for the team to thoroughly characterize Bennu before sampling; 2) simulate the descent to the asteroid surface thousands of times before committing to the sampling; 3) perform a series of rehearsals for each stage of the sampling sequence - plan on repeating each step if one does not go according to pan; and 4) fly capable reaction wheels - this failure doomed Hayabusa from the start.

 |Because of the way that the Federal Government operates - the budget is secure through January 15, 2014 - when the current continuing resolution expires. However, we are a high priority for NASA planetary science and have strong support in Congress so we are confident that our funding will continue to be authorized.

[Hello Dr. Lauretta, I realize that there are many components to this project, but this question is in regards to the possible presence of the building blocks of life. I have read a few papers discussing the resistance of certain microbes to our most robust antimicrobial techniques (ex. UV light, saline solutions\).  How would microbiologists recognize pristine extraterrestrial proteins or nucleic acids?  How will you keep your clean room clean?  --Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxx7nn?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx has a level-1 requirement to return a ""pristine"" sample of Bennu. We have a pragmatic definition of pristine - which means that no foreign material introduced into the sample will hamper the scientific investigation.
 |We split our contamination efforts into two categories - Contamination Control and Contamination Knowledge. Contamination Control seeks to minimize the contamination of the sample using prudent and established spacecraft fabrication processes. Contamination Knowledge seeks to document any contamination that may be introduced to the sample. Together we can both keep the sample clean and document any foreign material that is present in the returned sample.
 |The spacecraft fabrication clean room is a standard Class 10,000 room. The curation facility will be much cleaner - Class 100.
[What is the plan for extracting the sample from the asteriod?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxwugp?context=5)|We are using a device called the Touch-and-Go Sample Acquisition Mechanism ([TAGSAM](http://osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu/?q=spacecraftpayload/tagsam)). The basic concept is to contact the asteroid surface with a large air filter (something that would look right at home sitting on top of a carburetor from a '57 Chevy), then blast the surface with a pulse of high-purity nitrogen gas. The gas agitates and fluidizes the regolith, which expands into the TAGSAM device. If we fill the collection chamber - we have ~2 kilograms of material. TAGSAM can collect particles up to 3-cm across. We also have contact pads on the outer edge of TAGSAM. We will collect particles less than 1 millimeter as long as we touch the surface.  
[I read every comment and all of your replies.  This is so interesting, thank you.  I am not an expert, nor a student in this field, but a housewife married to a science fiction fanatic and we have 3 amateur astronomers.  My questions focus on when you are at your described third moment terror (which is my biggest moment of terror for you\)...the moment of TAG, when you send the spacecraft down to the surface of Bennu to collect the sample. What type of suction or attachment, if any, will you be using on the space craft to attach the landing?  Is the landing similar to a plane landing on an air craft carrier? Do you have a plan B in case it sticks too much to the asteroid?  A fun question if you prefer not to discuss my other questions:  What is the most common household item you will be using on this mission?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdy5z4t?context=5)|We do not have any system to anchor the spacecraft to the asteroid during sample acquisition. Instead, we have very tight control on the spacecraft state during the descent. We have to contact with an approach velocity of 10 cm/s (+/-2) and a lateral velocity of 0 cm/s (+/-2). The spacecraft can not be rotating about any of its axes. If we hit the surface under these conditions then our momentum will be absorbed by a constant-force spring in the robotic arm. If we start to rotate, the attitude control thrusters will engage to damp out any angular momentum. After five seconds of contact we fire our back-away thrusters and get out of dodge.
 |These back-away thrusters should be sufficient to unstick us from the surface. In the case where we are totally jammed our only option is to sever the sample head from the arm - but that would mean loss of the sample.
 |As for the most common household item - the spacecraft has a surprisingly large amount of tape on it! Though, of course, the tape is space qualified.

Can you expand on that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1sif2f/i_am_the_principal_investigator_for_the_nasa/cdxz1zt?context=5)|OSIRIS-REx will help us understand how asteroid satellites are formed. A leading theory for binary asteroid formation involves the [YORP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky%E2%80%93O%27Keefe%E2%80%93Radzievskii%E2%80%93Paddack_effect) effect. Basically, YORP acts to either increase or decrease the rotation rate of an asteroid. As an asteroid's spin rate increases - material will start to migrate from the poles down to the equator. This mechanism may be responsible for the observed equatorial ridge on Bennu. If the spin rate continues to increase - the material may be spun off the equator and accrete into a binary companion.

1sipx4,4,2013-12-09,IT intern looking for advice from professionals.,it_intern1,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1sipx4/it_intern_looking_for_advice_from_professionals/,"I'm a business continuity intern for a Fortune 500 outsourcing company. I was brought on after relentless (not sure if that's the right word) looking, emailing, and calling for an internship with this company. Not sure how I ended up in business continuity / disaster recovery, but there it is. I'm always eager to learn new things.

My supervisors have been very open-minded and generous with me (I'm their first intern), however, I don't feel like my heart is in business continuity. They've really tried to get me involved with clients, especially since I have a TS/SCI since it opens up more doors within business continuity. I really enjoy more technical things, such as scripting, administration, etc and I feel like business continuity isn't a great fit for me. I've also interned for a federal agency for IT security, which was great. I got to do some computer and network forensics and I *loved* it. 

I got to tour one of this company's data centers a few days ago and got the chance to browse through their SOC. I was actually pretty excited and super interested. I know the shifts suck (1 AM - 1 PM), but I'm willing to do that because I feel like that's where my career interests lie. 

I feel horrible because my supervisors have been so generous with me and now I want to jump ship into another business unit. If I were to stick with project management / business continuity, I feel like my ""chance"" to get experience in the more technical nature of IT will be lost. I feel like there's this ""fork"" in the road and I need to choose which path to go down. 

They're fast-tracking me into working in project management (which would require me to relocate to D.C. metro for TS/SCI-required clients). On the other hand of all this, I think I should be grateful for them getting me on board before I've even graduated (May). Then again, I have reservations about moving to D.C., because I really don't want to spend big bucks on cost of living. 

TL; DR: Company is fast-tracking me into project management, I feel bad because I want to jump ship into their SOC. Supervisors have been great in PM, so I feel seriously conflicted. 

I would greatly appreciate some career advice. "
1si5yn,1,2013-12-09,Making My Masters Count,Grogie,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1si5yn/making_my_masters_count/,"Hello /r/AskAcademia.  I am a 23 year old with an Undergrad in Engineering (B.Eng) and like most people my age I struggled finding a job right out of University.  However, my luck changed when I was offered and accepted (Fully Funded) a Masters of Computer Science and Operations Research (Thesis based).  I am pretty excited for this opportunity and want to make it ""count"" as much as possible.  I was inspired to ask this after listening to the [AoM Podcast with Dr. Jay](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/10/12/art-of-manliness-podcast-episode-51-the-defining-decade-with-dr-meg-jay/) and [the relevant TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/meg_jay_why_30_is_not_the_new_20.html).  

I definitely became a better student over my undergrad (going from a C student my first year to a mostly A student - with a B here and there - my last 4 trimesters).  I feel like I have become a good student and will do well academically.  I had a few internships and was able to learn a lot from them as well.  However, part of the talk focused around ""Identity Capital"", which I didn't fully understand but I believe it has to do with goals.  
I'm not 100% sure of my long term professional goals.  I have talked to another Professor of mine about his career as well.  I feel like I could relate to his story because he ""sort of stumbled"" into an academic career (i.e. it wasn't his goal to be a Professor when he started University).  As a result of our conversation, I have a plan sort of hammered out:

* During the academic year, focus professionally on school.  Funding and savings can cover living expenses
* Obtain relevant summer internships to expand (or maintain) my network and to make some coin for the winter months.

However, I am not 100% sure if I want, desire, or can be successful as Professional Academic (Professor, Researcher, et al.) or if trying to head off to industry in 2 years is the better option.
For me, I believe I have a short term goal, but as my long term professional goals I am not really sure what I want at the moment.  I think part of me that worries about making another long term goal is that where I am now is nowhere near the goal I had set out back when I was 19 or 20 (Which was being an EIT at Rio Tinto).  

So /r/AskAcademia: those of you who ""stumbled"" into the academic world:  

* What advice would you give to someone who is just starting out with his Masters and to make it ""count"" as much as possible?  
* For those who could relate to my story (i.e. hard time finding a job but when back to school right away) how did you make it count?  
* How about those that who can relate and went back to industry after the masters, what can I do to still make my self relevant? 

Thanks in advance!

I've never worked with XML files before, nor do I know how to parse them--but this is one of the first projects I wanted to do in order to get a better grasp of node.js. The reason why is because this is one of the problems I faced in an internship over the summer and had to request a developer to help me out. He ended up parsing the XML for me since we were on a time crunch. This time around, I'd really like to be able to do this myself.

My programming background includes two Intro to Java courses (one with my CS department and one with my MIS department since I switched majors), a course teaching Intro to Algorithms with Java, and a Systems Programming with C/C++ class--so I am very well acquainted with basic programming concepts and some intermediate concepts. 

So far, I've discovered this node module that allows me to parse XML to JSON (https://npmjs.org/package/xml2js) 

and another module which allows me to parse JSON to CSV 
(https://npmjs.org/package/jsoncsv)

Unfortunately, I'm not really able to understand how to use them due to my limited knowledge of node.js. 

I've also found this small tutorial

Because at least there's JOBS in CE unrelated to having your hand up a cow's butt!

But I keep failing. I really enjoy CE but I'm a Super Senior and I still have three semester's worth of garbage to finish. Plus I'm going to flunk out again this semester.  The earliest I can graduate now is Fall 2015. I will be 27. I will have been in college for 8 years.

I've failed. I have worked for them for a year and loved every second. I've been on awesome projects and been given responsibilities most interns just don't get.

Here I am failing again. Reddit, I am so depressed and tired and utterly gutted by college. I want to drop out and get a job. I just want to go and get a job as an engineer, even at half the pay because I don't think I can make it through another two years here.

 I know college is the right thing but after two years of telling my parents and everyone in my family more and more delayed graduation times I just can't do it anymore. I suck. College is not for me. I should never have come here."
1snb21,4,2013-12-11,"Trying to decide if it makes sense to get a Masters in something CS related-- if so, trying to decide between Stats &amp; CS.",jwdink,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1snb21/trying_to_decide_if_it_makes_sense_to_get_a/,"Hi Folks,

I asked a related question recently, but I didn't get a ton of response, and circumstances have changed slightly anyways.

I'm currently in a PhD program for cognitive psychology. Academia's tough, and it would be good to have some marketable non-academia skills, as a backup. Luckily, I'm pretty good at programming, get a good amount of practice with it, and really enjoy it. I also find Machine Learning, algorithms, and AI really interesting (which makes sense, given my interest in cognitive psychology).

So it'd be nice to have the option (if needed) of moving out of academia after I graduate, and into a career in industry, focusing on ML/AI. How can I best set myself up for this? 

Here seem to be my options:

* Focus on the PhD, try and make research more computational, try and work on CS-y personal projects and build up a portfolio of these sorts of things.
* Continue with the PhD, get a masters in stats meanwhile. This seemed like a good option at first. The stats department at my university offers a program for people who are getting a PhD in another department-- for me, just take 8 courses in their department, no thesis even. I have 8 quarters left, lines up nicely. I know that machine learning and stats are heavily related (though it's unclear to me whether AI and stats have much relation). HOWEVER, I missed out on the intro sequence for this year, and will have to wait until next year to take that. Courses that don't depend on this intro sequence are either stuff I'm super familiar with (linear regression) and/or stuff that has nothing to do with what I'm interested in (e.g., meta-analysis). In addition, the director for this program has been very difficult to pin down to talk to, making it difficult to discuss alternative options with him.
* Continue with the PhD, get a masters in CS meanwhile. I would love this-- the courses are explicitly on the topic of my interest (machine learning, AI), and I enjoy programming more than I enjoy math. However, this department doesn't explicitly have a program in place for people in other PhD programs (like the stats department does). Instead, I'd be taking the usual MS requirements, which are a bit heftier: 12 courses OR 9 courses + a thesis. This would be a lot to juggle with my PhD, might be difficult to get my advisor to approve of, etc.

So my questions are:

* **Would the stats degree really help get me into the areas I'm interested in?** I've heard it's relevant for ML, but for some reason I'm second-guessing that.
* **Will potential employers want to know that I've completed a thesis/ master's project anyways?** One of the downsides of the CS is that it's quite a bit more work-- but if this is the sort of thing that employers are going to be looking for anyways (as opposed to ""oh yeah I took 8 courses""), it may be worth it. Or can I be pretty vague with employers on how I got the MS? This is related to the concern that I'll be coming out of this program without any CS internships or the like-- just book learnin'.
* **Are either of these Masters actually helpful? Lately I've been hearing that most ML jobs require a PhD anyways.** Now, technically I will have a PhD-- it'll just be in cognitive psych. Does this help?

Bonus Question: Can someone describe what ""Statistical Computing"" is-- or rather, what a typical class on ""Statistical Computing"" is like? This is one of the classes I could potentially take this year. It seems like its more appropriate for my interests than e.g., ""meta-analysis,"" but I don't know if it'll assume lots of background/foundational knowledge that I'm missing out on by not taking the introductory series this year.

Sorry for the the length of this post. Any help would really be appreciated, I'm feeling pretty paralyzed. I think my heart says CS, but my head says stats."

How do you prepare for your interviews?

They don't quite teach Product Quality engineering at my Uni to CS majors (its one of the top UCs).

I look at the screen in front of me, look at the screen on the desk opposite. Both display nothing to indicate any malfunction in our systems. I then look back at the worried face of P, the unfortunate messenger of this week's idiocy.

*""Is your system down?""* I ask gently.

*""Well, I didn't look, and if the computers are dangerous...""*, she trails off.

*""Let's go and check shall we?""* I get up from my chair and head determinedly towards M's office space.

As we walk along carpeted corridors there is a noticeable absence of outcry, the air is buzzing with the faint sound of people continuing to work, unhappily eking out the remainder of their lives as tiny cogs in a relatively small machine. The faint smell of biological death from the potted plants fills my nostrils, temporarily displacing the perfumes of burnt dust and blown capacitors.

As we get closer to our destination we begin to hear the chatter and bustle only evident in this office at times of catastrophe or free cake. I soon can make out a voice.

*""I'm telling you, worst shock ever, I've got a tingling feeling all the way to my elbow. Still!""*

*""That's terrible, and really dangerous!"" ""We could get shocked any time!"" ""I heard even a small one can give you a heart attack!"" ""And the radiation you get inside causes cancer!"" ""Could we sue?""*

A small crowd has formed around M, their unlikely martyr. Sweating, pink shirt creased, and with an expression of heroic suffering, M is cradling his hand while he tries to chat up a couple of interns.

*""Yes it hurts, but I do karate, and one of the first things you learn is to control pain, to embrace it as an expression of being still alive.""* He trots out this garbage with a faint crocodile tear in his eye.

*""ooooh""*, coo the interns, (hopefully) feigning sympathy.

*""It sounds terrible. Do you think you need an ambulance? Without care you might lose all use of your hand.""* I pitch my voice to interrupt the ongoing conversation.

Silence falls over the group, I visibly see M weighing the choice between calling the paramedics and attempting to hold up his injury under professional attention vs. staying and continuing his quest of banging an intern, a quest he had been unsuccessfully pursuing for several years at that point.

*""I'm sure it isn't necessary, I have a strong constitution""*, He finally responds.

*""The system is down! Why haven't you fixed it yet!""* Cries one of the amorphous blobs occupying valuable floor space with his cup of tea in hand.

""Is it down?"" I open up the closest machine and log in as normal.

The group goes a quiet.

*""Well it must have fixed itself...""* says the blob, as the group drift back to their seats and back to their work.

M intervenes at this point.

*""Look! Nothing!""* He points at his screen triumphantly, proudly displaying its glossy black surface like a gold medal.

*""I pressed all the keys and checked the monitor and pressed the power button and it doesn't work!""* The triumph in his voice is clear, he, the user, has been unfairly betrayed by the priests of IT and his actions are just.

I walk to the wall socket, turn it on, and turn on his machine. The sound of the windows logon echoes in the now quiet room and all eyes and ears turn to him, expressions rapidly hardening.

*""Ehm, I guess that's all fixed then. Thanks!""* He realises his error is embarrassing, yet another crop of interns are probably lost to his grasping hands forever.

*""Not so fast. I still have questions for you.""* I block his access to his chair.

*""You said you got an electric shock and that our computers are unsafe. Seeing as yours was off at the wall, where did you get the shock from?""*

His answer makes my blood run cold. *""I went down the computer room. I thought I could just reset it from there and it would work. I had a really important document I needed to do!""* his voice rises to a whine.

*""The computer room... You mean the server room!""*

*""Yes, I went in their and tried to do a reset and then I got shocked!""* He pitches his voice at the end, once again trying to create blame. How dare we have electronic devices that might give him a shock!

*""Let me get this straight. You went in the server room.""*

*""Yes""*

*""Through the door with all the electrical warning signs and tape?""*

*""Yes, I took those off because it's obvious a computer room has electricity. The door was also a bit stiff, I don't think that's very safe if there was a real emergency.""*


For clarification, the server room in this case was an adapted supply closet. The door was a normal supply closet door (I didn't have budget and the upper management was unconcerned). The door however, was always locked.


*""That door was locked...""* I think my voice must have sounded like the rasp of sand on stone at this point. Shock had drawn all of my moisture away from the surface to protect my body from the clearly brain damaging gas that must have been present in that room.

*""It can't have been locked. I only had to shove it a few times.""*

*""You bypassed our signs and a locked door and got into our server room. What did you do?!""*

*""Well I reached behind the big computerey machiney thing and tried to unplug it, that's when I got the shock. It really isn't acceptable...""*


My tale ends at this point. Fortunately no damage had been done to our systems, but the server room door had been kicked open (boot mark visible in the crap wood) and needed to have the lock replaced.

A semi-happy ending, while M did not get fired for his actions, he was chastised exhaustively and never bothered IT again. Also, a couple of months later, after I had the chance to outline the damage that could have been done to our Head of IT, the server moved to a real server room, with a proper door and plenty of fancy bells and whistles, where it lived happily ever after.

**The End**

TLDR: Neither shock nor pain nor lock of door can stay these messengers from the swift desecration of our systems.

Before I get to my background knowledge, allow me to introduce myself. I'm currently a student in high school, but don't get the wrong idea about me. I'm able to communicate professionally, and am very dependable. I've been working with computer since I was in third grade, so there's that. I'm an avid tennis player, as well as a cross-country runner. I spend most of my free-time either playing tennis, programming, or reading. That's the gist of me. 
 
Now back to the topic at hand, the internship. I'm looking for a professional, work environment where I can learn. That's my main goal, in fact. I have background experience with the following.

* HTML
* CSS
* PHP
* MySQL
* Wordpress
* Apache server
* Nginx server
* MySQL server
* Unix shell (CentOS/RHEL, specifically)

Although that is my current skill set, I am more than willing to learn whatever I have to.  
Another thing I should note is that I may be busy every once in a while simply due to school. I'm taking all advanced courses, so it's quite a load. I am generally available after 7:30 PM CST, but I don't mind staying up later if it's required.

If you can state your name and the answers to as many of the questions as you want. I'd prefer a mechanical engineer to respond, however all are welcome =)
Thank you.

1sr4wp,1,2013-12-12,"What is the appropriate, professional way to get unbanned from a LinkedIn group?",lilgadget,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1sr4wp/what_is_the_appropriate_professional_way_to_get/,"A while back, I wanted to join a group on LinkedIn related to my field of work.  The group required 3 years of professional experience to be a member.  Looking through my profile, I had over 3 years of experience between my current job, internships, and professional experience with real companies on projects as a grad student.  So, I tried to join and was denied.  Understanding that perhaps the group admin didn't count my grad school experience as ""professional,""  I waited a few months until all my experience outside of that added up to over 3 years.  Denied again.  Ok, I supposed maybe he didn't count internships as ""professional."" so I waited a few months until my current job and an apprenticeship I'd had equaled just 3 years. Denied again and bam! blocked from the group.  

I really wasn't trying to be a nuisance or push my way into a group that I didn't belong in.  I've been in professional industry associations and have worked with companies in the industry since graduate school (and I know several people in the group who could vouch for that), so to me that all counts as professional experience, but the group admin obviously doesn't see it that way.  

I was going to send him a LinkedIn message soon after the ban explaining my position and asking for admittance to the group, but I worried too much that I would be interpreted as a whiny kid trying to get into something she should be in, or challenging his authority too much, or that I'd get some kind of nasty response from him.  After that I forgot about it until now, several months later.  Today, the time at my current job and the apprenticeship adds up to 3 years and 10 months.  

I'd really like to be in the group, so how do I go about approaching this?  Is there a way to ask neatly and professionally if I may join the group now? Do I mention the ban? Play stupid and just say that I can't seem to access the group? Should I just bite the bullet and wait 6 or 7 more months until I know that he can't discount 3 years at my current job? Even then I would have to go through the awkwardness of asking via a message to him...

1sqlk9,1,2013-12-12,I need some advice with a job offer I received today.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/1sqlk9/i_need_some_advice_with_a_job_offer_i_received/,"So let me put you in the situation. I'm 7 months out of college, still no job. It's probably due to a lack of experience on my resume, as I never did an internship in college, mainly because I didn't see how important they would be in finding a job. I did apply to one internship, but I didn't get it, and anyway, it's a bit late for that.

I don't have a job at the present time, and I've been looking for one pretty much full time, but I'm kind of lazy so I'd say about 4 hours a day or so is spent looking for a job. I've had several interviews, I think close to 10 at this point, most of them for decent positions, but 2 were for door-to-door sales scams that basically tricked me into interviewing with them. I recieved an offer from one of the door-to-door jobs (which I declined, because fuck that,) but other than that I've had no offers.

Now I just interviewed with a job yesterday for Eastern Account System. They found my resume after I reposted it (I do this every Sunday,) to various job boards. I interview with the recruiter first, then they send me to the job 10 minutes away, and it's a call center. I knew this going in, so at this point I'm still optimistic. Office looks nice, everyone is friendly, interview goes well I'd say, all is well. 

Now this is when the problems begin.

I look up the company online (I wasn't told the name of it until I arrived at the recruiter, one red flag there,) and the reviews are abysmal. I know everyone says ""oh, they wouldn't go to a review site unless they wanted to complain,"" but these reviews are the worst I've ever seen on glassdoor. And there are a ton of them. On indeed.com they are just as bad. Tons of reviews stating that it's a horrid place to work, that the turnover rate is extremely high, that it's actually a collection agency in disguise (I was told I'd be handling account issues, and that would be bonuses after 3 months. I'm learning now that all of these calls are payment related, and the bonuses are commission based on how many people I can get to pay,) and that all in all it's atrocious. And did I mention the hours (12:30-9:00 weekdays) are terrible? The pay (12.50 an hour) is also not particularly amazing. I could probably get that several places that are way closer than 45 minutes, which is what the commute would be.

Now obviously I'm hesitant to work here. In fact, I would outright say no (I asked for a day to think it over and the recruiter was not happy, which...whatever,) if it was not for my mom. She's pressuring me to accept this position, probably because she knows I'm a lazy guy, and that I'm really hesitant to do, well, anything, and I think that's clouding her judgement to the point where she can't see how legitimately terrible this position would be.

Now, I can be honest here - I've grown to like not having a job. It's very addicting. At any point I can just do whatever, and I don't have to pay for much, so I still have a large amount of money saved up. I know this needs to end though, sooner rather than later, and that if I still haven't found a career by next year I'll get a part-time job, anything that I can put on my resume would help. I'm going to need to start my life soon, but this job is not the way to do it, my gut is telling me that. My mother is really pressuring me to take it though to break me out of my funk, but if I do, that's a mediocre wage for like 3 months, and I'll still be looking for a new job to escape a damn call center. I'll also miss Christmas Eve with my family (apparently they don't get off that day, or most holidays,) and for what? 12.50 an hour that I don't need now, and a crappy job to put on my resume?

I know it's my decision, and my mind is pretty much made up, but how can I convince my mom that this is the right one to make?

EDIT: Another question here. I'm kind of new to the job world, but there's no penalty really if I accept the job, and then just instantly quit, is there? I obviously can't use them as a reference now, but there's no penalty on my end right? Is it possible I might sign something that would fuck me over in that regard?"

I started a internship in a big (great) company focused on IT. I asked here to see what could I do, as I didn't really liked the situation there, got some advice (keep looking for work) and stopped looking as a small (developing) project not related at all with what the department did arised. Things got boring, started looking for work again and looked straight in the eye on the awful software development spanish wasteland: Almost all are companies which re-hires you (I don't know the word in english... contractors?), with a ""get young people, burn them out, get new young people"" plan of business and which requires knowledge in very specific areas (i.e. specific java frameworks) with specific languages that doesn't really appeal me in a professional way (I think C++ is better for what i want to do long-time, companies only looking for people with Java, C#, .net).


So, right now, I'm 28, my only experience in the ""real"" world was an internship from which I didn't really learned nothing (Not really, small stuff, a Java app here, some theoretical knowledge of computer management there...) and seeing the market it seems there is no ""right"" spot for me, at least with 0 experience developing.


I have my almost mandatory personal project, and I would LOVE to have some free months to finish it and get some other ideas working, but that does not give money.


I'm also seriously considering freelancing, although the pay is crap (more for a guy with NO real portfolio) and the job is, at best, ""unstable"".


What my heart says is to build a real portfolio and forgot about this year, then start freelancing, then look for serious job. I don't really mind looking for job outside Spain, but I don't really see myself capable of doing it, both for language and personal stuffs.


So, any ideas/advices on what should be my next step?"

I was just wondering a few things that perhaps some past interns could answer for me:

1. Does this mean that I got the position and will be discussing the team I will be on? I ask this because I was expecting them to fly me over for in-person interviews first before discussing any offers.

Just want to say a quick thank you to the denizens of this sub. Its because of your questions, comments, and personal stories that I've decided that software dev/engineering is a field that not only interests me greatly, but can feasibly provide me with a good job given that I work my ass off. I'm trying to figure out how to best manage the remainder of my time in school, and I have a few questions.

After floundering in my major choice for 3 years, I'm now a senior with a sophomore-juniorish standing for a CS degree at a decent school. I don't have any personal projects or open source contributions to speak of (yet) , which seems like it may nix my chances for getting an engineering internship for the summer. Assuming that's the case, would it be better to: 

1. Take the summer to work on my own stuff, go for an internship for summer 2015, and then graduate after fall 2015. Or....

2. Take a bunch of classes over the summer while working on personal projects, graduate in spring 2015, and then attempt to get an internship/job after I graduate.

I realize these two options aren't very different, I only ask the question this way because it seems like most the internships I'm interested in stipulate that you be returning to your program after the internship is over. Does it usually work that way in practice? Are there respectable internships that don't have this requirement? (my research has been admittedly less than exhaustive)

Any insight you guys can provide will be greatly appreciated!"

Recently, I've been extremely intrigued with the challenge of CS and software development. I have picked up some of the core books, and have begun to slowly read through them. The issue is, I will be graduating soon, and don't know what I should be doing for internships. I don't feel I have anywhere near enough knowledge to pass a CS interview atm, as my Prog I and II classes only covered data structures vaguely, and I do not have any real experience.

1. Do I start applying for internships now, even though I don't feel comfortable in my ability to pass a CS interview?
2. Given 25-30 hours a week dedicated to theory &amp; programming development, how long might it take to reach a good level of competency? (I know this varies, just want a general number)
3. I aspire to work at Amazon, Microsoft etc. Is it feasible to have an in-person interview within a year? I'd be focusing heavily on the things they'd test on, and hopefully have an internship to help.
4. Currently I only have a pretty introductory understanding of two languages: Java and Python.

I'm in my third year of undergrad now, so obviously I'm hopeful I do well enough to be offered FTE.

I also hate academics.  I find my work boring, tedious, and pointless.  I have no motivation to do well, and most of my classes are in electrical engineering and thus unrelated to my future work.  I feel like I would learn just as much (and actually enjoy learning) working, while also being paid and not paying 30k/year for tuition.

I'm not quite Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerburg, but I'm curious about the possibility of dropping out to accept FTE immediately after the internship.

Specific questions:

1. Is this a good idea?  Would I limit my opportunities if I never complete my Bachelor's?  I would be forgoing my last year.  I can't help but think that 3 years of uni + 1 year of FTE must be equivalent or better than a Bachelor's.  I also realize that the most successful dropouts dropout because they need to focus on their work and can't miss an opportunity, not because they hate school as I do.
2. Do tech companies generally offer these kind of opportunities, and how rare is it?  I imagine the bigger, more corporate, and more conservative the company, the rarer it is.
3. Besides obviously performing well, how can I position myself for this?  Do I just ask if I can start FTE right away (obviously only if I am extended an offer at all)?
4. Would this affect any potential offer?  That is, would any offer be reduced in terms of compensation if I elect not to finish my degree?  I guess it would reduce my leverage while negotiating.  But the fact that I would be working for a year as opposed to paying tuition for a year already nets me a financial gain.

I'd appreciate any input at all, especially from anyone who's done this!  Thanks"

A Bunch of my friends, including my best friend Josh and his girlfriend Chelsea also got in that hospital and we decided to make a road trip out of it, you know to check out what we were getting into, we rented an RV, filled it up with all the essentials that we were going to need for an eighteen to twenty hours long drive and six of us me, Josh, Chelsea, Eric, Sabrina and the designated driver Ashley, she was 19, so she couldn’t drink and she is a good driver, so we brought her along too she’s Sabrina’s little sister. We started off late in the night maybe 2 or 3 AM, because we wanted it to be daytime when we reached the Klamath River so we could enjoy the freshness of the morning in the forest on the bank of the river. But I guess it was too much to ask for because turns out after 7 hours of driving we weren’t on the Cascade wonderland highway anymore but instead we were on the pacific highway, I was sleeping so I didn’t know when we crossed the state line and ended up in Oregon and Josh was busy with Chelsea and 27 years old Eric was busy hitting on Ashley and Sabrina was occupied with the dog that she shouldn’t have brought on the road trip but I guess it wouldn’t have made any difference even if she didn’t, it was my fault too, I shouldn’t have slept. When I woke up and after a while when I saw the road opening to the old highway I realized that we were on the pacific highway but there was no point in going all the way back so we decided that we should set up a rest camp over here between the intersection of the two highways. Sabrina wasn’t so sanguine about it she said that it reminds her too much about the wrong turn and that we should just keep moving until we hit a town, we all made fun of her and tried to scare her more but the truth is that I agreed with her, certainly not on the horror movie thing but on this place not being safe enough to rest here but we had no choice the RV’s engine needed sometime to cool down and so did we, besides it was not like a ghost town or anything because every now and then a car or an RV would pass by us and Josh was packing heat, his uncle’s hunting rifle, so overall it wasn’t that bad.

We set up a camp fire and started talking about different things like the friends that didn’t pass the exams, places that we would visit when we arrive in Seattle, about teaching hospitals and where we would buy a place to stay, things like that and out of nowhere Eric changes the topic altogether and starts talking about this 1800’s abandoned asylum in the Oregon forest and he starts telling his “folk tale” about this 80 years old deranged killer who would eat flesh out of his own body parts, every time different body part once a month and then he would wait a while for the flesh to reform and he would tear it out with his teeth and eat it again, he was committed there after killing his wife because she didn’t cook the deer right. He was found chewing on her face.

He was bound into straightjacket and a protective gear on his mouth just so he would stop eating himself and give up threatening others by showing his blood tainted, broken teeth and by making a petrifying roaring sound from the bottom of his larynx whenever they come into his room. Eric also said that when the asylum was being abandoned no one knew what happened to the old man they all assumed that he was left in his room because no one was gutsy enough to let him out and take him to the bus where all the other patients were.

No matter how juvenile his story sounds we were all a little bit startled, after all we were sitting outside the forest of Oregon.

Afternoon was ending and the evening was beginning, it was getting cold and dark, and the animals were awakened, so we started to head for our RV, Sabrina’s dog, Stella was getting a bit apprehensive. Now before I go any further you should know something about me and Sabrina, we use to date each other back in the college, actually it was more like four dates, nothing serious, I mean I guess it wasn’t because later I found out that while she was dating me she was sleeping with someone else, someone close to me, a friend. And she told me about him while *we* were making out, anyway I would’ve let that go if the guy was some stranger and not my friend but I can’t blame her for that because she wasn’t aware of that but he was, he knew about my relationship with her and how much I liked her, we are not friends anymore, not after I punched him in the guts. -After that I couldn’t date her anymore, I guess it was too much for my ego, we stayed friends, but that didn’t change the way I felt about her. Maybe that’s why when the dog, Stella leapt from her arms and ran into the forest and when we all decided to not go after her except Sabrina and Ashley, -and leave the dog because it was late and running off into the forest was just too much precarious, that’s when Sabrina looked at me with her deep blue eyes and said “Please”. Boy didn’t that make me change my mind. I also knew the story behind that dog, it might just be a dog for every one else but not for her because it was given to her by her mother on her sixteenth birthday, that dog was the last present she got from her mother, her mother died of a brain tumor, actually she died during her surgery.

So when she asked me to help her find the dog, I said “Let’s go find that dog”. I mean what could go wrong, right? -Running after a dog in the middle of the forest at night. It’s a beginning to the happy ending with half as population as before.

Josh wasn’t on-board with the idea, I don’t blame him neither was I but I don’t know why I was doing this anyway I did manage to get him on-board with the plan which involved me and Sabrina going into the forest alone but he said that he wouldn’t let us go alone in there with all the wild animals and I suggested that he gives us his rifle but he said, “No way you can’t shoot jack. I’m coming with you.” On which Chelsea also decided to join us and Ashley and Eric were going to stay at the RV.

We were following the same path on which we saw the dog running off to but she could’ve been anywhere by now after all the time we took deciding to go after her. Sabrina was calling out her name and Chelsea joined her upfront. Josh and I were behind them. “What the hell is wrong with you?” he whispered. “What?” I knew what but I still asked what. “Running after a dog in the middle of the evening, really? Hey if you wanna sleep with her go ahead but don’t get us all killed in the process.” Hey we’re not going to die you’re overreacting. We were just talking when we heard a familiar bark and then someone running it was Sabrina going after the sound of dog’s bark, we ran behind her for a while and then we stopped when she stopped, it was from here, she said. The barks stopped, we were very far out into the forest, and slowly we wouldn’t even be able to see anymore, the sunlight was fading away gradually, we again decided to give up, this time even Sabrina wasn’t this much enthusiastic about finding the dog anymore, we were just about to head back when we heard the barks again, this time from two different directions, it was not that uncommon for two dogs to be barking at the same time, Sabrina thought that she recognizes one of the dogs bark but we wanted to be on the safe side so we split up, Josh and Chelsea went after the other one he gave me his knife, just in case, he said. Finding our way back to the RV wouldn’t have been hard because we had our phone’s GPS synced with Eric’s phone. We were running in different direction and by my understanding they were running in different direction. Sabrina and I ended up at this very old building; it had fences around of it covering it but it had gaps in it which could be easily tackled by a dog. We entered the building; it was quite a big building we had to go through a barren yard to get in the building, there was a big, dry and thick tree in the yard, I don’t get scared that easily but I was and by the looks of it she was too but she didn’t want to go back without finding the dog because we could hear her inside the building. The building was very old; it seemed like it would crumble around us if we jump to hard. There was a reception just across an average size hall, it was a two floors building but we couldn’t go upstairs because the staircase was wrecked, it was quite easy to know that the dog wasn’t upstairs. Sabrina found a picture behind the reception desk other than a coffee mug, a journal, a 19th century telephone and a half piece of marble with “sylum” engraved on it, picture was old and was of this asylum, with some people standing in front of it, I couldn’t make out their faces. I guess we both were wasting our time here looking at these things because we didn’t want to exactly find out what was making all those noises in the back of building, we didn’t had much time so we started walking towards the hallway, “Secure unit” on a board that was hanging vertically from the ceiling. We didn’t bother to check the rooms that were either locked or the doors were closed, many rooms still had personal items in there, we were checking one of the rooms when Sabrina said, “You thinking the same thing I’m thinking?” “No. I’m thinking about you, are you thinking about you?” I said. She chuckled and said “No. I was thinking that this place might be the same place Eric was talking about.”, “It could be, it doesn’t matter even if it was, I mean it’s not like he could be alive all these years”. And she said, “I just want to find Stella and get out of here.” It might’ve been a peculiar timing but I asked her out in an Asylum, she said yes and then I said, “Great. Umm… just want to be sure if you’re not… with someone.” “What? Oh no… no I’m not.” We were just talking and checking the rooms when we heard a loud thump from beneath us, it was from the basement, we just skipped it because frankly I didn’t had guts to stare down the staircase into the obscurity, going in there was beyond my bravery. But now we didn’t had any other choice because we checked the whole first floor of the building, last time we heard the dog from inside the building, we knew that she was in here, the windows had bars on it so she couldn’t get out from there except from front door but we had that covered, we closed it behind us. Well, there was just one place left to look and it was the creepy, shadowy basement. The metal door into the basement was already opened so we got in and started walking down the stairs; I and Sabrina were using our phone’s LED screen light to see where we were walking. The stairs were made of rusted metal; it was creaking with every step. I was just hoping that it doesn’t break apart because I don’t think there was any other way out of there. It was very dark and it smelled of something very foul in there, our phone’s light wasn’t enough but it did the trick. It was a big basement, there was a long corridor with rooms on either sides and every room door was made of metal, there was another corridor but the door to it was locked. There was a reception there too but it had a lot of warning signs all around it. We started walking towards the end of the corridor from where we heard that thump, Sabrina was whispering Stella’s name. We must have only covered half of it when we heard a very stunning and deafening bang noise from upstairs, it sounded like two heavy metal objects striking together. I figured it was the basement door that we just passed through it must have been wind, because after staring a while at the basement stares waiting for something very strong coming down that basement stairs all hungry and growling was getting old, so we started moving again, she was terrified, I was scared too but my ego didn’t allow me to show it. As we were walking towards that place where it said “Medicine Room” from where that sound came from we heard something again this time it was from inside that place, we started taking our steps slowly towards that place, Sabrina stopped whispering Stella’s name, I had my one hand on the knife and my other in front of Sabrina, guarding her, that’s when we heard a scared familiar female voice, “Who is it? Don’t come any closer I have a gun, I will shoot.” It was Chelsea, she was very happy to see us; apparently she was scared because she too thought that something strong was coming down the stairs all hungry and growling towards her to eat her. Josh wasn’t with her, she said that he went to check the end of the corridor for some noise that he heard, and that he wanted her to stay there in case the dog comes out this way. We started walking towards the end of the corridor, checking every room from the outside, some were closed and some were opened, there was this one room that was closed and it said on the wall adjacent to the door “Do not open without proper authorization. Do not stare. Do not engage.” I looked inside and saw some blood on the wall and on the bed, I also saw some sort of a mouth protective gear, Eric’s folk tale was becoming more and more terrifying and not just to me. The door was unlocked, there was no lock on the door but we decided not to open it anyway. We reached the end of the corridor, only to find that two other corridors were sprouting out of that corridor but just as we were going to enter one of the corridors we heard someone running towards us from behind. Whatever or whoever it was we didn’t want to know but we looked behind and it was the dog, she startled us but she made Sabrina very happy and then there was my friend, Josh running towards us, I almost cracked a smile but then I saw that he wasn’t running alone there was someone else behind him, in fact he seemed to be running away from him, he was holding his shoulder and before he could shout run, I shouted “Run!” and it was after that one word that we all started running away into that undiscovered corridor, we were running very fast there was not enough light in the corridor, we couldn’t see where we were going, we were completely dependent on the dog and our luck, when she jumped we knew that something was in the way so we jumped. I could hear that thing coming after us although whoever or whatever it was, it was very slow but made a lot of roaring and growling sounds and then we reached a dead end, it was that close door that we encountered after entering the basement, it had a lock on it, which Chelsea shot with her rifle without wasting much time, we opened that door and ran up the stairs and closed the basement door behind us, that thing didn’t come up the stairs but we all could hear it down there. Josh was hurt, he said, “F*****g crazy old man. He bit me.” and then Chelsea said that we have to get out of here quick because there’s an another opening into the basement around the back of the building and he could come from there, so we ran outside and it was now dark we couldn’t see so we used the GPS tracker to get back to the RV, when we got there Eric and Ashley were making out, we ignored the vulgarity of the situation because we were preoccupied and yelled “Drive!” Ashley wanted to know more but Sabrina yelled at her and said “Just get us out here, now!” Ashley started driving towards Seattle again. Josh was bleeding but it wasn’t that bad, Chelsea was applying first aid when he said, “A**hole.” Yeah. I know, I said. “No I actually mean you.” He said. Chelsea wasn’t too happy with me or Sabrina, she didn’t say it but we knew. By the way, the dog was fine. Anyway, we got him to the hospital, had a bunch of blood tests, checking for rabies, poisoning, staph infection, hepatitis, Aids, T-virus (i.e. the zombie virus) etc. He was all good, even now he is married and has two kids perfectly healthy, although they do have some weird habits but I guess it’s normal for kids to occasionally *bite each other*.

1srstq,1,2013-12-12,Choosing between internship offers,HammockSway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1srstq/choosing_between_internship_offers/,"Hello,

I currently have two internship offers for this summer and I need to decide which one to choose by tomorrow. Both are software engineering internships, and one is in San Diego for Viasat and another in Lawrenceville, GA for Cisco. I am having a hard time deciding between the two because I really don't want to live in Lawrenceville, however I am afraid working for Viasat won't look as good on my resume. I guess I am asking if it will be detrimental when applying for full time jobs if I have experience at a lesser known company such as Viasat as opposed to Cisco."

The past summer I learned about programming through a Coursera course I took and I loved it ever since. I have been reading this subreddit for a while and am now trying to get into my school's CS department, it requires 4 math classes and a 2.5 cumulative GPA. I'm doing the math courses now and I'm sure I'll be able to get my GPA to 2.5+ in order to get in, but not much more (probably 2.5-6).


I currently have a 2.43 GPA with 48 credits at a Canadian University, the CS program will be about 72 credits (2 more years) for a total of 120 credits for the BS. After using some GPA calculators, it seems like the GPA won't go up significantly unless I get all A+'s, which is ideal but probably unrealistic. And internships, I won't get any?! How do I fix this? I can't transfer because I go to the only English university in my city. Is it worth it to change cities or is that overreacting? I have dreams of interning at Facebook or Google.


**TL;DR: I have a 2.4 GPA half way into my degree, will probably graduate not too far away from that. What do I do?**

I'm a self-taught visual UI designer. Right now, there's one more semester in my senior year in college. I've had an internship at a major design agency last year, and have done a couple decent sized client projects for a startup and an app developer. I'm also working on some side projects with friends too. ***I have to apply to companies this winter break (the next 1 month or so) in order to secure a job for the fall. I'm just worried I don't know enough code and employers are going to turn me down because I'm not an expert technician yet.***

I am doing my best to learn code still though. I know a small bit of HTML and CSS (hand coded my portfolio site), but I'm no Chris Coyier (CSS Tricks). I'm just starting Javascript, which is a lot of fun, but I'm struggling to learn it (I'm using pure JS, not jQuery or a framework or however you call it).

A lot of people these days seem to malign visual designers, so I know I have to learn technical skills beyond Photoshop etc. it's just that at this point I am struggling to learn programming and it seems like a prerequisite everywhere. I feel if I'm not a great coder/front end dev by the time I apply to companies, they'll turn me down in favor of some technical wiz who has less visual design chops because that's just the economy.

Dribbble, Forrst etc. with ~400 followers, for whatever little that is worth [read: nothing] but these days every job description says ""needs more than just Dribbble...must have previous web development experience"" etc. I wonder if given this skill set I have a chance to work at companies like Tumblr and Twitter as a junior/mid-level designer, or if I should simply resign myself to work at a local web design shop for a starting salary around $20-30K?"

1sw6y2,381,2013-12-14,Cutting,SaidIToMyself,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1sw6y2/cutting/,"All I can see is blood. Every time I close my damn eyes there’s blood. Every time there’s silence, instead of tinnitus I hear screams. I haven’t slept in… Fuck, when was the last time I slept? I don’t remember eating any time recently either…

“Now that you’ve seen what you’ve done, what you’re capable of doing again…” He lowered the scarf wrapped around his face to reveal a mouth that had been stitched closed. “Won’t you come use your powers for…” His words were in my mind. “The Greater Good?”

No, no, this requires some context. My name is Nathan Marlow, surgeon, amnesiac, butcher. This is the story of my conscription into a war you can’t see.

Five years ago I woke up in my hospital with retrograde amnesia. I’d vanished after the last shift of my internship, right after I learned I’d made surgeon, right after Bethany said she was leaving, and reappeared almost exactly a year later. At the time I couldn’t recall a single second of my time away.

They offered me my position back, being first in my class out of med school and having a perfect record as an intern, and of course I graciously accepted. I enrolled myself in therapy but the best trained psychologists I could meet with couldn’t rouse anything from the depths of my mind. Before long had passed, I simply accepted I wouldn’t figure it out.

I’d probably spent the better part of the year drunk or on one type of binge or another. By my figuring, it was probably better that I didn’t remember. I had no idea how right I was. With no family to speak of, no one investigated too hard after I was declared dead. I’d never made friends in school, being a gunner and a rank climber, except Bethany. No one missed me, especially not Bethany.

I tried to call call her, email her, visit her house, but it was like she had been wiped from the map. Her parents and friends never returned any of my calls either. Total communication embargo, but I was oddly okay with it. I was alone, but I was also handsome and athletic, the top ranked surgeon in a prestigious hospital, and used to it. Alone was how I operated best. I just made a pun, that’s almost more grating than the screams…

All of that being said I did actually enjoy the company of others, especially pretty, young women of loose moral fiber. Outside of surgery I could usually be found at one of the trendy bars or clubs in the city. Inheritance covering the cost of my schooling and investments covering the cost of my living left me with plenty of money to float people’s ways in the form of drinks. This meant that if I wanted company for the evening, I could usually secure at least a lengthy conversation if not more.

It was everything I could’ve wanted out of life. Or at least that’s what I told myself. It was every man’s dream, right? I was set to coast through until I had the clout to secure a mansion, a trophy wife, and a retirement in the south of Italy.

And then I met The Shaman.

The last day of my life as I knew it started out like the hundreds before it. I untangled myself from my sheets and stumbled across the room to shut off the alarm. The girl in my bed, I can’t even pretend to remember her name at this point, rose naked and disheveled. I told her I had to go to the hospital and my dockett would have me there till the evening. She was welcome to use all of my house until then. I think I really liked her? Back when things like that mattered.

What followed was a long ass commute, three short surgeries, lunch, a run, a transplant, and paperwork. More paperwork than I ever imagined myself doing back when I had stars in my eyes as a boy. It was entirely tolerable but it’s funny how romantic ideas die when the weight of reality begins to push down.

When I finished up as much work as I felt like finishing I took a long hot shower in the hospital locker room. I scrubbed my hands three times then took another shower. It was a habit that had cropped up post amnesiatic episode. My therapist had suggested any number of theories, but the simple truth of the matter was that I never really felt clean unless I took two to three showers. The fixation on cleanliness had served me well as a surgeon. I was sure to never be a source of infection.

When I entered the hospital that morning the sky had been overcast but the roads had been clear. Leaving met me with a snowstorm and clogged up public transport. It looked like walking would be my best, fastest option, even if it wasn’t the warmest. Trying to look on the bright side of things, it meant that I could swing by a bar for a drink.

I had no faith that the girl had stuck around. She never answered my attempts to contact her. I could take the message and, as I said before, I was used to it. On to the next great adventure and all that romantic shit. None of normal watering holes sounded good to me as I passed them. Instead I ended up at a hole in the wall I’d never even think of entering if it weren’t so damn cold out.

“Whiskey sour please,” I said to the bartender, dropping onto a stool. “Top shelf whiskey if you can swing it.” He looked at me, not in the normal way, but harder. I could feel the look like a ray of light off a heating lamp. I wondered if I’d somehow offended him. Sure, some would consider a whiskey sour a non-manly drink, but I couldn’t fathom it eliciting such a stern reaction. It hardened into frustration with an edge of anger but a ten dollar bill waved his direction sent him on his way.

The man poured the drink and the look on his face evaporated as he graciously accepted the large tip I left on the lacquered wood. This was the kind of place that catered to a hardcore group of regulars, I assumed, the jeans and t-shirt crowd. I wrote it off as a reaction to a soggy man in a suit tripping through his door. After a long sip, I turned to scope out the other people at the pub.

A few men were playing pool. A woman watched from where she leaned against the wall calling the game against the winner. Only about a quarter of the booths were taken up, all of those that were looked to be filled with close-knit friends. The others at the bar all had their own conversations going on that I didn’t feel like interrupting. 

Normally I would’ve been out of there after my drink, but I stayed. Why didn’t I just leave? I’ve agonized over the question, but the only answer I’ve been able to believe in is that it was because The Shaman didn’t want me to.

Instead of high tailing it, I picked out a booth in the middle of an empty series of three. After I got settled, shucked my coat, and taken another drink, I checked my phone. No new messages. Those that I’d sent to the girl were still unread. There weren’t even any messages from the other surgeons at the hospital. Normally at least some of them talked to me, it was as close to friendships as I had.

A server brought me another drink that apparently had been paid for by the girl by the pool table after I finished my first. I raised my glass in salute after catching her eye. It wasn’t a rare occurrence, having a drink bought for me, but normally it was just a pretense for reciprocation. Those that did normally let me buy them drinks for the rest of the night. But the waitress told me this girl didn’t drink. Sure enough she’d come sit down when her game was over. And sure enough I was right, eventually she did come over but she was joined by another person. He was a man in a long grey coat, draped with no less than three scarves not counting the one wrapped around the lower half of his face. He had vivid green eyes and a mop of wavy black hair that fell to his shoulders.

The woman was a small blonde who wore a scarf like the man’s wrapped loosely about her shoulders. The two of them looked at me expectantly for a minute after sitting down before she broke the silence. “Enjoying your drink? I had you pegged for a whiskey drinker the moment you came through the door. We don’t get many of your type around here. You look monied. What kind of car do you drive? Apartment of house in the suburbs? Sorry if Barry the barkeep gave you a hard time, he’s really a big ol’ teddy-”

“Serenity, please.” The girl had been talking at a mile a minute before the man had interrupted. “My associate is excitable. And also apparently rude as I believe she neglected to ask your name. Please excuse her transgression.”

“I’m Nathan,” I said, “but my friends call me Nate.” Why had I said that? I had not friends and no one had called me Nate since Bethany. “Actually, Nathan if you would.”

“You don’t have any friends,” I heard Serenity say. Well, I thought I heard her say it. Her lips hadn’t moved. I dismissed it as a product of stress and anxiety.

“Hello Nathan,” he said slowly. Each syllable was cool and calm and… Almost musical. It was the kind of voice that would hush a room without rising above a whisper. “You’ve already had an introduction to Serenity and her proclivity for speaking much more and faster than is wise. Then again, I cannot fault her as I quite enjoy conversing as well. But that is a matter for discussion later. As for the matter at hand, you may call me The Shaman.”

The way he said it, casual, part of his rolling speech. I didn’t question it. “It’s nice to meet you, Shaman, Serenity. Thank you for the drink, it’s actually really good.”

“What do you mean by actually? Expecting less than quality?” There was a hint of incredulity in Serenity’s voice. “Believe me our bar has the best damn spirits in the city. Much better than Rez or Green Street, I see to that myself. My bar-”

“Serenity…” There was something cold in the way The Shaman interrupted her this time. “I’m sure our companion here did not mean to disparage your choice of liquor. Simple misspeak, that’s all it was, am I correct?”

“Yeah, all I meant is that it’s delicious.” Each word I said was cautious. “It tastes like the mix is homemade.”

“It’s nice of you to notice, I’m sorry for flying off the handle,” she said looking down at the table. “Why you?” but her mouth didn’t move for the last part. I ignored it again.

“How about I buy you a tumble of my choice of libation as an apology for our combined verbosity?” he asked. “This conversation must be dreadfully droll for you.”

“It’s not,” I assured him, “and I’d love to try it. What is it?”

“Where is your sense of surprise?” He laughed. “I will tell you after you’ve had a sip.”

I agreed with a certain amount of discomfort and suspicion as he signaled the server. She must have been keeping her eyes on us seeing as she bustled right over. The Shaman made a short sharp gesture then showed three fingers. She understood and was back moments later with three glasses of purple liquor. She passed them out to the three of us and walked away without a word.

“To an end to this god awful snow. And Barry the barkeep,” Serenity said raising her glass.

“To holiday remembrances,” The Shaman said following suit.

“To new found friends,” I said, completing the cheer before lowering the glass to my lips and sipping…

Blood. Blood and screaming and men in shadows. It’s on my hands as I operate. The patient is asleep but I can still hear her as I cut. A scalpel snaps but another is in my hand the moment I raise it. The shadowed men converse as I stand at attention. The patient is next to me, spine ramrod straight, eyes dull. When prompted, I taze her. I tazer her a second time. A third time. Never flinching, never recoiling, never moving. She is a perfect success. Subject 1.

The patients thrash in their beds, waiting to go under my knife. The nurses anesthetize them one by one. I cut and cut and cut. My hands covered in blood. The walls echo. One after another, no time to even wash my hands before moving on to the next. Days without eating, nights without sleeping. Just cutting away. Cutting away.

The survivors stand in lines, face to face listless eyes meeting listless eyes. A nurse blows a whistle. They tear each other apart by hand until exactly half are left. I stitch up the survivors, the winners, before returning to my O.R. Before returning to the blood and screaming. They file out wordlessly. None of them ever speak after I’m done operating. None except the first. The Hollows aren’t supposed to speak. It’s why I take their tongues.

Alarms. The alarms go off and I’m wrist deep in an experimental project. Cutting for fun, he’s long dead. Thought maybe I could put it back but I never finish. Gunshots and more alarms. I run. Blood drips from my hands behind me. Outside is hell. A battalion of Hollows are fighting the Others. I’ve never cut an Other. I want to know what makes them Other. My scalpel hand twitches with excitement. Maybe I can fix them?

The shadowed men converse. I stand. Subject 1 waits in the shadows. Three scalpels are hidden up my sleeve. I can’t kill them all. They say the word. Subject 1 leads me out. In the hallway we struggle. My blades meet her face. Her blood is on me. She locks me in submission, The world goes black. My eyes blink open to the harsh lights of the hospital, remembering nothing.

“What the flying fuck was that?” I found myself back in the bar, not even a minute had passed. The two looked at me, Serenity smiling widely, The Shaman with his hands folded around his empty glass. “What did you bastards dose me with? Fucking fuck. Why the hell are you smiling bitch?”

“Dear Serenity, it appears as though our guest’s side effect is using curse words,” The Shaman said evenly. “How interesting.”

“Was it some kind of shitty acid? Why the hell did I see all of that?”

“It’s called InnerEye. The Shaman distills it for all of the Others and it’s nothing like what you were thinking. It awakens dormant powers in those with the potential though in your case it made you remember yours.” Serenity chattered and sipped at her glass. “The weird thing is, it affects the way we speak. You’re swearing more than we’ve ever seen you swear. The Shaman is like walking thesaurus vomit and obviously I can’t shut up until someone interrupts me or-”

“Shut the hell up,” I bellow at her. “Fuck that nightmare, fuck InnerEye, and fuck you two.”

“Calm yourself Nathan,” The Shaman raised a hand. “You would have had the recollection eventually. Sins like yours do not merely vanish, we just helped you to remember your black year. You can thank us by saying yes to my proposal.”

“Why would I do anything either of you two…” I catch myself before I swear again. “Why would I thank you?”

“You operated on people’s souls, more specifically you paired them away until the vessels that used to contain them were husks.” The Shaman tapped his glass and the waitress took it away. “The Convocation used you to create soldiers until you failed them, then they eradicated your year in their service and abandoned you without your remarkable talent.”

“We want you to work with us. Of course it wouldn’t be anything as nasty as pulling souls out of people. InnerEye can only awaken what’s already there, it doesn’t instil any type of gift. That’s where you come in. We want you to graft Potential onto people’s souls so we can bring them in with the InnerEye and fight the convocation. So basically the exact opposite of what you were doing with them-”

“Now that you’ve seen what you’ve done, what you’re capable of doing again…” He lowered the scarf wrapped around his face to reveal a mouth that had been stitched closed. “Won’t you come use your powers for…” His words were in my mind. “The Greater Good?” I ran away. As I left a terrible laugh, boiling and cackling, cracking and breaking, erupted from The Shaman’s mind. “Don’t you remember me?” His voice followed me outside. “Your experiment? Your pet project? Your failure?” I ran down the street as fast as I could. “You can repeat the process.” I packed a bag back at my house. “My blood on your hands, that’s why you bathe so much and scrub so hard. You still feel it.” I got into my car and started driving. “You’ll be back.” I left the city limits at 90 mph. “Your hands are aching to cut a soul again.”

I’ve been living in hotels ever since. I can feel people’s souls when I draw near. Everyone except for Convocation agents, they’re all flat or hollow, warded or scooped out. The Others are keeping eyes on me too, their souls are too big for their bodies. They’re both following me from town to town, but neither side is making a move. I don’t sleep, I don’t eat, and I don’t know what to do…

The Convocation would erase it all and hide me again.

The Others would use me to fight the abominations I created.

Either side would take me in.

Maybe, for the things I’ve done, I should kill myself..."
1svx47,7,2013-12-14,My brother is getting paid less than minimum wage by a PC repair shop. He is not motivated to do anything about it. Should I report them?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1svx47/my_brother_is_getting_paid_less_than_minimum_wage/,"My brother is a good guy, but he doesn't have great self-esteem and he isn't good at sticking up for himself. He's 22 and making less than minimum wage (we are in the U.S.) for his job. This is not an internship.

I believe he works between 30-40 hrs/week. I asked him if he'd like me to speak up for him, but he said that he'd rather I not. As a concerned citizen (and not just his brother), I think that the guy who runs the joint is a douche and a law-breaker. My brother says that it's good experience for him, which is fine, but the law is the law (and my bro brings in a good amount of revenue with his tech skills).

Should I just not intervene? I know my bro has to fight his own battles, but I hate seeing an employer take advantage of him (and his co-workers, who are no-doubt being underpayed as well)."
1svpse,8,2013-12-14,Trying to get out to the west coast: Take a Midwest detour or move there directly?,sll_r0_r0_0,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1svpse/trying_to_get_out_to_the_west_coast_take_a/,"Well, first a little about me. I'm an ECE student graduating next semester, I have mid-range GPA from a public university in Florida, no impressive internships but some relevant work experience for the last year or so. Right now, I have a strong desire to find a job in Silicon Valley or Seattle, which I feel would start my career off on the right foot.

I currently have two offers:

One offer is from a company based in a pleasant Midwestern city, developing healthcare software. I like a lot of things about this job: the campus is nice, they allow a lot of independence, the pay is very generous, and I've negotiated the terms to ensure I'll be doing something that interests me and will be marketable in the future. I've heard companies like Amazon and Microsoft recruit some employees here, so it's not what I consider a dead-end job by any means. However, I don't see myself living in the Midwest forever, so I view this job as a sort of detour to prove myself before moving on.

The other offer is from Cisco, at the San Jose, CA location as a software engineer. I don't like the work as much and there seems to be a lot of middle management. Pay isn't a big deal for me (I won't leave a student mindset for a while) but when factoring in the cost of living it's a good deal less. To be honest, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer, but I feel like it will give me way more opportunities and I could move on in a year anyways. Having a Cisco reference couldn't be bad for my career, and since I want to get involved in the startup scene this seems like the most logical option, if the less fun one.

I'm concerned that the year or two working out in the Midwest will delay my career by too much and then I'll be playing catch-up. On the other hand, I want to be doing something I enjoy. On the other other hand, I could probably force myself to do a year of work at Cisco if it means it will be way more beneficial.

Any thoughts?"
1sva0s,7,2013-12-14,Wanting to build a portfolio for an upcoming career fair. What should be in it and why?,The_Alex_,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1sva0s/wanting_to_build_a_portfolio_for_an_upcoming/,"Hey all. So my University has a career fair every semester and I'm wanting to get an internship to not only get some valuable real-world work experience, but also build my resume. I personally feel as though that when it comes to programming and coding, a resume says nothing about my code, what it looks like, and how efficient it is, especially since I do not have any work experience related to coding, nor any accolades other than my grades.

That being said, I feel a portfolio of my projects is the way to go to impress potential employers. My only questions is : What should I put in my portfolio?

I can code extremely well in C++, and have decent experience in Java, JavaScript, and Python. My computer science knowledge encompasses past intro courses to basic data structures. Of course, I don't mind taking on projects above this knowledge range ; everyone likes to improve and solidify their knowledge if they are serious about this field.

Although I am not too concerned with whether the internships I apply for are relevant to the career I want to get into since any experience looks good on a resume, I do see the logic in having a an internship that applies to your desired career on your resume, so I will mention that I am wanting to get into Robotics.

Thanks so much for your time!

EDIT: I also would like to know the best way to go about forming the porfolio. Should I have a folder of printed out code or should I just have a link to my Github? I feel the latter is far more practical, but I'm worried no one will pay any mind to it."
1suivu,1,2013-12-13,First offer out of school - should I negotiate?,psant,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1suivu/first_offer_out_of_school_should_i_negotiate/,"Hi guys,

I finally got my first job offer! I'm super excited, but I'm curious as to whether or not I should negotiate. The problem is that the position is part of a unique rotational program, so the salary is not something I can simply look up on GlassDoor to see if it's competitive.

Some factors I think might help (will they?)
1) I'm working on my Masters in Computer Science.
2) I was an intern at this company last summer.

Any tips? Should I even negotiate?"

[Hey Will! Three years ago after the Betty White SNL taping, my friends and I enticed you over our way with a box of cupcakes. You ran over and began punching the cupcakes in anger. You called us muffin poisoners and immediately regretted punching them as you had a lot of icing on your fist. Three years later, I was wondering if you still regret this decision and if you’ve ever been able to look at cupcakes the same way again.  Also, what was your inspiration behind your SNL character Clancy T. Bachleratt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce1518g?context=5)|I am still very sorry about the cupcakes situation.  I absolutely remember destroying them.  I do not regret it though.  As for Clancy T. Bachleratt -- I don't even remember how we came up with that stuff.  It just kinda happened.  We originally tried to write a sketch using ""model t cars, jars of beer, toddlers and spaceships"" in existing songs like Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone but it would have been too expensive to produce so we just made up original songs.  And Jonah Hill was really good about championing the sketch after the table read.  Thanks for liking that one -- it's one of my favorites I ever got to do at SNL.  Sorry again about punching the cupcakes!
[P.S. Tell me which movie studio I need to entice with cupcakes to get them to make “MacGruber 2: Grube Harder” and/or the prequel to the Brothers Solomon ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce1518g?context=5)|And no need for cupcakes, we're gonna make MacGruber 2 -- somehow, somewhere, sometime!
[What did you do for your SNL audition?  Were there any sketches during your time there that you were completely surprised went to air?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce159ow?context=5)|For my audition, I did Tim Calhoun, a speed reader, a prison guard that yelled at people and another thing I used to do at the Groundlings Theater (perhaps my favorite sketch I've ever done) called the Gold Man -- I'm one of those Gold Men on the streets that moves when people put money in their bowl -- I get my money stolen and then sing a sweet song about the hard life of a Gold Man that ends in the reveal that I suck cock for my facepaint.  From there on out, most of the rest of the song is about cock and facepaint -- in fact, those are the only two words I use for the final two minutes of the song -- I must have sang the word cock like 200 times by the end of it.  As I walked out of the audition, Lorne thanked me for coming and I shook his hand and said ""Sorry for all the cocks.""  The next day, I found out I got the job.  I guess it was the perfect amount of cocks!
[What is the status of the MacGruber sequel? Also have you considered calling it MoreGruber or MacTwober?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15215?context=5)|Val wants us to call it MacGruber Also which I really like.
 |Status:  In the writing process but Jorma, John Solomon and I are all so damn busy, it's been hard to get together.  It is a priority though and we will write it soon!
[When will ""Fortin' with Will"" get picked up as its own series?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15eqm?context=5)|I would sign onto that in a heartbeat!
[Hi Will!! You're f'ing fantastic. Rewatching old SNL's, I noticed that you frequently did a lot of funny singing - and you're quite good at it too! I loved your mother's day song. Aside from comedy-singing, do you enjoy singing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce155u1?context=5)|I love singing so much.  Jason Sudeikis and I go do karaoke about 90% of the time that we hang out.  Just the two of us usually, doing deep cuts.
[Personal hero Will Forte.  The Brothers Solomon is one of the most underrated comedies of the past 20 years (I have a Brothers Solomon tattoo that only people who saw the movie would get\). In the DVD commentary, you mention you have a 'we need black baby' story about the casting and I sometimes lay at wake at night thinking about this. Can you please share? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce158cr?context=5)|I wish I could, but only in person -- if you ever see me on the street or something, please come ask.  I even give you permission to interrupt my dinner and ask.  Even if I'm eating with the President!
[Hi Will! Did you know that you were a better Jenna Maroney than the real Jenna Maroney?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15jd4?context=5)|Bite your tongue!  Jane is an amazing actress.  I always had respect for her, but getting to work with her, my respect grew even more.  What she does is really hard to do but she makes it look effortless!  What an honor to be a part of that show -- thanks Tina!
[How much fun is it to do Drunk History?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce154a6?context=5)|It's so damn fun.  I love Derek Waters.  Would love to be the drunk person telling the story at some point too.
[Is the gum in your mouth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce182fv?context=5)|Ew, that's gross sorry.  Yes I will.. if it's in your mouth.
[I've never seen a character quite as...""emotionally troubled"" as Will Grello. How did you manage to tap into that level of emotional instability? Also, how did the kids in the ""Fortin' with Will"" sketch react to such a convincing display of rage? Love your work, brother. Keep it up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15dv7?context=5)|Tim and Eric get you there very quickly -- they create such a fun environment in which to go crazy.  As for Fortin with Will, I was really concerned about the kids, so I spent a great deal of time in between takes becoming friends with them and letting them know that what I was about to do was all just make believe -- those kids are so awesome in that -- they really make that sketch!  Thanks for the compliment!
[Will, who was your favorite SNL host to work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce154g5?context=5)|Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Betty White, Josh Brolin, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin (my number one hero).  So many wonderful people and wonderful memories!

If you had to pick, what was your favorite character you got to play on your Weekend Update slots? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce155f8?context=5)|I think I would have to say Jon Bovi was my favorite.  So fun to do that with Sudsy.  And I don't think we ever got to say this, but our character's names were Dick Thickness and Girth Evans.  Now you know!
[Will you sit in gum for me one more time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15pj8?context=5)|Is the gum in your mouth?

[WILL!! I love your SNL characters! What's one of the hardest times you've had to keep your composure for a skit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce158j9?context=5)|The hardest probably was when Bill Hader and I did a sketch with Josh Brolin called Fartface.  It bombed so hard so it was tough to mentally stay in it.  But we plowed through it!
[How big is your dick? Post pic.  Edit: He answered. I am 200% satisfied.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce16xwv?context=5)|Shoot, my dick pic camera broke (I have a special one for dick pics)  But it is huge!

I loved that show and thought it ended too soon!
[Hey Will!   How did you mentally prepare for the celery scene in MacGruber?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce159uo?context=5)|The hardest part of that scene was the fact that my mom was visiting the set that day with her friends.  I should have told her to go to Santa Fe that day (we made the movie in Albuquerque).  But we got past it as a family.
[MacGruber is an underrated masterpiece. Did you have any regrets about the way it was marketed?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce158n0?context=5)|I love that movie with all my heart.

And then Olivia Wilde took him away from me!  (She's so amazingly awesome and I'm so happy for both of them)
[The Falconer - anyone in particular inspire this character? How could you guys keep a straight face writing these sketches?

I had nothing and he said that he was gonna say five words and we were gonna write a sketch about one of them.  And then he said: ""dental hygienist... construction worker... falconer... tennis player... chef.""  and we all agreed that a Falconer was the way to go and the three of us went to work coming up with the idea.  It was very late at night -- or morning -- like 5:00am when we started it.  Thanks so much for liking it!

[Macgruber is an under appreciated masterpiece and the stuff you did with Tim And Eric is some of the funniest stuff I've seen, along with snl stuff like the falconer and tim calhoun.

They write amazing stuff that's easy to get worked up doing.  It's so fun to work with Tim and Eric -- with the crazy stuff they do, you would think that they would be way more weird.  But when you meet them, they're just two nice normal dudes.  I hope you get to meet them so you can verify this!

A lot of times, people try to talk you into doing stuff that makes you compromise your comedy.  Do not EVER let that happen.  Believe in yourself to the hilt!

It really was the best job of all time to be in that kind of situation for your job.

[Did you know Nebraska would be in black-and-white and does that knowledge change anything about how you act on film?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce159b6?context=5)|I found out from Alexander pretty early on in the process that it would be in black and white.  It didn't really change anything about the way we acted in the movie.  We did however at times wear some pretty weird color combos that would register better in black and white -- undershirts that were neon orange -- that kind of thing.  If you were to watch a color version of the movie, you would think, what the hell are these guys wearing?  But I can't imagine the movie in anything but black and white now -- I think it's so beautiful!  Alexander Payne is amazing!
[That inspirational coach speech with Peyton Manning was the funniest thing I've ever seen. Where did that come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce175px?context=5)|Thanks very much!  So happy you liked it.  I think that's my favorite sketch I ever got to do at SNL.  That was one I wrote with John Lutz (the guy that played Lutz on 30 Rock).  He came into my office with that crazy song (""Casino Royale"") and I told him about an idea I had from years before in which a coach used a weird song to motivate his team and we went from there.  The funny thing is that we wrote the whole thing just thinking that I would play the song and listen to it the whole time.  But right as we were about to turn the sketch in, Lutz said ""Why don't you dance while the song is playing or something.""  I can't believe we almost didn't think of that because that's the whole sketch!  Thanks again for liking it!
[How much fun was it to be in Beerfest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15fk1?context=5)|It was such a blast.

How I Met Your Mother was an amazing experience.  I wrote at Letterman with Carter Bays and Craig Thomas who created the show, so I had known them forever.  They're wonderful guys.  So it was a very comfortable experience working on the show.  The director Pam Fryman is AWESOME and the whole cast is so talented and so damn nice -- it really was a great experience!  And I didn't ever get to drink a Wharmpess but I bet it tastes like it sounds.  
[""Lettuce"" is my pretty much my favorite thing ever, whose idea was it?

Akiva, Andy and Jorma came to me and asked if I had any ideas for shorts.  I told them about this and then we wrote it together.  Really happy that you liked it!  Oh, and forgot the second question!  My favorite things to do on SNL -- the dancing coach sketch with Peyton Manning -- all the Clancy T. Bachleratt and Jackie Snad songs about Model T Cars, Jars of Beer, Toddlers and Spaceships -- the ESPN Classic sketches -- MacGruber -- Jon Bovi -- and Potato Chip!
[Hi Will, you were my favorite character in Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar movie as the Alan, the owner of E-Z Swords.

I just do what they ask me to do.  I love working with those guys so much.  They are surprisingly normal guys for the crazy stuff they do.  I hope you get a chance to meet them one day -- you'll see!
 |And thanks!  So happy you liked Allan Bishopman!  There is a commercial for E-Z Swords that for some reason didn't make the final cut of the movie.  If you haven't seen it, you should check it out.  I love it!

Did she do anything weird?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce151d0?context=5)|I did get hang out with Aubrey at Parks and Rec, but I had known her for years.

Every part of the Nebraska experience was amazing.  Bruce could not have been better to me -- what a great friend and guide through the whole process.  And I got to watch an amazing actor who has given hundreds of amazing performances, give the best performance of his lifetime -- and I got to watch it from like a foot away.  To say it was an incredibly special experience would be the biggest understatement of all time.
[How did you keep the celery in your butt cheeks during the MacGruber scene? Intense butt strength or was it pretty far up there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce16srs?context=5)|It was more of a butt strength thing.

I usually say that you should either go to The Groundlings in LA, UCB in NY or Second City in Chicago and start working your way through the system.  They always look for people in those places.  But there are so many other wonderful theaters and I'm kinda out of the loop now.  There are also so many ways that you can get noticed on the internet too.  Old Man Forte wishes he could give you better advice, but that's the best he can do.  Best of luck to you.  Work your ass off and work with as many people as you can -- you never know who is gonna make it to the next level and then take you with them!  Or maybe you're the person who makes it and takes them along.
[Hey will!!! i a big fan from the uk! love you in SNL and 30 Rock!! my question is why is Nebraska only showing in cinemas in London, rather than the whole UK? cause i love to see it but i don't live near London :(  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15c9y?context=5)|They've been stepping it out slowly -- it's the same thing out here in the US.  They opened in only four theaters (two in NY, two in LA) and have been slowly expanding.  I think it's gonna be in like 250 theaters this weekend out here.  I assume it'll expand in the UK as well.

[But I need to know.  In the sketch where you are in a spelling bee and take 2 minutes to spell Business, were all of those letters written exactly on the cue card, or did you make them up as you went along?  This has been keeping me up at night for years.   And also, days.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce15jzq?context=5)|As for Spelling Bee, that's one I used to do when I was at the Groundlings (a sketch/improv comedy theater in LA).  I used to go on forever with the letters -- sometimes like double the SNL version of the sketch.  I was really nervous because it was the last sketch of the night before Neil Young played and I was scared that he wouldn't have enough time to do his song so I did it a little shorter than I normally would have.  In hindsight, I should have just kept saying letters until they hauled me off the stage.  But it was so fun to get to do that one at SNL -- that's one that's really close to my heart!
[Hi Mr. Forte. Can I call you Will?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1str27/my_name_is_will_forte_and_i_will_answer_anything/ce166n8?context=5)|First of all, thank you so much for the nice things you said in there!

I don't really plan things out.  Nebraska came out of nowhere for me -- it's been such an amazing experience and has been so exciting, but it was about as unexpected as you can get.  As for the future, I would love to try a little bit of everything!  And I would also like to try to make MacGruber 2 (but don't tell my parents that -- I think they think I've moved through that phase)

1syorc,9,2013-12-15,Can non-programmers ever write anything besides spaghetti code?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1syorc/can_nonprogrammers_ever_write_anything_besides/,"I do a lot of programming in my current job, because I am significantly cheaper than a trained programmer, and my boss is a little vague on what makes one computer skill different than another (think http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cVhuG5QYoQ). Apparently this pattern has been going on for quite some time (hire person who knows nothing about programming to program, replace with other non-programmer when they leave), so I'm sitting on a huge mountain of legacy spaghetti code. I don't want to add to the problem; I've tried reading ""Design Patterns"" and stuff by Knuth, but to be honest it all seems a little beyond me. I'm really not sure how to improve without going back to school for a CS degree, and trying to explain to my boss why exactly they should replace me with at the very least a paid intern from the local CS department has not been successful.

Is this a sinking ship? I know that I don't have the skills to re-factor the codebase, but what can I do to at least stop myself from making it worse? What tactics should I use to convince my boss that they really do need someone with training working on the code?

Am I going about this the wrong way? Advice appreciated."

* *This is a hand-on, learn-by-doing course that shows you         how to build solutions to real-world problems using embedded systems. Each student will purchase a Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller kit and a few electronic components. This microcontroller has a state of the art ARM Cortex M4 processor. The course uses a bottom-up approach to problem-solving building gradually from simple interfacing of switches and LEDs to complex concepts like display drivers, digital to analog conversion, generation of sound, analog to digital conversion, graphics, interrupts, and communication. We will present both general principles and practical tips for building circuits and programming the microcontroller in the C programming language. You will develop debugging skills using oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and software instrumentation. Laboratory assignments are first performed in simulation, and then you will build and debug your system on the real microcontroller. At the conclusion of this course you will be able to build your own arcade-style game.*

I was wondering after completing this edX course and the college courses I've listed, I'd be a good applicant for a computer engineering internship since it's really important for me to get as much experience as possible before I graduate."

Sorry if I ramble or sound rushed; I'm a little sleep-deprived and nervous. Basically, I applied and interviewed for two internships for the upcoming semester. I'm 20 and still in college. Company #1: really cool, fits what I am hoping to be paid for this summer (editorial work) at a different company (so I think it might look good on my resume if I've interned in a similar position), and it's well-known. Company #2: a non-profit that has several locations across the country, which was my main drive... and while it's not oriented toward what I'd like to do in the summer, it still seemed fitting as it would allow me to teach creative writing to kids. After the interview, however, I felt differently about it; it didn't seem to fit exactly what I wanted, and the commute home was extremely difficult. It would be a 2 hour commute and I would be unpaid. At Company #1 I'd also be unpaid, but the commute is only 15 minutes on the subway.



So I think it's probably clear that I'm leaning toward #1. However, #2 contacted me on Thursday and offered me the job, asking for a response from me by today. I waited until today because I wanted to see if #1 had gotten back to me. Because I was nervous, I emailed #2 back and said that I was having a bit of trouble with my scheduling for next semester and might only be able to work there one day a week. I know, I know - I should have just asked for an additional couple days to make my decision. but I'm not wildly experienced with these kinds of things and have never had to turn down an offer, so I felt uncomfortable about that. I ended up talking to my teacher/advisor and he suggested that I ask for extra days and contact #1 to see if they'd come to a decision yet. I honestly didn't know that either of those moves would be considered appropriate - learning experience, I guess....





So, as it would happen, I emailed #1 asking nicely for an update, and they responded immediately offering me the position. Which is exciting, but also so frustrating --- especially because Company #2 emailed me at the SAME time saying that they'd be more than happy to be flexible and work around my schedule so that I could come in whenever I am available. Dammit. They're so nice! So I guess I just feel really, really guilty now. There is no way I could accept both positions as I won't have time. I really want to accept #1, but I don't know what to tell #2, and I feel like a jerk for having to say ""Oh, thank you for being so considerate and willing to accommodate my schedule, but I'm STILL going to turn you down."" Sigh.


So that's my struggling point. I don't know how to turn #2 down after they've been so nice! I know this is something I need to learn now as opposed to later, so I thought you might be able to help me.

Thank you SO much for any opinions and suggestions!"

Hi guys,

I´m in need of your help here.
At first, please forgive me my grammar and spelling, as English is not my native language.

I work as an intern in an IT-Department, which has recently acquired two big-ass 4K-Displays.
Their purpose is showing several monitoring applications, like NAGIOS, for example.

My job now, is to build a preferably small Windows-machine, which is able to feed two 4k-displays simultaneously.
I´m experienced in building rigs, but the whole 4K-thing is new to me, as it is to anyone I know in person.
Sadly I couldn´t find any useful recommendations on the web for a project like this.

Also my boss would like to see something based on a mini-ITX board, while I fear this won´t be possible.

Scenarios I thought about are:

A)	Using an Intel Core-CPU, equipped with internal graphics and a PCIe graphic adapter for the second panel. Provided that the board supports the use of both (the on-board and the external) HDMI-jacks simultaneously. As I haven´t tried this before, I don´t know if this would fly or not.

B)	Building a “normal” PC, equipped with a SLI- or Crossfire-Setup, what in turn would not meet the desired small form factor. Until now, I couldn´t even find out, if there´s a graphic adapter supporting dual-4K output, or if If I HAVE to choose a  dual-setup.

As this little project might be a small step to a permanent job in the company I´m doing this internship at, I´d really appreciate any useful input from you.

I´m a Redditor since about three years now and haven´t asked for much yet (except funny cat pix and some Gonewild-stuff), but today I need your support.

Thank you,

I would like to eventually build a social music sharing website, but would also like to learn Python for general coding purposes and to pursue my interest in machine learning and AI in general. My time and energy is quite limited, however, so I need to prioritise my pursuits. **Given a time span of one year, would it be more worthwhile to focus on Python** projects that incorporate AI of some sort; **or to learn web dev skills** to get the music websites up and running, **then add on machine learning/NLP features?** Basically, I feel like the Python projects would be more relevant to developing AI skills, but less beneficial to the world, whilst the music websites would actually fill a gap in the market.

***&lt;/SHORT VERSION&gt;***

***&lt;LONG VERSION&gt;***

**Definite Goals:**

* Have a well-designed blog/website up where I can also host my programming projects
* Have a demonstrable coding project done within a year
*  Become proficient at OOP
* Learn Python


**Tentative Projects:**

* A variety of swarm intelligence exercises (think StarLogo)
* A website where people write about their experiences with particular songs, enabling an exploratory mode where recommendations are given based on the similarity of your experience with someone else's (using NLP)
* A social music sharing website (think Facebook groups with functionality geared towards sharing music)


**Constraints:**

* Limited time and energy (heavy university workload)
* Currently doing General Engineering, with very little programming in the coursework (C++ only) - I only specialise next year
* Would preferably like to explore machine learning, NLP, AI, genetic algorithms or computational creativity (I find these topics very interesting)
* Would prefer a career that utilises the Information and Computer Engineering degree I will eventually get, i.e. AI/machine learning focus over web dev


**Current Skill Level:**

* 1st Year uni knowledge of C and C++
* 2 month internship doing basic work with C


For the blog, I intend to use WordPress to get it up and running so I can do some writing ASAP, but **in future, I'm not sure if I should focus on developing my WordPress skills**, or if I should learn JS or perhaps Flask (so I can build my Python skills simultaneously), in order to further develop the site.

Basically, my dilemma is whether to **focus on basic web dev skills** right now so I can eventually get either one of the two big music based projects going, or to **focus on learning Python**, so I can build interesting (but initially fairly useless) swarm intelligence/computational creativity apps. **I really want to be able to build the music websites some day**, as I feel like there aren't any social music websites out there that do exactly what I want; **yet I fear the learning curve for web dev skills would mean I won't be able to get anything done in the limited amount of time I have**.

The problem I am having is that I have no internship/co-op experience in my field whatsoever. I also have no research experience either, just research I have done for my senior design project.  My GPA is fine (above a 3.0), and I have held officer positions in a number of student organizations on campus. My university does not require you to do an internship in order to graduate so for my first two years, I did not think too much of them.  I did not grasp the importance of doing an internship/co-op in college until my third year, and I was unfortunately unable to acquire one for that summer despite my efforts. Now it is my senior year, and I feel like I am the most noncompetitive student in my major for finding a job. I tried this past semester to find a full-time position, but no luck. I have seen plenty of my other fellow ChE students get jobs seemingly effortlessly and it is very discouraging to me. I've worked part-time jobs in the past before, but nothing engineering related. I am just afraid that I am not going to be able to even get my foot in the door to get my career started. Just thought I would post my thoughts/fears. Just not really sure what to do at this point.

One of the guys from tech support told me about one of his older jobs as a system admin at a small company some years back.

Apparently they didn't have a proper admin before, the guy responsible for administering the company servers just gave him a quick rundown of all the systems the day before he started work and then he was gone.

Everything was running fine, no crazy issues. That being said, a couple of weeks in on the job he hears people talking about using the ""long distance"" email account for communicating with clients.

This obviously set out some alarm bells. He goes and asks about this long distance email address thing, which he thought was some company policy he didn't hear of before. Apparently people used some personal email accounts for talking to people living far away, because their company emails only worked for small distance emails (what?).

It seems that everyone in the company did this, it was common practice.He goes and checks the server it was connected and sending to the internet and any address just fine. The problem was, emails were getting timed out almost instantly. The old solaris based server had set the timeout to 0 and if the connection was fast enough emails could get trough just fine, otherwise they would disappear into thin air. Thus only recipients 'close' enough could receive them. The problem had been there since they first started, so people just saw it as the norm."

1t2mav,3,2013-12-17,My life is heading nowhere,Tharagar,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1t2mav/my_life_is_heading_nowhere/,"I am writing this here because I can't bear to hold it only to myself anymore. 

First of all, I must apologize for many reasons. The first and least reason is about the quality of my English. I do not usually write in anything else than French so, please, be indulgent. The second reason is about the situation which brings me pain itself. I had a fairly easy life and still have a lot of things others would have dreamed of at that time and I consider myself lucky to have had those things, but they do not erase of ease the pain. I apologize for that weakness and loathing toward what would seem for many as an easy way of life. The last apology I must make is about the length. I do not expect someone to read it whole and if you just read those words and do not wish to continue any further, I would easily understand.

I have been thinking a lot about suicide recently. My way of life has changed a lot and painful thoughts and memories are rushing back. I should give you a quick glance at what happened before. 

It all began in high school. Back then, I was one of those kids who are considered nerds. I was the kind of kid who had his first black eye at 6. Playing D&amp;D, card games, video games, that kind of kid. It was my way to escape. I escaped hostility from my classmates. On good days, I was kind of invisible, which was not as bad as it may seem. On bad days, I made a mistake and got laughed at for what seemed an eternity. On really bad days, people picked at me for a laugh. Never with physical violence, only words. Before entering high school, one of my fears was to think of myself better than I truly was, to overestimate myself. The worst was when a girl hugged me because I was too pitiful (and it was not one of those sincere hugs). No need to tell you that by the end of high school I didn’t know what to think of myself anymore and that I was terrified at the idea of speaking with a girl for every time it happened before, the sole purpose was to laugh at me. 

Cegep began (a kind of 2-3 years advanced studies between high school and college) and I decided to stick to the shadows. Besides, I didn’t know what else to do at that time, the one girl I fell for a year ago telling me she wasn’t interested in me. It was also a time of turmoil in my mind for I didn’t think I wanted to go into psychology anymore (especially for the length of the studies). I was in social science at that time. I found myself a little small haven where I would be almost alone and reflected most of my free time. I already wanted to end my life at that time, thinking I was worth nothing, that there was a purpose behind all that hate towards me. I managed to carry on, dealing with my concentration disorder poorly. I earned my diploma 3 years later (when it should have taken me 2) and took a few months to reflect on my future. I thought about teaching history in Cegep, since that place, despise having stuck to the shadows, was one of the better things that happened to me in a long time. I longed for philosophy, economy, French and English literature, psychology, sociology and especially history. I knew that I wanted to become a scholar. However, statistical chances that I would find a job as a history teacher were incredibly slim so I abandoned that project. 

I worked for 6 months out of school, not knowing where to go. I met a girl that was from the Cegep I went from at that time. It didn’t work out well and 2 weeks after our kind of date, she was with another guy. I do not need to tell you how much it hurt me.

I finally got into a networking class. It was expensive but I went for it since the money would be good in the end. Halfway through it, I wanted to give up. It bore me to no end. I ended up assimilating the whole books for the exams and then forgot everything about them. Everyone pushed me to get that piece of paper when I wanted out. I was burnt. Only one thing kept me going. 

There is a girl at my part time job. She is beautiful, caring, the embodiment of innocence and happiness. I got along incredibly well with her. We were about to go take a coffee together around Christmas last year and I planned to confess my feelings for her then. But I waited too long. One week before we went, I overheard at job that she had a new boyfriend. I was crushed. This was the first time I felt something so strong for someone. It was not just physical desire, it was a lot more. She was not perfect but I could have lived with those flaws. Now, every time I see her with him, I fell like someone is tearing me from the inside.

I almost finished my networking class but my laziness took over and I did not do the last projects. There is uncertainty about whether I’ll finish it or not. I still did my 2 months internship and ended up knowing I could not do one of those cubicle jobs and be happy. In the middle of my internship, the night before the end of the first inscription round, I applied to get into a history baccalaureate. Since then, I am studying history and aiming for what would be my dream job, no matter the odds. 

However, all my willpower is lost. Everything that kept my laziness in check just went away. I barely pass my classes, barely sleep, eat less than 2 meals a day in average and just drown myself in video games to forget the pain and problems. I feel like I have no future, no hope and that no girl with a bit of judgment would open her heart to me. 

I am now 24, hopeless, weak and lonely. I made myself a promise at 20 that by 25, if nothing would have gotten better, if no one ever opened their heart to me, if I failed to rise, I would forfeit my life. 

Do not misunderstand. I do not hate myself. I hate my laziness and my lack of charisma but I do not fundamentally hate who I came to be. I just feel I am wrong by not hating it."

1t1zlb,3,2013-12-16,"About to graduate without a degree in CS, looking for advice...",importTuna,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1t1zlb/about_to_graduate_without_a_degree_in_cs_looking/,"Hello Reddit,

Longtime digger, finally signed up for reddit after lurking for quite some time.  
If I break some cardinal rule of reddit please forgive me.  Anyways, I’m in an interesting 
situation, and need some career advice.  I guess I should start with a little background
info on how I got to where I am today.  This is going to be beyond TL;DR, so prepare yourself.

I started out my venture into CS back in 2005, when I was accepted into Penn State’s Engineering
program at a branch campus.  I spent two years there, studying computer science, and while I 
absolutely loved the coursework and the program, I simply could not keep up with some of the 
math courses.  The college of engineering, as I’m sure you guys are aware, uses many of the 
math and physics courses as cut courses.  Bone crushing exams and the like.  Granted, a lot 
of my failure there was related to my age I feel.  At 18/19 years old I was more interested in
partying and generally being an ass than hitting the books, but hit the books I did.  
My final semester and third run through calc 2 I finally saw some of the writing on the wall.

The effect on my GPA was nearly catastrophic.  I withdrew my final semester with a 
2.02 GPA.  My family was not in the best of financial shape at this point.  My dad lost his 
job a semester in to my first year of school.  Given my academic performance, and the number
 of courses I had dropped, I ended up paying back a lot of grants, not to mention having to 
make student loan payments.  I needed to find a job that paid well enough to cover these 
expenses, as well as my dream of returning to Penn State.

I found that job in the wireless industry.  Selling cell phones believe it or not is actually 
a reasonably decent job.  Not too bad, especially if you’re good at it, and I was.  I spent some
 time working for a small local dealer, and when I left there, I went to one of the major wireless
 carriers in the US.  At this point I was working for a top 20 fortune company, with all the benefits.
  Not a low stress job, continual increases in goals and quotas, management screaming at you
 constantly to improve this metric or that metric.  The silver lining was that I was at this point 
making $60,000 a year.  I parlayed my success at this into a transfer to a store in State College,
 took a $10,000 a year pay cut, and made my journey back into school.  I figured the $6000/yr 
in tuition reimbursement made this only a $4000/yr loss.

Penn State was not as receptive about my return.  I was essentially washed out of the 
computer science and engineering program as I did not receive entrance to a specific major.  
CompSci was just simply not an option, not to mention, 4 years had passed since I’ve last even
 looked at calculus.  Given the field I was in, I did some bureaucratic gymnastics, and weaseled
 my way into Penn State’s Information Sciences and Technology program.

The journey to that point was not without its trials.  This also wasn’t my first rodeo with 
Penn State’s massive bureaucracy.  After leaving school my first instinct was to find out what my
 options were as far as returning goes.  Not meeting entrance to major is a death sentence for an
 engineering student.  I knew that.  I reached out to the college of IST immediately after withdrawing,
 and scheduled an appointment with an academic adviser.  The adviser (who happened to be the
 head of academic advising for the college), that I met with after a 3 hour drive to university park,
 told me that the college of IST was simply not an option for me.  My GPA did not meet their
 requirements as such, and moreso, it seemed that the college of IST was more interested in
 a student fresh out of high school than anyone with the thought of leaving compsci and coming
 to IST.  Regardless, I knew if I had any shot at beginning a career in computer science or a
 related field, I needed some sort of degree, and being the sort of person who insists on finishing
 what they started, another university was simply not an option.  I started at Penn State, my
 father went to Penn State, I had decided on penn state when I was in middle school, I was
 going to graduate with a Penn State degree.

So now, I’m living in the correct geographic area to begin my return to school.  
I read the academic advising handbook, and pretty much every policy Penn State has. 
 First order of business was reenrolling, which was easy enough.  Simple form, hand it to 
the registrar, and for the first time in four years, I was a Penn State student yet again.  
That said, before I could register for classes, I had to clear somewhere along the lines of 
20 separate holds on my registration, two from the college of engineering, one from the 
bursars office who apparently forgot that I had paid them, one from housing regarding a 
4 year old charge for a new light switch plate on my old dorm room, the list goes on.  
I cleared those holds in a few hours’ time, and then could register for classes again. 
 I still was at this point, banned from the college of IST, but for now, I was a 
telecommunications major.  Seemed fitting given my current career.

I found an interesting policy in Penn State’s handbook a few years prior that I bookmarked. (http://handbook.psu.edu/content/academic-renewal) 

&gt; The student's cumulative grade-point average and cumulative credits start anew when he/she enrolls in the first course following the renewal. His/her total credits &gt;are recalculated to include only those courses in which a grade of C or higher was earned and which have been approved by the appropriate dean to fulfill &gt;graduation requirements.
&gt;The student's prior academic record remains on the transcript, including all grades earned prior to renewal. Courses with a grade of D taken before academic renewal &gt;will not satisfy graduation requirements. Courses with a grade of C or better that are approved by the appropriate dean may fulfill graduation requirements.
&gt;Late drop credits are restored; credits used prior to academic renewal are not counted against the student's late drop credit limit.

I met with an adviser in the college of communications, one of the people 
who helped me most along my journey.  She helped me prepare a petition to the 
faculty senate, as I did not meet the less than 2.0 GPA requirement of the policy.  
The faculty senate responded after about a week’s time.  I was granted academic 
renewal, and my GPA was reset.  I then completed some more paperwork, and changed
 my major to Information Sciences and Technology, with a complete fresh start, keeping 
all the credits I had already earned.  Interestingly enough, now that I was an IST major, 
I needed an adviser in the college of IST.  I was assigned to the same person who four years 
prior had told me that IST was simply not an option for me.  It’s basically impossible for me 
not to smile a bit each time I walk into her office.

So now I’m working full time, about 50 hours a week, taking about 6-9 credits per semester. 
 My performance at work slips a bit due to my course load, my performance at school slips slightly
 due to my work load.  I fight my way back to being at least an average sales rep and a decent 
student.  I’m at this point at work the person with the most seniority, everyone comes to me with
 complex questions and problems, my hourly rate is almost twice that of a new hire with the company. 
 I’m in a job that I don’t really want to be in.  My passion has always been computers, but I find
 myself more and more out of touch with programming and the computer industry as a whole. 
 My life is consumed by cell phones.  I can’t walk down the street without being able to identify
 every person’s cell phone by brand, model, and carrier.  My manager is constantly riding me
 about sales numbers, and I’m honestly sick of sales.  My heart just simply isn’t in selling cell
 phones at this point, and it’s about time for me to go.  I was let go from that position about a
 month ago at this point.  That said, I stashed enough money away over this time to be able to,
 for the first time in quite a while, return to Penn State full time, and finish my degree.

That brings me to the present.  I’m at this point a full time student.  I expect 
to graduate after fall semester with an Information Sciences and Technology degree, 
with my focus area being Integration and Application.  If you’re interested in reading 
the description of what that exactly is, here is the link to the academic plan for the
 integration and application track.  http://ist.psu.edu/current-students/pdf/IST-ITINT.pdf 
 I still have yet to complete an internship.

Most of my coursework to this point involves systems integration, getting system A
 to talk to system B, data aggregation, etc.  That said, I’ve been exposed to the compsci 
curriculum, and what I can tell you is that I’ve never written anything for school that wasn’t 
in Java or PHP.  No professor has even mentioned a sorting algorithm or the like in my 
coursework.  It’s not the “low level” stuff I sort of expect from CS, but, that said, I did
 complete the first two years of compsci aside from accomplishing the math.  Most of 
the IST program seems hell bent on providing me with an IT consulting job.  I’m not 
100% convinced that’s what I want.

I’m at this point, exactly where I feel I was leaving Penn State the first time.  
I’m about to enter the job market, and I’m not sure I’m 100% prepared for what I’m 
about to enter.  I need to find an internship as a graduation requirement.  I sort of
feel that that is my real chance to break out of the consultant mold and get a job I’d
 be really passionate about and enjoy.  I’m interested in doing some sort of game 
development, as it’s always been sort of a dream job for me.  Looking at the jobs 
I’m interested in, most of them want a BS in Computer Science.  I’ve got an inordinate
 amount of questions, most of which lead to other questions.

* What job titles should I be looking for given my degree and do I want any of those jobs?
* How well does an IST degree stack up to a CompSci degree?
* Will not having a true Computer Science degree hurt me in the field?
* How will I fare in an interview for a CS related job with the degree I have?
* What options do I have to better prepare myself?
* What sort of internship should I be looking for?

When I look at the courses people who started out in university took, such as the introductory mechanical engineering courses (which my CC doesn't offer) I'm worried I wont have as much of a grasp as them. 

For instance one University I'm looking to transfer to has classes such as Computer Methods in Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Design Graphics, both of which I will have skipped by being an upper division transfer. Can/Should I still take those introductory courses even as an upper division transfer?

Also, a lot of people start getting internships in their junior year. I feel I wont have the connections or the introductory engineering process knowledge to be able to get/do well in any internships. Only some decent math and physics under my belt. I haven't done CAD or anything like that which my classmates will already have experience with.

Am I correct in being worried? And if so what can I do to help get caught up?"

1t6xhw,7,2013-12-18,"I need career advice, currently at a game changing point in my career",[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1t6xhw/i_need_career_advice_currently_at_a_game_changing/,"Hi /r/sysadmin,

I've come to ask you all for career advice as I'm currently at a game changing point in my career. 

A little background: I'm a 20 year old who has been interning for a very high profile financial corporation for a total of a year and a half now. Although I have one more year of college to go, the company has told me that they will hire me full time, to be in effect by the beginning of next year.

This company, I have been slaving my ass off for a year and a half. I started as a Desktop Support Intern, doing simple helpdesk tasks for 3 months, got dragged on to the infrastructure team as our help desk team was getting outsourced - and have been doing infrastructure related tasks for the past year and 3 months. During this time I've learned more than I could ever be thankful for, but I know I have so much more to learn. I can handle VMWare, SAN, Networking, AD, DNS and FTP better than I ever could in my life, they've taught me so much here. I've put in countless hours. Everyday is  8 am to 5pm. Then school 5pm to 9pm and then working even after 9pm remotely. Even though I was only getting paid $16/hour this entire time, it was so worth all of the hours that I've put in. 

But now it's coming to the point where HR will no longer allow for my company to extend my internship and it's either I get hired or I don't. I talked to my boss about it and he is definite on hiring me. 

So here's where I come to you for help. My boss's boss invited me in to a conference with him to talk about my current situation. He expressed that I have done tremendous amounts of quality work here and that it hasn't gone unnoticed. But he asked me if what I'm currently doing is what exactly I'd like to do. If I get hired on, I could explore other fields in the company: database, production application support, development.. He asked me if that something that I want to do instead of what I'm doing now. If I didn't want to continue IT, he would refer me to other departments and refer me to their open positions.

I love IT, I love what I do, primarily because I'm good at it. I'm good at supporting, troubleshooting and I could tell you how to set up an ESXi host for VMWare blindfolded (well almost), but so many co-workers here tell me that IT is not the place that you want to be your entire life. They tell me that there's a cap at the end of System Administration/Systems Engineering and I believe them. However I'm so comfortable doing what I'm doing now that I haven't thought much in to the future.

What do I do /r/sysadmin? I have to tell my boss's boss by Monday otherwise they won't be able to process this request through HR in time for the new year."
1t6uzx,6,2013-12-18,"Gave it 100%, fired twice. What to do?",workthrowaway618,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1t6uzx/gave_it_100_fired_twice_what_to_do/,"I've worked in the same field for the last ten years (as a technologist in the medical field) The first nine years were great. I worked with great people, we all were a good team, and I learned a great deal about my job and became very skilled at what I did.  I worked at my first employer for four years, then for five and a half at the second. I left my first job when I moved for an internship for my program. Then, I worked at the second job for 5.5 years. We had a new manager come in 2011. He didn't get along well with women and found reasons to fire three out of the four of us. He got rid of me after I brought up some situations that I thought were abusive to us to HR: throwing books at us and telling us we were worthless idiots, to name two.  The other female transferred to another facility. Patient loads dropped dramatically after his arrival, so I always wrote on applications that I was laid off. 

The next facility I worked at hired in me in anticipation of having more patients, but despite marketing efforts, the patients that were supposed to be filling the center never came, and after a good review at the 90 day mark, and nothing but (what I thought were) daily conversations all managers and employees have while working together to discuss the day's work, I was given a written warning and an action plan because my work wasn't up to par. Seventeen days later, I was fired. 

Now, I'm not getting unemployment because I was discharged. I have an appeal at the end of the month and I'm not sure what to say, especially if they bring up that I was fired from the previous facility as well. I've never been intentionally negligent in my work. I put on a smile for every patient that came through the door, listened to their concerns, and tried to do the best work I could. I worked twelve to thirteen hour shifts, sometimes longer, as I always came in early to get a head start on my work, or stayed late to make sure all tasks were complete. In both jobs, patient volume decreased significantly prior to my getting fired. When patient loads started going down a lot a couple years ago, I went back to school (for IT), but right now I don't have experience, so nobody will hire me. I'm working as hard as I can to do some projects to show my skills. I've graduated now, with my second bachelor's degree, but I can't break past HR to save my life. 

What can I say at the appeal to increase my chances of winning? 

I've listed both firings as layoffs, because I think that's what they really were. How should I bring up my leaving these companies? Can potential employers ask why I departed from the company?

[Aspiring screenwriter here. I have no contacts in Hollywood, I don't even live in the US. How do I ""break in""? Screenplay competitions? I've read one way to stand out is to actually have your screenplay made, which is a chicken-and-egg problem, but I'm writing something I can shoot for cheap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nff9?context=5)|There's a concept within literary representation - it seems like a nice little platitude but it's true: If something is *good,* people will find it. The trick is to keep writing. The mistake most young screenwriters make is they'll have one script, or two or maybe a tv spec. But that's not enough. You need to write something and then write the next thing and keep writing. As you continue to write you work will improve. And writing is comparatively inexpensive as compare to other pursuits.  Now if you really believe you've written something strong then yes filming a short or low budget feature is a fantastic way to get people's attention. Especially if it stands out and is different.  **TLDR** Keep writing, always be writing. But if you can definitely shoot it, it's a better package for your idea, and directing will help you as a screenwriter think about direction and the final look of the movie. 
[I'm writing this *""shootable script""* - few actors and locations, as few special effects as possible. Don't get me wrong, I love when movies are great with just a good script, but it's somewhat limiting - two of my other scripts (one written, outlining the other\) are sci-fi so not as easy to pull off without embarrassing results. What's the game plan for the ones I *can't* shoot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nmse?context=5)|In a perfect world: you shoot this short. It's good! It gets attention at some festivals and you'll be introduced to managers/producers and they'll all ask you this question: ""What are you doing *next?*"" The wrong answer is to say I don't know. The right answer is to say, we'll i've written YOUR NEXT MOVIE.  They'll ask you send them your script(s), and assuming they think it's good they'll either ask to represent you or ask to option the script from you. If either, hurray! If only the ladder, then make sure you find a manager to negotiate the option.  In a less than perfect world: the movie is not great, but you learn from it and make another one and another one. Keep plugging away until you're getting the responses from people you want. Cause if friends think its good, then strangers (who might be in a position to help) will think so too.
[What are some of the secrets that happen behind the scenes that only you guys know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4o7zs?context=5)|So many categories to speak of. Well it's no surprise that a lot of actors/actresses have to have a public persona of being affable and fun and are actually complete terrors to work with. That's a given. But it's also kind of surprising to people how much power a young actor is given as compared to say an experienced production designer or AD. It's kind of sad really, the amount of people who work tirelessly (and I mean incredibly long hours) who never get any credit compared to actors who do so little but are the face of the films.
 |Conversely promoting a film is hell on actors. Like film junkets are awful - if you can imagine - you're stuck in the same hotel room for days sometimes. The studio will bring in local, regional and international film critics to ask you the same 5 questions over and over again. And you need to look sharp and respond as if they're asking it for the first time, because that's how movies get sold. 
[I really feel for actors on junkets. I do my best to really engage &amp; connect w/ them in interviews, even for my 5 minutes, and thank them for their time &amp; just project my respect for their endurance!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qppq?context=5)|You're one of the good ones. Great username btw.
[What are your top 5 favourite movies of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nqzi?context=5)|Casablanca.
 |Shawshank Redemption.
 |Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
 |City of God.
 |What about you?
[I loved ""Children of Men"".  I consider ""There Will Be Blood"" a modern classic myself.  I know a lot of people didn't like this movie, put I really liked ""City of Ember"".  Also a big fan of ""Dark City""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qwir?context=5)|The only one I hadn't seen was City of Ember, I worked for the studio that made it, but never got around to watching it. I'll give it a shot. Dark City is amazing, I wish there were more movies like it.
[I've only recently started to have an appreciation for films, but so far it's:  1. Fight Club  2. Oldboy  3. The Lives of Others  4. In Bruges  5. Drive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nzpi?context=5)|I mean all those are fantastic films, so I'm going to guess we have similar tastes.
[I'm a senior high school student in southern Ohio who's life dream is to be an actor. What should I be doing now and through college to get out there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nedl?context=5)|There's no right answer to this question. In my opinion, actors have it the hardest. Because anyone can be a closet writer, director or producer. But part of an actor's job is to put themselves out there constantly and let themselves be seen.
 |From my experience, the actors who have had the most success (obviously talent helps a great deal), is to be in a place where you're able to shine. If that means being in a large production in a small town, do that - because in New York, Los Angeles actors are everywhere and you really need to find a way to stand out.
 |That being said - if you're able I would highly encourage you to try to get to an acting school in either New York or Los Angeles, besides being in a protective environment and being able to hone your craft, you'll also make connections to the people who will (years later) be in a position to hire you.
[Do you think Hollywood has changed? Is it more valuable to be in a series rather than films because of the longevity I.E Game of thrones/Dexter/True Blood/Sopranos ETC.  Who is the humblest person you have met on your journey up the ladder.  Do U have any regrets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pxh6?context=5)|Yeah it has changed - it continues to change. It wasn't that long ago that the thought of being a huge actor on a tv show was impossible. But then this market emerged where it gave you more than 2 hours to tell a compelling story.
 |The downside, from an actor's perspective - is that a movie might take 6mo-12mo of your time, but then you're free to go to the next project. Television is more demanding, so if you're the kind of person who like to mix it up - you're locked in. The money might be good - it might be nice for your family to have you in one place but it definitely limits your options.
 |The humblest - I don't know. Most people in the industry are insanely humble - they do such incredible things but unless they're an actor or director no one has heard of them. For my money - I once worked for one of the producers on the original Lord of the Rings. And while he was a great producer - the reason he got the job was because he was old friends with Peter Jackson and when Peter was first in LA, he crashed on his couch. So years later when Peter was pitching the project - he came to his old buddy and they made one of the most successful franchises. And you would never expect it from him but he was very down to earth, he told me one time (while we were waiting for a copier to finish making copies), ""never wish away time - you'll regret it one day."" It stuck with me.
[Hi, thanks for doing this. I'm trying to get a short film together, with the intent to enter competitions and upload on the internet. People have been successful doing this in the past. Any advise on that? also when it comes to shorts what do you think is more important cinematography, writing, acting. Should i be as anal as i am? It must be perfect.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nvvz?context=5)|Be Anal. That's the best advise. Be Anal.
 |The best filmmakers are anal, they care about detail. I'm sure when they started making shorts they were surrounded by people less concerned about the minute details but because they weren't their shorts were better. That quality attracts others who have a respect for the craft.
 |So what should be good - cinematography, writing or acting? EVERYTHING. But from the perspective of a short I'll say this: a terribly written short can't be saved from the best actors or the greatest cinematographer. However the best written short is hard to screw up - even with terrible cinematography or acting.
 |And yes - I mentioned it elsewhere, but direct a short, direct a bunch. Submit to commercial competitions (not doritos, but smaller ones) - they're a great way to practice and get better with the possibility of getting paid.
 |Filmmaking is a skill, you have to practice to perfect it.
[How much emphasis gets placed on soundtracks? How do most music directors go about finding/selecting music for their films? Does is rely on publishing agents? Is it a director's personal taste? Do many in the industry prefer unknown artists in order to save money financially?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4q49w?context=5)|Movie soundtracks are a dying art. Score aside, most people can cobble together any studio movie soundtrack from their own libraries so there's little demand for what was an incredibly lucrative side business in the 80s/90s.
 |The person you're talking about is called the Music Supervisor. It's their job to suggest and negotiate music/bands for their movies. Most studios have a department that does this - they get credited on each movie (usually on the billboard as well as in the credits - I think this is a contractual vestige of moviemaking from the 80s/90s).
 |However there are movies where a Music Supervisor's work is absolutely necessary so they are good at their job. It's their responsibility to know what's popular, what's going to be popular. And they do that by having relationships with labels and managers. They're constantly sent free samples and its up to them to determine whether they should pitch these bands to the studios (though a lot of the time, it'll be the director demanding they get the rights to a song the director likes).
[In your opinion what are the key elements to a good screenplay?  Also, when developing characters what do you start with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nozx?context=5)|I think what defines a good screenplay or movie is an original plot. If you've got that then it's just a matter of fine tuning all the other pieces to service the plot.  If I go to the movies I want to see something I haven't seen before. I want to believe that world is real. I want to go on a journey with that character and have them overcome all odds to succeed. That's what I want, so if something does that or even better - surprises me, twists my expectations and turns them on its head - then I know it's a good story.
 |I don't start with characters - I start with plot. Is the plot good, new, interesting, real? If it is all of those then characters within the plot should have those traits too, they're just tools of the larger plot construction anyway.
[Related question: How likely is a screenplay with an original plot to be picked up? It certainly seems that the same old thing gets produced time and time again, while the truly original and interesting stuff is perhaps seen as unmarketable.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce5ga6q?context=5)|If something is truly original, I believe people will gravitate to it. Especially if it's well written.
 |Yes it's easier to invest in something that already has a built in audience, but there's still enough of a demand for original content that people do seek it out.

[Thank you for doing this AMA :\) Is there a possibility/chance to recreate a big film industry similar to Hollywood in emerging big countries? India has Bollywood. Perhaps other countries such as Brazil, or Indonesia able to follow the footsteps?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4omzf?context=5)|Possibly. I think it has to do with language and I think it has to do with culture.
 |The US film industry currently has a rampant case of ""runaway production."" Basically other cities/states in the US and abroad provide tax incentives to major productions to film there. The logic is that the productions will create industry and infrastructure there, because you artificially create demand. The problem is that time and time again, once the tax incentives go away (or there is a higher incentive somewhere else) production leaves. BUT I think if there is little to no internal film industry and you artificially create one with incentives - you HAVE to then encourage local people to use the resources at hand to develop films locally.
 |The reason Bollywood exists as a counter to Hollywood, is that it's not exclusively English nor are the stories particularly Western. So there is a demand for those kind of stories and Hollywood isn't supplying the high-end product, so it's being made locally - and in the case of Bollywood it's being made very well and truthfully in a stronger market than Western cinema.
 |So I think it's possible to create industry in emerging nations, but there has to be a demand for local, cultural product as well as finances available for locals to learn how to create cinema.
[Hi there, I'm really curious about some major movies can turn out really badly (e.g. bad script etc.\)  I understand that getting into hollywood is generally really competitive, but if this is the case then how do movies with terrible direction or acting happen?  Surely the most qualified people get the job, so shouldn't they produce the best work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4p72t?context=5)|It's a tricky question - if you can give me a specific example we can pull apart and try to figure out what went wrong.
 |First thing's first. No one sets out to make a bad movie. When people back a project and put millions of dollars into production, they do this because they are confident that it's going to be a good movie.
 |Through production a number of things can go wrong, a director who had a great vision may turn out to be terrible working with a particular crew. The studio may decide to make revisions into the story to save costs but ultimately cut out what made it good in the first place.
 |An actor chosen because they are a box office draw may turn out to be the wrong person for the role.
 |So many things can go wrong, but there's one thing I guarantee you - the time and effort spent by the crew to make Schindler's List is the exact same that a crew would put in to Prince of Persia. It's just a question of how audiences are going to respond to it.
[Well, what I consider bad movies are those that go straight to DVD. For some reason the producers sometimes decide not to release a movie in theaters, even if it is watchable, and release it right on DVD only. Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pjqu?context=5)|I would not be so quick to assume something going straight to DVD/netflix is a bad movie.
 |The industry is changing very quickly. The amount of money it costs to put a film into theaters is tremendous - particularly if you are an indie film. Imagine each theater requires a physical copy of the movie. And imagine that every market you are in requires advertising and marketing. Then you have to do it all over again when you release it on DVD months later - its expensive and only makes sense if you are big studio and have money to burn.
 |For indie films - releasing something straight to dvd/VOD. Means it's cheaper to release and that they only have to do 1 single marketing campaign instead of 2.
 |Sure there are plenty of terrible movies that are made specifically for DVD, but they're trying to hit a particular audience either those that seek out bad ""B movies"" or those knockoffs that look like a popular studio release and they get tricked into buying that one instead.

[Does your career affect your family life?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4piwp?context=5)|Yeah. It's actually kind of a sad fact, those that do production rarely are able to sustain marriages or family life. I'm not talking about actors or famous directors. I'm talking about the people below who do all the work. On one hand its making movies and you get to travel and experience such amazing things. But it means you're not in control of your schedule. You're also getting paid per project so you really can't say no to a job. It puts a tremendous strain on a relationship - I don't get how some people are able to do it. Personally - it's prevented me from ever being in one place for over a year and as a result I've lost some really great people in pursuit of this dream.
[Do you feel it was worth it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ppju?context=5)|I'm still hopeful I'll find a balance - find someone who understands the demands.
 |But if I had to chose... well relationships are fleeting and movies live forever.
[Can you tell if the video piracy on interenet is really damaging the market now? I remeber in the old days, when there were Music tape cassettes, and VHS videotapes, everybody were copying music and movies then, but the market seemed stable at that time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pxud?context=5)|I really can't say - studios/distributors are incredibly protective of numbers for DVD/online sales. So it's hard to say how it's being affected.
 |I assume it is - but I don't know to what extent. Nor do I know what the relationship is to seeing something in poor quality, making me want to seek it out in high quality.
 |All I can tell you is that it's never a good feeling when someone tells you they downloaded your movie - yeah it's great they saw it, but you know if everyone did that - you'd be out of business.
[For a very long time, all I've wanted to do is to become a composer for film. What advice do you have for someone who wants to join the film industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4r086?context=5)|As a composer? We'll always need music - trust me. Your future career is secured - the question is, will you be doing it with a live orchestra or with digital files. I'm inclined to thing the ladder - it's cheaper.
 |There's no direct path for a composer, but I would definitely try to seek out composers you admire. There's always an assistant to a composer who will secretly compose sections of a film's score an eventually work their way up until they have a relationship with a director (or producer) and get hired on all of their projects.
 |But you definitely need to be the best - in order to do that you need to practice, and I assume go to a university. I'd suggest aiming for a program in either LA or NY if you can.
[I'm really been interested in the behind-the-scenes part of the production of a film. What are some day to day responsibilities of a producer during production? What are needed qualifications to get into the production sphere of film? Also, do you know much about the people in charge of film distribution? I'm really interested on how the film gets from the film company to the screen in theaters. Should I look to getting some experience interning? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rtlm?context=5)|Lotta questions - okay let's see.
 |First thing you need to know is that there are a couple categories of producer. There's a creative producer who helps develop a project (tweaking the story, getting a writer/director/actor attached and ultimately getting it sold.) They oversee the macro problems with the movie.
 |There's also a line producer who deals more in the nitty-gritty of hiring crew and locking down insurance and locations. They're more involved in the micro day-to-day issues of the crew.
 |There's also Exec producers who may only be involved by name or who may be more involved in a creative sense.
 |Personally I'm in the creative department, so my job is mostly about what happens before we start shooting. Once we're in production my day-to-day is mostly just to make sure everything is moving along and that everyone is happy. If a problem comes up it's my job to resolve it as quickly and cheaply as possible.
 |There are no qualifications for this job except prior experience, you get that experience by working under a more experienced producer. And you get that job by being their assistant and you get THAT job by starting as a PA or intern. So yes - take an internship working for a producer if you can.
 |Film distribution is another category altogether - there's the studio side of distribution, where they are just another arm of the studio, they're told what project are coming down the pipeline and they need to manage how it'll get sold and to what markets and when (what is the other compeition for this kind of film in a particular time of year.
 |There's also indie distribution, where you'll seek films out at a festival and if you think you can make money on it - then you'll approach the producers and offer to distribute for them. Because indie is much smaller scale - you attack each project as it comes up and more often then not - your main concern doesn't involve the big studio releases. Your concern is award season and how you can leverage a release date to help your ticket sales to coincide with the oscars.
 |Whew...lotta info - let me know if I missed anything.
[Thanks for replying! I think you answered all of them! Just one more question-sorry- I am going to college next Fall, Should I look have a Business and Entertainment major or take classes in that area?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sys3?context=5)|Business - I think it has more applications should you decide entertainment isn't for you.
[Do you work for a company and get regular paychecks or are you a contractor/paid by the job? If you get paid by the job how do you survive in between?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4pn4b?context=5)|Per job. I've been fortunate to have a pretty good run these last couple years - I've been working with one director in particular who has had no trouble getting projects financed.
 |For medical - I'm not part of a union, but I get health insurance through a film fund that supports a lot of non-union production people.
 |Otherwise I just try to save up and hope I don't get in a position where I have to go into debt, hopefully the next project will just be around the corner.
 |The real threat is when I'll have to strike out on my own.
[I've always dreamed of being a screenwriter but I'm up in NYC and I'm only 15. What would be the best thing I could do to increase my odds of making it one day? Should I just start writing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4nt2a?context=5)|Of all places to be NYC ain't a bad choice. There are plenty of film studios in New York and New Jersey where plenty of tv shows and indie movies shoot. New York rescinded it's tax incentive last year, but NYC still provides one so I imagine production will continue to stay out there.  WRITE! WRITE! WRITE! At 15 you've got a lot of free time and not a lot of places to spend it - writing is a great way to practice because you'll learn from mistakes about what not to do. And if by the time you're going to college and you want to pursue screenwriting still - then apply to film school - NYU, USC, UCLA. You'll get the chance to work with screenwriters who can help you with your craft and if you're good enough, hopefully send along to their contacts.
[Thanks man, it's really awesome your even talking to me, let alone giving me advice.  Last question, is it really risky trying to get in? What position might i start at?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4w1j5?context=5)|Super risky. Intern/PA?
[Are screenplay contests worth it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qhpy?context=5)|NO! With the exceptions of the [Nicholl Fellowship](http://www.oscars.org/awards/nicholl/).
 |Any program that expects money from you is not going to help you out. Your best bet is to keep plugging away. It's definitely hard to break in, but I really do believe if your material is good enough, it'll find it's way into the right hands. Cold calling submissions sucks and I don't really recommend it either, but outside of trying to produce your own scripts, I would recommend any other option besides contests.
[What about the Black List?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4uucs?context=5)|Eh jury is still out on the competition. Franklin's annual list of unproduced scripts is awesome if you can get on it. But it's not connected to the screenplay contest side. 
[Is the media portrayal - casting couches, producer scams etc. for Hollywood strugglers as real as they make it out to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4p6vr?context=5)|Not at all. First off - the casting couch. I have worked on 20 projects that had casting, I also (once upon a time) interned at a casting company. The VAST majority of casting directors are older women and gay men. So the perception that casting directors take advantage of eager young actresses seems ridiculous to me.
 |That being said, I had worked at a talent agency that had some older agents - those who rose to prominence in the 60s-70s and for them, it would not surprise me to hear that they had done that in their day. Now everything is pretty corporate and sanitized. Someone would have to really be an idiot to try and pull that now - the repercussions for a serious casting director would be endless.
[I've been working turning my blog into an ebook &amp; debut novel. I would like develop the book into a tv series. What's the process like for books like Orange is the new black or a series like the Office to come to development?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rco4?context=5)|I don't know the background behind Orange is the New Black exactly. I know Jenji Kohan had done Weeds based on her personal experiences. And I know Orange is the New Black came after, I had heard her Moth story which I believe was the origin of the book.
 |The Office was a remake of the UK one, which I believe was an original idea kind of based on a radio character Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant created - so I think that's a different route entirely.
 |But the idea is that if you have a novel, the hope would be you also have literary representation too? If not you should seek it out, I think it might not be the worst idea to create an outline explaining how your novel would translate well to television, and assuming you had the gumption to also write a pilot and series bible. Because at the end of the day you're the one who is going to have to go banging down doors to sell the idea, unless your novel/blog is popular enough that it's being sought out from you directly. I hope that makes sense.
[Thank you for the insight! And doing this AMA!! All the best on your current &amp; future projects!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4soch?context=5)|You too.
[Can you explain why suddenly Hollywood started producing a lot of remakes of relatively recent movies? Everybody I know says it is a little bit odd, because useless. Don't they have enough good screenwriters anymore to write something new?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4po1i?context=5)|I disagree a little bit with your premise. Hollywood has been doing remakes, sequels and adaptations for quite some time.
 |Fall of a Nation (1916) was a Sequel to Birth of a Nation (1915).
 |What I will give you is the trend these last 10 years or so is that something original has less financial security then something being remade - something that already has a built-in audience.
 |It's a flawed kind of logic, but it's hard to argue - Harry Potter had been a very succesful book series before they adapted it to film. But that sort of became the ideal financial model - so now studios look for succesful Young Adult novels to turn into films.
 |Same with sequels - Transformers 2 made way more than Transformers. People seek out what they already know.
 |This will keep happening until people stop going to see them. But I doubt that'll change. So we'll keep descending away from originality.
[Do you agree with the ""hollywood is a bloodsucking leech on all that is creative and original"" - discourse, a stance taken by such people as Steven Soderbergh, Nicolas Refn and Mike Stoklasa?  Do you agree that the quality of large Hollywood films (in terms of artistic vision, originality (again\) and so forth\) is worsening, as the same quality on TV is improving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sm4g?context=5)|Hmm - I think I have a more nuanced opinion on Hollywood. It's not a bloodsucking leech, I'd put it more to an untamed horse. You can either fight it and risk getting trampled by it. Or you can tame it and make it work for you.  But both TV and film mean you have a boss controlling your budget, so unless you're an incredibly successful indie director it's always going to be the case of trying to protect your art against someone who is trying to make money with it. Sometimes you see eye to eye, sometimes you don't.
[Is there a way for someone with little experience, other than some college, be able to get into the business? I went to a small school and had to drop out when my mom passed. But I just wanted to know if there was anything I could do to save my dream? I have relatively no money to go back to school right now. What small steps could I take to get my foot in the door?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4xb7s?context=5)|Sepooh - I'm sorry about your mother. I'd only suggest to see locally what access you have to try and make some inroads, maybe a local tv station or community theater. Just to try and see if anything gives you an opportunity. Barring that I might try to save up and see if you can move to LA and take classes as a community college like Santa Monica CC.
[What have you made in Hollywood? Anything I can view online?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ns8y?context=5)|Sorry to have be vague here - I've made it a point to keep my identity private. But I'll say this, the vast majority of what I've worked on - I've only had a very small roll in. I made an independent movie a couple years ago that I was very involved in - and that movie played in theaters and is now available on iTunes.
 |Sorry I can't be more specific.
[I've written YOUR next movie! When will you be ready to produce this masterpiece?! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sodd?context=5)|As soon as I see your last movie and quickly call your reps to ask how I can get involved in YOUR next project.
 |You gotta earn my interest first. 
[Awe crap. Hope I'm not too late for the party. Here I go.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4ywko?context=5)|Not too late. Here's the truth about directors - it's your job to always be in charge, to always be 100% sure of your decisions and your choices. Secretly to yourself, you know that none of it is true and you're bullshitting - but what makes a great director is convincing people to trust you and you do that by giving off nothing but confidence.
[I've always enjoyed acting. But never had the means to drop what I was doing and head to one if the big acting markets (well...I had the means but I'm always the analytical investor\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4qfr7?context=5)|Sadly, career calculation and acting are opposing forces. If you want to be a successful actor - you have to throw yourself out there and be willing to not see success for many years.
[Any advice for a 33 yo IT guy who is dropping everything to pursue writing/directing/cinematography?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rp3i?context=5)|I would urge the PA gig, because it'll show you how the job works. If you don't have much of an education in writing/directing/cinematography then once you've been a PA and have a sense for how things run then you can look into school and programs and see if those will be beneficial to you.
[I'm not sure if I should still go the college route for the connections/friendships or just work (I already have offers to PA w/ a producer friend on a TV reality show and I have another friend doing low budget features\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4rp3i?context=5)|Take the PA gig - 100%. Take the feature one first, if it's not an option then the reality TV one. It sounds like you're passionate about pursuing this, though I don't know your background.
[If I had a ""killer"" idea for a sequel or reboot of an existing series/franchise, is it worth trying to flesh out and write or are the rights to original work usually too much of a hurdle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4vs4f?context=5)|Honestly - I'd write it. If you feel really passionately you should write it. Then you should write something original - hopefully when your original script sells you'd be able to arrange a conversation/meeting with the rights holders of the existing series/franchise and pitch them your idea.
[What are your thoughts on contacting industry people directly with ideas? Do you have any advice (e.g. ""when sending ideas to Wes Anderson, throw a mothball in the envelope because he just looks like someone who would appreciate that""\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4vs4f?context=5)|Pretty much everyone has a non-solicitation policy. It covers their ass in case they make something similar to something someone sent and it also saves them from having to sift through the endless terrible stuff people usually send. If you establish yourself as a good writer - then they'll want to meet you or read your material.
[Thanks, I've been an IT tech for a long time, was thinking of getting training as a DIT (maybe RED certified?\) but not sure where to start or if a DIT is a good springboard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t5xkx/thinking_about_a_career_in_hollywood_iama_10_year/ce4sunv?context=5)|DIT is not a bad route, its a very niche thing - but every project needs one. That career leads towards being a full time colorist, who are sought after and make something like 6-7 figures. But its a very limited career, it doesn't really provide you the opportunity to see other aspects of the industry - and it'll put you back behind a computer. And I imagine if you're doing IT you want to get on the ground. So again - I highly recommend getting your feet wet with the PA job.

We're hiring a Lead Product Designer to own the design and branding of our web application and our marketing materials.

At Coefficient, we're changing the way that brands interact with and understand their consumers. As an integral part of our team, you will design and create the look-and-feel of our research and analytics web application and our marketing materials, from our website to specific customer presentations.

Our salary is competitive and stock options are available and will vary depending on your skills and experience. But most important, working with us you'll have the opportunity to be part of a fast growing start-up that will provide new experiences and expand your skill-set.


**Requirements:**

* Web application design experience.
* You have a love for designing beautiful products. You're not looking for a job, but an opportunity to showcase your immense talent in a product that will be used by Fortune 500 companies.
* You will push the boundaries of our products creatively but understand how to balance this with usability.
* Professional work experience, either through a full-time job, internship or personal projects. We love taking risks on emerging talent, whether you have 15 years of experience or have only worked on personal or side projects -- if you're a great designer, let's talk.
* Must hate busy work and Internet Explorer.
* Refuse to call yourself a ninja or rockstar even though you're very talented.
* You're a leader, but not a manager. Expect to spend most of your time for the first six months getting shit done. 
* You must be self-motivated and expect insanely good work from yourself and from those you work with.
* You're equally obsessive about User Interfaces and User Experience. 
* You're looking ahead. Product design doesn't just incorporate our needs today, but it looks ahead to how the product's features and needs may change over the next six months and how can we best prepare for that today.
* Desire to own our brand. While product design will be your number one priority, we need someone who wants to own our brand in all public-facing materials. From overseeing the design of our website (we are excited to update this to be more inline with our brand and product design quality) to customer presentations. 
* You must seek feedback and desire constructive criticism. Yet, you're willing to take a stand on design principles you believe must be kept. You can do all of this respectfully.
* Familiarity with responsive web design techniques.

At Coefficient, we are motivated to provide ongoing, up-to-date consumer information that can quickly answer questions in a simple, concise manner. 

We believe that you, the customer, should be at the center of every decision that a company makes. We're excited and motivated to give companies the tools to truly do this.

We're located in downtown Orlando, sharing co-working space at Envy Labs and CodeSchool. We're a small, tight-knit team with supportive investors and we're looking to hire an exceptional Product Designer to help build our products, Company, and team.

Coefficient founders are former Grooveshark colleagues who held core leadership roles in revenue and software engineering at the online music-streaming company. Coefficient's founding team has a track record of success in growing teams, products, and revenue.

Coefficient is an early-stage Company, which means you'll be given a lot of responsibility and a lot of opportunity for growth. To this end, we need people who expect insanely good work from themselves and are motivated by responsibility and professional freedom.

For example, I had a 93% in 4 papers in a college writing class but ended up getting a C+ because I was barely there. And then there are finals which for example, are 20% of my grade and end up lowering my average score because I just seem to have a mental block when it comes to tests.

As a result, I was on scholarship probation as well as academic probation. This semester I buckled up, went to as many classes as possible, but could still only end up with a potential 2.5 GPA which would get me out of academic probation but not scholarship probation.

I'm not dumb. I know I'm not because when it comes to my major, I'm pretty good. I have a great background in it especially with the experience I have in jobs and internships. I currently have many paid jobs which are related to my major. I always do well when it comes to research papers, projects and essays. But I just can't seem to get an A. I'm beginning to ponder if college really is for me? I was confident of a 3.0 this semester but my expectations seem higher than they actually should be. I'm struggling to find motivation. I will obviously keep trying harder and harder but if I get another below 3.0 GPA next semester, I don't know what I'd do.

Oh and my parents don't know that I probably won't have scholarship money next semester and I'm scared to tell them.

Any feedback would be appreciated."

I did an internship for a couple of months a few years ago, and they really liked me. Now, two years later, after doing my MA and not having had any practical on-the-job experience in all this time, I started realizing how difficult it's going to be to find something decent.

I went back to the place I interned, mostly to just catch up with the people there because it was such a great experience, but I also wanted to probe the waters for anything they might have open. Within 10 minutes of casually speaking to my former supervisor / mentor and catching up, she decided to offer me a temp position with the possibility of becoming permanent in a few months. Didn't even have to do any kind of formal interview where I'd be nervous as hell and probably ruin my chances.

What I realized from this experience is that even though they could haven used someone, they didn't have any listings / open positions posted anywhere. There's a lot of advice on this subreddit about utilizing your network to push your CV to the top of the stack, but **I guess what I wanted to point out here is that even if positions are not explicitly listed, it's still worth a shot to probe companies that you might already have an in with. At worst, they'll say no. At best, you'll be the only candidate for the position.**

Good luck to all, and thank you once again.

1t4oo2,1,2013-12-17,Tips for a UK student hoping to apply for an Internship in America?,internet_ham,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/1t4oo2/tips_for_a_uk_student_hoping_to_apply_for_an/,"Dear all,

I'm hoping to apply for internships in America for this summer but the idea is quite daunting. I want to go for the mechatronics/robotics/automation sector, which is quite small in the UK.

Some questions:

1) **Where should I be aiming?**

I'm studying at Cambridge which is arguably the best University in the UK and the best course for Engineering. I am a Second Year, and the course is general, so I'm learning everything from Material Science to Digital Electroncs. A downside of this is that the course is very work intensive, so I haven't had an awful lot of time for student led projects, but I've joined one this year and done a fair amount with Arduino in my spare time. I got 71% in my first year exams (average is 65%) and have won Department prizes in Computing and Robotics. (Sorry if this is braggy, I just want to show you what I'm going to sell to them...)

What size of company should I contact? What kind of position? Are there cities where I would struggle finding a place due to popularity? (I'm thinking maybe Boston, SF)

2)**When should I apply?**
I want to be applying now, but I'm worried I'll be lost in the Christmas Break Rush and/or New Year Rush. Is there an 'optimum time'?

3) **How should I apply?**
Given my position, should I go through the careers page, email directly or get in contact via UK offices?

4) **What should be in my application?**
How would a US job application differ from a UK one? The answer is probably not at all but I thought I'd ask. 

Hope you guys can help!"

i started my university journey not knowing what to major in, after consideration i chose Computer science despite my brother (who finished CS many years ago) advising against it, i was enjoying the study the first year but not so much the second one when the theoretical study and huge projects started rolling in, i struggled that year although i achieved a pretty good GPA. that summer i did an internship and hated every bit of it, after that internship i started seeing my brother view point and started questioning my decision, I'm  not a good programmer and struggle in class projects so this hit the nail on the head and made me want to switch to a major that i was thinking off at the beginning and starting again in a 4 year engineering major ( Industrial Engineering). now, i want nothing more than switching but I'm afraid that its just a whim(which i think is not because i actually started hating programming and also i'm not good enough to make it professionally ) and that i will regret it later on, thoughts redditors?

i really don't know what to do I'm just confused.

My site just completed a major datacenter, network closet, and wiring upgrade performed by a professional team of wiring experts for ~75 percent of the campus (very large building with thousands of endpoints).  The main issues is that the company telecom/wiring tech is not a part of IT in any way and does his own thing without considering the impact (or insanity) of his decisions. 

* He has inexperienced interns make cables by hand, these patch cables often fail
* He regularly would splice existing cables, use couplers, and deploy junk consumer switches rather than pull proper cables
* He generally does not even pull cable but outsources it to a one-man business who also does shoddy work and who charges almost as much as trusted local company that would give us certified/warrantied solution 
* He moves or plug in new patch cables my teams switch ports without communicating the changes causing helpdesk calls and general chaos
* He insists on his own odd labeling systems and has modified the factory patch panels with his own scheme.  Cables previously were labeled with the switch blad and switch port rather than the patch panel number.
* Cat5 patch panel repurposed although all new wiring is Cat5e
*We have new closets that are messy because we were forced to use home-made 10-12 foot patch cables.  The intent was to have all new factory patches but as this for some reason fell on Mr telecom he never bothered to get the lengths and counts together 

We now shut all switch ports that are not in use to encourage that he include us in the process,requested changes and or placed our labeling scheme next to his, began documenting all the mistakes and impact on users.  If you have any insight or comments I would greatly appreciate some expertise.

I came in and shot for 5 straight days, in which I got the flu on the FIRST DAY of shooting!!! Great timing. We filmed in SanFran and I had to demonstrate an insane amount of guitar lessons. I would sit there and play these licks or techniques and sometimes have to exaggerate the way I played them for camera. It would feel so awkward to do it that way, but it was the way to make it look correct and clear for the viewer so it was worth it. They had me do all sorts of stuff like finger tapping, sliding, palm-muting, etc. Was very interesting and fun. Hard work though. The guys at ubisoft are INCREDIBLE and amazing dudes.

I remember auditioning for this really dark, rock band called ""Ours"" and I walked in not really knowing the deal. I knew immediately, it didn't matter my attitude or my playing that I wasn;t getting that gig, nor did I want it haha. As far as SNL, specific things that were important for this was knowing how to read music (although I wasn't very good at it), have a reasonable knowledge of a wide variety of music (SNL covers ALL styles), and just be a good player. If I were you and going into an audition my advice would be whenever possible, be as prepared as possible. Wether that means bringing the right guitar for the gig, dressing the part, or trying to meet some of the guys prior to the audition through a friend so they recognize you when you come in, little things like that. Have the music part so down that it requires no thought. Be early. And play like your life depends on it. It might. ;)
[Duuude.  You just had to play along with a track?  That sounds kind of brutal.  Were there a ton of people there to audition?  I bet that was terrifying.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5cali?context=5)|Just track, no stopping. Just me and Lenny. TOUGH one. And the callback audition I had to play live with the entire rhythm section and we did like 6 tunes back to back. I think I had 1 minute to look over each new song. Yikes. 
[Props to you on nailing such a tough audition!  Good luck on the rest of your career.  I really appreciate you taking time to answer my questions.  You the man!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5ce5n?context=5)|My pleasure! Good luck to you as well. Please stay posted to all this damn social media world! I'll be putting out some music over the next year that is some next level shit!
[Have you ever had a ""holy shit. I'm playing with this guy"" moment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59jdz?context=5)|Being a fan of music, any time that I get to play with someone I've listened to, looked up to, etc is always a thrill. I've had a few SUPER crazy moments like playing back to back with Sting, or me and Elton John rocking out together at the front of the Carnegie Hall stage. One of my favorites was playing with Mick Jagger at the SNL season finale last year. THAT WAS NUTS!
[Would you rather burp confetti or fart glitter for the rest of your life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59g8q?context=5)|Burping confetti sounds like fun for everyone.
[Since getting picked up by SNL, who were some of the best/worst hosts in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59m24?context=5)|BEST: Will Farell, Jimmy Fallon, Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey.
 |Worst: hard to say or remember the bad ones. 
[Do you ever do any subliminal messages that only you and your friends recognize when the host is doing their monologue?  EDIT: When Jimmy Fallon says ""We're gonna have a great show tonight, Justin Timberlake is here!"" you should definitely scratch your chin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5arh5?context=5)|Hahahaha. I have! rarely though. remind me on twitter the night of!
[Who or what's your inspiration? What made you decide to go for a music career? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59sxd?context=5)|I have so many. I grew up idolizing rock bands, and then guitar gods, then pop bands, then producers, then just people for different reasons. My influences and inspiration continually grow to be honest. That's what keeps me pushing forward to create and look to the future. Never looking back. As far as going for a music career, it wasn't a choice. I just loved playing music as a kid and it ended up taking over my life. When I was in High School was when I was able to pinpoint and say, ""this is what I want to do with the rest of my life"". In fact, it happened during an Allman Brothers Band concert haha. But I knew. And thankfully, it worked out bc I have no idea what else I would do with my life! Maybe go into the food business. Who knows.
[That's awesome. Hmm food business. Ramen perhaps? haha! yum...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a1rx?context=5)|Yeah, maybe some sort of travel/food show or writing. I really respect and love the food world so prob. 
[Is playing on a TV band something you always thought about doing? Or is it something that you fell into? Does it leave time/space for you to accomplish your own music goals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59fol?context=5)|Great question. I would come to SNL during the last guitarist's (Dr. Luke) 10 years on the show every once and a while. And I always thought to myself, ""I would totally rock this!"" haha. So, it's kind of funny that I got the job. I think I might have manifested it or something by always thinking I could get it. Who knows. I was pursuing bands at the time, but I was getting very disillusioned/disheartened from being in a band. The struggle and up and downs were too much. It was nice to get something consistent. One of the best things about this job is that I have a lot of free time during the week to work on all the other music I do, like producing pop music, producing/writing my new instrumental EPs. Those last two things are honestly my biggest focus outside of SNL. 
[How did you get your job on SNL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59fe9?context=5)|There's a lot of different interviews I have done on this that goes into detail if you want to check them out. But basically, was recommended, then auditioned like everyone else had done. Got a call back for a smaller group of people to audition again, and then got the call that it was me. That was a good phone call ;) 
[What's your favorite pedal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59l8c?context=5)|If I had one pedal to take with me to a desert island it would be my old Memory Man. I'm also loving my new Strymon Big Skies!
[Are you ever intimidated by having to fill G E Smith's shoes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59ehr?context=5)|No. Never once entered my mind. The last guitarist, Dr. Luke was there for 10 years so G.E. Smith was a long time ago for me. Was just happy to get the job and get to rock out ya know? 
[Any SNL disaster stories you can share?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59xf5?context=5)|Not really any train wrecks. The worst stuff is typically when the band has to play during a sketch. Sometimes, the writers/Lorne cuts and edits the sketch and ton. Our musical directors are giving us new comments/edits during the prior sketch and we are marking up our music and then we have to play the sketch, essentially completely changed and unrehearsed. It's scary but thrilling at the same time. Even if we mess up, it always is relatively ok though. 
[So jealous of your collection. What year is your vintage LP? Does it have P90's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5boqt?context=5)|I had 2 guitars up untill SNL started!!! Isn't that nuts. 2 strats. Have been slowly geting some good stuff over the years. 
[What's your favorite Led Zeppelin album?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59f99?context=5)|I used to have the 4 ""TAPE"" box set haha. So I knew all the songs but not which album they were from. But prob whatever has ""Good Times, Bad Times""!
[That'd be their first, Led Zeppelin I, FYI.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a614?context=5)|They had it right the first time I guess!
[Any great Tina Fey stories?  Also, how much of a boss is Lenny Pickett?!  Edit: nevermind my user name, you're an absolutely phenomenal guitarist! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5bpsq?context=5)|Nothing in particular about Tina. She seems like the coolest lady. When she's on set she's hanging with her kid and doing her comedy stuff as well. You can tell she is a great mom. Lenny Pickett is the man!!! Waht a fucking legend! What a honor to play music with that guy. Always inspiring. 
[You wouldn't need an intern for the summer in NYC, would you? :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a44t?context=5)|I don't think I would, but if you are in NYC or LA I may know someone who does.
[Thanks so much!! Would you mind messaging me info about that? Thanks so so so much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a6g7?context=5)|Just hit me on facebook and send me info on who you are, what you do, and why you want to intern. thx!
[I recently added you on facebook and I was surprised you accepted me. Are you busy all the time? It would be great If we get to talk! Also, do you think there will be any openings for the snl band? That's my dream job man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5acyd?context=5)|Hey dude. Yeah, I accept everyone untill they cut it off, which hasn't happened yet! I try to have my facebook open to whoever wants to check out what I am doing and whatnot. Glad that you stopped by. No openings for a looong time I imagine haha. It's one of those ""lifer"" type gigs. 
[Awesome thank you so much for the honest answer! I'm applying there as we for guitar this yr ( senior\) and I like I jazz but I LOVE rock haha - thanks man and would it be cool if I could send you some videos via Facebook of my guitar playing? Jazz and Rock? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5avgj?context=5)|Yeah man. Send over 1 or 2 and i'll take a look. Stay in School! haha. I will say, NYC is not what it used to be and there's not all that much opportunity to do sessions and stuff here. I would heavily look into LA as well. ALthough, the schools in NYC are pretty fantastic.
[Will there ever be a Velvet Frogg reunion show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5aiyf?context=5)|WOW. Bringing it back old school! Nah, probably not. I love the guys and what we created when we were younger, but it's a different lifetime. We are all mostly in touch though. Actually, I talk to 2 of the other guys all the time and are some of my best friends. They're like family.
[Pretty crazy that all those people from where you grew up became pretty famous musicians. What's your oldest memory of playing in front of a crowd? What did you play and what 3 artist are you always excited to see play on SNL?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5as20?context=5)|Yah, it's rad. We all pushed each other back in the beginning so maybe that had something to do with it. Who knows. Maybe luck. Maybe random. Oldest memory was playing the drum set to wipeout when I was in 5th grade at the band.orchestra concert!! I remember where I was, the angle I was facing on stage, color of the drums, all of it. Or possibly before that, the first time I sat on stage in 5th grade playing guitar while everyone sang along. I had my white Ibanez Ex series guitar and I knew Wild Thing, and a few other simple sing a longs. The entire lunch room was singing along. That was a great memory ;). As far as artists I am always excited to see play on SNL? Def anyone who I grew up listening to. I'd say I was most excited about Paul McCartney (continuously), Radiohead (in my college years I got to see them play SNL before I joined up), and a tie for Tom Petty/Mick Jagger!
[Just want to say you are one of the reasons I watch SNL. Always a joy to see you on screen.  My question is: any guest host that has ever jammed with the SNL band?  ( as in picking up the instruments and played with you guys\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5a9p1?context=5)|We usually play with the host during monologue if it's a song. I'd say the biggest example of what you are asking is when we did a song with Mick Jagger and Jeff Beck for the finale last season (or 2?). that was freakin' crazy.
[If you were forced to play one and only one model of electric guitar for the rest for your life, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59rvt?context=5)|Strat. No question!
[Is Lenny Pickett a cool guy? I feel like he would be a cool guy. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce59y4z?context=5)|Lenny is a very amazing person. He's got so much knowledge on EVERYTHING. Super intelligent and incredibly talented. He's a lot of fun. Rad dude for sure.

 |Nice! thx! I'm doing a bit of livetweeting during the shows now so stop in next time!

The weirdest thing is most actors or comedy people actually have decent voices. So freakin' weird! But, Jamie Foxx hands down is the best!
[Are you doing anything else musically outside of SNL? I loved the short lived Royals band.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5alqo?context=5)|YES!! thank you for asking. I am working on an instrumental project of my own. Writing and recording 2 eps currently for it to be released at the same time! Please stay posted to my social media outlets bc I'll start uploading little gtr clips and vines from the studio, etc! I appreciate the kind words about the Royals. Love those dudes and we had great times. Was a big learning experience for me and certainly changed my life, even though it wasn't successful. 
[In fact, The Coast EP will always remain in regular rotation.  So tastefully accomplished.  It's perfect in so many ways without losing its raw, organic tone.  Lyrics, musicianship, mixing, songwriting, etc., etc.  Any chance of ever doing a reunion with at least Kevin and Phil?  Those guys are beasts!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5b2bv?context=5)|Wow! that's really cool. Thank you again. I did that Ep with my buddy Claudius Mittendorfer. I played all the insts on the entire thing. maybe we'll do a reunion one day for shits! but we are scattered throughout the US (LA, NYC ad upstate NY). Did you ever check out ""bedroom eyes"" or ""Don't Get attached to the world?"" Those were some of my faves! We recorded 3 new songs towards the end of all that, but never released them.
[Yeah, I've got both tracks.  They were great too!  I think Coast just spoke to me, you know.  I had just moved to NYC to assist at Right Track (R.I.P.\) and was excited to get into the music scene there.  Then, I almost immediately found you and the band and remained my favorite.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1t7ywn/jared_blake_scharff_snl_ask_me_anything/ce5bnuz?context=5)|Very cool! yeah, it was def a moment in time for sure!

I started out at the Hart School of Music for 1 year (Jazz performance), then transferred to NYU. Took one semester of Jazz perf, then switched to music ed. I never wanted to be a jazz guy. I consider myself to not be a jazzer. I can play through some changes, and some lines but at the basic level. Never was something I focused on. NYU for me, was more about being in bands and in NYC, not about school. BUT, I will say I was lucky to have an amazing teacher for my private lessons and he was my favorite part of school for me. I didn't need to do all those harmony classes and all that stuff. In retrospect, I guess it was useful, but nobody typically has anyone read real music anymore so you can learn all of it outside of school also. I guess it was helpful to have structure. But honestly, it was the guitar teachers at the time that helped me the most (Bruce Arnold and Pat Cerello). Pat was my private teacher. He sadly passed away a few years ago. I'm not sure who is still there teaching for the gtr stuff. I was def nervous for the audition but more bc I wasn't a great sight reader and I had to read the charts. I blew the first tune completely, bc it was in 6/8 and B maj. Oops. But I made it through i guess ;)

Previous version: https://www.dropbox.com/s/97cxnaqsa55v22u/Jay%20Huang%20-%20Resume%20-%20old.pdf

New version: https://www.dropbox.com/s/sw8ljo4e086ygjs/Jay%20Huang%20-%20Resume%20-%20newest.pdf (Modelled after Gayle Laakmann McDowell's resume on Careercup)

Having touched a computer for the first time 6 years ago, I'm very conscious about being behind my peers, and feel that I'm probably unable to compete with many individuals far more talented than I.

Do I even stand any chance in getting a job at the Big 4?

Also, a few questions:

- Does 4 links seem a bit too much (email, website, github, linkedin)?

- I was only at my last position 3 months because it simply didn't work out. Does my presentation bring up any questions/should it look different?

- Does ""Language skills"" seem a weird label since I'm a developer? Would there be a more appropriate name?

- Listing SAP internship as 2 listings in my new one -- does making this re-hire apparent make me look more employable (ie: SAP decided to hire me again)? Or would 1 listing like in the original be more succinct?

I had more questions but I can't quite remember them right now...

Any help/suggestions are welcome and greatly appreciated!"

*I'm not entirely sure what makes an applicant attractive to grad schools - what makes an applicant more desirable than another? 

*I'm also getting mixed messages from my school's advising department regarding when to apply. I've heard everything from ""You should have applied last year (junior year)"" to ""You should apply only after you graduate, secure a full-time job somewhere, and stockpile enough money to pay for school."" When exactly do you apply?
*What does financial aid look like for graduate school? I've heard horror stories about people graduating with absurd amounts of debt - my family is not ridiculously loaded, and my undergraduate degree was more or less funded with academic scholarships and grants.

*My goal is to eventually do research in artificial intelligence. For now, I would be pursuing a Master's degree in CompSci. However, the schools with the best CompSci programs (MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, etc.) are extremely selective and expensive - taking both economic background and where I'm getting my undergraduate degree from, I doubt that they'll give my application a second glance. How much weight does the school stamped onto your degree actually carry?

*Is it viable to work a full-time job and be a full-time grad student?

*Are professional recommendations acceptable as supplements to recommendations from professsors? I feel that my employer would be able to write me a strong recommendation - would that carry any weight at all (as opposed to a recommendation from a professor)?

**Background Information:**

*Major: Computer Science

*Concentration: Software Engineering

*GPA: 3.65

*Job Experience: I have 6 years of job experience and will soon be adding a CompSci related internship to my resume.

I'm planning on going over all the necessary interview prep over the next month, as well as doing a large scale senior project my last semester, which will hopefully be roughly equivalent to an internship, as the project works closely with industry leaders. I have two other side projects as well.

I'm not so much concerned about getting a job, but more when I will get a job. Only a few friends of mine have offers at this point, but from what I've read here, hiring for new grads is wrapping up.

I have another 4 month internship coming up in the summer and I am terrified. I feel like my current job hasn't given me the programming experience that I'll need to look desirable to a company that's looking for a development position and I don't want to do support again. The problem is, the above is all in my head, deep down I know that. Deep down, I know that I'm good enough to get a dev job, but I just can't shake this impostor syndrome feeling. 

I don't know why but I look at my classmates, my SO (who is in the same program and year as me) and just focus on how I'm worse than them. I can't give myself any credit for my achievements and translate that into confidence that I'll get hired to do actual programming. I experienced this same feeling last time the application period rolled around and I'm sick of it. So I wanna know how do you guys deal with impostor syndrome?

I recently caught a lucky break and found myself with a well-paying internship in I.T. (which is what I actually want to do with my life). I went to Walmart to tell them I quit and before I could actually say the words, they just assumed I was putting in a two weeks notice. I found myself writing down an official statement saying I wouldn't quit until New Year's and signing it. I don't plan on working my remaining shifts and I'm completely fine with letting them fire me. The references and experience I can put on my resume at my new job should serve me very well in obtaining full-time employment when I'm done with college.
That being said, do any of you think that if I'm looking for I.T.-related employment about a year from now, that perspective employers would care if they found out that I walked out on Walmart (or that they would even bother calling to find out)? I've never done anything like this before, and I feel guilty, but I also can't handle the workload of both of these jobs. What do you guys think?"

Here's the problem.

The main reason I wanted to come back next year was to see if things would work out with my girlfriend or not (that way we could leave the same year and move to the bay or seattle together). Now that we've broken up I feel like I want to work in the industry for a few years before I decide whether to do a Masters.

However, I'm worried that if I quit the masters program I might get booted from my internship and lose out on what could be a career setting opportunity.

How do I approach this? Should I tell them ahead of time? Should i wait till towards the end of the internship before telling them that I'm considering not going back?"

I need advice.,thisismyfuckingdick,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1tdpoy/bad_stuff_happened_i_need_advice/,"So here's my story. Went to community college for 2 years, transferred to a UC with a 4.0 ready to start upper division computer science. First quarter went fine. Next three didn't.

In my year at university I managed to earn an internship at Amazon. It was an awesome experience and I did well enough to be invited back for another internship.

However, despite being a pretty good programmer, I turned out not to be so great at being a student. After D's in physics (twice) and math classes, I just found out that I've been academically disqualified from my university. 

Which puts me at a crossroads. I can either go to
community college again for another year and them come back, or I can just quit school now and try to make a career with the experience I have. Aside from my Amazon internship, I also have some contract work and personal projects under my belt. 

I really don't know what to do. I want to finish school, but it kind of feels like it's for nothing at this point. I've taken all of the core programming classes, everything left is math and extra stuff. But still, I know how much degrees are valued and how helpful it would be to have one. But would it be more valuable to just get more experience? I don't know. I'm really lost here.

So if you browse my posts, you'll notice that I'm a junior in college at the moment. You may also find that I have a internship in a nice corporation and I've recently realized how deep in shit I am. Excuse my language. 

Essentially I've got a decent amount of computer knowledge. I can put one together, take it apart, swap parts, fix it, etc. I can do the same to a network: put together, make it nice, fix it when it breaks. However, this doesn't compare even close to what happens on a corporate level. And I get that I require experience, and that I lack it at the moment. But I guess I don't know how to close the gap of where I'm at now, and where they people that work here are at.

To my point: How do I choose which set of Microsoft certifications I should take? At one point I was interested in getting my CCNA, but that fell off. Now I'm not sure what part of IT I'd like to learn. I'm interested in tech support, and maybe some sort of networking. Maybe even database. 

TL;DR: College kid severely lost in IT and I don't know how to choose what MS certs to look into.

You know, you find one you like and express interest. Only to never hear back. Or you actually go on a date (interview) and try to impress your date (employer) and get rejected. Well I just heard back the rejection from a position that I had worked my ass off to get.

About the company/job/interview:

The company was referred to me by a VP (different company) I met at a networking event. I began networking with the company, scheduling meetings to discuss the company and connecting with different people via email.

I applied to a few positions and originally heard nothing. I proceeded to email and ask about internships. They got back to me and scheduled a time to have a phone interview. The day and time of the phone interview my phone didn't ring. A few hours waiting past the agreed upon time, I emailed HR asking what the deal was. They informed me that my interviewer didn't come into the office that day, and to reschedule. I was upset but I remained civil and understanding in my email to reschedule.

The next day we conduct the phone interview. The guy on the phone asked me why we were discussing internships when I was qualified for an actual position within the company. He said he would make sure to have HR email me and set up an interview for a permanent position. HR gets in touch with me and a position was actually one that I had applied for originally but never heard back for. We ended up scheduling an interview with 4 different people for 30 minutes each. I prepared like hell for the interview, researched the company and specifically what services they offered, prepared notes and researched each one of my interviewers to view specific projects they completed so that I could reference them during the interview. I went to kinko's and printed/binded my professional portfolio, each addressed personally to each one of my interviewers.

Well, two of my interviewers weren't there that day, and they recycled the guy I spoke with on the phone to interview me again. Despite that, the interviews went great. I referenced their work, expressed my understanding of exactly what it was that they did, showed them a specific example of me doing the work that they did. They said they really were impressed by my portfolios and continued by saying they hoped I could join the team and talked about how great it was to work at the company.

Following up the interview, I sent out 6 hand written thank you's to each one of the connections I had made with the company, including the interviewers and HR.

They said they would get back to me within a couple days, well over a week and a half went by, during which time I sent following up emails as polite reminders and to check up on my status. The person I was told I would hear from gave me the runaround, saying they didn't know the next steps in the process and that I would hear back from the hiring manager. After that didn't happen I emailed them back referencing that I was told I would hear from them, and immediately after received an email saying they were pursuing other candidates that were the best match for the firm.

I'm pretty pissed off and bummed out by this whole process. I sincerely went above and beyond and gave it my best shot. I know that I am qualified to do the job and I literally proved it to them by providing examples of my work.

Thanks for reading, I just needed to vent. Would appreciate your comments.

tl;dr: This has been the worst year of my life, proving that my best is never good enough, in both my personal and professional lives."

I'm not sure what to do anymore and if any fellow media folks can offer some advice I'd appreciate it.

Let me give you a rundown of my situation. 

I graduated college with a journalism degree back in June 2012. After my wife finished her degree we decided to move to NYC. I had a decent contact base in our hometown, but prospects in journalism and media were bleak at best. I figured if I'm to hustle and grind to get this career rolling I may as well do it in the media capital of the world. 

We moved and after about three or four months the wife gets a high paying job in her field. I was working retail. I ended up finding a nice internship in marketing in July, but left fairly quickly (verbally abusive boss).

Now, I'm unemployed and basically in the same situation as when we first move here. I have no idea what I'm doing.

I've been doing freelance work while looking for full-time positions, but payment is always an issue. The stories I work on take too long to do and pay pennies (especially in this city).

When I manage to get interviews they always tell me they appreciate the work I put into my app, but it takes a pretty long time to do that. I end up getting 2-4 apps out a day and that seems slow to me.

I'm told I have an amazing resume, and I'm proud of it too (did it myself). However, it hasn't gotten me much thus far.

Finally, I generally focus on hip-hop culture as my beat. Most of my clips have something to do with hip-hop and its elements. I'm proud of this work, but it doesn't seem to be getting me anywhere as I can't seem to find a company willing to give me a shot at full-time. I worked hard in school to be as versatile and flexible as possible, but I fear it may not translate as well in my portfolio.

I just need some advice from some folks that have made it in this field, in this city. I spend far too much time in our apartment online and I feel like I should be out making moves. I just have no idea how to make said moves.

TLDR: More than a year out of college and still nothing on the job front. Working in a tough field in a harsh city. Discouraged, confused and rapidly going broke. What should I do?

Thanks r/jobs!"

**Bio:**

* Age- 23.
* Gender- Male.
* Signs of social anxiety began when I was : 18 years old.
* severity of social anxiety - 5/10.
* Seeing therapist: No.
* Taking medication: No.

**********************

**Problem 1:**
Nervous meeting new people in a formal setting, like a boardroom or in the office or even a casual environment with a formal meeting agenda.


**possible cause:**

**Social isolation:** 
 After I was finished with college, the last six months have been noticeably harder to deal with because for a large part I was at home.

**Possible solution 1:** 
I am accepting an internship offer that I have received from people I am familiar with. It will however, involve meeting new people everyday. So basically I'm ensuring that for a majority of the day, I will be interacting with unfamiliar people. I will post how I feel after 10 days of doing it.

**problem 2 :** 
Nervous when I'm expected to give a speech in front of a medium to large group of people. I'm much more nervous if the speech is not a prepared one. 

**Possible cause :**
I had a bad experience in college, where in I was asked to introduce my self and I just sat in my seat without saying a word(was also sweating), things started getting harder from then onwards.

**Possible solution :**
I'm already attending toastmasters sessions. I'll document my progress after a few sessions.

I'm currently in college and setting out for art/entertainment based jobs. Obviously, these are networking heavy industries. I do fortunately know quite a few people loosely who may have the ability to assist, but I'm not sure how to really go about that. It's not difficult contacting a stranger or friend, but those I speak to infrequently raises more questions. I also did not always have the most professional of demeanors and am only recently learning how to network appropriately. I feel like I may have damaged some of these connections in a professional manner.

I'll number every situation off separately; Feel free to give advice on one or all.

1) I briefly spoke with a founder of a video game studio who later added me on Facebook. They posted a short 'Hey, hope your holidays are going well' generic type thing to me last year around this time. I said something similar back ""Hey, you too"" or something and then segued into possible internships (stupid on my part). There was no further response. We haven't spoken since, but we also didn't speak often to begin with. Is it appropriate to attempt to initiate this again?

2) I have a family friend since childhood who has strong connections in the entertainment industry, has won Oscars, and is constantly working. I've never contacted them myself and only know this person through my Mom. She does not appear to want to contact this person to ask about internships. I could this person's email online and contact them, but don't know if it's appropriate to sidestep my family.

3) I have a friend at a larger animation studio with multiple locations. I was hoping to get an internship at this studio as they're local, but I also just applied for a job through another of the company's studios a few weeks back. I could simultaneously have the job and internship; Neither would affect the other and both would be beneficial in their own way. Should I contact this friend about the internship or wait until the job portion is settled? If I don't get the job (they'll know, since I referenced them), should I ask about the internship?

4) I met someone at an industry event who works at a large film studio who offered to give me industry advice and gave me an email. Emails went back and forth a few times shortly after then they didn't respond. I think I got back and they just mentioned being super busy and apologizing, then not responding again still. I tried again maybe a year later mentioning I was going to attempt applying to their studio's internship as I mentioned in person I planned to in the future. They said they would get me some information for their hiring manager then never responded. I may have followed up again; Don't recall off-hand. Either way, I never got the information. I didn't get the impression they were ignoring me, but rather the email just got lost in the ether. Their studio will be accepting internship applications again soon, should I email this person again asking for any information again? How should I go about this?

Again, I know not all my actions were necessarily wise from a professional standpoint. I haven't ruined connections as a friend with any of these people or done anything ridiculous or outlandish, but I do believe on a professional level, I may have ruined any credibility. Is there anyway to make sure any emails do get replies? Is it wise to attempt to contact people working at studios I'm interested in interning at and making connections? What is it appropriate to say when emailing a stranger out of the blue? I'm only just adjusting to professionalism, so while I'm generally extremely comfortable meeting new people and talking when being myself, I'm finding it nerve-wracking how to professionally network and connect with people. Mainly because I feel I will do something that may kill my current or future chances with a company in an industry where jobs are scarce already.

So, any advice would be extremely appreciated in any of the above scenarios or in general. Apologies this is a bit long; I just have a ton of situations occurring at once. Thanks if you bothered to read through all this!"

1ti1sx,3,2013-12-22,Negotiating full-time salary as iOS Developer. Does about-to-be-earned Masters matter or average iOS Developer salary? Thanks for input!,[deleted],startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1ti1sx/negotiating_fulltime_salary_as_ios_developer_does/,"So there's a successful startup that I had an internship with that would like to have me back full time in Chicago after I graduate with a Masters this year. A friend of mine who works there says the current software developers earn about $60,000 with a Bachelors but I'm seeing averages for iOS Developers be in $90,000 and that doesn't even take degree into account. There's dental &amp; health insurance, up to 2 weeks of paid vacation days, and stock options although the company has so much investors involved that the stock options I assume aren't really that big of a deal (0.1%).

Would it be insane to ask for $90,000 from a startup that has more than a million dollars of VC money? I never knew the average for iOS developers was so high and I always saw myself as a software developer who happen to specialize in iOS, thus justifying a much lower pay. However in the end, I am an iOS developer so I could argue that the job market average is much higher and that I'd like to get paid more. I have become quite acquainted with their software and even know how to work with integrating the Windows and Mac client software with the iOS app since that's what I did during the internship, which makes me worth a lot in their eyes. Not only that but I'm going to have a Masters so that should count for something, right?

I don't want to be exploited but I don't want to sound like a cheap penny pincher that cares only about the money in the company. I love the work! But with the salary I was earning as an intern, they were clearly using me for cheap labor since that's what interns are in the end. What are your thoughts? Should I be expecting to be getting anything higher than the $60,000 that the other software developers get even though my specialization has a higher average and I will have a Masters degree? Thanks a bunch for the replies! :)"
1tmur3,0,2013-12-24,How to approach getting an internship,[deleted],AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/1tmur3/how_to_approach_getting_an_internship/,"I considered posting this in r/EngineeringStudents but I really want the opinion of people currently in the field, sorry if this is the wrong place!

I'm a Junior Computer Engineering student currently on winter break and diligently hunting for internships. I'm having a very hard time finding good fit opportunities to apply for and and since the application process for most is rather time consuming I only want to spend time on ones that I have a chance at and I would accept. I had one internship last summer (as a rising Junior) but it was with a family friend's company and although I learned tons it was basically tossed into my lap.

If you do a simple google search about three third party websites comes up with the same 15 opportunities. Having only a 3.2 GPA and somewhat limited organized extracurriculars I feel I don't have the qualifications to stand out from what will likely be a huge pool of applicants.

I'm most interested in working for a smaller company and I don't know how to find them. I had such a positive experience at the small company I worked for last year I would love to find a similar experience (I am not returning to my first internship because I would like to steer my career in another direction). Would it be inappropriate to find companies that look interesting and call/email to ask for more information about what they do and if they'd be interested in an intern? I feel like many small places don't actively look for interns. I'm also very interested in sustainability/green engineering and plan a minor in sustainability engineering, does anyone have any recommendations for finding a company that places an emphasis on this? So many company websites are outdated and have a very small amount of information that I'm not sure what my next step should be.

Thank you for your help r/AskEngineers!"

I know that top companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft are all just about done hiring for their internship programs, and I've been left with no interviews. The environment at school is very cutthroat, insular, and unforgiving so I guess I'm trying to get a second opinion and understand what's going on elsewhere. 

I kept putting off applying for more positions because I feel like I'm very rusty on CS basics and I haven't had time to review, and because I want to do front end but my skills there are less developed than they are in the back end. Should I stop worrying and just get my resume out there, or take my time and prepare? 

I know this might sound overly anxious (which I'm sure it probably is), but it's hard not to feel this way when everyone around me is constantly talking about their internships and comparing them, and I'm completely empty-handed. "

1tlvq2,1,2013-12-24,"Visionary College Entrepreneur Builds a Startup For College Students... Interviewed On Startups (While In School or Anytime) ""I WILL Start a Startup No Matter How BIG or SMALL""",roomscapeu,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1tlvq2/visionary_college_entrepreneur_builds_a_startup/,"RoomScape U: Redefining the College Dorm Living Experience

There is something brewing down in Tallahassee Florida…A nice little ecosystem of start-ups is shaping and coming into form, and this development is being led by Josh Hagler a senior at Florida State University, and founder of RoomScape U, a website dedicated to helping college students find unique and novel items for dorms.

The idea for his start-up came to him when he was a freshman at FSU, and noticed that most dorm room walls were blank and dull in color. He found the same issue as well when going to Target and Walmart, and noticed that both stores had the same boring items.

In this article Josh shares the RoomScape U story, and gives advice for aspiring college entrepreneurs.

Q: What is the elevator pitch of your business?

RoomScape U curates and sells essential, cool, and innovative products for college students. The goal of our site is to reinvent and re-imagine your college living experience.
Q: What does RoomScapeU offer to its users? What’s your value proposition?

On the site we offer everything from awesome wall peels to branded bar stools for schools. We offer an array of products such as cooking and drinking products, electronic products like alarm clocks, entertainment speakers and headphones and UBoxes. As pointed out in the website, UBoxes were created to provide college students with awesome products at great prices. Weekly deals are ran to promote UBoxes and are only available while supplies last.

The value proposition for RoomScapeU is discovering new products for college students that are curated to students. It too is themed specific for each school, for example, when I sign in with FSU the product results that are returned are FSU themed. Users can also view the cost between roommates in the product description. The products then become a Facebook for social shopping, where people can send products to roommates via Facebook and more.
Q: What was the hardest obstacle you faced starting out?

The hardest thing for me starting up has been teaching myself how to code and learning photoshop on the fly. This was accomplished too with only the help of a few interns. Having limited resources as a start-up has made me work 15-18 hours a day, which is not necessarily a bad thing because I love what I do.
Q: How did you decide what to sell?

When I started the site it began with just posters, from their I thought what are the essentials for college rooms. Wall posters, cool wall cloths, everything that can go on a canvas, this whole student marketplace sooned followed. Shower stuff, alarm clocks, tech items, I started to look at trending items on various websites like TechCrunch for new products in hopes of getting them on RoomScape U.
Q: Where are the products from?

A fun thing I love about RoomScape U is finding suppliers, constant research, googling college shopping, seeing what people are saying, locating the essentials, finding what is going to make this venture different. The process is a hard one to copy once you found your partners, each business has a method.
Q: What goes into keeping those relationships strong?

These people get 50-100 requests a day, have to be purple cow when reaching out to potential business partners. Always be friendly and keep up the conversation, look up their team, and see which person might be related to your business the most, Keeps the conversation positive and following up.

Stand out and be personable.
Q: How did you come up with the name for your start-up?

The name is something that stemmed from landscaping, or making beautiful things outside. So we called it roomscaping, literally making your room awesome “RoomScape” and the “U” is for university.
Q: How is balancing school and a start-up?

It is challenging. I used to enjoy going out, spending time with friends, but I don’t have the time anymore! The good thing is that I am extremely passionate about what I do. In addition, this semester I am taking two entrepreneurship courses, with great professors, these professors all have great advice which has helped with RoomScape U.
Q: What is the most important part of your business?

The most important part of RoomScape U is to make college students happy! We want students to have an enjoyable time browsing our products to discover cool stuff. Hopefully it gives them a new idea for their own rooms. It is all about making the customers happy, without them there is no site.
Q: What is the biggest mistake you have made along the way, how would you prevent it next time?

The biggest mistake I made was not seeking help early on, or not seeking a founding team earlier. Doing so would have probably helped accelerate the business. Having that founding team makes it easier to throw the idea around, get feedback, to kill it at the same time together.
Q: What is your advice from college students starting out?

My advice for college students wanting to start a business is to write the idea down on a paper. Write something like, “I will start a start-up,” when the goal is in mind it becomes much easier to reach. “No matter how big or small, I will start a start-up” is the phrase I used to motivate me to start RoomScape U.

How you discover what you want to start, comes from an idea, the execution, when reality meets, you take your idea, and get feedback early and test. Ideas are a guess, when the guess is given to another person, that is when you start to innovate and get something people want to use!

In short keep writing, keep testing, and keep innovating! Think big and be rational about what you can do. Believe in your idea, it can happen, and set out to change the world."
1tls51,5,2013-12-24,24 Year Old Computer Science Student. Do I keep trying?,ineedadvice24,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1tls51/24_year_old_computer_science_student_do_i_keep/,"In 100% honesty, I'm just not a very good student and I'm just not very intelligent.  I started this journey in 2007, dropped out for 2 years because of financial problems after my dad passed and transferred to a cheaper school.  I lost all of my credits but I'm trying again but I just don't know if it's worth it.  

I feel like an old man and I feel like everybody is watching and waiting for me to graduate and I feel like I'm a financial burden on my mom and more than anything, I just want a tech related job just to get me started, even if it's minimum wage and even if it's the most worthless tech job where I get treated like dirt.  I just want to get my foot on some rung of some ladder but I cant seem to get anything and I feel like I'm just spinning my tires in the mud.  These last 2 years I've been sending my resume everywhere, I've been trying to land just something, anything and I've had zero luck.  I'm quite savvy with computers and I learn quickly when I'm on my own and when it's practical but I'm no good at learning in a classroom or from a textbook.  Ill admit, I was a lazy high school kid and I've developed terrible habits but I think I've gotten better.  There was a time when simple Algebra terrified me, in fact when I took the placement test at school, they dropped me into Algebra and I hate to work my way up and just yesterday I took my Single Variable Calculus final.  Maybe I didn't pass that final but I have to admit, I do feel a sense of pride in being able to say that I got out from under my math-illiterate hole and have a keen understanding of at least a few concepts in Calculus.

Anyways, I digress.  I just don't know if I can keep doing this.  I feel like it might be time to drop out and just work at some fast food joint or something and accept that higher education isn't for everybody and perhaps I just don't have what it takes.  When I started this journey the plan was to become a competent programmer and to move out to Austin with some friends who have started a game development studio.  They knew that I wasn't the best programmer but the idea was to get my foot in the door and to just grind through it.  Ultimately, I wanted to work in design and it's where my passion is but I wanted to become a programmer so that I had a marketable skill to offer rather than being the ""ideas guy"".  But I don't know.  I don't think I'm bad at programming, I think I'm just bad at learning.  I have poor study habits and I don't really know how to start to learn.  I've gone through textbooks, I've sat down and worked on projects of my own but nothing truly perplexing comes out of it and I don't feel like I've made anything worth showcasing.  Ideally, I'd love to land some internship where someone forced me into a position where I had to learn to program but out here in New York, it seems like every position asks for 3-5 years of experience and a degree which is totally understandable but I don't know how I'm going to get started.

Thanks for reading all of this if you've made it this far.  I feel pretty god damn worthless and I don't want to give up but it just seems like it's what I should do at this point."

- This internship is in Sunnyvale, CA. As a high school student, should I expect to be paid for it? If so, how much? If not a real salary, should I expect to be paid for transportation costs?

I'm looking to start a career in programming, and I've read that securing internships positions is very important. I'm a little confused however, on how to become qualified for these internship positions, which languages should I be familiarizing myself with? At the moment I'm studying javascript from codeacademy, I was learning html but I heard that javascript is more popular for commercial use.

I really like this company and would like to continue working there after I came back if I left for the summer, especially because I will probably be studying here for 4 more years (double major CS and Mathematics)

If I apply I don't want my boss to get a surprise phone call from another company about me but I don't want to tell him I might be leaving a few months before the release of a project that I am the primary (only) committer for. It would leave him in a bad spot and might ruin the relationship I have with the company.

I am thinking of trying this, http://support.microsoft.com/kb/829700, about changing the registry.

Besides this, what could lead to this sort of slowdown? Especially when the previous workstation handled this like a champ despite being less awesome hardware.

Update 1: NIC drivers seem to be up-to-date and the right drivers. Still disturbingly slow when accessing network resources, some files being more slow than others.

Update 2: Windows 7 Professional, wired, previous workstation on same jack still works fine. Can access files on the data server just fine, save it be the one specific file in question. Every other non-new workstation can access can ""slow-ass-file"" fine, just not the CEO's workstation. The other new workstations access it fine too. Fracking frack frack frack frack frack.

As I visited this mighty sub, I remembered a story that happened 5 years ago.  
A young intern (me) worked at the tech support of a small IT company.
Their job was focused on providing machines and softwares to customers. Customers would almost only be small businesses and that typical customer would not be savvy at all. 
We thus sent technical sales engineers to them (they weren't technically engineers, but they had the title), who would try to solve the issue, and send us the broken hardware if that was the cause of it. We had to repair, replace or reset items before sending them back.

Fast forward to this day, the almighty engineer sends us broken hardware, just a screen, for repair or exchange. With a little note ""Broken screen"".
I try it on my computer, screen's dirty, but it works. It works quite well actually. I check everything. Everything works like a charm. I phone call the dude, who explains to me that the screen was totally broken and always displayed a blue screen. 

I shit you not. He saw a BSOD, sent back the screen, and left the desktop computer.

As I was in the job for a few month during summer, I suppose every tech support must have already faced this mistake. If you did, how much common is this mistake?"

The field that I am currently in is Operations Research (OR), and the military has paid for me to get several professional certs related to this career.


The problem I have is this: I'm unsure if I want to continue down the OR or IE track, or revert back to a CS-related career once I get out of the military. From my own personal research, it seems like the OR/IE career fields are small and less financially-rewarding than a CS career, and a vast amount of the OR/IE-related jobs out there are in the government in some shape or form.


If I continue down my current career track, I would most likely go into consulting as that's what a lot of Industrial Engineers do. However, the average salary difference between an Industrial Engineer and a Software Engineer is pretty big. At the same time, I don't feel like my experience in the military has adequately prepared me for an IE career in the private sector (my academic experience is pretty broad but my actual job uses very superficial analytic concepts).


However, if I try to go back to a CS-related field when I separate from the military, I'm afraid of starting at square 1 at 28 years old. I've had 2 internships relevant to the field in college, but that was almost 4 years ago, and I'm afraid that my skills will get rusty by the time I get out.


My current plan for the next 2 years (when my active-duty commitment ends) is to catch up on my programming skills (I mainly used Java and C++), while continuously making sure that my OR academics don't get rusty since I never get to use it. I'm thinking of taking additional grad-level courses in CS but I'm unsure of just how much more that will benefit me career-wise.


To be honest, if the average salary difference and the job market outlook between the two career fields weren't that big, I wouldn't be worried about this right now. 


So my big questions to you guys are: What are some things I can do now to ensure that I can be competitive in the private sector once I exit the military, what additional decision-making factors should I consider, and what would you do in my current position?

Thanks.

I've been doing my PhD for over a year and I'm fed up with the job and the field in general. I want to do something else.

For my MSc thesis I taught myself LaTex and loved the process of learning it. In fact, it was the most enjoyable aspect the whole thesis. Ever since, I thought that I should give programming a whirl.

Two weeks ago I finally gave it a shot with hour of code. Then I moved on to start the Python course at codecademy and fell in love with it. Since, I have spent 2-6 hours a day, practicing python. While I'm no genius, it does come not come difficult to me. I find myself completely immersed and have no problem putting in hour after our. I learn python because it's been recommended as a great beginners language that helps you grasps the concepts of coding.

I put codecademy on hold at 60% because a lot of time instructions and explanations were poor. I moved on to 'learning python the hard way', 'python programming for the absolute beginner', googles python class videos and the new boston tutorials. I'm doing a lot of exercises to make sure I've understood everything. **Sometimes I feel like I should be learning more new material instead of perfecting things I've learned.** I also made my own little program, a calculator for molecular biology applications.

So that's what I've been doing so far. Here's my future goals:

1. 'Finish' python. That means knowing the content of at least one book from cover to cover.

2. Take the harvard CS50 course online. Without the 350 dollar certificate.

3. Learn Javascript, HTML and CSS on Code Avengers + books

4. Make my biology calculator as an android app

5. Be good enough for an internship at a software developer

6. Quit my PhD (maybe 6-8 months from now IF I found an internship)

7. Find a job in programming

This probably sounds ludacris but I've never wanted something so much in my life. I'd greatly appreciate any advice you could offer, any insights you could provide. If you have questions for me, I'm glad to elaborate on everything.

Long time lurker on this subreddit.  I am currently a graduating electrical engineering major but, have worked mostly in software.  I am about to graduate after working at a fortune 500 company.  I have other experience other than that in some summer research programs.  I was shamefully not offered a fulltime position at my internship due in part to my inexperience at the particular type of programming my group did.  I have received an offer from a smaller company in my area and am worried that working my first fulltime job at a small company will hurt my chances of coming back to a company like qualcomm or google.  I would really appreciate some advice on this.  

Other notes, I favor the smaller company because the work load will most likely be smaller, and I will have the option of sitting in on classes at my university.  The pay will also be less but since the workload will be less I will have more time to keep learning.

Thank you for the advice.

I'm looking to start a career in **web development, possibly**, but I'm not certain if that's the direction to head in at this time. I want to get into a field within programming that'll make me the most marketable because, from what I studied in college, did not make that happen and I've been working retail jobs for the past two years and am now currently unemployed (and looking!)

So I'm looking for guidance as to 

1. What should I (or should not) be learning language-wise
 
2. What sort of tech work I currently qualify for that would make me a thousand times (or to some similar degree) more knowledgeable and super duper in my work, and 

3. Any other information that you might find pertinent in my particular situation.

**My background:**
I have my BA in Communications Media: Media Management, so I have a good grasp in general marketing, PR, and management ideas for various subsects of media including television, radio, and general web. I also have an AA in general Liberal Arts and took two internships in news related agencies (a newspaper and an NPR station).

**Coding experience:**
I have a working knowledge of C++ from a course I took in community college plus a book I fiddled with over the summer (I love video games and was going for learning them, but eh, I live in NY). 

I had started learning HTML on Neopets as a kid for the pet pages and have used the markup language in a few endeavors, including when I worked briefly for a (very, very minor) game site as a reporter for editing blogs I've had in the past, and a geocities site (that I coded by hand, mind you, not it's weird drop interface). I came back to it recently on Codecademy, finishing the course in that and finding a few other websources to fiddle around with as well.

CSS I didn't really start grasping until recently, though I did fiddle with it when myspace was a big thing. Again, Codecademy got me there.

Khan Academy is actually what got me started into programming again with their promotion of the Programming Power Hour (I might be getting the name wrong). I finished the full Javascript course about a week ago and feel rather comfortable writing in it now. But I'm not really sure what to do with it from here. If you're interested, [here are my projects](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/JJinx/programs).

Lastly, I've been dabbling in a few random languages based upon what I've seen in help wanted ads. I've seen Ruby on Rails, jQuery, PHP, a slew of other things. I've been told by other programming friends different things as well, so I'm a bit confused as to where to go from here.

**So to sum my experience:**

* Some C++
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript (working with OOP a bit more now)
* A *very, very* small bit of Ruby, PHP, and jQuery

If anyone else thinks it's necessary, I could list my work history as well, but as I stated above, it's mostly retail positions. I've worked briefly (non-paid) in film as well as a few other things. Just let me know. Anything to help get the right guidance. I'm sick of living with my parents at 26 without anything to really show for myself."

In the beginning of my college career I wanted to do CIS but I had to settle with CS because my college has a GPA requirement in order to get into the College of Business(CIS). 

I was still able to get a job in the College of Business as a lab manager where I managed a help desk of 15 employees and oversaw the technology for our lap(200 clients, 100+ laptops, 5+servers). It was by far the best job I've had since.

Last summer came around and I decided to get an internship so I could see how I like coding in corporate setting. I got put on the reporting team and taught PostgreSQL to myself and was in a closed room with 3 other introverts programming for 8 hours a day with no human interaction.

Needless to say I don't feel as though programming 8 hours a day non stop is my cup of tea. I absolutely hated it at my internship and there was no human interaction whatsoever.  It was definitely a learning experience but I am safe to say that I don't like that environment. 

My question is what type of job still offers the human interaction, sys admin, coding position. I loved the ""minor"" sys admin position I held at the College of Business and I still like to code so I am looking for an in-between kind of job. My only delta is that I've read stories of the full blown sys admins that have to work weekends and holidays and are always on call and have to deal with the shitty customers.  I am not looking for a ""full blown"" type of sys admin job but something in the middle would be nice.

Any suggestions on what type of position this might be would be greatly appreciated!"

This includes going through a break up. I have also finished my 5th semester in University.

I have done some self analysis and some research online and have finally realized most of my unhappiness is because of my insecurities.

Some examples (to help give you an idea) include:
1. Social situations I am insecure in - I laugh at any chance that is given to me. ""Oh you said something that was sorta sarcastic..? 'laugh...'  "" 
2. I never use large words when speaking to people because I panic that I will say it wrong and they will think i'm an uneducated idiot.
3. I get really angry when I do poorly at games such as Trivial Pursuit, or even video games because I think - ""If i suck at this, I am not quick at thinking, which means I won't be smart enough to get a good job. Now this means i'm going to be poor when I'm older. 
4. If I say a joke and nobody laughs I immediately have to say something afterwards to try and break the silence. Then after saying what I said, after the silence, I feel more like an idiot. It kills me and can kill my confidence for the rest of the day/night.
5. When someone starts talking about something I am not certain of such as: what job they will have after university, or the internship they are getting, or the promotion they got... I envy them and begin to feel scared and worried and angry because none of that is happening for me. I will let that ruin my day as well.

I think one of the main reasons for my insecurities is how i view life. I have too many values that rely on what others think of me. I feel like my life is almost fully based on other people's perspectives. ""If i do this... what will this person think??"" Always thinking about what other people think of me.. Or how they see me. 

I know this post is all over the place, but I am just sick and tired of feeling this way all the time. All of my friends (to my knowledge) don't see how insecure I am. I try my best to hide it and because of my active personality, I can. I am just always always always feeling uncomfortable and I want it to change. I haven't really thought to ask the internet for help, but maybe redditors can help me out.

What can i do? Does anyone else feel this way? How severe can it get if you can relate? "

This Christmas season has allowed me to reflect on my life in a lot of ways. Over the past few years, IFU. I want some serious help how to turn around my life. I have built myself extremely academically strong. The amount of awards, accomplishments, and experiences I have attained is breath-taking, yet there is something missing.

Hopefully, I have described them below.

* I realized that my social life is dying. It never really was alive. I was never really noticed by anyone, always marginalized as the uncool kid. Consequently, it is partially my fault. I turned away most people because I have trust issues, assuming what they would think of me. Now, I’m getting better, but still need to improve because I mostly keep to myself.

* I ruined my professional life by creating an unintended scene. Some may think that I “won”, but the only thing I won was misery. I replay every day of that in my head. I am disgraced to know what happened was because of me. I wasted an internship that another eager person could have had. Now, I have no positive references when applying to real jobs. There should be no pity on me.

* I feel like I am loved too much by my relatives. They are willing (and they do) everything for me. It seems like their willingness to love me is taking a toll on them. They are (or more like, I am) afraid that I’ll never grow up, that I’ll never move on. Some days I feel that once my parents die, I will follow.


I deserve to amount to nothing because of my actions, but I won’t accept it. My entire life I was the poster child for success and goodness (I was voted most straight edge in high school), yet I don’t feel it. I still play it safe, afraid to experience anything risky or wrong. I want to show sincerity, maturity, and thankfulness to all of those around me. There is a roadblock some place that I need to move past. I want people to know that there is no subtle reserve behind his lucid frankness.

I'm mostly done. I have my format and everything down but I'm not sure when to put as far as computing and programming languages. I've taken a C programming class which I know is a little dated. The Digital Circuit Design class had us program in Verilog which I think is a bit more modern so I think I'll put that down. But, as far as any other languages are concerned, I haven't used any.

I'm good with Microsoft office so I'll put that in the ""Computing Skills"" section that I reserved for this type of thing.

I've found an internship that I really want, it's of a software developer role and this is what they've started on their website as to what they want in an intern:

Desirable:

 -HTML, CSS
 
 -.Net, C#, ASP.Net
 
 -SQL
 
 -JavaScript

I know HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript, but not the rest. I've got a fairly advanced knowledge in Java (very similar to C#).

The main thing they're developing on is .NET, and I haven't the slightest clue as to what it is/how to use it. Since it is an internship, is there any use to applying for it, if I don't know how to use one of the main things. Or will they see my application, see that I know mostly everything and have a strong background in Java, and let me learn .NET on the job (if i do get accepted)?

I unfortunately only just saw this job and the deadline is the 31st of December to apply for it. So I obviously can't learn how .NET framework and C# work in 3 days time.

* since graduation, have been searching for local and nonlocal jobs even sort of related to my major (museum, library, writing, editing, publishing, government work)

LONG STORY

Two weeks ago marked my one year anniversary of graduating college, and since then I've done my level best to find a job that is even remotely related to my field of study. To me, that means the obvious choices of research and library work, but as of eight months ago I expanded that search to include things like writing, publishing and editing. Living in a small town in NE Ohio, I've obviously have been open to relocating for the position,  

I've been to job boards like Indeed, and I have the USAJobs website e-mailing me daily about new job opportunities. I did freelance work through Elance for about two months before I got my current (part-time, soul-crushing) retail job.

To my detriment, I admit that I have no internship experience. Due to the unpaid nature of such internships, my then-current part-time job, my class schedule, and the commuting times between home, work, and school made such internships impossible.

Needless to say this whole ordeal has been very frustrating and anxiety-producing. I'm fortunate(?) enough to live with my family (nuclear, 7+) rent-free in exchange for pitching in with groceries, some bills, and watching over the younger kids (cousins) when their parents are at work.

For the last couple months, I've seriously been considering going back to school for a more technical field of study, namely computer science or accounting. The school that I'm looking at offers career assistance and co-op programs for its technical degrees, which makes it seem like I would have a fighting chance after graduating. I'm not proud of it, but I was also thinking that, being female, going into computer science could help get my foot in the door.

I know that I messed up in a lot of areas (particularly in internships), but I just need some advice as to whether or not this is an advisable course of action. Any serious advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated."

So I'm graduating in the beginning och next year and I currently have two job offers that I'm weighing against eachother and some help nudging me in the right direction would be appreciated!

Job 1 is a place where I had an internship on, great company with 3000 employees world wide and 200 at the office that I might work at. One big con is that I'll have to that city permanently (not a viable option to commute) and I have a girlfriend in my current home town that has one year left on her studies.

Job 2 is a smaller company, 30 employees in total, 10 of which at the office I might work at. Only been there on interviews, seems like a nice place but not as many benefits as the bigger corporation. A positive is that it's situated in my current home town so I can keep my current apartment etc. 

What of the two would you consider most viable? I want to advance in my career within a 3 year period, where would that be most viable? What looks better on a CV? Where would you think pays the most?

I'm sick of retail and want a better job but don't know what I'm doing wrong. I apply to at least two jobs a day and get rejection letters weekly. I gotta be doing something wrong, but don't know what. I know I've got a few spots that might make me undesirable, but I have no idea.

I have some college but had to stop due to lack of funding. I went to college in Seattle, but now live in a small town in the middle of nowhere low-rent with friends trying to find a job that pays more than min wage.  

I have computer skills but no certifications. I completed A+ training but couldn't pay for the certification test (which was $175 at the time I took the training.) But I can type 100wpm and have 6 months of data entry/office experience from my internship. I also have experience working with Microsoft Office, the Adobe Creative Suite, Autodesk software, Jira, and Perforce. I also have experience opening, solving, and closing tickets. I have roughly 4 years experience in doing random under the table computer repair. I also have 4 years customer service experience and several months experience working as an assistant in a pharmacy, taking phone calls, working with medication, and changing data in the computer.

The thing I don't understand is, I know people working at jobs that pay them $20 an hour to use a computer that they don't even know how to use. Data entry, mild programming, and these people can't even type without hunting and pecking. One of them had all of her programming training paid for by the company. 

I want to know how to get those kinds of jobs. I work amazingly in an office environment, and I'm a quick learner to anything computer related. Anything I don't know, I can learn. But the only returned calls I get are spam for pyramid scheme work-from-home type deals. Since moving to this place, the only jobs I've been able to do are farming jobs and retail. And I'm sick of pulling 12 hours shifts without overtime so I can barely scrape by."

One thing I would like to explain is that my mother has actually told me that there was a customer who works at PSEG willing to network students and that person asked me to send the resume to her email. Although she didn't ask for cover letter, I'm just writing it in the email.

cover letter:

I would like to thank you for making time to take a look at my resume and providing an opportunity to be part of the PSEG company workforce. Although I had the drive to work for PSEG after reading about the company many times, I was even more motivated to do so when my mother, (name), told me that you were willing to network for the internship position. I have attached the resume to the email.

Having received awards in community support and corporate performance as one of the most diversified energy companies, PSEG greatly piqued my interest. As the company provides various career opportunities while developing a green workforce which is heavily labor intensive, I believe that my passion for engineering and the past experiences will allow me to make a great contribution to the company,

As shown in the resume, along with the general engineering concepts obtained through academic progress, I was able to learn the effective ways of dealing with typical situations working as a volunteer and a part-timer. While I was volunteering at Englewood Hospital, the supervisor provided additional jobs for me to take care of acting as an administrative backup in the management field; she has taken an interest in my working process and offered useful information regarding how I could take these skills further. Taking advantage of these skills, as a cashier, I was instructed numerous times by the manager to act as assistance for instructing the newcomers. Although having good background knowledge in the specific field is necessary, I believe that knowing how to take advantage of it to its full potential when dealing with a problem is just as important, as it is greatly need in bringing about the best outcome. This show that I have what it takes to be part of the workforce and my willingness to get the job done properly for the company.

The programs are part of the school's college of science and technology, and not particularly large (the school is primarily a business and education school, but well known for its Polymer Science department). Anyways, I'm strongly considering transferring to another state university my junior year to finish up EE. 

The EE school is  more engineering focused, including its career services. I have some scholarship at the school I'm currently attending, so the cost of the EE school would be bit more until I manage to find some scholarship there. I could cut back on living expenses at the EE school, and even have to option of living at home with my parents since this university is in my home town and about 30 minutes away. Even then, I think it would still come out to be a bit more expensive.  

So my question is, will it be worth the extra debt (probably around 2 grand more per semester for tuition) to obtain the EE degree? I met with the EE department chair a couple of months ago and he told me that my EET courses would not transfer over (which is somewhat frustrating considering I might have to take a circuit analysis course, despite already 3 hours of DC and 3 hours of AC). So I might even have to go another semester to make up for sophomore EE courses missed. I should be fine on GEC and math (I've had DE, linear, and all calc). 
I was also curious if anyone had any experience with MSEE programs accepting BSEET students? I might try to get the BSEET degree here and then get into the masters program at the EE school in question. I've heard some schools will allow it but require bridge courses, which I would be fine with. BSEET and BSCET graduates from my current school that pursue a masters do a computer science masters here that seems very hardware focused. This is also an option for me. I'm not sure what kind of work I would fine with this.

I suppose my main concern is being able to find a job after I graduate. I'm a pretty solid, dedicated student. I enjoy most of the electronics course work, especially digital design and the trig involved with AC analysis. Haven't figured out which field I would like to go into though. I generally understand and enjoy the math (which is why I feel a traditional engineering degree my be better suited for me). I have a 3.6 gpa and am a lab intern for introductory electronics labs. I just read so much now days about engineers not being able to find work, which worries me. I want to go with the choice that gives me more options for employment. So if anyone has any related advice, or any experience with BSEET compared to BSEE, it would be greatly appreciated.

Having the proper background in terms of AP courses, or equal college-level work.  Having very focused academic interests and goals for your potential future.  Backing this up with work or interests outside the classroom.  Demonstrating that you are an individual thinker.

[My dad's 44. He started working in his family business at the age of 19. At some point they were the number one company in India in their industry. Recently, due to his differences between the partners (his dogmatic uncles and megalomaniac cousins\), he mustered the courage to stand up to them and split up the business. Following this, he carefully invested his share in stocks and real estate. Now he makes more money through rent and real estate speculation than he ever made in the business. Essentially, his money is basically just multiplying itself.  My father was never given the chance to make his own decisions and follow his dreams. Now he finally feels that he is free to start fresh. And he aspires to pursue an MBA at Harvard. Does he make a strong applicant?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecq8ds?context=5)|He would make a strong applicant, if he has a strong and focused plan regarding what he wants to pursue in the future, in terms of business, and how he believes an MBA will help him pursue his goals.  It's all about the narrative and story he can create and present in his essay, but age alone shouldn't deter him at all, as I have had many clients in their 40's get into the top Ivy programs.

[Perhaps some family connections and a generous donation to the university could grease the skids for him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecrv07?context=5)|Family connections do help in terms of legacy.

She married the son of a Marriott (of the hotel chain Marriott\) that was enrolled in the Harvard MBA program.  Soon after, she enrolled and graduated from Harvard.  I'm not sure how to put this, and I do not want to be rude, but the girl was not very bright.  Is entrance easier for the spouse of a concurrently enrolled student?  Or do family members of fortune 500 companies just have a easier go of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqlru?context=5)|Legacy + resources (money) + connections simply perhaps means they can hire the right people to help her say the right things to, perhaps, push her application through.  Is this ethical? No.  Does it happen?  I'm sure.  Of course, I don't know about your specific example.

I tell my students to pick something.  Everyone understands that, at this age, you can change your mind many times, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Just have a PLAN of what you MIGHT want to pursue, as schools like to see students who are focused (even if they later alter their plan or change their mind).
 |They want to see that initial focus.

I want to see that they have at least SOME work experience (and preferably 3-5+ years) and I want to see (and I ask) that they have very focused goals and a reason for pursuing their MBA now, at this particular time, that makes logical sense.
[What did your high school transcript look like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqtsj?context=5)|Interesting question.  I had straight A's, from a suburban high school, where I took all the AP classes offered.

If you are interested in extremely focused engineering though, you might be better off at MIT or Cal Tech.

Criteria that you list officially and don't. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecomml?context=5)|AP courses, 4 or 5 on the AP test in the field, and GREAT math scores on the SAT, as well as via your GPA.  Outside work in the subject also always helps, too.
[Awesome thanks. Unfortunately they don't offer AP classes in South Africa, would that be a problem?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecor73?context=5)|No, not at all, as long as you could demonstrate college-level work in your subject, even if that is something you just do and read about independently in your spare time.  They want to see that you can converse and think on a college level...before you get to college.

He decided, with his parent's, to open a day trading account and learn about the stock market via penny stocks.  It was something that made him interesting, didn't cost much at all, yet was something most high school students don't do...find something that parallels your sister's interests that she can get involved in.
[I wonder how my sister can pad her resume with tweets and Instagram photos.  Maybe something tech-related.  Or perhaps I'll convince her to start at a local community college.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecresg?context=5)|Taking classes at a community college would be great, as would perhaps trying to develop her own website or tech-related business online.

[What are your reasons for being opposed to the gap year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecqvun?context=5)|I think it possibly hints that something is wrong...that there is a reason the student couldn't or didn't want to simply continue pushing forward with very focused ambition and drive.
 |I work mainly with the top schools in the country, and it just makes me wonder why a student would even feel they ""need a break.""  I am, personally, more interested in students who are extremely competitive and push forward.
 |That said, if you are truly doing something interesting and it's fascinating, etc., I would change my opinion.  I had one student who took off for a gap year, because she was in the Olympics.
[Have you ever had any content in an application that made you laugh your ass off?

Feel sorry for a student because of their misguided attempt at an essay, also yes.
 |The funniest sentence I ever read, was from a kid whose very first sentence in his Common App read, ""I often play games where I am a very large Wizard.""  I had to actually pick up the phone and say, ""No, you cannot write about this for your Common App essay.""  It was pretty hilarious.
[What are the criteria for evaluating an admissions essay? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecoitf?context=5)|Good writing. Accomplishments that show the student's interest in the field outside of classwork, and a unique and CONFIDENT narrative.
[Serious question, hopefully I don't get a BS answer.

I paid attention to international versus domestic applicants, and that was about it.  Beyond that, for me, it was all about what was on the page (essays, scores, etc).
[Do you look for similar qualities in both grad and undergrad  applications? E.g.

Thank you for your time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1tydm3/iama_harvard_admissions_interviewer_ama/cecry7e?context=5)|Work experience and your resume is much more important for the MBA, than any undergraduate experience.

I just feel so awful for them, and without demonstrating confidence and an ability to carry an adult conversation, there is just no way I can recommend they get in.  It breaks my heart, and I try to make them more at ease and comfortable, but sometimes there is just nothing I can do.
[Have you gotten any applications from Finland? If so, why did they get in? There is no culture here of people having a bunch of extracurriculars.

I don't believe that I have worked with anyone from Finland, before, but that may be because I usually just focus my marketing in the U.S.

You could just have one, but if you do it well, and have some major, serious accomplishments in that arena, it's so much better than spreading yourself too thin.  I don't know (really, at all) but I would assume a program that has a strong computer/art foundation.  Cal Arts, on the West Coast, has a program I have heard of.  It means having an internship, at your age.  NYC is the best place in the country to get one -- just contact someone who is working in your field, even if it's just sending them a blind email, and ask if you can perhaps shadow them for a few days and/or apply for an internship, or volunteer.

1tybch,7,2013-12-29,Internship Program vs Current Good Situation,ShipOfHopes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1tybch/internship_program_vs_current_good_situation/,"Howdy!

I'm in kind of a predicament that I didn't anticipate I'd ever be in as a CS student.

Currently, I have a good thing going for me.  My current position as a student developer for my school has me leading projects, working on actually important software, and not being pigeonholed into some ""intern project"".  I interact with our client (Dept. of Transportation), I get experience with all phases of development and testing, and I get to work directly with a Senior SE nearly every day.  Additionally, I get to work with awesome people in an open space with powerful workstations that have two screens.  We have licenses for every .NET piece of software, use TFS religiously, and get to work with the latest versions of everything.  This position will, assuming I don't take another position, last until I graduate.  However, if I take another position over six months, I can't guarantee a spot for me when I get back.  My boss, the Senior SE, is well-connected in the Portland area and many students end up working for a company under his referral.

On the other hand, I'm a part of a competitive internship program.  The program I've been accepted to will *guarantee* me two six-month internships with companies in my area over the next two years.  I have no idea which companies I will intern with, nor do I have control over who picks me (aside from interview performance).  I know that internships run the gamut - some interns are just given a laptop and told to have some web application done in six months, but others get more hands-on work.  The program is well-known in the state, and most students who go through the program end up with job offers from one of the companies they worked for.  This will offset my graduation by a year.  The pay will be about $10 more per hour than my current position.

Then there's the X-factor, my life outside of school and work.  I have an amazing living situation with great roommates, a great location, cheap rent, and a whole house to live in (rather than just getting a room) with a very hands-off landlord.  I also have a girlfriend who I'd like to spend more than just weekends with.  If I left for an internship program, I'd be giving up my living situation and there would probably be some stress involved with the girlfriend, traveling over weekends, not necessarily having a wonderful place to go cycling in my free time, etc.

**TL;DR** - I have a great living situation with a great job, with the opportunity to get a better job while in school, but at the cost of my living situation and no guaranteed spot back at my old position.

What are /r/cscareerquestions' thoughts?  Could two higher-paying internships with companies in the area be worth leaving my current position and dealing with other issues?"

I am currently 19 years old, living in The Netherlands. I'm doing my degree in 'technisch informatica' at a university for applied sciences. If I had to explain my degree in english: Embedded software engineering/system programming. Everything's going pretty good with university, I'm thinking about finishing the final 1.5 years trying to graduate cum laude (with honors) but I'm not sure about that yet.

Anyways, school requires me to do 2 internships (or rather, co-ops since they take 5 months each). I'm doing my first internship as we speak at a company in The Netherlands but I'm thinking about doing my second internship in the US (the second internship is also called a graduation internship since this internship determines whether you graduate university or not). I'm wondering if there are any companies in the US willing to go through the immigration process after I'd done with the internship and graduated properly from university with a bachelors degree?

It's pretty common in The Netherlands for companies to take in the graduate internees after they're done with their internship and graduated to work for them but I wonder if this also can be applied to companies in the US. I mean I'll be basically working for the company for a good 5 months, showing my capabilities.

Would it be preferred for companies in the US to do this instead of some just-graduated kid from Europe knocking on their door asking if they have a job and are willing to go through the immigration process? Should I mention this when doing internship interviews? Is there even an immigration process at all to go through for an internee from another country?"

I'm getting to the point where I don't want to be in my home town for the coming summer, so I've been applying for various big name internships. So far, I've gotten one phone interview, which did not result in an offer.

One of the biggest problems I've found myself facing is the lack of experience. I started coding my first semester of college, while most of the friends I've made in my field at school have been doing development since the beginning of high school, if not earlier. Competing with them is obviously difficult at times.

Here is the resume I've been sending out, which I feel is fairly strong but could use improvement, so do your worst. I'd especially appreciate input from interviewers or people involved with recruitment. I do plan on replacing the snowboard instructing with a personal project that I've been working on over the holidays soon, but I'd like to get it a bit more polished before I put it on there.

I'm about to finish my masters in computer science (focus on AI) at a university in Europe and I had this idea about leaving the continent, at least for a year or so, to gather some work experience abroad. As a matter of fact I was thinking about an internship (6 months+) in an East Asian country before starting a full long-term job or maybe even a PhD.

I'm aware of the huge cultural barriers that must to be overcome for a foreigner like me but I'm confident about being able to handle these difficulties, at least for some limited time. The main obstacle might be that I don't speak any relevant language (yet) which obviously isn't the best prerequisite. Therefore an English or German environment would be a requirement.

So I'd like to ask for general advice about how and where to gather information about internships for foreigners in countries like China or South Korea. A good guess would probably be to target branches of western firms but my impression so far is that their offers are mainly restricted to their own employees. 

I'd love to hear from people who have done something similar before. Any kind of input is appreciated!

He asked for resumes from interested students, and as he was a pretty interesting guy, I also sent mine to him and we had a pretty good conversation. Long story short, he made me an internship offer, but the expected content of the internship is pretty much nothing like what was advertised up front. It is related to machine learning, which, despite being a hot topic these days, I have little interest in. Somehow I didn't realize up front that everything this company does is stuff I don't particularly care about and doesn't advance my career goals. He had said I would get to muck about with implementing a distributed system, but that's turned out to really be a marketing department tool to help analyze how well this startup is being spoken of and also get a handle on the data being processed by their clusters. 

I am not a high-level engineer. Hell, I'm not even a software engineer. Most of my coursework has been in either ECE or in computer science theory (e.g. theory of programming languages, computability, automata). While I have a very good time with systems-level things like device drivers, OS kernels, and compilers, the highest-level experience I have is writing and running configuration scripts on the cluster I'm helping build for my grad school research. I feel both as though he read me totally wrong and I am totally unsuited to the jobs he would like me to perform. In the email he sent me describing the position, he also said he couldn't have me spending my time on ""piddly shit"". Considering I'd have to start at square one as far as methods, algorithms, and even the bloody terminology in machine learning and big data are concerned, I think I'd be unwittingly stepping right into a huge *pile* of piddly shit were I to accept.

 I respect and like this guy but I have no interest in his work, do not have the skill set for it, and do not think it would help my future career in any way, shape, or form. I'm a computer science major but pretty much only because I took a bunch of theory classes and liked them. Everything I'm doing researchwise is ECE. This is very much a software internship.

tl;dr how can I decline this offer without sounding like an entitled douchebag?"

Today I received a phone call from my current employer. I just graduated with my degree a few weeks ago. Electrical Engineering. The company I was working for was a big name in the electrical engineering field and looked very good on my resume, along with other internships I had in the past. The call was to tell me that my drug test results came back and I did not pass, and therefore I was fired. 

I would give a lot more information but I am not sure what is relevant to the question but I will say that yes I did and do still smoke pot, I stopped as soon as they said I was going to take a drug test by the end of this year (I was told it would be in May so I had planned on quitting by the end of this year since it is a hair test as well). The test was 20 days from my last smoke, and using a home remedy (tide/salicylic acid/vinegar method) my hair still showed traces apparently. 

Well another important part is that I hated it there anyways. They never actually let me do what they hired me on for 8 months to do and instead gave me absolutely the most boring work I could do with my degree. On the side I did my own research there, and filed a patent with them as well. I showed them I could do more, but they kept me on this annoying project and I was just fed up with it. So this is actually a blessing in disguise I think. 

Where should I take my life now? Should I look to move and look for EE work in Germany (conversational German is good, the more technical I have issues with so might not be an option), move to California to be with a friend? Stay in the area where most of my friends and family live? 

I have been thinking about bartending, possibly side jobs in retail (I have lots of hobbies and could fill roles in many retail locations), traveling, and just trying to live freely for a bit. This is a very NOT me move. I love planning things out and having a plan. I had a plan if this occurred but holy shit it's new year's eve and I have a fresh start. 

I currently live with my parents, but I own two vehicles I can definitely remove the one from the equation for extra cash. I just sold off the few stocks I still held and applied to multiple jobs in the area as well as an old retail job I had a few years back that I quite enjoyed. 

I have no S.O so the attachments here are lifelong friends and family so traveling for good I do not see myself doing, possibly a year or two. 

I love space, I love Sci-Fi, playing instruments, microcontrollers, art, various board and card games and I have tons of hobbies besides these so I feel like I could really find a job that I would love to do (in EE field of course). I always wanted to work for NASA but know they have been cutting back greatly, Planetary Resources would be awesome but I am a fresh graduate with only 2 years of experience and most of their stuff is senior level. 

I know I can do whatever I put my mind to, I learn easily and am always curious. I feel like I have been given an opportunity here for something great. I posted here to help me see what others suggest while I go enjoy my new years with loved ones and talking to them about this as well. 

Will add more info if specifics come up and are requested. 

TLDR: Life open to me, how do I start?

A couple of summers ago I got an internship at a local ""Customer Operations Group"" for a company that runs an online service for retailers around the world. The only real mistake I made during the summer was when working with their servers, unfortunately. However, the mistake was quickly fixed and the only people that noticed it was the IT department. I now have an interview in two days for a full time job.

Basically, I'd like some more insight, or perhaps a link that can explain what happened with the issue. My terminology about servers is shakey at best, so if you could help me out there that would be great.

IIRC, on the right side of the server there are four ethernet ports to each section of the server. The first two ports essentially do the same thing; the second is for backup. I can't remember what the other two do. The left side of the server also has several groups of four ethernet ports, which I believe connect to the motherboard(?). Above the server are two boxes, I believe a switch and a SAN.

Basically, what happened is I think that instead of plugging an ethernet cable from the right side of the server to the SAN, I plugged it in to the switch, or motherboard, can't remember. It caused the server to crash, I got a call, unplugged everything and it was fine. I was super embarrassed, but no real damage was done. I recognized the mistake that I made later.

Alright, so can anyone ELI5 what happened and perhaps explain the significance of each part of a server and how they work together? I feel this is important for me to understand going into this interview.

(x-post from r/engineering),amaroq1371,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1u2pyq/lack_of_experience_making_my_job_search_difficult/,"Hey guys, I'm a recent grad (earlier this month actually), but I have no professional experience under my belt since I didn't do any internships while I was in school. This is making it hard for me to streamline my job search because I don't really know what's out there. I'm hoping someone can give me a little advice on how to get where I want to go.

A little about myself:
BS in Computer Engineering
I think I want to go into graphics or embedded systems development on the software side, but I currently don't know much about writing firmware or drivers. My dream job would probably be working at Nvidia designing/programming graphics chipsets.

The classes I most enjoyed in school were:

* Object Oriented Programming I/II -- Java
* [Systems Programming](http://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs351/assets/slides-intro.pdf) -- C
* [Computer Graphics](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~agam/cs411/information.html) -- C++
* Digital Computers and Computing -- RISC/CISC Assembly
* Computer Organization and Design -- Focus on computer design, some VHDL

I mention the firmware development position above, but how can I work towards that goal? What resources are available to me and what similar positions are out there that I can use to gain more experience. I'm not opposed to doing internships but I assume getting into one would be extremely difficult considering I've already graduated."

So far I have learned C / C++ / Javascript / PHP / HTML / CSS / Some MySql stuff. As far as concepts I have a decent understanding of polymorphism, pointers, inheritance, classes as well as web development stuff like $_GET / $_POST stuff and can make some pretty complicated php websites.

Next semester i'll only be learning some UML / C# / .NET stuff because I failed the intermediate c++ course so I can't take the Java course this semester. 

My program offers me a co-op but that is next summer, I would like to get an intern ship this summer if possible."
1u28oc,0,2013-12-30,Undergrad seeking advice - Systems Engineering,zantech,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/1u28oc/undergrad_seeking_advice_systems_engineering/,"Background:  4th year software engineering student (Canadian).  Trying to figure out what I really want to do.  

Last term I completed by Control Engineering/Theory course, I loved it.  It was mostly system modelling and finding margins or error, but it seemed like it was the first time that we as engineering students were really able to ""engineer"" something, not just cobble together a bunch of parts, but actually show that what we have designed works. 

My peers are focusing on things like games/graphics/consumer software, I have determined after some frustrating internships that these thing are not for me.  

I think that I may be interested in industrial systems and designing software to control/monitor them.  However, I am not really sure what it entails or whether it will be something I am interested in.  

I am also considering staying in school and working towards a biomedical engineering masters after I graduate from my undergrad.  I have an interest in biology and medicine.  

So...questions....
- Does having a SENG degree put me in a bad position for industrial system type jobs? (my knowledge of mechanics doesn't extend much beyond 1st year, but I am a quick study and love to learn new stuff)

- How is the job market for this kind of thing at the moment?

- Day in the life of someone who does this kind of stuff?

- Job satisfaction etc...

- If I wanted to gain some experience in this area what can I do?  So far in software engineering I have been able just sit down and code an application or learn a new language if I want to gain some experience, however I am not sure this approach would work with large industrial system. 
Thanks
