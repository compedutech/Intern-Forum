r6243n,1,2021-11-30,"About to graduate with a finance degree (decent GPA) and don’t want to go into the field, thinking of doing computer science",shantzybear,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r6243n/about_to_graduate_with_a_finance_degree_decent/,"Hey y’all. I’m about to graduate, and I’ve been really regretting my degree choice, not that I haven’t enjoyed it, I just don’t see myself enjoying working in a soul sucking finance position, and have been really considering doing computer science. I enjoy math, my highest grades were always the math-heavy finance classes and had a lot of fun and did well in the few IT classes I took in business which were basic but did some C++ and python stuff. I didn’t do any crazy banking internships but I did do a summer co-op with a large pipeline company and left the summer with a solid recommendation from all my superiors, and was given more responsibilities than the other co-op students, so I have some formal experience. I also worked as an analyst in our schools investment fund, and as a fallback I’m writing my CFA level 1 this spring.

I just don’t see a future for myself in finance beyond a few years, it’s such a competitive industry and I also think that my job security going forward may be a little more guaranteed or at least I will develop more useful and valuable skills in CS that will have much more use in 10-20 years than my finance skills. 

If anyone has any input to help me out, I would really appreciate it as I have little to no industry connections or people I could ask about CS stuff."
r62cbu,1,2021-11-30,How to tell the boss of my unpaid internship that I can't work full-time anymore so I can get a part-time job?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/r62cbu/how_to_tell_the_boss_of_my_unpaid_internship_that/,"I'm a 23 year old female that graduated university a little less than a year ago. I started a new internship this month working at a research hospital. I'm very happy about this, as it was a rare opportunity to do work in my field with little office experience. However, the internship is unpaid. My boss said that if I do really well in my first few months, he may consider giving me a stipend, and if I do really well during the entire duration of the internship (6 months), there may be an opportunity for a full-time paid position at the end. Because of the potential job opportunity especially, I want to show my boss that I'm a hard worker who really wants the job (which I genuinely do). This has made me feel like I need to work 9-5 and during the weekends on the project I was given just to prove myself (I was never given a clear answer on the expectation for how many hours I'm supposed to work during the week).

That being said, the bills don't stop just because I have this opportunity so I need time to work at a paid job. I want to tell my boss I'd like to work 3 or 4 days a week on the internship so I have time to work at a part-time job, but I don't want to seem like I'm slacking. How do I word an email to my boss telling him I really want to work full-time at this internship, but I need more time in my schedule to make money to pay for my bills?"

r62u0z,9,2021-11-30,Working for a live performance venue...long (sorry! I am...old.),Ms-Park,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r62u0z/working_for_a_live_performance_venuelong_sorry_i/,"I love this subreddit. It is heartening &amp; enlightening to see ppl sharing, commiserating &amp; giving each other compassionate advice &amp; having a grim laugh at the very least.

I read peoples stories &amp; want to say to everyone, ""no cutie, it AIN'T you. Your lil' no power or influence or livable wage having self, is NOT now nor will it ever be, ""the problem"". ""

I wanted to tell you all that I was the bookkeeper for 2 music venues (1 that recently closed) &amp; a music festival, on the west coast.  I took the job, w/HALF the pay of my predecessor (I didn't find this out til later.) &amp; after the GM had been removed from her position by the venue's owners, for rampant employee abuse, drug use &amp; ""misappropriation"" of funds. The former GM is of course, lauded and given ample PR about ""stepping down to pursue different options"", w/zero mention of her being mandatorily put in 30 day rehab, emerging from the rehab entirely unapologetic &amp; unrepentant &amp; promising to be the same shitfuck she's always been &amp; then the owners buying out her shares in the venue &amp; removing here from her position for her chemical dependency, erratic behavior, theft &amp; abuse of staff. 

(I do not care abt. ppl doing drugs. Do them, have fun &amp; be safe! When the GM says yer being able to take PTO is dependent upon you getting  her drugs on yer vaca, THAT is a problem.)

While trying to do my effing job, I did HR, bookkeeping, payroll, AR/AP, paid all the performers &amp; did another set of secret, unreported books for a large yearly music festival that was an entire legalized money laundering scheme &amp; ""philanthropic PR"" for a prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalist family of entire fuckwits.

Was trying to clean up the books. They were a hot mess of fiction, for the most part, covering for the GM's &amp; former management staff's, wholesale embezzlement.

On my 3rd day, one of the much beloved Bar Managers, dropped dead, while out walking their dog.

This prompted me to look into, what benefits their spouse was entitled to, if any &amp; if there was any back owed wages, etc. Normal HR shit that happens upon finding out a staff member is deceased.

This particular city, had an Ordinance that provided, basically, a health care savings account, that employers were required to pay into, on a quarterly basis.

The deceased staff member, had an account balance of, at least $5K, which I thought their spouse would be entitled to collect , if only to pay for expenses related to the decedents death.

This opened a huge can of worms. The Ordinance required that folks receiving money from their employer, to sign up via their web portal to ""claim"" the funds. Folks that did not sign up, LOST their money, it went to a general fund account, for the County.

The Bar Manager who died, had NOT created an account w/the County. So their $5k+ went to the County.

The County said the onus of educating staff about how to access their money, was on the Employer. The Employer, said the onus of educating staff about how to access their money, was on the County.

In short, none of the staff had received any information or training about how to access or claim their money and as a result, upwards of $50k+ went to the County's general funds account.  This is, imho, legalized, theft from employee's health savings.

The County had send out mass mailings to all County residents. Those who did recall seeing those mailers, said they thought they were bills/invoices for back-owed taxes from the County and/or junk mail &amp; threw them away.

The venue, did no training, did not advise staff that this money was being paid in &amp; set aside for their medical expenses. Nor did the venue advise staff of their accrued PTO/Sick pay. In fact, the prior abusive, awful GM, had denied that staff had PTO, refused to let staff utilize it &amp; refused to pay people, their accrued PTO for time taken off. One manager had an outbreak of shingles, on his face &amp; the GM refused allow them to take their accrued PTO and did not advise them of their healthcare savings acct.

Upon figuring all this out, I went to the acting GM's for advice &amp; they said not to tell staff about any of these benefits open to them. They told me to shut up. I didn't, because it is a violation of labor laws to, ""shut up"".  Fuck them, btw. Boot licking scum.  (One still works there.)

I arranged for a training to be held by the County at the venue. It was not mandatory &amp; the County staff, was there to sign ppl up to claim their benefits. It was poorly attended. Not even 1/3 of the staff members showed up. People have lives. I did, want the managerial staff to either assist folks in signing up and/or direct them to me &amp; I'd help ppl sign up. That was the most I could do &amp; it did not feel like enough, because, most of the $ that the venue had paid into this program, was already gone to the County's ""general funds"" aka ""expired"", simply because employees were unaware of how to claim this benefit.

In chatting w/staff, I found that many did not care about any benefits. They were happy to work for minimum wage, which they took to be in trade for the 'family meal' before shift &amp; attending shows at the venue for free. NO. THAT IS A GIVEN. That is the minimum one should reasonably expect from working in a venue, not something to 'trade' for shittier pay, shitty working conditions &amp; rampant abuse, wage theft &amp; flaunting labor laws.

The venue was also cited &amp; fined for non-payment of overtime wages, prior to my being hired.

The venue was still getting away w/non-payment of OT wages. They used, ""departmental codes"".

EX: Staff person A worked 6 hrs in Dept 001 and 6 hrs in Dept 004. Which meant they were paid for 12 hours, at their regular hourly rate. IN REALITY, they should of been paid, 8 hour regular and 4 hours at the overtime rate of 1.5(time and a half.)

JSYK, use of 'departmental codes' as a way to avoid paying overtime is fucking illegal. Not to mention, entirely fucking douchey, esp. when the biz owners are fucking billionaires.

I paid people their overtime. Period. The acting GM's didn't know, coz they didn't know how to run payroll &amp; were entirely ignorant of labor laws &amp; I repeatedly stated I would not break the law for them, coz it was my ass, if the venue were to be reported.

Did I mention the venues &amp; festival are owned by a ""consortium of fucking venture capitalist, inherited wealth, never missed a meal, billion/millionaires""? ( I don't hate the wealthy. I hate what they aren't doing with it &amp; I hate how they fuck over workers as easily as they fucking breathe, in order to maintain their shitty wealth, status, power &amp; class vs. just being decent humans.)

Whatever, fine I TCB and the acting GM's are entirely unaware. People take days off, get paid their PTO, etc.

In the meantime, I have to meet with these clueless consultants. The owners have hired one of the owner's sons, friends, to consult on how to run the biz more ""efficiently"" aka ""cut staff &amp; keep more revenues for greedy people who have more money than they can spend in their entire families lifetime.""

And I'm paying these douchebros $5000+expenses every 2 weeks. Expenses = staying at 5 star hotels &amp; Michelin rated ""biz dinners"".  Like that's standard, legalized crony corruption &amp; this spot, wasn't the only spot that does it, ime as a bookkeeper.

They proposed only staffing w/1099 employees. Hiring catering companies for every event vs. having paid staff. I said that was not a good idea, because, duh, it's fucking not.

I had to meet w/one of the consortium's billionaire partners, some founder of the 1st online media PR firm &amp; he's total douchebag, (who now works for...L\*veN@tion) bragged about ""beating"" a sexual harassment suit, when he was the CEO of the company he founded. I don't know why he felt the need to brag , odd flex. To this day, I do not know why I had to meet w/this bootlicking fuckwit.

And these consultants &amp; the owners are actively recruiting for a new GM, to replace the one they removed.

They hire a band manager, from some shitty SKA band &amp; pay this pasty no experience having douchebag 2x my salary.

(sidenote: I fucking hate hawt topic 90's ska. Hate it. It's fucking reggae dancehall appropriated by frat douchebros &amp; so is the ""indy"" record co. that host most of these pasty turd bands. They can get bent x5ever.)

I quit on his first day. No 2 weeks. Fuck you bai.

I filed a complaint w/the DOL re: salary discrimination. Case was not pursued by DoL. Whatever, the DoL is pretty useless, I did it , so there was at least, record of my complaint.

I reported them to the County for violation of labor laws &amp; ordinances. The venue was subsequently assessed a fine. AND this consortium of fucking billion/millionaires, closed the venue, rather than pay the fines &amp; back-owed wages. They still own another venue w/the ska band manager GM. &amp; yes the PR around the venue closing was, over COVID. Not the refusal of filthy fucking rich people to adhere to labor laws.

The management entirely slandered my name, said I withheld login/pw info &amp; stole money etc. I didn't. Login/pw info was in a notebook, next to my computer &amp; I trained in another staff member on how to run payroll, and did not steal anything. LMAO.

I'm sorry for the staff that no longer has a job coz this spot closed. It wasn't my intention, I simply thought you all deserved the full benefits of your wage &amp; labor rights &amp; that you shouldn't of been taken advantage of, by greedy, shitty fuckers. Coz, fuck them.

Other notable fuckshittery:

The fucking dipshit private event booker (also friends w/aforementioned ska record label shitlords) allowed a fucking racist, anti-gay, misogynist, fundamentalist church to rent the venue, during a pro-life protest weekend and half the staff walked off their shift.

Fucking J3ll0 aka 'puddin' Bi@fr@, would crash punk shows, get onstage &amp; talk about himself, taking up the performers time. He's a raging a-hole narcissist who steals labor from ""unpaid interns"". Don't work for his co. See also, was tight w/the removed GM &amp; didn't call her out on her shit &amp; professes to be some kind of old skool godfather o' punk rock. Fuck that guy. Ew.

There are no booker's anymore. They are contracted w/A3G. All their shitty shows are shitty A3G performers. &amp; A3G is owned by one rich, white, shitty, anti-gay, fundie xtian conservative piece o shit.

Some shitty utube boyband, stole all the towels &amp; trashed the dressing room. Their performance was lipsyncing their ONE hit &amp; they made tweens parents pay $250+ for an ""afterparty"", where they dj'd using a mac.Some country performer was booked and the yt suburban fans started a brawl w/the Latino fans, before the show even opened. Coz country music is only fer yt people or some bullshit. A dozen dipshits 86'd an hour after doors opened, coz they just couldn't be civil &amp; keep their racism to themselves. Who gets mad that their preferred artist/performer reaches a broader audience?

The same consortium of rich aholes also funded a yearly music festival. The festival's founder, a rapacious venture capitalist, &amp; W3lls F@rgo descendant, who got moar rich via orchestrating tech IPO's , bragged about getting a notable anti-corporate/anti-capitalist folk singer to perform.  A super shitty flex, imho. 

The money for the festival was laundered via the county parks n rec board. I kept a separate set of books and none of the vendors was ever 1099'd and they were all cronies of either the venue's GM, or the bazillionaire's family/friends. But everyone loves it &amp; I'm an asshole : D

Thank you for reading my epic way too long rant &amp; I want everyone at minimum, to know their labor rights, unionize and/or form/collectives &amp; co-ops. Share your pay info w/your co-workers &amp; advocate for one another and I am of the  opinion that we are long overdue for a global strike."

Currently I’m a 22(M) living with my girlfriend 21(F) and I’ve hit a bit of a rough patch in overall life. I’m currently enrolled in university, and I’m a fifth year student as a computer engineering technology student. I’ve switched majors twice now, and I’m doing so have pushed back any hope of graduation for close to two years now. The issue with uni is that I’m currently struggling with PTSD, major depressive disorder, as well as severe anxiety. Thankfully for that, I’m currently seeing a psychiatrist, but this last year I’ve been constantly working on finding the correct cocktail of drugs to help return to neuronormative capabilities. 

That adds to the stress because, I’m struggling with being able to function, and any discipline I had is gone, motivation is long gone, and I’m also working an internship that requires my enrollment in school. Due to how long I’ve been struggling, (failing calc I once, and failing calc II three times) I am feeling like a break may be warranted to focus on getting this med change in order, and being able to mentally reset. My overall efficacy has nose dived since Covid hit, and I went from a 3.0-3.5 student to a 2.0 student maybe.

Today brought about the biggest change of all, when I sat down to discuss the future of my internship with my boss. Which concluded with him telling that the amount of time I’ve been spending at work doesn’t add up to the low amount of output, and that essentially if I’m not I’m school I will be let go.

I’m waiting to hear back from the big boss who ultimately has final say. And all I can think is it’s pretty grim. Part of all this pressure culminating is further exacerbated by the fact that in trying to find the right set of meds, my anxiety has sky rocketed and I find myself being so restless that I’m lucky to get maybe a couple of hours of sleep a night. 

Furthermore while I’m not truly suicidal, my depression has formed very strong opinions that are difficult to continue to fight every day. I want to live, and that keeps me here each day.

I’m at a loss really, because I don’t feel like I have the strength to finish school at this juncture, and I find it nearly impossible to find a comparable job that would hire me due to not having a degree.

Any advice would be helpful, and guidance, because I’m really lost. Money is tight. And I feel like if I can’t find a similar paying job, I won’t be able to support my half of our current expenditures. (Rent, internet, utils) 

Thankfully my parents are both incredibly understanding with mental health so that’s one less worry right now. But they definitely don’t have the money to also support myself and my girlfriend, and I don’t want to put that on them.

I apologize for the length of the post, and genuinely thank you for anyone who has read this far."

But now, due to bad circumstances, expensive tuition may not be in the budget. 

Thought I had plenty of time to get my 4 year and some internships planned out, but now, as I may just be getting an Associate’s, I’m not sure where I should be looking to as far as careers. And I don’t think college has prepared me at all for a job in computer science, as I just know object-oriented programming languages. 

What certifications should I look to get in the next 6 months to prepare me for getting a career in a programming or tech-related field. Is a certificate in C++ or some other object oriented programming language a good idea? Or look to something like OpenJS certification? I know they’re all specific to the job, but which one might be the best bet for applications?"

I found this field my senior year in highschool and started a low level position collecting soil samples and fell in love with the technology, map development and reading and the outdoor work. I developed passion for agriculture and the equipment and technology surrounding it.

However now I’m not sure if I’ll even be able to graduate. My first semester of college I tried to work around 20 hours a week but after horrendous grades I quickly discovered I need to devote more time to school and took a leave of absence from my job. Second semester was much better academically. This was partially because of time off from work but also because of more classes doing hands on work similar to me job. But I was in poor shape mental health wise I noticed I was drinking a lot, friends noticed me distancing myself and I felt useless not having a job. I was so ready to be out of school and back to work I left without doing vital paperwork for an internship which will most likely delay my graduation and put me on academic probation. Now I am in my third semester and I can barely function with out drinking excessively. I am struggling to find motivation for anyone or anything.

1. They prefer to work from around 1am to 4pm daily (they are based in the same time zone as me). I’m all for setting your own hours but I feel like some of the mentoring/feedback gets lost when they are working alone in the middle of the night and can’t ask me questions.

2. I’m observing that they tend to rush to get things “done”, with errors, instead of doing things right all the time.

3. Low attention to detail.

I feel like the answer is to have a feedback conversation with them, and so far the feedback I’ve given them has been very positive, so this will be more of a development conversation.

I know that personal projects are also considered when applying for internships but I haven't done one yet due to a complete lack of motivation and burnout. I've heard that grades matter as much as personal projects when you apply for your first internship, and arguably even more, since you technically don't have any experience in the industry.

I'm seeing my friends applying left and right for internships, some of them already received offers and everything. I don't want to wait again for next year since I took last year off to recover from the shitshow that was online, but I feel like if I don't get enough experience then I'll be stuck in limbo after graduating.

Last week I got in contact with a senior employee at a very prestigious and well known company, and he offered me an interview for a very good internship. The conversation ended with him saying he would email me with confirmation of the interview for a week from now.

Naturally I was very excited and eagerly checked my email, but received nothing. After waiting a few days I got in contact again asking for confirmation and got no response. I then asked again a few days later and nothing.

Today is now the day of the supposed interview and... nothing. I'm very irritated for a lot of reasons, including that I booked the whole day off work because I wasn't sure what time the interview would happen, and that my hopes were raised up.

Is there anything at all I can do? Can I message the companies HR explaining what happened? Will that actually help me with my employment chances? Can I talk to some of his colleagues instead? The company is big but this particular team is very small and I wouldn't to make myself seem like a ""problem"" employee or anything.

But I also hope that if I contact HR they'd give me a ""make up"" interview.

Any help would be gratefully appreciated as its a very very good opportunity.

Thank you :)"
r6d0q7,12,2021-12-01,I want to drop out of architecture school. Help?,ughuni,CollegeRant,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/r6d0q7/i_want_to_drop_out_of_architecture_school_help/,"edit: thank you all for replying!! i’ve decided to drop out and do computer science since i enjoyed it in high school, and while my parents aren’t happy about it, they’re supportive and agree that ultimately it’s my future, and they’ll pay for my tuition as much as they can. 
i also wanted to note that i came into architecture pretty blind knowing nothing about the amount of commitment needed, and i genuinely don’t think i can do this for four more years.

I’m currently a third semester architecture student and i’ve given up. 

Choosing architecture was my own decision since I wanted a fun(?) degree but the college I study in isn’t my favourite. My parents actually applied here for me and I only got to know the day I got admission. I said yes to the college because the tuition fee is super cheap, it’s a highly reputed college and I would get a placement 100% and I didn’t really have a backup plan if i rejected it either. 

My classes have been online for the past two semesters and they started regular classes last month. I couldn’t take the workload and frankly unrealistic deadlines and begged my parents to let me drop out since the end of first semester. They pacified me for a while saying that it could get better and it’s only hard because it’s online and I agreed. 

This past month has been hell for me. The professors don’t teach anything that i think is essential (like how to make a plan or design your space), and I have to google every aspect of designing. They’re even stricter with the deadlines and don’t explain our assignments prior, and we’ll have to redo them every single time. 

On top of that we have to take on extra work for competitions every month (which the professors will not help with at all) if we want to even apply for internships. Side note, these competitions are part of the syllabus for other architecture colleges while it’s not part of ours, and the professors don’t grant us deadline extensions. 

I applied to another university for another major without my parents knowing and I got in, but the tuition fee itself is around 8x what I’m paying now. Then there’s admission, transport and other charges that add up. I feel really guilty about asking my parents but I want to change majors so bad. 

I had planned to take up jobs and help pay but I still feel I wouldn’t be able to contribute to much. I also don’t know much about student loans so I’m a bit skeptical about them. 

So, thoughts? Am I being lazy and irresponsible with work and this is what all architecture majors go through or am I reasonable in wanting to drop out? 

Also some help on how I could earn money? 

TL;DR - I want to drop out of architecture school with cheap tuition fee to change to another major with high fees."

r6i9rw,45,2021-12-01,Why tf are american unis so fkn expensive??,unavailabelle,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/r6i9rw/why_tf_are_american_unis_so_fkn_expensive/,"I've been mostly looking at canadian unis so far and I've just started looking for a few American unis to apply to. And MY GOD THEY'RE GONNA COST ME AN ARM AND A LEG. How do people afford so much tuition? Are scholarships that readily given to students? How does it even work like? As a middle class indian whose annual family income is around 10000 USD, it baffles me how expensive the tuition is? It breaks my heart that quality education for international students is so inaccessible. And i'm pretty sure there are several others like me. I'M LIVID! 

Ps: it'd be great if y'all could help me pick American unis based on my (okay-ish) profile. I'm applying for Master's in CS (through project or course work). My CS undergrad  gpa is on the lower side of the spectrum (3.1). However, I've done shit load of extracurricular stuff, some volunteering, a data analysis internship and 4 CS projects. I'm looking for good unis that I could get into based on my profile, that are also affordable (30-40k USD for two years). Thanks in advance.  :)"
r6igkm,6,2021-12-01,"Company actively says they need and value me, but I'm getting mixed signals and it's overwhelming me",aizhana,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/r6igkm/company_actively_says_they_need_and_value_me_but/,"I \[27F\] have been working for my current company since 2017. I’m a multimedia editor, meaning I work with everything online be it shooting or editing videos, animations, and photos as well as writing copy. I also work as a Web/UI designer, which is my favorite part of the job. I started out as an intern through my University, got hired with a pretty good contract at the time, taught myself everything I do now and eventually dropped out of my uni degree (which I was already struggling with since it was in a completely different field I did not like) and focused 100% on my job. Over the past few years I’ve had to deal with my own Imposter Syndrome (I suppose dropping out only made it worse) and took up many courses to learn more and do better.

My supervisor has been telling interns I’m a “genius” and that I can do anything, and I’ve been told she exploded during a meeting with higher-ups a few months ago when someone hinted they could ask for my help - saying that I was doing too much, that I’m too valuable for the company and that they can’t afford to lose me. That if only I tried I’d have a queue of recruiters knocking at my door soon enough. I’ve had the Director of Marketing calling me up in his office and basically telling me I could work with any department I wanted to, that multiple people had been asking to work with me.

At the same time, there have been multiple occurrences when I’ve felt like my work and input wasn’t valued by managers (who have never been in the designing/editing field), as if they assumed they knew more and that my job wasn’t exactly thought-out or that their personal preferences were more important than my research and knowledge simply because they’re in a higher position, or that they’re the only ones who can have a saying in scheduling deadlines (usually at the last minute) even though they don’t actually know how much time a task takes. I’ve also worked hard on difficult motion graphics projects with a strict deadline only to never actually see it go live - whereas a video shot in 2 minutes and edited via TikTok by an intern was turned into a paid ad right away.

I feel like they take creative work like something you can tweak to your liking and that doesn’t have any special meaning, and I’m merely the person who knows how to use the software they don’t. As a result, I’ve been ending up going over any single project multiple times to the point where I just give up and feel sick with the end product AND feel sick with myself because I “care too much” in doing a good job when managers don’t seem to mind anyway. HR administration is even worse and it’s basically like it’s not even there.

Cherry on top - even though life is kinda cheaper in my country than compared to the US - I get paid the equivalent of 13$/h.  


I really don’t know what to do and what to think, I’m getting mixed signals and I’m overwhelmed by this. It’s like they have huge expectations in me, but don’t actually care about what I do or think anyway.

In the meantime, I just stress myself out daily because my decrease in motivation obviously meddled with my productivity. My mental health is not the best either, so I always end up doubting myself and my actual skills, probably taking everything more personal than needed and thinking about it 24/7, thus never actually getting and “mind rest” from my job. I’d like to update my portfolio and look for new opportunities, but that takes energy I currently can’t find and, more importantly, makes me clash with my ever-present self-doubt. 

Am I just overreacting? Is there anything you would advise me to do to try and improve this situation?"

r6iwca,3,2021-12-01,Does an 1 year fail in MBA tier 1 college have any decent career opportunities?,Educational_Action66,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/r6iwca/does_an_1_year_fail_in_mba_tier_1_college_have/,"First of all about me.
B tech: NIT (relatively newer) 2018 passed, 6.5 gpa, 
No experience, Joined MBA in 2020 batch. So 2 years gap. 

I come from weak financial background and am barely managing my expenses. Getting a good paying job is extremely important to me because my parents medical bills, student loans and taking care of home after father's retirement. 

So I'm studying in an MBA tier 1 college and due to certain circumstances I didn't appear for one of my final exam papers which would mean that I will have to give the exam next year and will receive my degree an year later.

Now usually it being a tier 1 college, usually there's not much problem for getting jobs as companies come and hire during placements period.

But me being a year back, and my resume barely getting shortlisted for 1st year internships, I am really worried and under tremendous stress if I will get a decent enough job or not. So I wanna ask if it will be possible to get a good job for me, an year back, either on campus or off campus when I have no industry experience? 

I am really scared that I won't, Plus everyone of my friends and relatives are expecting a good job from me given that I'm in a tier 1 college. And all that pressure is pushing me further and further into depression. I was already mildly depressed due to certain circumstances when I had started my MBA college and its the depression that led me to not giving the exam. And now after failing due to not appearing for the exam I'm at a stage where I can't sleep at night, I feel heavy feeling in my heart constantly, I'm unable to eat properly or even get any motivation to do anything. I wake up at around 4 am, barely getting 2 hours of sleep and yet I stay in bed till like 11am - 12 noon after which I barely down my breakfast. I even have certain health issues but I don't have any time to even worry about that. 

Now I know some people may think that this is a joke, and that after getting in a MBA tier 1 college getting a job is easy. But the truth is idk. I have no idea. I have no one to talk to that's why I turned to reddit. I don't have many friends, all my life I've been at home and in a very isolated environment so I literally have no idea how the job market works and what's the opportunities available. I can't sleep worrying about it every day. 

Tl;dr - MBA tier 1 college student, failed 1 year. Dire need of money. Any scope of getting a good job after one year delay through on/off campus placement?"

I'm now 22, almost 23, and I'm not sure I actually want to go through another 60 years.

I started my career about 5 months ago as a software engineer, I did 24 weeks at the same company before that.

Since I started my internship, all I've been doing is worry about the pathetic amount of things I've got done because of my lack of concentration and ability to reach out for help when I'm stuck. (I'm pretty sure I had concentration issues since I was a kid).I had some kind of breakdown at work 2 weeks ago where I just spend the 2 last hours of my day fucking crying or looking at my screen, so the day after I talked about that to one of my coworker and seeked a psychologist.

When my day is over, I watch a movie or a show on netflix, or I go to the gym, or I try to get things done (phone-call, cleaning up, tidy things up, ...) and fail at doing that.

I think I used to be averagely happy in college, maybe slightly below average I don't know ... I've never been that guy with a massive smile nor have I ever had a girlfriend/boyfriend.

I always had intrusive thoughts like some cringe memory slapping me in the face or some sexual stuff and sometimes suicidal thoughts that actually meant nothing to me ... Except now the suicidal thoughts kinda start to mean something and they don't bother as much ...

Nodody know about the fact that life does not satisfy me.

I guess I'm gonna tell my psychologist (2 sessions late) about that little detail.

Today I spent around 3 hours doing nothing because I just had some kind of mental crisis out of nowhere ... Nothing was out of the ordinary, I had a respectable pace with work and everything.I don't know, I just spiraled from a cringe event to a lot of shit and ended up there.

I'm seeing my psychologist tomorrow, I hope I'll get some guidance on that ..."

r6l00w,1,2021-12-01,Can't decide between two job offers,basicpreset,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r6l00w/cant_decide_between_two_job_offers/,"Hi all,

I am a 22 year old student, currently working at a big tech company as a software engineer intern. I've been here for the past 6 months, working in C# on a legacy product. On the side I work on a project of mine which is built using more modern concepts and technology.

Recently I got a full-time job offer from a smaller company (could call it a start-up) to work on multi tier cloud applications (.NET Core, AWS services, cutting edge tech and projects from scratch), which is much more interesting for me than my current job (a monolith, no new projects, old tech, etc), plus my project is built exactly on the same stack and I would really benefit from learning that stuff from work and not having to learn it on the side.

Today I told my manager I am accepting the offer and within two hours they offered me a full-time job aswell.

I am in a tough spot because even though the new job would seem as a better fit for me career wise, other factors are not as good.

**Current job**

Pros:

* More pay
* Nice people, used to environment
* Fully remote, with the option to go in the office whenever I prefer
* A lot more freetime (some days there are just no tasks)

Cons:

* Legacy, monolith product
* Outdated tech, doesn't really interest me

**New job offer:**

Pros:

* Tech stack is exactly what I'm interested in, could benefit my side project
* New projects every few months from scratch
* Working on a mac (which I prefer)

Cons:

* Only 1 HO/week
* No reserved parking spot, makes commuting hell
* More work hours, people leaving between 5-7 (they told me they are not your typical cushy 9-5 job)
* Less pay
* People seem a bit more rigid, but that just may be because I'm used to my current environment

I am completely clueless as to what should I choose, I would really appreciate some tips!

Thanks in advance!"

I’ve been working tier 1 desktop support since June of this year and I’m
expecting to graduate with my B.S. in Cybersecurity this upcoming May. The job is decent since I work remotely and get off at 4pm but it’s honestly mind numbingly boring. We have a pretty heavy call volume in the first half of the week which usually results in 8 hours of back-to-back calls but they’re almost always issues with MS Office/licensing, password/AD/IAM Access, VDI, or Avaya soft-phone issues. 

I’ve learned a lot in my short time here, but I’m really itching for something more. I was told when I converted from a contractor to an associate that I would be receiving a raise, but the raise was less than a dollar (which I know is more than most get, but still disappointing since they relied so heavily on that “bonus” during training). I’m studying for my Security+ right now and want to work in security, but I’m also a bit lost on how to get my foot in the door there as well. I do not currently have any certs or internship experience. I see all of these posts with people being stuck in a help desk position even though they have many certs and it makes me nervous because I do not want to be in this role for longer than I absolutely need to. When would you say is a good time to cut my losses and move up from this position or branch out into my intended career? Any guidance is definitely appreciated, thanks!"
r6mo27,3,2021-12-01,"7 years experience, but haven't been at a company more than 3 years. Should I try to stick around?",pixelblue1,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/r6mo27/7_years_experience_but_havent_been_at_a_company/,"As the title says, I've been working for 7 years now.  First job was around 1 year 2 months, after which I left for a much needed pay raise - $15/hr intern pay to $40/hr overnight in a HCOL city.

Next job was almost 4 years - but with a 6 month leave of absence to do a contract between project cycles, and another short break.  So more like 3 years continuous.

Followed that with a contract that allowed me to relocate for 5 months.  Then accepted a full time position where I've been for 2 years.

Job switching is common in my industry.  But now that I'm in my 30s, I'm getting concerned about hopping too much, and want to try to establish myself somewhere.

Overall, I've worked at 5 companies in 7 years.  2 short term, 3 longer term(1-2 years+).

I have an offer for another contract position at a significant pay bump : 20%.  It's a 10 month contract, similar benefits.  It's unlikely that it would extend beyond that, but not impossible.  
Would you advise trying to take this contract for the pay bump, or should I try to go to my current employer and bargain for a raise?  I feel very stagnant at my current company in my current role, and am concerned even if I do stay I'll never advance.  But the new company I'm looking at moving to has a reputation for cycling through employees quickly, rarely keeping anyone long term."

Here in Greece after finishing all your semesters in college  and passing all of your classes (I don't know if they are called classes or subjects ) you have to do a semester of internship at a place that does what you studied. If you work 8 hours , you need 6 months and if you do 6 work hours then it's 8 months , I chose the first option , to finish quickly. 

Here in Greece the company or your, boss does not have to pay you in order to hire you for your internship

After lots of searching I found a company doing exactly what I want to do , and I was so happy when the boss called me to tell me that I am hired! The first couple of months were great , the atmosphere was superb , the place was great and I was sure that after my internship I would want to stay 100% .

The boss told me that I would get the money for every project I finish in full , I have finished 5 of them , that are priced over 3k each , and I only got 250€ from all of them . He keeps saying more money  are coming and that he is going to pay me  , but he never does.

I do everything because its a small company . the boss leaves around 13:00 and then I am alone , he can see what I am doing from the cameras, so I can't do whatever I want,  when I tell him the problems of the projects he does not let me to fix them , and the next day he complains about the problems even though I told him , and when I tell him my ideas for a fix , he ignores me , tries his way , fails and then does my way and says I am lucky ,or says that he found the fix . I have done excellent work , I don't want to brag but the things I have done many other students would fail to do and he never says to me good job or nice work, he has got a lot of money because of my projects and my work , I don't want all the money but I want some help 
Because I can't survive

I am starting to get angry because I work for free , and he does not even help me . I hoped to at least get money for gas , but not even that , I have tried so hard to do everything as good as possible , even working on weekend's at home . I don't have the guts to tell him that I want some money , and I can't tell him that he is mean to me so I am thinking that after my internship I don't renew my contract and go find another place to work ! The last five months I have 0 income I don't even have money for food anymore , I can't keep working for free. What should I do ??"

r6q436,2,2021-12-01,"Finance Major, Accounting Experience, Interested in Technology. Advice on next steps?",yeah_dat_way,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/r6q436/finance_major_accounting_experience_interested_in/," 

Hi All,

I graduated in May of 2020 with a finance degree and have been working my first full time position at my current PE firm as a staff accountant for a little over the past year now. Overall, I find the work to be unrewarding and I don’t see a future at the company. I’ve looked internally for positions that are more geared towards finance, however, I believe I’ve come to the conclusion that maybe the private equity space is not something I’m interested in, if I’m not on a sought after deal team. Considering my resume, that does not seem plausible at this point unless I went for my MBA, and even then could be a stretch. My past internship experience was a controller at another large bank. I feel my resume looks pretty good on paper with some big company names supporting me. My limited finance experience has been working as a controller for an internship, as well as the way a PE firm operates. And in accounting, I have a year’s worth of fund accounting experience.

What I’m unsure about is what type of role I should look into next. Recently I’ve started to become more and more interested in the technology space. I’m pretty technologically inclined and feel like I can learn the different technologies fairly fast. I see technology such as blockchain, AI, cloud computing, machine learning, etc. as the future of business as many of these items will be implemented into existing businesses in the future if they haven’t already. I don’t have any software engineer skills, however I’m confident in my ability to learn them would it be required for a role. Would anyone have any recommendations for potential lines of work or skills that I should look into?

Some potential roles that I’ve thought about from a finance/accounting perspective has been an investment analyst, commercial or corporate banking, consulting, or real estate. I also haven’t crossed out the potential for something a little more sales/relationship based, as I’m fairly comfortable talking to people and if anything would allow me to grow professionally even more. Is there a cross over that I’m unaware of that would combine my finance major, accounting experience and interest in technology?

TL;DR. I’m a recent graduate with a finance major, accounting work experience, and with an interest in technology. Are there any paths for which my experience and interests would align?"
r6rqyq,1,2021-12-01,Chance me for Stanford MSCS,monal_m,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/r6rqyq/chance_me_for_stanford_mscs/,"I'll be applying next year(2022) for a part-time MSCS, I'll be graduating in Spring of 2022. Here are my stats:

Undergrad College = Purdue University (Bachelors in Computer Science) (Purdue has extreme grade deflation, top 3% of students have GPA of 3.95 or higher, 4 year graduation rate is about 50% iirc)

GPA = 4.0GRE = 327 (Q = 168, V = 159) Will be retaking to make it 335+ over the next year.

Extra curricular = TA positions, I taught a for-credit course to a group of 40 students (a student-run course), Active in some clubs (no leadership positions).  Will be joining Microsoft full time after graduating.

Research = Researching with 2 professors, published a paper under one.

Ethnicity = International Indian.

LOR = I interned at Microsoft the past summer and will be coming back to the same team, manager LOR will be very positive. 2 more LOR from professors, will be above average.

Some more extra stuff = Will be graduating in 3 years instead of 4. Had 2 internships at reputable companies. Took a very heavy CS-focused course-load, degree required 12 CS courses to graduate, I will have taken 20 CS courses by the time I graduate

In order to increase my chances, what would you recommend me to do? I've emailed professors from Stanford in order to do research with them and am hoping this will help. I'll be joining Microsoft in the Mountain View, CA campus (chose this as I would like to be near the Stanford campus), so maybe this could help me in meeting with professors? I'm also hoping to start a club next semester for leadership experience as I have none so far.

Note: Will only be applying to Stanford, it's been a childhood dream."

They said they would hold another interview in November and have offers out by December. Well there was no interview in November and I had not heard from them since around October 20th.

I emailed them on November 10th asking for any updates regarding the hiring process and expressed my interest in the position again but I did not hear back. Today, I emailed them again:

So this is my first post on this subreddit but I just got an internship offer at Oracle OCI and I had some questions.

I know some people have had their doubts of oracle in the cloud business but I still think this would be a very exciting internship.

I was the typical gifted child; I was reading and writing by the time I was 3, and it wasn't until 4th grade that I got below a 90 on any assignment ever. But, even though I was always the subject of much praise by my teachers, they also always said that I had organizational problems. My desk and backpack were always a mess. On my first grade report card, which I still have, my teacher wrote that I ""did not participate in class discussions but had the right answer when called on'' and ""appeared to be daydreaming most of the time"". I first read about ADHD in a pamphlet at the doctor's office when I was 8, and immediately began suspecting that I had it. I brought it up to my parents, but our lives were descending into chaos at that point, with my mother's behavior becoming more and more bizarre, and nothing was done about it.

When I was in 4th grade, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor. I also began to get bullied at school. My academics suffered, mostly in the form of missing or incomplete assignments. I moved school districts in 6th grade, and on my first progress report at my new school, I was nearly failing science. Before I started 7th grade, I decided that I was going to return to my former glory. My average was in the low 90s for the rest of middle school, and I was even inducted into Arista in 7th grade. But all those projects I got As on were done at the absolute last minute, and I didn't even know the meaning of the word ""studying"". I remember many Sunday afternoons trying to physically force myself to do the homework I'd been putting off all weekend. I missed many opportunities that, unbeknownst to me, could have changed the trajectory of my life- I didn't study for the SHSAT until two days in advance, and was *12 points away* from getting into my first choice high school. I ended up going to my second choice school, where I continued to succeed by pulling off amazing feats at the last minute. There were so many essays that I started writing at 10 PM the day before they were due, so many tests that I did all my studying for at lunch literally minutes before I took them. Sometimes I didn't pull it off, and I had assignments that I turned in a few days late or just didn't do at all, but there were enough assignments in total that those zeros didn't have a huge effect on my average. 

By the time I started 10th grade, I was preparing for college. My introduction to Reddit was actually r/ApplyingtoCollege (on a different account), and like most of the applicants on there, I was shooting for the stars. I decided on my dream school, an Ivy League institution, after taking a tour there on a whim my junior year. For the next 10 months, everything I did was in pursuit of that dream. But I still could not overcome the heavy shackles of procrastination. I almost didn't get to apply to my dream school, because I waited until the day they were due to write my supplemental essays. I literally sent in my application 7 minutes before the deadline. I had to take my SATs later than expected because I procrastinated registering for them, and I still didn't study for them until the last-minute panic set in (although I did take a prep course for several months, which is the reason I scored a 1490 out of 1600). Just 3 weeks before the happiest day of my life, I didn't complete an essay that I had months to do. I sat in class with tears in my eyes as everyone turned theirs in, thinking that maybe I wasn't ready for college at all. 

I wasn't expecting the happiest day of my life at all. Everything about my application process had been last minute, and while part of me dared to dream, I was pretty much certain that, while I *might* get into one of my lower ranked schools, my dream school was a lost cause. The results came in at around 3:30 PM on December 1, 2017, but I, true to form, procrastinated looking at them. I always did this with big news, prolonging the suspense for as long as I could, but I had *another* application for a *different* college that was due that day that I'd waited until the day before to start, and I wanted to finish that before I received this potentially life-changing news. At around 6:05 PM on December 1, 2017, I finally checked my application status. Even writing this four years later, I can feel the pure shock and elation that I felt in that moment. I called my entire family to tell them. When I got back to school and delivered the news, I was the talk of the school. I felt that this was the vindication of everything I'd been through, that my entire life would be on an upward trajectory from that point forward.

But the demon of procrastination was still there.

I started sabotaging my time at my dream school from basically the moment I got in. After I was betrayed by my high school ""friends"" that spring, I checked out of everything, whether related to high school or college. My school has ""pre-orientation programs"" where incoming freshmen can stay on campus for the summer, but I didn't apply to any of them. When the time came to pre-register for courses, I did not set up an appointment with my advisor until the second to last day of the pre-registration period, at which point it was too late. I had to pick up courses in the free-for-all after everyone else had picked theirs. One of those courses was Intro to Calculus, which I had never taken, but everyone else was taking a math course and I hadn't given myself time to think about which courses I *wanted* to take. When classes began, I realized that I couldn't understand calculus for the life of me. I horrifically bombed the first two exams and ended up having to withdraw from the course (on the deadline), which meant that I didn't have enough credits to participate in sorority rush. I was barely getting by in my remaining three courses- there was one course that had video assignments, and I finished the first two on the morning that they were due and didn't do the third one at all. My ""finals"" my first semester were projects, and I locked myself in my room, not eating, on the days that they were due in order to frantically finish them with hours to spare. The final outcome of my first semester was three Bs and one W. 

After I got out of the hospital during winter break (I was having odd neurological symptoms similar to those my mother had before she was diagnosed), I vowed to turn my life around. I even decided on my major while I was in the hospital. My second semester courses required a lot of reading, which had always been hell for me- I spent many nights taking notes in the study lounge in my dorm, watching the crowd thin out as the night wore on, until it was 4 AM and I finally gave up. But I was still going to my classes, paying attention, trying my best. Until my neurological symptoms came back. I spent a week paralyzed in pain and fear, too weak to venture out of my room, wondering if I really was dying. I went back home for an MRI that weekend and ended up being readmitted to the ER. Thankfully, there were no signs of a brain tumor or anything else abnormal, and I was able to return to school the next day. But the downward spiral had been set in motion. I never recovered from falling behind that week, but if I'm honest, I didn't try. I had many conversations with my professors where I promised to make up the work, then promptly went on and forgot all about it until the next conversation. I kept lying to myself that I still had time to turn it all around, but I never did. My professor in the course I was doing worst in told me there was no way I could avoid failing, and I went into a panic, trying to do well enough on my finals to pass my other courses so I wouldn't be in danger of being ""dropped"". I had three final exams in a period of 24 hours and did *all my studying for them* in the 3 days before the first exam, after a semester of barely paying attention. I managed to pass those three courses, but failed my other two, so I went ""under review"" by the committee on academic standing to see if I would be ""dropped"" from the school for a year. Miraculously, I wasn't, but was put on ""deferred drop probation"".

I came back to campus the following semester prepared to do whatever it took to not lose the greatest opportunity of my life. I devised an intricate note-taking system and study schedule. The first week of the semester went off without a hitch, but that first weekend, my friends all blocked me without warning. Several days later, they cornered me in my apartment and accused me of something awful that I had no memory of doing. I was left hurt and confused and scared, but even though the schedule I'd created fell to pieces after that (because I had devised the schedule with them so we could study together), I white-knuckled my way through my probation semester the same way I white-knuckled my way through high school- by being lost in my maladaptive daydream world, pulling off amazing feats at the absolute last minute (I got a perfect score on the final for the intro course for my major with *one day* of studying), and believing that the future would be better. Having lost the people I spent my freshman year with, I spent my weekends alone in my apartment, but I was looking forward to *finally* getting to rush a sorority after I got off of probation. The promise of that sorority, and of a twenties that was nothing like the misery of my teens, was the only thing that kept me going. I got As in all my courses that semester, including the two I had to retake after failing. But as the new decade began, I was beginning to realize that that might not be enough. As I was preparing my schedule for my spring semester, I started crying because I didn't want to go back. The first weekend of the semester, as I was trying to do my homework, I was overwhelmed with a feeling of frustrated depression. I didn't want to do my work, but I didn't want to do any of my usual procrastination activities either. I didn't want to exist. Still, the second week of the semester I was at rush, trying to convince myself that it would all be better once I was in the sorority.

And I didn't get in.

I realized that I couldn't keep living like I had in high school, locked up in my room alone, having nothing but my academics, fantasizing about a better future that was never coming as life passed me by. I couldn't white-knuckle my way through the rest of my degree, or the rest of my life. The next day, I checked myself into the campus counseling center. I started using this Reddit- my ""mental health account""- much more often, subscribing to a bunch of subreddits that pertained to me. I searched for a trauma-informed therapist, and within a month I was seeing one. And I was working with resources on campus to get diagnosed with ADHD. But my academics were suffering as I sought help. Again I was showing up to classes 30 minutes late, submitting assignments at 11:52 PM after barely skimming the readings. On my last day on campus, I showed up to class without the essay that was due that day. I promised my professor that I would make it up during spring break.

Little did I know that ""spring break"" would last two and a half years, if not forever.

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic that week. All my classes moved online. When I woke up on the first day of online class after my first lecture had already happened, I lied to myself that I could just watch it later. And that's what I did for the next two months, for all my classes. I showed up to take exams, which I got the answers for out of the books, but that was it. The virus claimed my grandmother's life in April, and my final was on the day of her funeral. I had frantic, tearful Zoom appointments with my academic advisor, as we discussed what could be done about my imminent failure for the second time. I ended the semester with one B, two incompletes, and two failures. Rather than be ""dropped"", I went on a voluntary leave of absence, intending to return in the fall of 2021. And I completely forgot about school. The incompletes turned to failures as I did absolutely nothing about them. I did manage to get several virtual internships while I was on leave, but I wasn't able to keep up with my work for those either- it was just like school, promising things that I never delivered. I lost one internship because of this, and ended up leaving the other because a conflict of interest arose with another job that I took (both the internship and the job were political in nature). That job, which ended in June, was the last job I had. I was supposed to be preparing to return to school, but I did nothing about it- missed the deadline to apply for housing, missed the deadline to pre-register for courses. I received the form to apply for return from LOA in early April, and did not send it back until *July*, the last day to be considered for return for the fall semester. On the form, I was honest with them that I was not at all prepared to return, and they granted me an extension. And I haven't. Done. Anything. Since. Then. I haven't even gotten a job, even though I know there's a labor shortage right now. I spend literal weeks on end not leaving my house, wasting my life on Reddit and YouTube.

Now it's been four years since the happiest day of my life. I still get emails addressed to the Class of 2022, talking about upcoming senior events. I don't even look at my school email anymore because otherwise I'll cry. The other day, I heard ""Nothing New"" by Taylor Swift while in the grocery store: *""How can a person know everything at 18, but nothing at 22?""* I was barely able to keep from bawling in the middle of the store, even though I know I didn't know anything at 18 either. I was just sort of able to pretend back then. Procrastination almost prevented the happiest day of my life from ever happening… and now, because of procrastination, I fear that December 1, 2017 will always be the peak of my life."

r6x82w,22,2021-12-01,Need advice: My new boss wants to take me from a W2 to a 1099 employee,ovrthnkn,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r6x82w/need_advice_my_new_boss_wants_to_take_me_from_a/,"I followed this thread in awe of the shitty things employers did, never thinking I’d actually have a valid thread to post here. I need some help, advice, and some knowledge on what to do.

I am 22 (F) and have worked at a marketing company for a little over a year since graduating college, proving myself through and through. It’s a small start up company within the past few years. Around 10 employees. I’m not being cocky, but I have done a really good job while being promoted from a graphic design intern to a full time content specialist position to then a social media manager, taking on more work. (Promoted twice within a year) One of our distributor clients has noted that if I no longer work here, they will no longer continue employing us for their social media marketing. This would mean a loss of at least 200 clients. Since we are a small company, my work is massively critical to the company. I run the entire social media aspect of our marketing agency. 

I had a conversation with my original boss that hired me that I was moving out of state soon and during this conversation I was recommended a raise because of the new tasks I took on taking over another position recently as well as for all the hard work I’ve done throughout the year. It was approved for me to work out of state, the raise is still in question due to restructuring. But there’s more to this.

In that time since this conversation, the higher up guys pulling the strings out of literally nowhere brought in a new boss and demoted my original boss into sales. They also took away our 401k matching plans. My original boss and one of the investors hate each other and the dickhead investor guy is the one who hired this new guy. This new guy knows nothing about our company or what we do and who now knows nothing about me, what I’ve done here, or my value, wants to take me from a W2 employee to a 1099 because of me moving and dealing with health insurance and isn’t too keen on the idea of me getting a raise because we aren’t “profitable” only due to covid when in reality we grew the business a little less than 50% over the year. I think he just wants to reduce company costs and make me more disposable. His first question when meeting for the second time ever was “do you even want to work here still” a loaded question insinuating that this would just all be easier if i wasn’t still employed with this company.

He wants to make me a 1099 employee instead of being a W2 anymore like I have been all year. He told me to do my homework on what it means to be a 1099 employee, and the more I learn about it, the more I feel as if I am getting fucked over and becoming more disposable of an employee to be potentially let go soon. I absolutely love my old boss and would honestly quit if he wasn’t around and am massively bummed about his demotion. I love what I do and I’m good at it and it shows with my promotions, but I feel like I am getting a massive decrease here even though these things were previously approved. I am not the only one upset with this new guy and the restructuring. I have a really hard time saying no so when having this 1099 discussion, I didn’t know what to say or how to stick up for myself. I feel like I didn’t explain this thoroughly so please ask questions for context if necessary. Thanks in advance, Reddit friends."

I like computer science because of how it can be applied and connected to my other interests (design, policy, business, etc.), projects can be customizable, and how technology can be used as a tool to help others.

But a lot of the times I do not find spending hours programming to be enjoyable. Some concepts are difficult to understand, and I am often behind. I get frustrated quite fast and start doubting my choice of pursuing this major as I am always struggling with it. 

Before pursuing computer science, I had interests in film production, photography, communications, marketing, graphic design, and others that I abandoned. And I am currently taking a class that really made me fall in love with public policy, law, and political science.

I'm a current admin and have been working at a mid-sized (quickly growing to a large-size) contractor/research company in the D.C. area. This is a fantastic employee-owned company with good benefits. I like the people I work with for the most part - its cozy, I get support from management (for the most part) and I feel appreciated. Have my own office, I'm respected for the skills I bring to the table, but I'm a Jr. Admin supporting my entire two offices alone. There's other admins at my company, but they are responsible for different locations. 

The thing I absolutely hate about this job is how overworked I am. I feel like I have 4 bosses between our corporate people, my own users in my LAN that I administrate, a satellite office 1,000 miles away I'm also responsible for, and my actual boss. I'm pretty much behind on every task except the day-to-day IT Support which I'm also responsible for. I patch vulnerabilities across 100+ systems, manage approx. 5 rapidly aging servers that are already fully depreciated, I can't get any traction on an upgrade because every purchase needs managerial approval and my boss is also busy. Our server room doesn't have the correct wall plugs for some new UPS' we've been sitting on for months, our old UPS don't have batteries that work, our backup server is full and I can't do anything until we roll out Veeam, and several of my users don't even have computers cause of the shortage/delayed shipping. At least I can work from home 90% of the time (in the office for physical deployments, re-imaging workstations, special meetings, etc.)

Its honestly stressful and tiring logging in every day with a mountain of work and no idea how to tackle it other than to just chip away at what I know I can get done immediately. My management is aware of this and is trying to find a way to help balance it out without hiring another person (asking someone to take on additional duties, getting an intern, etc.) 

I'm beginning to realize that a small team is meant for my workload, and not a single junior admin. I'm not trying to play imposters syndrome since I've been keeping this ship somehow afloat for about 1 year now, but its been really difficult. I've already tried asking for assistance, but they claim they aren't able to hire another IT guy right now (it went all the way up the chain and was shot down by a VP). BUT they hired 3 more accounting people exclusively for purchasing. Ugh.

Rant aside, I was contacted by a guy on LinkedIn through DM. He was impressed with my profile and wanted to see if I was interested in a job at his company. I did some research, and they are legit - been around since 2007. I normally have dozens of those typical ""chain"" recruiter messages to my DMs but this one stood out. The position is also sysadmin work administrating several servers used among 3 different contracts, no end-user or helpdesk duties, and . He's the co-founder of a small company that serves as a NASA subcontractor. Cool stuff. Minimum, I'd be making 85K which is a 20% increase in salary compared to what I make now. 

I've compared the benefits and I get slightly less PTO and not as good health insurance, but I'm young and likely won't be getting sick too often. I still can't get rid of this nagging feeling that I'm in a good spot, and I shouldn't move unless offered something really compelling. I'm not going to take any action until I get an offer letter from the LinkedIn guy, though I'm hesitant to leave behind a good group of people I get along with, despite the fact I'm overworked. I know there's always the possibility of returning to my company at a later date, I'm just feeling unsure. Then there's the fact that I'm worried about being qualified for the new position. Am I being an idiot? Need some more experienced thoughts on this situation."

r77g4a,1,2021-12-02,My father keeps asking for money and I don't know what to do,Normal_Ad_998,LifeAdvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/r77g4a/my_father_keeps_asking_for_money_and_i_dont_know/,"I am part of a family of 5 (father, mother, two sisters and I). We live in Brazil and my father is a freelancer, so there are months that his income is big and others with a low income. I work as an intern in a multinational company and receive a salary of R$2,000. One of my sisters is a college student and doesn't work, my other sister just started a job as a teacher and earns the same as I do, and my mother is a housewife.

My father is financially irresponsible and always spend much more than he earns. Some years ago he asked for a lot of bank loans that hopefully right now are all paid. We, as a family, agreed that we would never ask for a loan again. The problem now is that since he can't ask for a loan in the bank, he is now asking me for the money.

I don't see any problem in helping my family with a part of my salary, when I started working I sent my father R$500 every month. However, my father has a credit card with a R$3,000 limit that he is always using in full and right now his income as a freelancer is really low, in November he earned only R$1,000.

For the last two months (October and November) he asked R$2,000 for me each month (basically, my whole salary) to cover the bills of that credit card. As I have some money saved, I sent the money to him because I knew that if I didn't he would secretly ask for a loan.

Now, in December, he has asked me R$3,000. I have this amount saved, but I am afraid that I am going to use all my savings with this and be out money soon. He also knows that in January I will have to move to another city (an expensive one, by the way) because of work, but he is still asking for money.

My sister that is a student has some money saved because our auntie send her some to use in college, but I don't want to ask her to help because she doesn't have an income yet. My other sister that just started working as a teacher is not saving money, all I see is that she is buying clothes for parties, expensive stationary items (her obsession), and zero worried about our financial situation. Recently I had to pay a bill for her and she told me she could only pay me back when she received her paycheck (in other words, she is spending all that she earns).

I feel like I am all alone trying to solve our financial situation and that my father will keep asking for money forever, I won't be able so save any money and he will soon get into another loan that he can't pay.

The expenses in that credit card are mostly for groceries, electricity, gas, and water bills. But recently he also went to an ophthalmologist to get new glasses that cost R$1,000. So there are essential bills and other things that he buys even after knowing he doesn't have money to pay.

How should I deal with this situation? My savings are getting low now, I will have to move to another city and I am afraid of him getting loans that he can't pay if I don't give him money."

r78p1z,34,2021-12-02,Screening on FAANG companies?,[deleted],cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/r78p1z/screening_on_faang_companies/,"I am a student from a top 3 university in France in Computer Engineering/Computer Science. I have two internship experiences in R&amp;D at large multinational companies, one large French company and one large international one, originally from Tech sector but older than FAANGS and quite moribund now (not to say other thing) but still a household name that everyone knows. My GPA is 3.98 out of 4.  


I know several students from my school who are at FAANGS across Europe, but I just can't seem to get past screening stage at any of these companies. I specifically tried **(all internships)**:  
1 - Amazon Luxembourg (I know several people from my school/similar ranking schools and even worse schools that got in with no previous experience),  no answer.  
2 - NVIDIA in Zurich and Paris - Declined after 1 day.  
3 - Microsoft Paris - Received ""we regret to inform..."" mail on a Sunday.  
4 - Google Zurich with referral - no answer.  
5 - Apple Zurich - No answer.  
6 - Apple Paris - No answer.  


I have some contacts in these companies, specifically because they come from the same school/are same nationality. I talked to them but its not like they can just make me pass to the interview stage, so I need some help on passing on the screening. For my internship I think its too late (I'm on the final round with other prestigious companies, just not tech)

Bear in mind some of these positions asked almost verbatim what I've done and I made sure to put (well I think) the keywords there, however my CV always gets a mediocre score at Jobscan like 40%. I strongly suspect the problem is with ATS here, but I don't understand how? I typed my CV in LaTeX and always send it as PDF, and my contact at Google said it was ""very good"" but I just don't understand if the bar is really that high and I am just under it, or if there is something else going on.   


Thanks"
r78p5q,3,2021-12-02,Confused about design verification,whenjob,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/r78p5q/confused_about_design_verification/,"Got an internship offer from qualcomm for design verification (v grateful) but tbh im pretty new to the field, could someone tell me a bit about the career prospects and such? tried looking stuff up online but the info is just all over the place. Also, is qualcomm a good name for a design verification job? would it help in getting interviews in the furture?

Def not looking to do the same thing for the rest of my life, so my next qs is would what I do on the job be applicable to other subfields in software/firmware/emdedded?

im a 2nd year cs major btw, so thats another thing, im gonna be taking more digital logic courses then usually required but not a lot of stuff on electronics so would that be a problem? (I anyways want to stay more on the software side of things, rather than go ham on hardware)

lastly, has anyone here worked at qualcomm (canada maybe?), or a design verification position even? what was your experience like, and what did you do on a day to day basis? and did it help you find jobs in another field?

ik answers vary a lot for everyone, im just trying to get a general idea, id really appreciate an answer to even one question, if not all!"
r78szh,2,2021-12-02,Slow Start,Big_Boush,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r78szh/slow_start/,"I graduated earlier this year with a degree in Computer Science. I just started a new job at a university working as a software engineer. It is my first job (I fucked up and didn't really do any software eng internships) and things have been really slow. I completed the first training project and they didn't have anything for me to do for a day and a half. Then my boss gave me a program to review and make notes. I made a flow chart of how the program works, a table for terms that are undefined, and documented the role of each of the classes in the program, working with the other new employee. My boss basically said good job and that will review it when the co-worker who worked on the program gets back from vacation a week from now.

My main questions are..

* Is this sort of thing normal/does it get better?
* If it doesn't get better how soon should I get a new job?
* Should I ask my boss for more work even though, he already knows I finished what he gave me?
* Where are the best places or industries to work at if my values are in order...

1. Growth and Challenging Work
2. Social Impact (I feel like my work affects people in a positive manner/is useful)
3. Flexibility
4. Respect
5. Money."

My main issue right now is my relatively empty CV. Considering I am already in 2nd year in a 3 year degree, my only hope for gaining experience before I start applications is next summer. Internship hunt is not going well unfortunately, even if it did, I would only have 1 high-quality experience compared to other's 3-4 high-quality experiences.

I am just looking for advice from people who got into top tier US grad schemes without internship experience, I am planning on doing research next summer if I cannot get an internship where I will learn something meaningful (this will still only give me 1 more thing to add to my CV/ experiences). 

I am open to people telling me that my mindset is wrong, etc. Anything that'll make my vision for next summer a bit clearer because right now, I am not exactly in a great place.

r7gemr,3,2021-12-02,Paycom vs Deutsche Bank SWE Internship,fro3nix,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r7gemr/paycom_vs_deutsche_bank_swe_internship/,"Paycom:

pay: $25/hour

housing: provided (corporate)

work: unknown

Deutsche Bank:

pay: $41/hour

housing: not provided (out of pocket)

work: unknown

location: New  York City, New York

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I should I go for Paycom since they are providing housing for me. I'm based out of Texas so I can provide transportation for myself. It will save me money. Ultimately, once I get out of college I would like to move to a big city in Texas for work. 

On the other hand, Deutsche Bank seems like it could provide better networking opportunities for me. Especially since its located in New York City. I feel like Deutsche Bank has a better brand name than Paycom. They aren't providing housing or transportation for me, so I'll most likely come back with little to no money especially given that housing in New York can get pretty expensive. 

I know I shouldn't be as concerned about the short-term money I'll be making in the internship but I don't know if the networking opportunities in New York City overshadow the opportunities I could get working in the DFW area.

r7h5aa,3,2021-12-02,Struggled to finish architecture school now I'm lost,Curious_Pumpkin2782,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/r7h5aa/struggled_to_finish_architecture_school_now_im/,"I'm in the last semester of my program which was supposed to be a 4-year bachelor's but has actually taken me 5.5 years to finish. I struggled immensely with my mental health during this time and was overwhelmed with just my school work so I never interned or acquired any relevant experience that I could add to my resume. On top of that as a POC, I really had a hard time connecting with the faculty and even other students in my department. I experienced many microaggressions that just made me keep to myself within the group dynamic that is ARCH school. I generally didn't do well so although I do have a portfolio it's very lackluster and my resume is so bare that I'm actually embarrassed by it. 

Now because of the dynamic during studios, I am convinced that I would have a similar experience in a professional studio office and that makes me doubt whether I even want to enter the field. I have applied for several internships during this semester (I had a much lighter course load) and I haven't heard back from any of them which makes me believe that I'm underqualified even for internships. so I don't think ill be able to get an entry-level job once I actually have my degree. 

I know I haven't been putting all the effort that I should be into finding a job but I just feel so disappointed with my experience in architecture school and don't see myself fitting into this profession, it's draining just thinking about it. I don't know what to do with this degree and I'm going to need a job soon. It also sucks to see the people I started college with graduating with their masters and jobs in the field. (i know its not good to compare but I can't help but feel like such a failure when I see their success)

I've been considering going into UX design but I think my resume would be a problem with any path I take. Not to mention a UX BootCamp would cost a couple of thousands of dollars and at the very least 6 months of time which I can't really afford rn. So that's just a very long way to say I am so lost."

Sort of wanted to vent and also ask for advice at the same time. I am a Sophomore pursuing COmputer Science. Suddenly I have lost almost all the will to code .

Initially it used to be exciting for me to get into a problem and thinking creatively to solve one. But for some reason for the past few days , anything that doesn't have a clear answer is giving me pretty good anxiety , its as if the enthusiasm has completely left me and the joy of finally being able to solve a problem is also not there anymore. This in turn makes me feel more worthless as I am unable to build really anything . At one point I was really into it and was messing with everything I could , trying to figure out how things worked but now that I look at it , the field feels competitive and there's just so much fear surrounding whether I am good enough to make it or not. The thing is no more about just doing what you wanna do , but it feels competitive , and I feel I will never make it. I am stuck with python and I can see how hard it is to actually even get an internship with the tech stack I currently claim to have experience on . I feel I am very biased and hence won't excel as a programmer . Everything is taking a toll and it makes me wanna quit everything for a while and not think about it. But doing that would just increase the whole thing more. 

How do I deal with fear of not being enough?"

So I am in the process of getting an offer for an interning position from Tesla in Austin Texas. I was wondering if anyone got any experience with benefits, pay, and housing for Tesla in Austin, TX?

I know that interns get housing for Tesla in Nevada but not sure how it's like in Austin.

Also, with the pay, how much would be standard for a Junior year student?

Thank you"
r7jcqa,1,2021-12-02,"What would be the best tools, JSFrameworks, ideas for replacing plain JS ?",Mrcsrobles,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/r7jcqa/what_would_be_the_best_tools_jsframeworks_ideas/,"**Context**:

Two weeks ago I started working on a new software company that has a software product developed using Java Spring and plain JS. They told me I have to develop a new view for the web product, but they also told me I could use any tech I would like.

Now, I have been checking the JS code, and it's unorganized, but it works, so probably my part would be the only one using this tech or at least the first.

**The questions:**

So far I have checked React and Vue, but since I know nothing from JS frameworks I am not sure which would suit more for my case, I only have ever used Angular a while ago and I am sure it's discarded because of its learning curve. 

Also, a perfectly correct option is to keep using plain JS, but it feels like it lacks modern mechanics.

What I think I am looking for is end-user performance, an easy learning curve, organization of the code, reusability, and of course compatibility with Spring Java.

Furthermore, I have been checking TypeScript, and seems like a lot better for the developer than JS.

Any other tool that you can suggest is welcome since I am on an internship and I am learning.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."
r7jmge,3,2021-12-02,Last internship before I graduate. Help me decide!,lookingforhelp007,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r7jmge/last_internship_before_i_graduate_help_me_decide/,"I'm a junior and this is going to be my last internship before I graduate. I have gotten offers from Amazon and Microsoft, and having a hard picking between the two.

Amazon:
Team: Random

Pay: $9200/month + $2200/month housing

Microsoft:
Team: DevDiv

Pay: $7500/month + $2200/month housing

I'm leaning more towards amazon mainly because I'll get to work with technologies used across the tech industry. At Microsoft, there's a high chance that I might end up working with C#.

For new grad, I'm planning to aim for either fintech or FB/GOOGLE. If I can't get these jobs, I'll most likely end up going back FT to the company I intern at.

Which one would you pick if you were in my situation?

Edit: I have U.S. citizenship

I'm a new grad living in Toronto studying CS with no internships. I only have side projects.

I recently was offered a web development contract for $22/hr for 4 months.

Wondering if I should take it? I'm pretty desperate for a job since I'm graduating really soon and most employers just ghost me. Don't know if I should take this opportunity since on one hand I need experience to get a job but on the other hand, the pay is only $22/hr and it's a contract (idk if this looks bad on a resume since it's only 3 months?)

r7knrp,0,2021-12-02,Am I ready for an internship/how do I list my experience?,EquipmentOk8810,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r7knrp/am_i_ready_for_an_internshiphow_do_i_list_my/,"I have a bit of a problem in that I'm not an actual CS major. My major is considered liberal arts but I started taking my university's standard progression of CS courses in my second year (a program that's part of my major), though at this point I'm considering a CS minor just switching majors . 

Right now I'm about done with second year CS courses (Java advanced OOP and Data Structure Fundamentals), and have been advised by family members who work in programming jobs to seek an internship or a part time. (they tell me a lot of the learning in CS is done on the job)

My questions are mainly:

\- Am I actually ready to take on an internship? I really feel like my knowledge about Java and just CS as a whole is still very very basic.

\- If I do apply, how would I list my qualifications? Most internships I've found have something along the lines of this: ""Must be currently enrolled in a full time degree or program and returning to the program after the completion of the internship"" in their requirements section, though some of them specifically mention being in a CS major."

I really want to do both internships (by trying to move one to offseason ) but not sure if it is worth it (have to take more classes in rest of sems, more grind). Really appreciate some input!

Is it worth doing both snap and doordash?

Note: I'm also a soph so I'll be recruiting next year too. Don't know if this changes anything.

EDIT: For those choosing DoorDash offseason over Snap offseason, is there any reason why?

r7ltvj,3,2021-12-02,How to go about this situation,Sam-Hinkie,Big4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Big4/comments/r7ltvj/how_to_go_about_this_situation/,"
So, I recently accepted a position at PWC for a full-time tax position for next summer. I asked my recruiter for an extension on the offer but she never responded, so I took it. At this time, I had an interview with kpmg for tax/summer lined up and I ended up still going through with it and got an offer for that as well(2,000 more for salary, but no bonus which makes them equal) and haven’t decided yet to accept or not. The reason I wanted kpmg over pwc is because I have one of my best friends(and new roommates in a few months) there and I’ve also met a bunch of his coworkers that I liked and can already tell I like this particular firm’s culture, based on the people I’ve met so far. 

My first question is, I know people joke about kpmg on this sub but to what extent are the two actually different, like in terms of recognition from outside of public(I’m doing this for good exit op as I don’t see myself working 60+ hours for long)?

My real big issue for all of this comes with pwc also offering me a seasonal/internship role for this winter(kpmg said they can’t do the same). I haven’t accepted it yet, as I try to make my decision. But a key factor with this is that I will be moving soon to the city and need to be working, if not there then somewhere to pay rent, so might as well not miss out on the big payday I’d get for working busy season at an hourly rate.

I’ve talked with people and been told to go this route, and for starters, I don’t even know if it’s legally possible based on my contract but I’ll double-check. They said that in my position they would accept the pwc internship and also the kpmg full-time offer. Then in the time in-between internship and full-time for pwc, renege the offer and then just start at kpmg. 

This is not something I feel completely comfortable doing tbh. Feels slimy. Based on this sub, I know that reneging on an acceptance isn’t the worse thing in the world outside of burning that one bridge with the firm. But my situation is worse off since I would like to accept the internship/seasonal role still (for money and if I really like it then I could renege kpmg, which I wouldn’t like either, but I’d do that if that meant I’m staying at a place I know I like.)

What would you do in my position? The same that people advised me to do? Decline pwc internship, renege pwc ft, and accept kpmg right now? Decline kpmg and accept internship/not renege FT(prestige much better/don’t want to renege)?

Also, for my situation and in general how much weight would you put on some of these things?
-Working with friends and a place you know you like a good amount of people? (tell me if this is a silly reason to accept a job)
-Starting off at a firm where your roommate works? (feel like this could help to acclimate in this remote time —- yes same practice)
-Money gained from working overtime during busy season?
-Missing out on cpa study time?
-Pwc full hybrid(also does re-evaluating in July likely mean the end of full remote then? Is kpmg likely to go back to normal soon?)
-Possibly one or both firms finding out. (this is a big one)
-Awkwardness of leaving after spending time there (shouldn’t be too bad since I won’t be  starting FT right after seasonal role)"

r7mr64,14,2021-12-02,They thought I would simply work without being paid and now they own me 30x my paycheck,therealilith,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r7mr64/they_thought_i_would_simply_work_without_being/,"A few things to make the story more clear:

* In my country, every worker has to have some kind of work contract stating wage, hours, rules, and it must be signed by the company AND the worker. It's usually done/signed before the person starts working because working without a contract is illegal and the worker can sue the company for it.
* We also are given, by law, 30 days of paid vacation a year and paid sick leaves, if the company denies either of those they can get sued as well.
* Companies are OBLIGATED by law to pay their workers until every 5th working day of the month, if they don't they can get sued.
* This story happened right after it was ""safe enough"" for the schools to open again (jan/2021)

\~\~

**TDLR:** *I was hired, they didn't make a work contract, I got covid from one of the students, they made me work on my sick leave (that happened to fall during a major lockdown) and then claimed that they would only pay me 1/2 of my wage because I wasn't working at the time.  I sued them for lack of contract, lack of payment, making me work on sick leave, and other things, and now they have to pay me and 30+ workers 50k each. The place is closing soon.*

\~\~

One of my closes friends recommended me a school that was hiring a bilingual teacher to work full time, the payment was good for someone who only had previous experiences working as an intern and wasn't even graduated yet. The ""interview"" consisted of a conversation over text with the school owner (who was also the principal) and a one-day-try-out to see if I was fit for the position. 

In less than a day I was hired.

I started working without any major problems and, for the most part, the workplace was very nice, my colleagues were friendly and the kids were great. After one week working there, I went to talk to the principal's secretary to see what documentation she might need for my work contract and she laughed at me saying that the person in charge of it usually takes a while to make them and that I shouldn't worry about it. (Red flag number one)

A month goes by and every time I tried bringing the contract topic to the principal (she was working from home after dislocating her knee so most of our contact was over text) she would either ignore it or leave me on read. I thought that she was probably the one in charge of it and would only be able to sign when she came back to work. (Red flag number two)

After three weeks of working there my city got into a pretty serious lockdown that lasted 14 days, almost everything closed and the schools were no exception, but they could decide to continue classes online or to take those 2 weeks of the kid's vacation period. The school I was working on made it very clear that they wouldn't adapt to the online classes and that the kids (and us) were on vacation, so we shouldn't send homework or things like that to the students.

One or two days before the lockdown I caught covid for one of the students (who was sent with all of the symptoms to school and even though the other teachers were aware of it they decided to ignore and keep the kid inside the school - Red flag number three) after getting tested I received from my doctor a 14 days sick leave (that would match exactly the lockdown period) and orders to rest. I sent the doctor's note to my boss and she even wished me a good recovery.

For the first two days of my sick leave, things went smoothly until she started saying on the school's group chat that *every* teacher was required to record videos teaching to send to the students so she could upload them on the school's Instagram. I texted her in private about it and she threatened/gaslighted me into recording/editing/uploading videos to the students even though I was on sick leave AND with covid. (Red flag number four)

When the lockdown was over it was the beginning of the month and every worker was called individually into the principal's office to receive the news that they would only pay us 1/4 of our wage until the 5th working day and another 1/4 of it until the 15th day of the month because ""Since you were at home you were not working and you only get paid for the days you worked"" and some non-sense about the parents not paying the tuition (that is charge monthly) and that the school didn't have any money because of it (which was a lie because alongside the school renovations that they were doing the owner of the school had just bought a new and very expensive car).

I was livid. What they were going to pay me wasn't even going to cover the whole cost of the covid tests I had to get. I argued (over text) that they should have to pay me full either way because sick leave and/or vacations are legally covered and the workers must be paid for it, and since I was creating videos I was working, so they should pay me for it. They denied my full payment and I decided to take legal action against them.

From my online interview to my text pointing each law they broke, I had documented everything so I could prove that I worked there (even without my contract) and that they were deceiving their workers. I got a lawyer and now they own me more than 50k, I got my fellow coworkers to sue them as well and now they have at least 30 ongoing cases against them.

The school is closing this month and I'm thinking about where to travel with money I got from the case, any tips?"
r7mvm0,74,2021-12-02,vanquished college regrets,TYHAFBAHHHHHH,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/r7mvm0/vanquished_college_regrets/,"Used to lurk on this sub last year when i was in HS...

Anyway: when i applied last year, got into some pretty nice US schools; a couple T10s (Cal, CMU, etc), for engineering/CS. But i couldn't go to any of them --- mix of insanely high tuition for international students and personal reasons.

So i went to University of Waterloo instead (for engineering). I was pretty depressed about this, thinking about the cool, famous, high-ranked US schools i could've gone to and all the things i might've been able to achieve. Waterloo is by no means a bad school...but it definitely didn't have the glamour of american T10s and ivy leagues. I regretted not biting the bullet on US schools and settling for waterloo.

But holy shit y'all; waterloo is actually fucking awesome. This co-op program shit is absolutely insane. With a crappy resume and zero work experience i somehow landed a machine learning/AI engineering job working with one of the best researchers in the country, and my friends are getting internships with big names everywhere. I'm so hyped to start working; i get to do cool shit, take a break from school, and earn money at the same time...i can pretty much cover tuition and rent for next semester with my paycheck. Plus with 5 more co-op terms in the future, feels like the sky's the limit. Everyone I've met is nice and passionate about their work. No more regrets about schools i could've gone to.

Sorry for the long-ish, rambling post; moral of the story is it all works out in the end. Keep your heads up even if you don't end up going to your dream schools...everything works out in the end. Also, if you want to go into tech/engineering, **consider Waterloo!** We produce an insane amount of silicon valley/FAANG people and successful startups; we might not be high ranked, but trust me, the reputation is there if you want to do tech stuff. Plus the application is due pretty late (mid-Feb) so you can procrastinate your application as much as you want."

*At the edge of Coalition space, a kingdom of desert pirates launches a surprise attack against their former allies, plunging the territories of Borealis into a brutal civil war. As the cruel Matriarch deploys her armies to take control of the planet's trade routes, the UNN lands an armored battalion on the surface in an attempt to restore order. Little do they know that she has more up her sleeve than ramshackle technicals and stolen anti-satellite weapons. On one side, a multi-species scout vehicle crew tries to find common ground, while on the other, the newly appointed Fleet Admiral wrestles with the weight of her duties.*

CHAPTER 1: PREEMPTIVE STRIKE

The sound of claws scratching against the metal deck echoed through the cramped corridor as the Crewmaster made his way to the bridge, ducking under exposed pipes and bundles of electrical cables. This warren of winding passages was made for humans, not Borealans, his eight-foot stature requiring him to hunch over to avoid hitting his head. Their smell still permeated the vessel, but it was fading now, overcome by the scents of oil and alien machinery.

His furry ears brushed the doorframe as he emerged into a more open space, finally able to stand upright. Before him was a room occupied by half a dozen console banks, more of his kind hunched over before the glowing, holographic displays. They waved their clawed fingers through the projections, adjusting their course, and tracking radar contacts. The bridge was a little more homely than the rest of the ship. As the command center, the bare hull had been decorated with crimson drapes in the traditional style, the flowing fabric cascading from the ceiling to the carpeted floor. A large window wrapped around the room, occupying his entire field of view. The glass doubled as a monitor, displaying information in small boxes that the crew were moving around with gestures from their furry hands, the angular hull of the frigate visible beyond.

It extended into the distance like an artificial horizon, tapering into a dull point a good two hundred meters in front of them, the subtly raised conning tower giving them a fine view. It was broken up in places by the streamlined blisters that housed the ship’s railgun turrets, and the closed hatches of the torpedo launch tubes. The vessel bristled with weaponry, but it was all stowed, as they were not on a combat patrol. The hull had once been painted with a stealth coating that was as black as the space beyond, but it now sported a more fitting red, the color of Elysia. Intricate scenes of battle and hunting flowed across its surface like a tapestry, their brilliant gold gleaming under the light of the system’s twin suns.

The finely engraved, ruby-red armor that the Crewmaster wore over his silken tunic clanked as he rolled his shoulders, a long cape sewn from *rainbow spider* fur glittering with iridescence as it trailed behind him. He stalked over to his throne, taking a seat on the padded chair, his long tail slotting through a hole in the backrest as he leaned into the crimson leather. Most of his crew were wearing their pressure suits, but the *Furious Swipe* was a sound vessel, she would not forsake her master.

[Elysian Crewmaster Concept Art](https://imgur.com/AZXQzU6)

“Report,” he grumbled, resting his face in his palm as he gazed out at the starfield. “What is our present course?”

“We sail over the territory of the Rask, my Alpha,” one of his crewmen replied with a deferent bow of his head.

“Radar contacts?” he asked, scratching idly at his fiery mane of orange hair.

“Some Coalition, and one jump merchant, but we have adjusted our trajectory accordingly.”

“Very good,” the Crewmaster muttered, waving a hand at the viewport. “Show me the ground.”

The inky blackness of space faded, replaced with a camera view from the underside of the frigate. The planet beneath them was mostly desert, its surface blasted by the heat of the system’s primary, scant wisps of white cloud drifting through the atmosphere. Borealis had no oceans, no continents, all of its water was locked within the great lakes. They shimmered as their sapphire surfaces reflected the suns, encircled by bands of lush, green jungle that served as bulwarks against the ever-encroaching deserts. The greenery trapped moisture to create a micro-climate, swirling clouds seeming to cluster over the country-sized oases, their borders dividing up the different territories.

Elysia was one of them, his home. How he longed to return to the shore of its endless lake, to walk between the stone edifices of its capital once again, to feel the wind in his hair. Captaining a ship of the Elysian Navy was a noble station, one earned through great deeds, but it tended to get a little dreary.

[3D render of Borealis](https://imgur.com/jpLZdaG)

His feline eyes turned to the territory that they were cruising over. Unlike most, the jungle band that should have shielded it from the sands was broken in places, the desert spilling through the breaches. It almost looked like a giant grazing animal had taken huge bites out of it. The lake itself was relatively small, a puddle compared to that of his own nation. He could only just make it out, as it was sandstorm season, the obscuring clouds visible from space.  

Its inhabitants, the Rask, were a hardy people who were more accustomed to desert life than most. They were notorious bandits and pirates, raiding caravans, and making incursions into neighboring territories in ages past. Their admittance into the Coalition had somewhat curbed that behavior as of late. Rask and Elysia were technically allies, but old rivalries persisted.

The Rask did not have a Navy, nor did any of the other Borealan territories, which meant that Elysia ruled the skies. The Patriarch had been forward-thinking enough to cooperate closely with the Coalition when the aliens had made contact, the resulting prosperity allowing him to purchase technologies that were hundreds of years more advanced than anything available on Borealis. Many other territories now followed Elysia’s lead, but their headstart had expanded their influence greatly, making them the planet’s only superpower.

The radar operator to the Crewmaster’s right faltered, his round ears twitching as he frantically scanned the holographic readout of his console. A crimson warning light bathed the bridge in its glow, alien icons flashing on the window.

“What is the meaning of this?” the Crewmaster demanded, rising from his chair. He didn’t recognize the symbols, and it wasn’t his station to know them.

“The ship’s mind warns that we are being locked, my Alpha,” a flustered crewman replied.

“Locked?” he demanded. “By what?”

“I...I do not know, my Alpha. The skies are clear of enemies, there are no hostile ships in radar range.”

“Put out a call to all ships in the vicinity and warn them that we are being erroneously targeted,” the Crewmaster ordered with a wave of his hand. “The humans must have mistaken us for a pirate skiff, or perhaps our systems are malfunctioning. Order the ship to run a diagnostic on her sensors.”

“As you command,” the crewman sitting at the comms console replied, the other Borealans on the bridge turning their heads to look back at the Crewmaster. One of them paused to wipe her pink nose with the back of her furry hand, her ears swiveling to track him, her reflective eyes darting about the room. This had never happened before. The Elysian Navy had never seen combat, let alone in orbit above their own planet. Nobody quite knew how to react.

“Eyes on your stations!” the Crewmaster snapped, the bridge crew hastily turning their attention back to their displays. “You are like a litter of frightened kittens! The humans built this vessel for war, and she is crewed by Elysia’s bravest. There is no excuse for doubt.”

“The ship reports no fault in her sensors,” the radar operator continued, his fingers moving through the orange projection.

“Coalition vessels report no lock,” the comms officer added. “Should we ask them what to do?”

“No,” the Crewmaster replied. “Tell the ship that she is to locate the source of the lock.”

“She is triangulating,” the radar operator said, watching his readout intently.

“My Alpha,” the comms officer began, the Crewmaster turning to face him. “The Coalition vessel *Rubin* wishes to speak with you.”

“Very well,” he grumbled, “put them through on the main speakers.”

There was a hiss of static, and then an alien voice rang out.

“Captain of the *Furious Swipe*, this is the UNN CIWS frigate *Rubin*. Our sensors show that you’re being locked from the ground. Are you in need of assistance?”

“From the ground?” the Crewmaster hissed in the Elysian tongue, the radar operator shaking his head in reply. He switched back to English, the language of the humans, clearing his throat before replying. “Captain of the *Rubin*, this is the *Furious Swipe*. Our radar systems are unable to determine the origin of the lock. We thought that it might be one of yours.”

“The sensors on those old Mk I *Clovis* frigates are a little slower than what we’re using,” the Captain of the *Rubin* replied. “Our systems show a missile lock originating from the surface of the planet, we’re burning to cover you.”

“Very well, *Rubin*. We await your arrival,” the Crewmaster replied. “What could be targeting us from the ground?” he asked once the connection had been closed. “A Betelgeusian fleet could not have slipped through our defenses, there is an entire Coalition flotilla stationed in orbit.”

“Still scanning,” the radar operator replied. The Crewmaster waited a few moments longer, his furry, orange tail flicking back and forth beneath his cloak in irritation. “She has it,” the crewman declared, swiping to bring the image up on the viewport. “Something just launched from the Rask territory, it moves to intercept us.”

“What is it?” the Crewmaster demanded, “a missile?”

“Ship’s mind reports that the speed and mass of the object correspond with a missile,” he confirmed, failing to mask the uncertainty in his voice. “Three minutes until contact.”

“Arm all weapons!” the Crewmaster snarled. “Prepare to launch torpedoes, activate the defensive guns!”

The blisters on the hull began to open up, railgun turrets rising from their protective housings, pivoting their long barrels as their systems ran diagnostic checks. He watched as one of the ball-shaped defensive turrets swiveled, its long cannon rotating as it angled in the direction of the incoming projectile.

“Put our bow towards the missile, present as small a target as possible,” the Crewmaster ordered. “How far out is the *Rubin*?”

“The humans are maneuvering between us and the projectile now.”

“Show me.”

One of the crewmen brought up a telescopic camera view on the bridge window, zooming in on the human vessel. It was close, but being close in space still put them hundreds of kilometers apart. The frigate was not unlike their own, perhaps a little bulkier in design, its hull painted jet black save for some blue trim here and there. It bristled with defensive cannons, its engines burning with blue flame as it decelerated, appearing to fly backwards relative to the *Furious Swipe*. The purpose of CIWS frigates was fleet protection, their guns and missiles were designed to shoot down torpedoes and fighter craft. As much as the Crewmaster resented needing help, he already felt safer in the frigate’s presence.

“Let the ship’s mind manage the defensive guns,” he warned, “the last thing we need is friendly fire.”

“The Captain of the *Rubin* wishes to speak with you again, my Alpha,” the radio operator said.

“Very well, put him through.”

There was another crackle of static before the human’s voice was transmitted. Their Captain was remarkably calm and casual, considering the situation. Unlike the Borealan crew, the aliens were battle-hardened.

“You’ve got an ASAT headed your way, *Furious Swipe*,” the human began. “It’s a fast-mover, but nothin’ that we can’t handle. It’s leveling out and entering high orbit now, maintain your present course.”

“*ASAT?*” the Crewmaster asked, his question directed at the weapons officer.

“An anti-satellite weapon, my Alpha, designed to destroy targets in orbit.”

“Make sure that the Patriarchy knows what’s happening,” the Crewmaster began, addressing the radio operator. “Ask them for further instructions. Once this threat has been eliminated, I want the Lord Patriarch’s blessing to answer this Rask treachery with a rain of fire.”

“Aye, Crewmaster.”

As they watched, the CIWS frigate loosed a stream of interceptor missiles, rising from its angular hull in all directions on plumes of blue hydrogen flame. They angled themselves towards their target, shooting off into the darkness in a swarm. In mere seconds, their thrusters had grown dimmer than the stars surrounding them, the projectiles fading from view. The Crewmaster sank back down into his leather chair, watching intently.

There were a series of bright flashes, and he pounded his fist on the armrest.

“Ha! Report. Was the missile intercepted?”

“I-I do not know, my Alpha,” the radar operator replied hesitantly. “Sensors show that...all of the intercepting missiles are gone, as is the Rask missile. But I now see a cloud of smaller objects heading towards us.”

“Debris?” the Crewmaster demanded.

“I...I do not know.”

“Emergency call from the *Rubin*,” the radio operator announced, the Crewmaster nodding.

“*Furious Swipe*, take evasive action,” the human Captain said. He sounded alarmed now, his calm demeanor forgotten. “Angle your nose up ninety degrees and start burning.”

“What has happened, *Rubin*?” the Crewmaster asked. “What is your situation?”

As he watched, the CIWS frigate began to pivot, the small thrusters along its length shooting jets of flame. It started to burn away, its main engines flaring brightly.

“There’s an expanding cloud of shrapnel heading our way at about eight kilometers per second. Our CIWS guns can’t stop it. You gotta move, *now*!”

“Do as he says!” the Crewmaster bellowed, the helmsman almost jumping out his skin before keying in the commands. The frigate began to climb away from the planet, the G-forces pressing the crew into their seats, the view on the window still tracking the *Rubin*.

Tracer fire began to spew from its many guns, painting glowing trails across the blackness of space, its point defense systems trying desperately to ward off the incoming projectiles. They wound together, the overlapping streams of bullets putting on a beautiful display, but it was too late.

The *Rubin* was ripped apart, innumerable slivers of jagged metal tearing through it like a giant shotgun blast, its armor no match for something moving at that velocity. The Crewmaster watched in horror as the state-of-the-art warship began to drift, its engines sputtering out, the guns going silent. There was a sudden, violent explosion as the ruptured fuel tanks ignited, a blue-tinted ball of flame blasting the entire aft section to pieces.

They only had a scant few seconds before the deadly cloud reached them, the Crewmaster’s claws digging into the leather of his armrests, the acceleration making him feel like there was a Krell standing on his chest.

“Brace for impact!” he hissed through gritted teeth, watching as their own point defense guns began to fire. Time seemed to slow, what couldn’t have been more than twenty seconds feeling like an eternity was passing by. There was a sudden sensation of cold, then everything went dark and silent…

\*\*\*

The Admirals stood around a circular table in their pristine, white uniforms, their breasts adorned with medals and colored ribbons. Many of them couldn’t physically attend the meeting, as they were light-years away from the station. Instead, they appeared as shimmering, life-sized holograms. The lights in the conference room had been dimmed, the dark mahogany paneling on the walls contributing to the dingy atmosphere. The great wheel that gave Fort Hamilton its nickname rotated past outside the windows, providing artificial gravity, the field of stars beyond seeming to spin around them.

From within the center of the table was projected a holographic image in wavering blue, lighting up the grim faces of those physically present with its pale glow. It showed the curvature of a planet, a smattering of numbered icons displaying the positions of nearby ships, clustered in fleets and squadrons. As they watched, a dotted line was drawn along the path of a projectile as it rose through the atmosphere, moving towards two of the targets. It broke into pieces, sending a spreading cone of shrapnel in their direction, the men watching in silence as the vessels were erased.

Admiral Murray straightened his cap, the golden UN insignia above the rim catching the light. He was an older man, in his late fifties, and his Australian accent complimented his tanned complexion well. All eyes in the room turned to him as he began to speak.

“This morning, at oh-nine-hundred hours, there was an unprovoked attack in Borealan orbit. A projectile was launched from the planet’s surface, striking the UNN *Rubin* and the Elysian frigate *Furious Swipe*. All hands were lost.”

A worried murmur passed through the ring of Admirals, Murray gesturing to the hologram with a gloved hand.

“The projectile was a MAST, a Multi-stage, Anti-capital Spread Torpedo. It’s a weapon manufactured by the UNN, usually destined for planetary defense forces on remote colony worlds where a fleet cannot reasonably be stationed. Its purpose is to counter all known methods of point defense, including cannons, missiles, and lasers.”

The hologram shifted to show an exploded diagram of the weapon, a long, white tube with stabilizing fins that was adorned with Navy markings. The Admiral zoomed in on the nose cone, the model opening up to show what looked like a tightly-packed bundle of railway spikes.

“This is the warhead. Once the missile is traveling at about eight kilometers per second, and the target is lined up, it releases these kinetic energy penetrators. This creates a cloud of high-speed, armor-piercing projectiles that spread out over a large area, making getting out of the way very difficult. At those velocities, even battleship armor is not impervious. We designed this weapon to kill Hive fleets. The idea was that a colony could fire a cluster of these and shred anything in orbit while they waited for a support fleet to arrive.”

“Where was it fired from?” one of the Admirals asked.

The hologram zoomed in on the planet, showing a ring of dense jungle. Within its bounds was a body of water that would have given Lake Superior a run for its money.

“The Rask territory,” Admiral Murray continued, clasping his hands behind his back as he began to pace in front of the table. “We now know that this was a preemptive strike. Shortly after the attack, a message was broadcast across all frequencies. It was in English, they wanted to be sure that we would hear it.”

The hologram shifted yet again, this time displaying a visualization of a sound clip. A female voice came through on the speakers, harsh and rasping, her rolling accent immediately recognizable as that of a Borealan.

“Today, the Rask Matriarchy demonstrated its power by destroying the spacecraft of the interlopers, once thought to be untouchable. Let it serve as a warning, for there will not be a second. For too long, our people have been subject to the will of others, and our voices have been ignored. With the backing of the aliens, the Elysians spread their influence across Borealis, trading their dignity for trinkets and favors. The Coalition, while it proclaims to represent all, makes pariahs of the Rask. We face unjust suspicion and scrutiny from our supposed allies, and our Security Council vote counts for nothing when we are drowned out by a mob of sycophants. Our way of life has been eroded, our pride wounded, our trust betrayed. Our warriors die selflessly for their cause, and our only reward is scorn. But no more. We will not allow ourselves to become clawless, we will not grovel for the approval of those who do not understand our ways. Today, we have severed ties with the Coalition, and we have declared war on Elysia. The sands of Borealis belong to her hardiest children by right, and we mean to restore that natural order.”

“Quite the speech,” one of the Admirals muttered, his holographic form flickering. “What does *clawless* mean?”

“It’s their word for *slave*,” Murray replied. “They usually use it to describe a Borealan who isn’t adhering to their pack structure, where the meanest son of a bitch is the Alpha dog.”

“What do they hope to accomplish?” another added, leaning on the table as the hologram returned to a visualization of the planet. “They can’t possibly believe that they can defeat the Coalition, let alone the UNN. They don’t even have a Navy!”

“Our intelligence is spotty,” Murray replied. “The Rask have never used the communications infrastructure that we set up on the planet, so our listening post at the pole hasn’t been able to trawl their comms. We’ve suspected for some time that they’ve been surreptitiously engaging in piracy and raiding, even after signing a treaty that forbade it, but it’s been hard to prove. The recent investigation into their incursions into the Araxie territory seems to have confirmed that they’ve been violating the Coalition charter. That report should be due any day now.”

“Maybe they’re trying to get ahead of the investigation,” another Admiral suggested. “If they know that they’ve been found out, maybe they’d rather flip the table than face the sanctions. Seems like a very Rask way of going about it.”

“That may be a contributing factor,” Murray replied with a nod. “Our analysts believe that the Rask intend to fight a guerrilla war, asymmetrical combat. We should expect to face a full-blown insurgency.”

“Then they needn’t defeat us,” an Admiral on the far side of the table mused, “they need only make the war too costly and difficult for us to fight. They know that our attention is focused on the Betelgeusian threat to our colonies, they’ve been a member of the Coalition for years, they understand our inner workings. Perhaps they think that by bogging us down in an endless ground war, they can wear us out and get us to abandon the planet.”

“Then they must also know that we have a responsibility to protect our allies,” another Admiral interjected, his voice hissing with static as his projection lagged for a moment. “Elysia is an important member of the Coalition, there’s no way that we would abandon them. And even if we did, I doubt that the Rask could successfully defeat the Elysians. They have a functioning Navy, for the most part, and better equipment.”

“I’m more concerned about where the Rask obtained the MAST,” another added. “How many more of them do they have, and what else might they have gotten their paws on? We haven’t supplied any of those weapons to any of the Borealan territories to my knowledge. There’s always a fleet stationed in orbit as part of our treaty with them, there would be no need.”

“We haven’t been able to determine that,” Murray replied. “That said, the smuggling of arms destined for PDF on outlying colonies is not a new phenomenon. We all remember what happened with the crime syndicate on Hades a few years back. Even ignoring the MAST problem, we’ve been arming the Rask with modern weapons for some time. Their soldiers have access to Shock Trooper armor, and XMRs, the same armament we provide to the auxiliaries. They’ve been trading openly with the rest of the Galaxy for a while now. Those who have served alongside the UNN will know our tactics and our capabilities very well, which further complicates the situation.”

“What has been done about this so far?” one of the Admirals asked.

“Because we don’t know how many MASTs the Rask still have, we’ve pulled our fleet out of their theoretical range, clearing a bubble of space over their territory that extends a good two thousand kilometers in every direction. Usually, we’d land troops on the ground and restore order, but we obviously can’t risk that in this situation.”

“Why not locate the launchers using long-range imaging and conduct railgun strikes to disable them?” another Admiral suggested, his holographic hands clipping through the table. “We could easily hit them from outside the range of the MASTs, even if our accuracy would take a bit of a hit.”

“Not an option,” Murray replied. “The Rask have certainly hidden the launchers in their territory’s population centers, knowing that we won’t risk civilian casualties on that scale. They know our doctrine well, lord knows we’ve explained it to them enough that it’s probably been drilled into their brains. It would violate a hundred conventions. There’s also the issue of the sandstorms. It seems that the Rask have timed their attack to coincide with the seasonal storms that plague the area, meaning that satellite imaging is going to be unreliable for weeks, maybe even months.”

“So,” an Admiral who was standing to Murray’s right mused, crossing his arms as he examined the display. “We can’t land troops in the territory without the risk of them being shot down by the MASTs, and we can’t conduct orbital strikes to destroy the launchers. What options are left?”

“I’ve been talking with the Captain of the UNN *Samar* via quantum link,” Murray replied. “His carrier fleet is currently on-site.”

He tapped some commands into the touch screen that was mounted on the table, the hologram shifting to show a flat view of the planet’s arid surface. A red line extended from one of the giant oases to the next, weaving around one or two smaller lakes, the blue dome over its destination indicating that it was the Rask territory.

“It’s his belief that a small, mobile force of ground vehicles could land in Elysia, then drive across the Borealan desert. Once they reached Rask, they could easily overwhelm their defenses, move into the territory, and disable the launchers. When that’s done, the fleet can move in and take things from there.”

“Are there any assault carriers in that fleet?” someone asked.

“Yes,” Murray replied, “the UNN *Okinawa* is ready to go. She’s loaded with a full tank battalion, and three thousand Marines. The Martians have also asked if they can test one of their new toys, some kind of prototype super-heavy vehicle.”

“All in favor?” one of them asked, a chorus of *aye*s echoing through the conference room in response. “Then it’s unanimous, we dispatch the *Okinawa* immediately.”

“What of the situation on the station, and on deployed carriers?” one of the holographic Admirals added. “This crisis is not confined to Borealis alone. There are thousands of Rask serving as auxiliaries in the UNN, many of whom won’t even know that their government has defected yet. What are we going to do with all of the Rask on the station, for example? Do we intern them? Encourage them to return home?”

“Trying to incarcerate them won’t go down well,” Murray muttered, his tone dour. “They’re a fierce people in more ways than one, and many of them have served in integrated units alongside UNN Marines. They have friends, comrades, people who won’t accept that decision. They haven’t done anything wrong...yet. This is a very delicate situation, it could go downhill very quickly.”

“Surely we can’t allow them to just stay on the station? What about spying, sabotage? The Rask are loyal to their Matriarchy and their Alphas first, and the Coalition second.”

Murray scratched his chin, considering for a moment before replying.

“Is the Rask Ambassador still on the station?” he asked.

“I believe so,” one of the Admirals replied. “They’ll probably be recalled to the homeworld in short order.”

“We need to work with them and make sure that this goes smoothly,” Murray added. “If we can find a way to just get them off the station, all the better. Reassign a carrier, or commandeer a civilian liner, whatever it takes. Worst case scenario, we can just park them in orbit until the situation on the ground is resolved. They don’t have their own ships, they can’t go anywhere under their own power.”

“I’ll have the Chief of Security see to it,” another Admiral said. “He’s a capable fellow.”

r7ni9g,37,2021-12-02,Not thinking your internship/job offer is prestigious/good enough,BecommingHer,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/r7ni9g/not_thinking_your_internshipjob_offer_is/,"Maybe I'm reading too much into sarcastic shitposts, but for anyone who worked hard for their internship/job offer and somehow don't feel fulfilled even though you thought *if I could just get that company then I'd be happy* \- then don't stop. 

I don't mean keep grinding for other offers - of course you can if you want to. Amazon to Google to HRT, if you're down to keep interviewing then do whatever you want. Know that the feeling might not change though (especially if you're already at the higher end of the offers).

Ever consider that maybeeee deep down you're not as ecstatic as you thought you would be, or the happiness didn't last, because you had been working towards a goal for this months, most likely years, and now that you've achieved it you're thinking 'huh....what now?'

I know that's what I thought. I was happy with my offer, but not as happy as I pictured I'd be. I had spent quite literally my whole life working towards getting into a good company, and I did. Obviously it wasn't on my mind every waking moment, but you know what I mean. It was probably one of my biggest goals that had been set for me by my parents, and I had adopted it for myself over time. Go to a good high school, then get good grades in high school so I can get into a good college. Then work hard at college so I can get into a good company. Never thought any farther than that, because my parents really just wanted me to aim high and land somewhere in a safe, financially stable place. And when I did get my internship offer at a good company last year instead of feeling like I finally got to my goal, I felt kind of empty. 

It wasn't that I didn't truly want to go to work for the company - I really am interested in it, and really do think it's probably the best choice for me right now. It was that I didn't have this next big goal anymore. 

So I decided that I can set my own goals now (wow insane I know). That's what I was missing - the feeling of working towards something that almost seems too much (still possible but arguably pretty hard). And maybe that's what some of you guys feel too. And no, my own goal is not to climb the corporate ladder. That's nice but I want to branch out and try to do other things in my time outside work on things tangential to CS, other things that satisfy the more creative side of me that being a SWE probably can't. 

As others have repeated countlessly, your job is a big part of your life, but it's not all. You don't have to live breathe your work 24/7, and you can be excited about things you plan to do outside of work too. If you feel underwhelmed by your offer, decide if you really want to get another one. If so, why not go for it? If not, you can set your sights on something else to pursue, literally anything you want. Or you can just learn to be content with what you have and take it easy. It's your life and your time, do whatever you want and nothing less. 

**TLDR:** If you don't feel satisfied with the offers you have, then go do something about it. If you're driven by having big goals then go set some more. This doesn't have to be the end of the road for big dreams if you don't want it to be. Your life is what you want to make of it, and if you don't want to stop now then you don't have to. 

(Howeverrrrr if you're too lazy to keep going but still wanna whine about your offer that isn't 'prestigious enough' don't bother - no one wants to read that)"

In addition, 2 of my 3 children have followed in my footsteps. I would recommend that you watch and familiarize yourself with this crazy world by watching and soaking up a good understanding of the ITF, but skip the cert. It will make your grasp of A+ a bit better. This is the training program I ask my interns And own children to follow on their professional development.  IFT (noCert you can find cheap classes on Udemy or Stackskills for this one) A+, Net+, Sec+ then branch off from there. Training aides:

1.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Professor Messer is always a good one since it is pretty much a free resource.
2.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Udemy Mike Myers, very entertaining and fills many of the Messer gaps.
3.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Udemy Jason Dion practice exams. Helps with practice and comfort with testing and a great study guide as you have a chance to review your wrong answers.
4.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Once you get established and makes some $ www.Cybrary.it cost some money, but one heck of a resource. For about 250 a year you get access to all sorts of classes and testing material and best of all LABS to mess around with.  It’s worth it’s weight in gold taking the SOC1,2,3 track alone. Not to mention the MITRE ATT&amp;CK training they started to offer as of late.  In addition to ISC2, Comptia, MS, Cisco etc…
5.	⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Also pricey, oriely books online. Has some really cool features like Cybrary but the feature I like and use myself are the live seminars to brush up on your cyber skills.

Also, if you have absolutely zero IT experience or need an extra boost to pass that A+ exam…Google IT Cert is an Amazing starting point.

Here is the link to the Google I.T. Support Professional Certificate:

https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-support?utm_source=gg&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;campaignid=2024515338&amp;adgroupid=71205997189&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=google%20it&amp;matchtype=p&amp;network=g&amp;devicemodel=&amp;adpostion=&amp;creativeid=354796883711&amp;hide_mobile_promo&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAgc-ABhA7EiwAjev-j-9LpLEHvhIxrxGX5AtiSenXCVVcfWN0aHNh8U4axx3Vvi72USvcARoCV8kQAvD_BwE

There are 5 courses in this professional certificate course and you will need to pass all five:

1.	⁠⁠⁠       Technical Support Fundamentals
2.	⁠⁠⁠       The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking
3.	⁠⁠⁠       Operating Systems and You: Becoming a Power User
4.	⁠⁠⁠       System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services
5.	⁠⁠⁠       IT Security: Defense against the Digital Dark Arts

I believe Google/Coursera is still offering a 7 day trial.  Please Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Also check with your local library as they might offer online resources that I mentioned above for FREE!!

Good Luck!"

r7oqe3,0,2021-12-02,Do companies lower the bar to attract women?,new_grad_12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r7oqe3/do_companies_lower_the_bar_to_attract_women/," I recently undertook an engineering internship at a large tech company (faang). As part of the selection process, it was required that you had to be enrolled in a cs/engineering degree. About 50% of the incoming interns were female, but I soon discovered that, despite that requirement, a number of them had no such qualifications nor experience (maybe a short bootcamp). 

As a female engineer with a 4 year engineering degree, I became very uncomfortable as I saw them struggle to complete basic tasks. I also started to worry about how this may reinforce perceptions about women not being good at coding or companies lowering the bar to attract women. Should I be concerned that my company's approach to hiring women could undermine my reputation? Or that people may wonder about whether I was just a ""diversity hire""? Will standards be lowered in the future when I go to apply for the next job or is this situation unusual?"

r7r11y,2,2021-12-03,Partner with ADHD: Struggling Relationship,peepoWOOpantsu,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/r7r11y/partner_with_adhd_struggling_relationship/,"Hello, this is gonna be a long one but I truly appreciate anyone who took the time to read. I am really having a hard time.

I (F) have been in a relationship with guy 'Alex' (M) for well over a year. We have been living together almost as long as we have been together. For the last 6 months or so its been just me, him and my cat (he claims as ""our"" cat).

A little about me:
I am a only child who was raised and has lived very independently. From a young age I knew how to cook, clean, manage chores, bills, appointments, paperwork etc. I also have a CPTSD diagnosis which was heavily influenced by my last 2 year long relationship with a guy who had severe (and I mean, awful) ADHD and it caused MANY strains in our relationship. Having had a lot of dating experience I am very firm on what I look for in a partner and from day 1 I have expressed this very clearly to my now-boyfriend. I would like someone who is reliable, trustful, responsible, driven, independent and definitely loves me to bits. Full time university student, 20h/week at internship 

Little about my partner:
Hi first experience moving out was with me. I don't think he had clearly expressed what he wants in a partner, but he seems really happy with me aside from my anxiety (cue CPTSD) and stubborn attitude. He got diagnosed with ADHD only after we started dating. I noticed many symptoms and urged him to see a professional and thats how we found out. He currently works from home, no education beyond high school.

To keep this as brief as possible, I will do bullet points where I can

Issue 1: Trust 
- the first few weeks of our relationship he lied about a lot of petty silly things (e.g; I have a drivers license, I totally bought you a present, I know how to cook pretty well, I am super busy with work all the time)
-drivers license lie was especially stupid because he made an elaborate story around it about how he took it recently etc (he doesn't even have a car)
-more into our relationship would make plenty false promises 
-would lie about petty things like what he ate, what work he did today, what plans he has etc

He would chalk it up to him being forgetful and also not wanting to disappoint me or make me upset
As of the last 2-3 ish months there haven't been any such lies, but it still set a tone for the relationship 

Issue 2: Reliability/Forgetful
Now i know this is a common theme with ADHD relationships
- forgetting important appointments
- forgetting bills 
- forgetting promises 
- FORGETTING TO EAT 
- forgetting to do chores I requested (and constantly reminded!!!!)
- forgetting time sensitive favours he agreed to 

Issue 3: motivation 

Work
This one needs a paragraph. Alex does not have any education beyond high school. When we started dating he was working as a full time graphic designer for a friend, and was in a very successful position. But during the first month or two, he took a LOT of days off (to hang out with me) and kept reassuring me its fine. He then started getting less and less work from his friend, but was still getting paid by his friend. I would urge him to get a job as he's basically got paid a living wage for working 5 hours a week, but he was too comfortable and wouldn't put in sincere effort. This went on for about 7-8 months, and his friend started paying him less and less, towards the end he wasn't working at all. Eventually he got worried and looked for another job. As soon as his friend found out he stopped paying Alex. Alex was so sure he got the job, but he didn't. He applied again and got into a company where he worked for 1½ months, before they basically laid him off due to covid and not being enough work. Alex just spent the bext two-three weeks working only 20h/week part time another job, because he had money enough to sustain himself. Finally after me pushing him again and again he's in a precarious employment working full time, but the contract states you can be let go anytime.

Food
Even before he started his medication, Alex complained he didn't have an appetite and certain foods would make him sick (acid reflux). He has a medication foe this but forgetfully doesn't take it regularly. Now he complains he doesn't eat enough because of that and hid ADHD medication, but he loves snacking on candy, pizza, take out etc. OR he will eat whatever I cook him. But I'm too busy to make him healthy meals! And beyond that he doesn't know how to cook (he lied about knowing that). He says he doesn't cook because it takes too long, and he wastes his time, and sometimes doesn't like what he makes. I wouldn't have a problem with him getting ubereats if he could financially support it. I used to be so patient and willing to teach him how to cook, but he used to be so uninterested, that now when he asks I just get annoyed and impatient. He used to say ""I don't need you to teach me i can learn myself if I have to, from youtube or whatever"" and now he gets upset that I dont have the patience. 

What he's done about these issues:

- Promised to never lie (okay...?)
- on ADHD medication 
- did therapy for 6 sessions (said it wasn't helpful, is not doing it again) 
- says he's ""working on it""

Good stuff about us :)
- we love each other, A LOT
- our friends and families love our relationship 
- romance is great! 
- we deeply care 
- we are good at dividing house chores
- emotional connection is the best

What I am really struggling with is impatience, I suppose. These are conversations we've been having for over a year, and from my perspective there's been little improvement. Part of me is worried this is just how he is and how he's gonna be and I gotta move on if he's not right for me from a practical framework.

They’re doing their best to support me and my siblings, I’m working a minimum wage job while maintaining a high GPA and volunteering and doing internships,  all so I can get to grad school and get licensed and have more financial stability in my life which my family has never had. Its worth the grind, and I am doing everything I can since so much has been sacrificed for my success (including my parents entire lives moving here), but I am so so tired. I can’t stop yet, and I can’t afford to lose motivation, but I am getting more and more tired. I know the correct strategy is to take time off and lessen the workload, but that is simply not an option here. I can’t physically afford it, much less afford it on the time scale as my youth is the best time I have to ensure stability while I have the energy and no major responsibilities like babies or a mortgage. A lot of the advice I have gotten from counsellors or friends have been: take time off, or relax when you can, but I feel like that is a privileged mindset to have as that means relaxing time will not be a detriment. It assumes there IS time, which with my workload, is not very possible. Plus, its very difficult to relax when looming instability is a fear. 

So, I dont like talking about this with people in person anymore. But, I am tired and I have a long hill to get up and I must maintain speed. How do other people in this same struggle motivate themself to continue? What are cheap/free ways to relax that don’t use up a lot of time? How do you remain optimistic?"

As part of the selection process, it was required that you had to be enrolled in a cs/engineering degree. About 50% of the incoming interns were female, but I soon discovered that, despite that hard requirement, a number of them had no such qualifications nor experience (maybe a short bootcamp).

As a female engineer with a 4 year software engineering degree, I became very uncomfortable as I saw them struggle to complete basic tasks. I also started to worry about how this may reinforce perceptions about women not being good at coding or companies lowering the bar to attract women. Should I be concerned that my company's approach to hiring women could undermine my credibility? Or that people may wonder about whether I was just a ""diversity hire""? Will standards be lowered in the future when I go to apply for the next job or something only the big companies do?"

I overslept my engineering communications presentation today as well. I just feel lost and clueless. Thankfully, I have an internship offer for this summer. I had three other interviews after that one but before that decision came out (CS tutor, product support intern, another SWE intern) but they all failed and I got rejected (sent out so many applications but the one I got was through the school career fair). I have one upcoming phone screen with an insurance company and I feel like doing it just for interview practice, should I do it? My resume is fine though (gotten 13 OAs, 5 phone screens with one coming up and 4 interviews(one of the companies didn't use a phone screen, it was straight to interview)).

r7so7r,1,2021-12-03,Should I graduate later to give myself more time to experience college?,CauliflowerNew2102,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/r7so7r/should_i_graduate_later_to_give_myself_more_time/,"My entire college career, I've put all my effort building a great resume  so I could get my dream internship. I recently achieved that dream, and due to taking classes part time this quarter, I was able to reflect on  myself a little and join various clubs.  Doing so, it made me realize  that I completely neglected other things many things about college, like  having a social life and building a network of peers and friends and it  has been something that I now regret deeply (COVID hasn't helped with  that either).

At this point, I am a  junior, and will graduate in 1 year by taking \~3 CS classes a quarter,  but in doing so I will not be able to give them the same level of  commitment as I did during my lighter load this quarter.  While 3 CS  classes is something that wasn't really a problem for me in the past,  3-4 classes a quarter would consume a large majority of my time and I'm  not sure I can participate in much of anything before I graduate like  joining other clubs/organizations as well as studying abroad.  While I'm  sure 3 CS classes isn't a problem for many other students, it's pushing  it a little for me.  I am thinking about extending my graduation by two  years by taking a lighter load (5 year graduations are actually the  norm here at my school).  This would lighten my load, and allow me to  participate in more clubs as well as study abroad (something I've always  wanted to do).

The issue is that I  really only need 1 or 2 additional quarters to graduate in a  comfortable time frame, instead of the extra full year to take the rest  of my classes, but the senior capstone sequence at my university  requires a commitment of 3 consecutive quarters in the final year.  So  in the last 2 or 3 quarters I would essentially only be taking 1 or 2  classes each quarter along with the capstone project.  Taking an extra  year would allow me to take an additional three internships (two winter  and 1 summer), but it feels almost useless when I've already secured my  dream internship (other then letting me try out other companies as well  as visit the East Coast).  Why intern when I could just graduate early  and start my career?  I've considered spending that time traveling as  well.  The good news is that it would essentially cost the same due to  scholarships; I would actually make more money compared to my 4 year  year due to previous internships.

I  understand that in the long term, the extra year doesn't matter much.   However, because I'll have so little to do in my 5th year it feels like  it would almost be a waste.  Sure I would be able to experience college a  little longer, and more importantly grow as an individual which will be  more difficult to do in the real world.  But in the end is it worth it?   I feel like at this point I should just suck it up, graduate on time  and try to devote as much time as I can to extracurricular."

Please note certain formatting errors are not a concern because the formatting changed slightly when I redacted information. So any weird formatting like spaces or commas, weird sentence breaks or anything like that is okay because it's **not** in the originals. 
________
**Here are my concerns**

1) The format of the entire resume. So this means the columns and structure of the resume. As mentioned any small weird things are not in the originals but what I am referring to here is the overall layout

2) The removal of the last job. The one that says Design and Marketing Intern. I removed it to fit the education because otherwise it becomes two pages. I felt maybe those tasks in that job would be something I should keep but I simply couldn't if I wanted to add the new skills and projects section. I also removed several bullet points from other positions. 

3) I removed my IT bootcamp. Again because having it there would push it onto a second page and with the new skills and projects section the bootcamp could not fit

I'd definitely be more willing to return to Meraki than C1, but I also feel like I might still want to try for other places for new grad. Also not sure how Meraki holds on resume vs c1. I know the decision is ultimately mine but I'd really like your guys' thoughts especially if you've had experience with Meraki in the past. Thanks!"

From some posts in here and some past answers to questions, I’ve seen that maybe I should give up hope on hearing back for either internships since I haven’t received even a HireVue interview and my status has stayed in “under consideration”. Any thoughts? 

I also kind of want to reach out to the recruiter (she said if I have any questions to ask her) but I don’t want to come across as too pushy especially since WarnerMedia doesn’t seem to really give contact info for follow ups.


EDIT: I figured I’d paste this here in case anyone else that applied was wondering but this is what the recruiter told me: 

“Hi, I hope you are doing well! All final decisions should be made by the end of this week/early next. Definitely continue to apply for positions!”

EDIT 2: unsurprisingly i was rejected"

1. $8000 (taxed at applicable rates)

Or

2. Corporate housing (4 roommates per 2 bedrooms)

I’m thinking about taking the $8000 because I found some Airbnb’s in the area that cost 4,000 for the entire duration that I will be there. Which will leave me with $2000-$3000 leftover.

On the other hand I want to take the corporate housing so that I can bond with the other interns. Plus the corporate housing has access to a pool, gym, lounge are, etc. I just don’t like that it will be 4 people in a 2 bedroom apartment.

Please help!!!!"

For some people this is not much, but I am trying my best) I am taking are not really leaving me much time to do other things. I want to graduate with as little debt as possible hence why the credit load. I also have no projects made since my decision to become as CS major happened pretty much right before this semester started.

I'm not sure what exactly I am doing wrong as of right now. I don't know if I should try and fit in an edX or LinkedIn Learning course or something on my free time to develop my knowledge on any of the languages aforementioned, or if I should be doing something else right now.

r8dpiw,1,2021-12-03,Job Dilemma as a Fifth Year Mechanical Engineer.,JaosnCadmus,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r8dpiw/job_dilemma_as_a_fifth_year_mechanical_engineer/," I am currently in my fifth year as a mechanical engineering student, set to graduate in May 2022. I have been in the process of looking for fulltime employment post graduation. In doing so I was down to two companies, one being a food manufacturer (company 1), and an equipment manufacturer/distributer (company 2). Throughout my time at college, I did 2 co-ops (these are 7 month work internships where you take a summer and a semester off at school to gain more work experience), and an internship with a different food manufacturer (a competitor of company 1). Therefore taking a job at company 1 would be more familiar and I have more experience in this field.

I had gone through both of the interview processes and company 1, this was done through three total interviews. First was a 30 minute in person, then a 2.5hr three part virtual interview, followed finally by a 5hr onsite plant visit/interview. Company 1 then extended me an offer for a reliability engineering role with a starting salary of 80k. This was back on November 11th. However, I had an interview with company 2 on November 15th, so I asked to have until before Thanksgiving November 23rd/24th to make a decision on company 1. After finished the interview with company 2 I was told that I would hear something before the 23rd/24th in order to make a decision. It was November 22nd and I have heard nothing from company 2, thus, I decided to accept the role as a reliability engineer at company 1. This was because I was too afraid to say no and risk not getting the role. I was relieved to have an offer from one company and was more content than anything to just relax and not have to stress over job searches.

Fast forward to yesterday, December 2nd. Company 2 called me and extended an offer as a technical sales engineer with a starting salary of 70k and profit sharing for my first year (estimated at 7-12k). The profit sharing portion is due to the 12 months of training that is part of my sales engineer role, wherein the goal is for me to learn not necessarily sell. On December 2nd, I initially told the hiring manager at company 2 that I had accepted a role with company 1 and I said that I had wished company 2 would have extended an offer to me as I personally felt that I would be better at company 2. This ended our discussion. It is now today, December 3rd. I called company 2's hiring manager back saying how I feel I've made a mistake and that I would like to spend some more time with him to talk about the role if its not too late. To my surprise, the hiring manager said that he told himself he would wait 24hrs before telling the HR manager that I had declined as he felt I would be a great addition to his team. This led to a half hour discussion about the role, first year and lots of other job specifics. Company 2's offer expires December 10th.

This concludes the back story and now I'm at a dilemma. I am unsure how to proceed. I am worried that I cannot fully do the reliability engineer role (I'm not the smartest engineer), yet at the same time I have already signed the offer letter with company 1 and I don't want to renege. However, I feel that the sales engineer role is something that I would enjoy more and I kind of want to give it a try. The compensation packages are roughly the same, and there's relocation with both. I feel like I want to go with company 2 but I am worried that I don't know what to do. This is like a massive fork in the road, both jobs are good but they lead down completely different career paths. In addition, I feel bad accepting company 2's offer since I already accepted company 1's. I suppose I am looking to see if there's anyone out there with either similar experience or willing to lend advise as I contemplate and think through this process and ultimately make a job decision."

Would love some input!

I really want to do both internship (DD Summer, Snap Spring) but I can only move Snap to fall (which I don't prefer since I'm not sure if I can get full time return offer if I do it during Junior Fall + not too sure if I want to do Snap offseason as I really want to do FB, Stripe during that time). Here are my options:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do DD Summer and reinterview for Snap Spring - risk not getting internship
2. Do DD Summer and take Snap Fall then try to move to Spring later - less risk since I would be able to do Snap Fall at least but might not be possible/recruiter might get mad
3. Do DD Summer and Snap Fall

r8fm7y,1,2021-12-03,A Dilemma Between Two Jobs.,JaosnCadmus,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/r8fm7y/a_dilemma_between_two_jobs/,"I am currently in my fifth year as a mechanical engineering student, set to graduate in May 2022. I have been in the process of looking for fulltime employment post-graduation. In doing so I was down to two companies, one being a food manufacturer (company 1), and an equipment manufacturer/distributer (company 2). Throughout my time at college, I did 2 co-ops (these are 7-month work internships where you take a summer and a semester off at school to gain more work experience), and an internship with a different food manufacturer (a competitor of company 1). Therefore, taking a job at company 1 would be more familiar and I have more experience in this field.

I had gone through both interview processes and company 1, this was done through three total interviews. First was a 30 minute in person, then a 2.5hr three-part virtual interview, followed finally by a 5hr onsite plant visit/interview. Company 1 then extended me an offer for a reliability engineering role with a starting salary of 80k. This was back on November 11th. However, I had an interview with company 2 on November 15th, so I asked to have until before Thanksgiving November 23rd/24th to decide on company 1. After finished the interview with company 2 I was told that I would hear something before the 23rd/24th to make a decision. It was November 22nd and I have heard nothing from company 2, thus, I decided to accept the role as a reliability engineer at company 1. This was because I was too afraid to say no and risk not getting the role. I was relieved to have an offer from one company and was more content than anything to just relax and not have to stress over job searches.

Fast forward to yesterday, December 2nd. Company 2 called me and extended an offer as a technical sales engineer with a starting salary of 70k and profit sharing for my first year (estimated at 7-12k). The profit-sharing portion is due to the 12 months of training that is part of my sales engineer role, wherein the goal is for me to learn not necessarily sell. On December 2nd, I initially told the hiring manager at company 2 that I had accepted a role with company 1 and I said that I had wished company 2 would have extended an offer to me as I personally felt that I would be better at company 2. This ended our discussion. It is now today, December 3rd. I called company 2's hiring manager back saying how I feel I've made a mistake and that I would like to spend some more time with him to talk about the role if its not too late. To my surprise, the hiring manager said that he told himself he would wait 24hrs before telling the HR manager that I had declined as he felt I would be a great addition to his team. This led to a half hour discussion about the role, first year and lots of other job specifics. Company 2's offer expires December 10th.

This concludes the back story and now I'm at a dilemma. I am unsure how to proceed. I am worried that I cannot fully do the reliability engineer role (I'm not the smartest engineer), yet at the same time I have already signed the offer letter with company 1 and I don't want to renege. However, I feel that the sales engineer role is something that I would enjoy more and I kind of want to give it a try. The compensation packages are roughly the same, and there's relocation with both. I feel like I want to go with company 2 but I am worried that I don't know what to do. This is like a massive fork in the road, both jobs are ‘good’ but they lead down completely different career paths. In addition, I feel bad accepting company 2's offer since I already accepted company 1's. I suppose I am looking to see if there's anyone out there with either similar experience or willing to lend advise as I contemplate and think through this process and ultimately make a job decision."

I'll spare the details about my passion and appreciation for japanese culture and the language, but during my time there, I've had the bestest of times. Expat community is great, food is heavenly, work-hard-play-hard culture is very much aligned with my mentality.  

About me:  

\-Accounting - CPA Audit in a big 4 firm  

Skills: -SQL -a bit of RPA 

Languages: -English (native) -French (native)  -Japanese - JLPT N2 (although that was 3 years ago)   

Next move:  After just recently receiving my designation, and planning to move to Japan, hopefully, by mid-2022,  I've been pondering on my next move: Stay at my firm and request and wait for an internal transfer, which may be a painfully long process that may take a year or so? Or, apply for jobs via recruiters once more and have higher chances of being placed in Japanese national companies, for which I've heard are notoriously big on overtime and power harassment ( different from work-hard play-hard in my books). 

In terms of jobs, while I believe my audit experience may box and limit my job prospects, I am highly interested in pursuing a position in FP&amp;A or analyst jobs (worked as an analyst during my internship in Japan).  

Goal: Live comfortably in Japan while working at a fulfilling job and enjoying the more vibrant lifestyle.  

If anyone has any insights on what would be the ideal move, or has been or is in a similar position, feel free to share!"

r8g05i,2,2021-12-03,Cisco Anyconnect SBL supposed to work this way?,kenjitamurako,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/r8g05i/cisco_anyconnect_sbl_supposed_to_work_this_way/,"TLDR; Am I misunderstanding how Cisco Anyconnect SBL is supposed to work?  Allowing a configured Windows device to connect to the VPN before the Windows user has logged on.

Or does SBL not do that and there is a hard requirement that someone has signed into the laptop with the same password that is being given to the user?

**POST**

I'm working at a help desk where we just got flooded with new remote users on the same day.  Most of our help desk members are new to the company (&lt;5 months).  Our process usually works but we experienced a sizeable hiccup with several users and so I think I've figured out what happened and was hoping to get it verified.

We're shipping laptops with Cisco Anyconnect including the SBL module and it goes flawlessly as long as this condition is met:
Someone has signed into the computer as the user with the password that will be provided to the user before it has been shipped.

We had several remote users call in to get help getting connected and the common patterns were that they would get Password incorrect or Domain not present error messages.  To resolve this requires having the system administrators add the user to a remediation group and telling the users enter the url for an anyconnect remediation address.

I'm thinking the process for when it works is this:

1. Windows remembers the password for the last login to the domain for that user and allows a login even without connection to the domain

2. The user can then seamlessly use the anyconnect client to connect as they are logged into a trusted account

I think with the failed users one of two things is happening.

1. Someone has not logged into the computer as the user at all (Domain not present errors)

2.  Someone has assigned a temporary password, signed in as the user to verify profile settings, and then set the password back to the generated password for the user (Password Incorrect)

I think it's understandable given:
 
The volume of users starting on the same day (17)

The short time frame given for the onboarding (some tickets for onboarding came in the afternoon of the day before)

Our lack of preparation (we were just given authorization to start imaging a new model of laptop as they were being tested)

The service desk was unusually busy the week before as we had just moved from an on-premise VOIP solution to 8x8 and although we were expected to support it our department was largely left out of the process.  (The computer operations project lead for that also passed away from covid midway into the preparation and we were given a hard deadline as the phone numbers would expire if not reclaimed in 8x8 within 30 days of cancelling our Comcast VOIP services)

And the fact that most of the time leading up to that date there were only 1.5 employees in the department (there are four of us and I've been with the company four months as a level one, the supervisor took a two week vacation leading to the date, the level two went on vacation the week before, and we have a part time intern)

I know I made the mistake on a couple of laptops of using a temporary password to sign in as a couple of our users had generated passwords that were a combination of four different words with 4+ special characters.  I had thought SBL allowed a VPN connection before logon but either I'm wrong on that or our implementation is misconfigured.

Am I misunderstanding how Cisco Anyconnect SBL is supposed to work?  Allowing a configured Windows device to connect to the VPN before the Windows user has logged on.

Or does SBL not do that and there is a hard requirement that someone has signed into the laptop with the same password that is being given to the user?

If it's the latter we might be in trouble because the company has in the past few years moved to a leased laptop model and brought on more remote users.  As those leases end we're planning to use a scanstate/loadstate script combination to move users to new laptops.  Those scripts are a combination of USMT and robocopy so Windows cached credentials are not brought over and we do not have those users passwords."

My LC is okay, and I nailed the technical interview 50% of the time.

However, I always failed at the final round for having no experience working in a real job. I applied for a bunch of internships back in Sophomore and Junior but none of the companies in my college's city (Lubbock) want to hired international students (even though they liked me and my resume). Thus, I just ignored internships hunting and tried to finish my degree as soon as possible before my scholarship ran out (worst mistake ever...).

I applied to everything and get the most interviews from entry Java positions from tech consulting companies.

I've been doing this for 6 months and only have 8 months left to find a job (because of my visa).

My goal is to become a pentester and it seems like I'll need certs but idk if I could balance getting relevant certs alongside my current course loads. Fortunately my university has an internship program that I qualify for next year and I plan on taking advantage of that, and I also plan on applying to internships on my own this summer. I'll be looking for basically any kind of IT work since I've never applied for internships before so I figure I should just try to get whatever experience that I can, but in particular I'm leaning towards sysadmin or software dev internships. My current 'portfolio' so far just involves a few programming projects. I made a password manager with a GUI and AES encryption which I programmed from scratch, I didn't just import a random python module to implement it for me, I made all the necessary modules from built-in python alone. The randomization uses true random numbers rather than pseudo random numbers or random numbers generated from built-in functions. The program scrapes true random data from a site and then uses that to generate the random input for the encryption. The other projects I have are much simpler than this, they are just advertisement bots which I made GUIs for so you wouldn't have to run them from a command line. Right now I'm working on an NLTK website that generates text from data scraped off some sites. I also plan on making my own linux distro (to show that I'm familiar with linux) and setting up a homelab soon so I can run some scripts 24/7 for me. I plan on doing some freelance tech support that I'll advertise on local craigslist-like sites which I plan to advertise via automation scripts that I'll run from my homelab, and also I'll try to make some crypto arbitrage bots as well. 

Aside from projects, I'm planning on going through either some opensecuritytraining courses or tryhackme's free beginner paths, or both. I'm also going to do the overthewire CTFs and eventually start doing hackthebox.

So that is basically what I'm up to nowadays. I figured I should just continue messing around like this since I'm still in university. However certs are kind of bothering me... I'm not sure I have the time to study for a cert given my current day to day schedule. Is it really necessary for me to get some cert while I'm still in school? The certs that are de facto required for pentesting careers like the OSCP are not things that I can spend the time to study for right now and I don't at all expect a pentesting job right out of school, I'm pretty sure pentesting isn't entry level. So instead I plan on getting just an IT job that is above helpdesk, ideally my internship program would help with that, and then study for the OSCP or something after I graduate while I'm working an actual job. I assume a lot of you guys work in the infosec field, so please let me know about my current plans. Does this sound good? I will legitimately consider any advice given since the thought of getting a job and making money is stressing me out. Apparently covid made it more difficult for people to land jobs and I don't want to fall behind in life. I apologize if my writing is all over the place in this post, it's exam season and really late at night :)"

Some topics I encountered led me to look into doing a PhD. 

 As of last semester I have transferred to an online top 75 degree program from a traditional top 50 ranked program. My dilemma is this, after transferring to the online program I realized that I needed to start doing research if I were to be serious about doing a PhD. This is something I'm more than willing to do. However, compared to my last institution the research opportunities are not as many nor as diverse. 

So I have two options: 

Return to my last university and reach out to professors to work with. Work within said institution and gain my references that way. 

Or, use the flexibility of the online degree to apply for REU's and other research internships to gain the experience needed. 

I am not sure which would make me more competitive to top graduate programs and I am wanting to aim for the top 20 schools in computer or cognitive science. If I apply to the right REU's or research internships would that be more beneficial despite the online programs less prestigious name? Or do you think I should go work in an established  ML/CV lab in person at an institution I attend. I have two years left and want to make the most of it. Also maybe worth noting, my previous brick and mortar school is top 25ish for Cognitive Science.

Just a side note all these rankings mean jack and shit to me. But they might mean something to an admissions committee and there is more research coming out of the better ranked of the two. 

I have been racking my brain over this for weeks and I'm losing my mind. Anyone with any insight wanna help?"

Over the past two years i have become so engaged with judicial matters especially in the area of 'Access to Justice', so much that my friends doubt if I really studied Business Administration. They will always go like ""how come you are a paralegal when we all studied Business together?"". 

Well, the answer is not far fetched. In my third year i decided to intern with a Non Governmental Organization (POS Foundation) which is also a Civil society organization and currently serves as the secretariat for the Ghana Human Rights NGOs Forum. POS Foundation is also currently the facilitating organization of the JUSTICE FOR ALL PROGRAMME FOR REMAND PRISONERS; A State driven intervention programme organized by the Judicial Service, in collaboration with the Attorney General's Department, the Prison Service and Police Service which makes justice accessible to remand prisoners by organizing In-Prison Court sittings to adjudicate remand cases that may have been long over due. I have remained with them ever since and this is borne out of my desire to be a channel through which a less privileged soul regains his or her freedom.

Having been to almost every prison in Ghana (Nsawam Medium Security Prisons in the Eastern Region, Winneba Local Prisons and Ankaful Prisons in the Central Region, Takoradi and Tarkwa Prisons in the Western Region, Sunyani Prisons in the Brong Ahafo Region, Kpando and Ho Prisons in the Volta Region, Kumasi Central Prisons in the Ashanti Region and the Tamale Central Prisons in the Northern Region) i can say that i have seen enough congestion of Human beings to last me a lifetime. In fact almost every prison in Ghana currently holds more than three times its design capacity. 

One would ask, what the cause of this over congestion could be. Simple, a lack of an alternative sentencing policy. Let me give you an example.

Recently at one the interviews which usually precede the court sittings I interviewed a 23 year 'young' man who had spent about 2 years already in prison 'on remand' and here is his story.

He had cooked some rice and was about to eat but went inside the room to take some water only to come out and find a chicken eating his food, in a bid to ward it off the object he threw hit the animal too hard it died. The owner after mobbing the young man together with some of his friends handed him over to the police. For the life of a chicken this young man spent two years in prison.

First of all, this young man did not intend to kill the chicken. Secondly, even if he did, the event of having to spend two years in prison could have been avoided if there was an alternative sentencing policy where the court would have asked that he either pay for the chicken or do community service of a sort without having to be held on remand. Unfortunately that was not the case. This puts out another question of what we prioritize most as a people; Humanity or the Law?

Now this is just one out of the many minor cases that land less fortunate people in prison on remand and with the way it is, everyone of us is a potential candidate of prison.

In 2014 a 72 year old man name Zoro Kuta was released by the Justice for All Programme. For a suspected charge of manslaughter Zoro Kuta spent 36 years on remand📷 (remanded in 1978) he was discharged unconditionally. 

Rashida Halidu who suffered abuse in the hands of her boyfriend was arrested and later remanded after her boyfriend beat her up till she lost consciousness only to wake in the hospital to be accused of stabbing her boyfriend to death. According to her the boyfriend msy have stabbed himself fearing that he had killed her. Rashida was pregnant for God's sake, yet this young woman was kept on remand till she even gave birth in the prison. A gross violation of the right of the innocent child. The baby was already 5months old when Rashida was released.

Article 14 (4) of the 1992 constitution states that a person arrested and detained and has not recieved trial within a 'reasonable period of time' is entitled to unconditional release or release subject to conditions necessary for reappearance in judicial proceedings (i.e bail). As to what constitutes 'reasonable period of time' is not made clear by the constitution and is a debate for another day.

I can go on and on with the pathetic stories but what is the way forward?

The law should first be to reform before punishing, however it seems like though the Ghanaian constitution is only focused on punishing. Section 294 of the criminal procedure and other offences act (Act 30) outlines the various punishments that can be meted out for various crimes, unfortunately it doesn't create room for alternative sentencing aside incarceration and fines. 

For this reason judges will tell you it is not their fault u have to be sentenced to 1 year in prison for misdemeanor such as stealing a chicken.

What then is the way forward? 

Government should introduce a non-custodial sentencing policy where other methods like community service or parole can be used o punish minor crimes instead of incarcerating people who will come out of jail more hardened haven been exposed to hardened criminals. this way, the individual is reformed by the same community he or she has offended. 

Countries like Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa are already using this method and it is working out fine for them. They have little to no cases of over congestion in their prisons. 

Prisoners are also Humans and should therefore still retain their dignity to some extent and if it is true that 'you can judge a society by how well it treats it's prisoners' as stipulated by Fyodor Dostoevsky then it will be such a huge shame that Ghana's Human rights status is an abysmal failure.   
Aside the fact that these people are made to sleep in compacted rows like pieces of sardines, a prisoner in Ghana survives on GHS1.80p/day which is less than 60cents. Even a primary school pupil spends more than that daily and so you can imagine the kind of meals these people are served.

The Justice for All Programme may be intervening now, but it is only solving the problem by trimming the branches, the only way to solve it completely is to deal with the root cause and that is by introducing a non-custodial sentencing policy. 

I therefore call on Mr President Nana Addo Danquah Akuffo Addo, members of perliament and all stakeholders concerned to consider a reform in this sector of the judiciary."

I've been in for \~3 years now with 3 years to go, and i finally realized I need to get on top of myself, take advantage of TA and get my college knocked out before I get out (ideally at the end of my 6 years) I want to go into SWE as my civilian career, I've been doing lots of research couldn't find find specific answers to my questions so I came here.  Reasons for wanting SWE is I like computer stuff in general, and have always wanted to learn coding/software design/security etc.  AND I want to be able to find a job I can enjoy doing for the rest of my life as well as get paid well to do it.  In my research I keep seeing stuff about FAANGS being best, but that there are also plenty of opportunities to make 6 figures not in FAANGS.  I'm not afraid to put in the time and work to make it into a FAANG job if that's really the best bet.   I was thinking along the lines of doing GERs/Undergraduate and groundwork during my remaining tenure, because I REALLY want to have the experience of physically going to college and learning with other like-minded individuals.  I'd also like to do internship/s while going through college.

My questions are:

A: SWE vs CS Degree, does it matter ( \[in my mind that is like Major/Minor\] which and why for a high paying/good SWE job?

B: Are there multiple degrees I need? So I could potentially get a full degree through TA (Tuition Assistance) online?  Then get the following degree or w/e with GI Bill in person after I'm out?

C: Best route for being able to do all this AND go to college in person? (very important to me)

D: What should I be doing towards the goal of getting internships while going to college?

E: Recommended colleges or increased opportunities towards FAANG jobs? Like I said, I don't mind putting in the work to get there

D: No programming/coding experience, What are some recommended books or material I should look into beforehand?

Feel free to add any additional concerns/obstacles I may have missed.

r8obap,12,2021-12-04,Should I stay in CS?,Virtual_Eggplant_281,PennStateUniversity,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/r8obap/should_i_stay_in_cs/,"I am currently a junior in Pre-Engineering, with my original intended major being CS. Of my coursework, I only have 464 and 431W/483W left for prescribed courses. Both of them are scheduled for next semester. Everything else is electives, department lists, or gen-eds. Because of my starting year being 2019, and the fact that I had 14 credits my first semester, I am sitting at 59 credits, which is still within the credit window for me to choose whatever Engineering major I want. Taking an extra year to graduate isn't a concern for me.

If someone were to ask me why I originally wanted to be in CS. I would say it is because I thought computer and programming were cool and interesting, during my senior year of HS. However, as I progressed through my courses, I found myself slowly becoming disinterested.

In my spare time, I don't see myself programming side projects like people usually recommend. I started doing different projects when Covid started, but I stop halfway for each one, as my interest wane. Not to mention, I got rejected by all the internships I applied for this Fall, which was especially disheartening.

The question now becomes should I switch to another major, and if I do switch, what major should I even switch to? I have 0 idea about the other engineering majors, beside Computer Engineering. Even if I do switch, I fear I'll find myself in the same situation again."

It was 30 minutes, with an intern watching with nothing but a ""ok, keep a diary, see you next month"" at the ending. Thought we would discuss medication, that she'd actually understand the urgency. I left feeling like my cry for help was met with nothing. It's been almost a month since then.

I have one friend, and I have an ldr boyfriend. My extreme anxiety and codependency keeps pushing him away. I can't tell him that I'm planning on not existing anymore. I've told him I feel like dying is the only way out, but as an off-hand comment while crying about every other thing in my life. I know he doesn't think I mean it. 

My parents never cared about my mental health. They didn't care when I told them that I couldn't walk out of the house with fear of entering my college, because of the trauma I suffered there. Never cared when I used to hurt myself or say I wanted to die. They wholeheartedly believe I have no reason to hate my entire existance, even though they're such a big reason for it. 

I just puked twice off of the feeling in my chest. My chest is always hurting. It hurts so much. It hurts when I'm jealous, it hurts when I argue, it hurts when I start thinking about pretty much anything.  By monday i should have the results of my heart exam, but I know that it's probably fine. It's all in my head, it's my head making it hurt. 

But it doesn't stop hurting no matter what, and I want it gone. I haven't decided how to go, but I so badly want to. I just want all feelings to stop. Being alone is terrifying. My boyfriend and my best friend don't deserve having to worry about me. My boyfriend especially, he needs less of me now. I honestly think he doesn't need me at all, I'm the one who needs him. 

I have to go to my part time just in 2 hours, but I don't want to show up, I want to wander off. Maybe I just won't return home on my way back from the shift instead. I just can't take one more second of this pain."

Finishing up bootcamp in a week, and one of my cohort mates gave me the hard sell; Come work with him at a startup that is a platform for blockchain securities based (remote job)

\-He just got hired as a ""analyst / front-end dev"" saying his time would be split 80%/20%

\- wants me to work purely as a front-end dev

\-says he got hired at low 6 figures

\-is a friend of the CEO

\-I would work as an unpaid intern for 3 months, and then would make at least as much as him.

I'm an old man, and have no interest working for free. But, he's going around to other people in cohort, and I'm worried that they may end up taking the offer, and building projects for the company, only to be let go after the 3 month period.

1. Is this a common thing in the field for entry-level developers to go through?
2. If they are hell bent on accepting the offer, what are the important questions to ask of the company?"

r8ygy8,6,2021-12-04,My mentor wants me to extend my senior year until December but financially it's not feasible,trvmlyncrl,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/r8ygy8/my_mentor_wants_me_to_extend_my_senior_year_until/,"Little backstory, I won't be long: 

I'm a senior who was expected to graduate in May. I ended up getting an interview for a development program, but it turns out it is for people with experience because it's as if you're being trained to be a full time employee. In other words, it has a lot more expectations than an intern that I'm not quite prepared for. I asked how I got the email for an interview anyway, turns out it's because I filled out a form with an anticipated graduation date of May 2022.

I have experience with clubs, a FIRST robotics team as well as project experience. No internships; aside from 2020, I was either working, in summer school, or just didn't get one.

Now I'm at senior year with no real experience and obviously I'm a little scared. I was not going to apply for engineering jobs straight out of school because I doubt I would get hired, instead I was going to work elsewhere and apply later. I didn't expect to get into the engineering field for the next five years or so. Anyway, my mentor suggested extending my senior year until December to make way for an internship in the summer (no I don't have one lined up yet). He said it would be difficult to get a job without an internship because of competition.

The problem is, financial aid cut me off as an adult student + six year academic journey. I already got a private loan for this year and an apartment lease. After this year, I'm tapped out. I would have to either renew my lease or move to a place that can do month to month. Then, I'd also have to find $$ for tuition, living expenses, what not. I'd probably take one or two classes but I'd have to work somewhere full time. 

I hope I'm making sense but I'm so confused on what to do; I understand WHY my mentor suggested that but it's not a great option. I'm extremely defeated; I'm thinking about how I worked for six years for a degree that I won't be able to use.

Now generally I see that people with 1-2 years of experience go for junior positions and 2-5 mid and so on. 

For me, I have worked for a very large financial firm as a year long intern, and then continued to work 20hr a week till I graduated (1.6 years) (this week). From my years of experience, I'm technically a junior developer. But - I have done a lot of side projects on my own for the fun of it. I have designed and developed apps inspired by Instagram and tinder. For those apps, I built everything that's needed to pass as an MVP. 

Looking at classification again, I feel like I have way more knowledge than an average junior developer. I'm proficient using React, Angular, Node.js &amp; python to the point where I don't think I will struggle at all picking up projects written in these languages and Frameworks. I can also navigate my way around react native and java.

I haven't sent in any actual applications but looking at a lot of job descriptions, i can confidently do most of the work required for a mid level position. But my biggest concern is that if I apply for those jobs, i will just get rejected based on experience on paper. How would you best approach this situation? Thanks.

TLDR: Recently graduated, have junior level years of experience, comfortable with most of the responsibilities for a mid level position. A good few significant personal projects. How to approach applying for jobs to get the best possible entry/salary?"

I'm a senior in CS at a top-30 CS school. I graduate spring 2022. My GPA is 3.9. I have one internship from a non-tech company last summer; it has a &gt;10B market cap but it's definitely not a huge player in the software scene.

I've been thinking that it would be dumb of me not to grind out a ton of interview prep to get into a big tech company and get that juicy TC. However, from what I can see most of the hiring for these places takes place starting in August and September, so it appears I may have had this insight a bit late.

I'm in the process of interviewing at Epic Systems among other places. My question is, with winter break coming up, should I start binging Leetcode and applying to FAANG over break/in the spring, or should I take what I can get for now and then study intensely for/apply to FAANG next August/September (or a few years down the line after I have some YOE in my pocket).

Any insights about the hiring pattern for new grads within FAANG would be appreciate. My fear is that I do a ton of interview prep now, get in someplace that doesn't have a high barrier to entry, and then forget it all by the time I actually would need what I've learned.

I'll try to make this short cause i don't wanna bore you and i'm really tired of this.

I work for a consultancy agency, we do networks and web apps and provide servers, this is a small company with on premise infraestructure in 3 data centers. 

I started working here on february 2020 as a intern, my first month was at factory that the company provides de IT department for. I was doing 2.5 hours from home to the factory and another 2.5 hours back, i was being paid 1500 Mexican pesos as an intern, (where i live you need like 8-9k to pay rent and such and be tight on money, no luxuries). Anyway, after that month i started developing some scripts and doing stuff like ""help desk"" but also was managing linux servers, vpn accounts and configuring databases for the newly created development department that consisted in two guys and me. Now it's April and they tell they're gonna hire me and pay me 6900MXN for the second half of april, i still doing the same stuff with some javascript and python stuff (which was actually i was accepted as an intern for) and then a network project comes in june. They pay for my transportation and food as i'm now asked to be on site every single day. 1.5hours from home to client and 1.5back but now i still doing the same work as before and networking stuff like configuring switches, ip phones and whatever you name, it was government so we had to do everything for them cause the network chief didn't even know how to put a vlan on a switch port.

&amp;#x200B;

I get a raise in september 8500MXN, but now the 24/7 kicks in and i'm asked to go to the factory again but now in 10hour shifts so i have to be on the bus stop at 5:30am and come back at home at 8:30pm. And this happens a few times in the next few months, but the first the i go to the factory the ask me to configure the mail for one person from the company, but i don't have a laptop cause i'm not allowed to inside the factory so i have to ask for one laptop and use my cellphone data. And this happens a few times and i get called out for it in a meeting a few weeks after when i'm not in the factory anymore.

Now this year in january i had interns that i was managing and was teaching stuff cause some of them would ""do my job so i can move to more interesting things for me"". 4 get hired, two for the factory and 2 for other projects and i'm still doing the same shit and been asked to work on saturdays and some mondays, configure datacenters in my days off and doing servers, programming, networks, ip phone stuff that i only do as a recipe cause i can't even study what the fuck i'm doing besides some simple stuff and i'm burn out af and even though i have days where i don't do a lot of things i don't feel like studying anymore and feel overwhelmed and i only want to go home after work and sleep or watch videos.

&amp;#x200B;

Didn't say it before but we are two persons in the same situation, my friend still has more expenses than i do cause he has to pay for gas cause he lives a little further.

In september i have to go to the factory again cause they wanna lay off two guys that didn't do anything wrong and the play it dirty by accusing them of stealing (which they did not) and everyone know it. Anyway i have to go to do help desk as one of them was the help desk guy and after two weeks the replacement comes and i teach her what i had to for a week. Now that everything is working again i go back to my usual clients and i found out that me and my friend now have to do help desk for another company cause our on site guy there quits. So my friend gets trained for 3 days before the other guy quits and now we have to do a lot of stuff that we're not trained for like managing outlook accounts and some other things. Now i'm asked to renew my factory credentials with my money and they say they'll pay for it. They don't.

We found out now that other girl at the factory quits and then the girl i trained doesn't even lasts there 2 months and quits also, so the other guy i was also training for my job now has to go and to the girl i trained job.

Now that this kid is at the factory boss tells me to train another guy that was supposed to do javascript and python but is proofreading for a moodle thing and uploading clases. I know this kid is also about to quit so i just tell him that if hes quitting i wont waste his time with training.

Now two or three days ago i found out that 2 persons of the development team had a 25% raise like 6 months ago and were asked to tell not tell us cause we would had our raises the next month which should have happened like in may or something.   The main service is what my friend and i do and we don't even have our cellphone data covered even though we're on meetings on the road almost every single day and half of the government has our personal numbers. They do an excellent work but they're stuff is a plus for the service we actually do on site.

I have my family support if i quit but i still have some debt to pay that i would be free of like in january but i feel so overwhelmed and disrespected... i'm thinking on studying for two or three months and apply to junior remote positions wheter its python or javascript. Honestly i thought the english would be useful but i've had 3 interviews already and even for junior developers and trainees they won't call me back. So i guess being a jack of all trades master of none doesn't actually get you anywhere anymore. I'm 23 so i think i have time but i feel like i wasted this year and i'm desperate to get out of here."

r9as27,4,2021-12-05,How to resign in this situation? [AU],AlphaFoxtrot5,AskHR,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/r9as27/how_to_resign_in_this_situation_au/," For the last 4 years, I have worked in professional services firm. This firm is made up of two people, myself and the Principal who I will call **Bob**. I recently received a job offer from a different firm which I intend to accept.

I am concerned how Bob will react when I tell him I am resigning because I am his only employee. There is no one else. I am also concerned when Bob finds out it is a competing business and will want to know the name of the new firm.

Bob and I have developed a good relationship but at the same time, I need to expand my knowledge/skills/contacts etc. Bob recently gave me a payrise and bonus which I felt I didn't deserve but accepted anyway. I feel like this has set an expectation that I will continue my employment, however, I didn't know I would receive a job offer from another firm at the time.

I am trying to time my resignation with some thought to Bob's businesses as business activity slows down over the Christmas/December period. I have found an intern who could provide some support, and who I could train over the next month (one month is the notice period). This intern could then potentially transition to part-time work as my replacement.

My plan is to take Bob out for lunch/coffee, tell him I have accepted a job offer, hand over my letter of resignation, briefly discuss my reasons for leaving, and express my willingness to have him as a trusted mentor.

I have never had an argument with Bob. We have had a good run professionally and I think we both want to see each other succeed as individuals. I am open to working with him in the longer term if the opportunity arises (and employers permit it).

A few questions:

* For me, it is essential that I leave on good terms. If the notice of resignation discussion with Bob gets awkward (or even hostile), what things can I say or do to make it easier on him?
* If Bob asks which firm I am leaving for, do I tell him? If so, under what circumstances? What's are the risks of giving the name of the firm? My feeling is that Bob would not sabotage the opportunity with the other firm.

I would appreciate any advice!"

Up to this point, as a student, I only had a few shorter ""laid back (?)"" interviews for internships, and am really stressed about this upcoming one.

The position is an Equity Capital Markets Internship.

The description said that this first round is going to consist of 3 interviews to get to know me and test my strategic and financial skills by a means of a verbal business case.
If positive I'd then get to the final interview.

I am an average student from a good European university studying finance.

How should I approach this? What should I expect from the three individual interviews?
From the he structure of this business cases?

From what friends told me it is mainly about showing the right personality rather than the knowledge though because of my background, they probably expect me to be beyond on point on the technicals. I might easily f it up because of stress.

How much time should I dedicate to preparing this interview? What research should I do on the company? What should I focus on revealing best about myself?

Thanks in advance."

My day to day life for the first two years will be very dense in coding (we are going to do projects in different languages as it is not specialised the first/second year). In France we do something called 'alternance' the last three years will be spent in school but also as an intern in order to pay for the rest of my tuition. I currently have a Mac that I bought in 2017. I don't know if the information I provided changes anything, but I would really appreciate some input. Please be simple and to the point about pros and cons. Being that 3K is quite generous, keep in mind I am not really here looking for the most bang for my buck. Simply put, if you had 3K to spend what would you do with it?

Overall, I have more experience with Dagster (I'm in that team) and have a fairly positive experience with it. I have also tried Airflow MWAA and after 2 weekends of trying out I find that I'm still barely getting anything done with it. But it may be due to a lack of airflow knowledge on my part. In this respect Dagster is really intuitive, I've actually had an intern create a pipeline to automate a ml workflow within his stay with us. 

My use case would be : 

1. ETL data bought from various data vendors for consumption by internal apps
2. Most jobs are fairly small (not big data) and can run as a EKS python job
3. Minority of the jobs need Spark, more for concurrency rather than data size. 

Would like to seek the opinions of those who have tried and used both.  

Should I forge ahead to use dagster for things like triggering AWS EMR for spark jobs? (on top of our EKS based workloads which we are currently using)"

My interests are in AI/ML research specifically towards Computer Vision and NLP. After my graduation I would like to work in ML related roles in the Big 4. I had the following questions regarding the MS in CS program:


1. How is the MS in CS program at UTD? Asking this because I plan to pursue a thesis track and would like to dedicate some time to open source as well.


2. How is the AI/ML research at UTD? How are the professors teaching courses related to AI? Are they approachable?


3. How is UTD in terms of job prospects and internships? I have seen some of its alumni working in really good companies like Microsoft, Google, Nvidia etc.

4. How is UTD's campus and student life?

Sorry for bombarding with so many questions, but deciding the right school is really important for me, for my career goals."

r9l83r,4,2021-12-05,Former Financial Services Recruiter. AMA!,Bodark,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/r9l83r/former_financial_services_recruiter_ama/,"Hi everyone, I have answered several of your questions in the past and did an AMA on r/financialcareers in the past, but I thought that now would be a good time do an AMA here with the turn of the new year. Many companies tend to go into hiring freezes during November - December and into early January but then recruiting starts to pickup again in the 1st quarter usually so I figured now would be as good a time as any to answer some of your questions or offer some advice.

TL;DR: I was a recruiting and talent acquisition professional in New York City after undergrad where I specialized within the financial services space, mainly within alternative investments and back-office recruiting. I did however spend a significant amount of my time working on non-FS positions and I covered positions that ranged in seniority from recent graduates, to people with 30+ years of experience or nearing the end of their career. 

Regarding my own background, I graduated from a non-target, state school in 2018 and worked in recruiting from 2018 until I was accepted to graduate school in late 2019. I am finishing graduate school this coming spring and will be getting an MS in a Quantitative field from a target school. Last winter I had an investment banking internship and a couple months ago I started a job within financial services in New York City.

Although the bulk of my experience is in financial services, I have extensive knowledge of: how the recruiting process works, interview prep/skills, and resume building and critiquing. There have been A LOT of people on this sub making many similar mistakes in their application process whether they're unemployed and looking for employment, or they have jobs and are looking to get new ones and I would be happy to offer any help, or answer any questions that I can. 

I look forward to offering any insight where I can.

Note: I believe the mods will be 'stickying' this post for a few days and there will be a brief period to allow questions to build up before I start to answer them in the next day or two."

Actually, I wanted to drop two classes, but the department did not allow this except for medical reasons. I have to handle two classes right now, and this is still hard for me because my major was not CS, so I did not have a lot of experience with coding a lot. I can follow one class, but another class is difficult for me and takes tons of time to understand. 

I can drop with W if I submit the petition (this can be accepted or rejected), but if this is not allowed even though I have a mental issue right now, the best way can be to retake the course. Now I already have one W and probably one C- grade in my first-semester transcript.

I studied biology, chemistry, and physics due to unavoidable reasons in High School, but my mind was always stuck with IT. I'll be starting my Information Systems BSc degree in a few months.

Now I'm working as a data science intern (some data automation, basic DS, and ML), with a very good mentor guiding me, so the lack of math knowledge isn't affecting me much. However, I do know that I have to understand how certain functions work, and matrices for DL, if I want to be good at what I'm doing. I really love the field and I want to enter the field of deep learning, ofc through DS and then ML.  I'm very unfamiliar with math since I've had virtually no interactions in the past 5 years, but I'm quite comfortable with computer science, especially Python.

**Now,** I know that for a beginner level, I have to study **linear algebra, statistics, probability, and differential calculus.** What I don't know is what sections of those aforementioned fields I have to study. I'm thinking about hiring a private tutor to gain at least **basic knowledge within the next 4 - 5 months.**

**The tutor asked what exactly I wanted to study and I didn't know, hence my request.**

* Could you please give me a structure of the topics I should study (beginner level)? e.g:

&amp;#x200B;

    Linear algebra
        * topic 1
        * topic 2
    Statistics
        * topic 1
        * topic 2

* Is it possible to be familiar with the topics you suggested within the mentioned time frame?
* Could you please suggest some good books for self learning?
* **Your advice, suggested resources (books, sites) are greatly appreciated.**

Thanks a lot for your contribution. Feel free to ask me any questions."

I’m still working in PwC as an Associate II, but I got an offer from KPMG Deals/Valuation.

I’m a fresh Bsc Economics graduate with 1 year financial controlling internship in a well known global pharma company and 1y 3 months experience in PwC Audit.

To be honest, I do not like accounting at all. I feel like I enjoy corporate finance. And I want to end up in equity research position maybe after 3-4 years, but I’m quite confused if I should stay in audit one more year in order to get **Senior Associate** title or directly going into deals?

Deal advisory is my dream, but I'm nervous leaving audit now, and starting in deals as A1 like a new grad.

What would you suggest me?

Edit: 
On my last day, HR had a call with me, and since I had good feedbacks and highly motivated employee, they asked me why not to stay in PwC deals. Of course then I had an interview with partners, at the end of story they asked me if I want to transfer into to the Deals. And I accepted the offer!"

I recently received an offer as an analyst from Big4 (Deloitte, EY, PwC, and KPMG).

The minimum GPA required was 3.3, but I still applied and got an offer.

I am not proud of my GPA, and yes, I struggled A LOT during my college years, but I was able to get back on track during my final semesters. I was also having difficulty finding internships. All of my other friends were getting internships at larger companies, but I received no responses from ""brand"" companies.

I sucked it up and got internships at small to mid-sized companies that no one had ever heard of. My school was not even a top priority; in fact, we had a bad reputation for Big4.

Everything worked out in the end. Not only did I receive an offer from Big4, but I also received a couple of other offers from mid-sized and well-known IT firms.

So, if you're looking for a job (especially if you're still in college), invest in yourself. Put in the effort and time. Don't worry about getting brand names if you don't get any, like me, because what will get you a job are:

1. Experience and the ability to talk about them.
2. The Quality of your work
3. Interview Skills/Strategies

If I could do it, you can do it too :)"

I know some R from continuing Ed classes and used a bit at work but mostly we didn’t have the applications for it.  

I love SQL and I’m pretty decent with it but no expert.  

After a year of working in healthcare analytics during the pandemic and reevaluating my priorities, I moved abroad (to Europe from the US) for a masters in Information Management.  I’m learning things like database management (EER and UML models so far), Python with neural networks, process mining, etc.  Next semester I’ll have Tableau.  

I graduate in July and I’m fairly confident I can spin my experience and this program into a decent gig as a business intelligence analyst or business analyst but I was wondering if there were any other IT/Information Systems paths I could/should be looking at too?  Or is my experience too skewed towards analytics?  I don’t know enough about what’s out there as options, so I’d like to get an idea.  

I’m thinking about maybe trying to do an internship while still over here for a few months to get more time here and more experience and then heading back to the states to work for real.  Any advice would be appreciated."

Overall, I've done pretty well in college with about a 3.67 GPA up until now, but I'm about to fail a second class (failed one a while back because the professor was a dick about me being sick). I definitely dropped the ball in this case though and just let myself fail this course as I felt burned out this term. If everything goes well for the rest of the year, I should finish with a 3.6 GPA overall.

I'm looking at about 9 schools to do a Computer Engineering PhD and have a couple years of work experience from co-ops and internships, so I'm really putting my work experience forward in my applications. How should I address my failed classes, and where should these be addressed? I don't think it'd be best to put this in my statement of purpose for a program, but if I don't have opportunities to address it elsewhere, I'm not sure how to try to explain why I have a few failed classes. 

I've probably can hide this second F until after I get decisions since applications are due before grades for this term are finalized, but is there a chance I'll be denied admittance after an acceptance?

I have no problems with the technical interviews, but I've noticed some problems during my experience that need to be addressed if they plan on keeping talent within the company.  


\- The timelines for hearing back from interview results are unreliable. There is no timeline, only waiting to know your results. While it could take a standard week or two to hear back, I've experienced/heard of candidates taking months before hearing back to continue the process. This extends to project search as well, literally a black box until your recruiter reaches out to you.

\- The above is even worse when you're in the project search phase. At this time for summer internships, most of the projects haven't even been approved (they ***SAY*** most projects will be approved in January\*).\* And with a lot of tech companies wrapping up recruiting by the end of the year, qualified candidates likely have other offers. If you're not guaranteed an offer, the only choice we have is to renege. What's the point of asking for competing offer deadlines when you're not going to accommodate/expedite?  


\- With some observations, Google definitely has favouritism towards their candidates. Some candidates are given guaranteed offers (guaranteed match), some are given more time to match to a project (they say you're given 6 weeks to match or you're out), some applicants are able to interview for projects at a later time (eg. Winter/summer projects as a candidate who originally interviewed for winter). While these are small grievances, it doesn't help to know candidates get treated differently.

\- It may just be my experience, but all recruiter's I've been in contact with only provide vague responses to any questions I've had in emails. Don't even get me started on their response time (me personally, there were two occasions where it's taken me 3+ weeks to hear back even with weekly follow-up emails JUST to give a vague, unrelated response copy-pasted from their FAQ. Like, did you even read the entire email??!?!).

With other companies offering better overall packages for full-time (TC, WLB, type of work, etc.) AND caring about their candidates, it's only a matter of time before they realize their prestige will only take them so far. It's been a pain, but I really enjoy some of Google's products. I hope they come to their senses and change SOMETHING so it doesn't take me 4+ months to get an offer.

Sincerely,

An Ex-Google Simp"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

It is easier to get an interview for new grad, but the questions are more difficult, and the interview process is usually longer.

If I have an internship but am interested in working at a better company, would it ever be worth extending graduation for another internship cycle and a better chance at working at a better company (for full-time)?

I have amazon and wolverine trading as SWE internships, but I am interested in working at a larger trading firm. I am worried about new grad interviews for trading firms and believe it might increase my chances for full-time if I get an internship at these firms (rather than trying for new grad).

Would it ever be worth it? How much more difficult are new grad interviews?"

Don't judge me because this isn't easy.

I graduated with B.S. Business MIS, and in the courses we learned Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau, along with the general business concepts like project management and such. However, the major is so broad that it doesn't delve deep in any one software skill like how Computer Science or the engineerings focus on Java, C++, etc. This is both a strength and a weakness.

I'm having trouble finding a job after graduation, it's been almost 1 year now and I feel exhausted and desperate. Worse, I held off on having a part time job (living with family) for months to focus on the job search, thinking I would land one soon, but it never came (will aim for a part time now and resume the full time search after). Even worse, I made the *heinous* mistake of graduating during the lockdown, and unfortunately did not secure an internship because of said pandemic. I didn't waste my free time during college though, I did a lot of student leadership and extracurricular which taught me other skills (leadership, teamwork, event planning, virtual adaptation, hosting meetings, philanthropy, volunteering).

The early portion of post-graduation I focused on applying for Data Analyst jobs, but soon discovered it was too advanced and not entry level friendly, too catered towards CS degrees. I focused then towards a mix of nonprofit administrative positions and business admin / database admin type positions, or any tech, but to no avail. Currently, per recommendation of some friends and my sister who switched from accounting to IT, I am gunning for IT. Except the entry curve is just as difficult and I am stuck needing to go for Help Desk Support if I want to start this career path.

To be honest nothing about any of those fields excite or motivate me (my choice of major wasn't the smartest even though lucrative), perhaps I'd be most interested in certain types of nonprofits that promote ethnic justice, education, helping others, etc. But nonprofits just pay less, and I'm particularly jaded after a nonprofit (where I've personally known everyone and volunteered with for years) that had a full time job opening still did not accept me after the interview stage due to having no professional experience in the nonprofit management industry. It was after that I decided to gun for IT, but now I have doubts. If I need to go for Help Desk (which I'm struggling to get into) and spend loads on certificates to advance, am I and my skill-set even a right fit?

More info per this sub rules:

1. Bay Area, California, I don't want to travel far or travel regularly
2. Graduated with Bachelors
3. I want to work at least a few years before deciding to get a masters (and I'd need to be SURE)
4. Prefer office / computer work, as long as it's not like heavy lifting or always outdoors
5. My age is early/mid 20s.
6. Only worked seasonal jobs before like retail, Census, etc.
7. Reasonable work schedule as long as it's not crazy/abusive like far over 40+ hours.

I have had 4 internships, 2 of which are big techs/Fortune 500, totalling about 28 months by the time I will graduate in Jan 2023. However, not a single one of them is from a FAANG company. Not only that, I just blew my chance of getting one by bombing my Meta/FB phone interview and Microsoft phone.

My undergrad also will be taking close to 8 years (in our program we are forced to take 150 credits, but I took a few extra courses to bump to almost 160 credits, also some mandatory courses are only offered once a year, and I had to take them in later years due to my earlier internships). I am also extremely old (I will be 27 by the time I graduate) compared to my peers. All of these just saddens me.

I am not going to lie, I kind of took a hiatus from grinding leetcode in fall as my summer and fall job search were really gruelling, and I had to go through lot of interviews and applications to get my last 2 internships, so I felt like burnt out. If I grinded leetcode a lot more in fall, I could have done much better at Meta/Facebook interview.

I don't know if I will ever get a chance to get interviewed for new grad positions next year, which will be much tougher. But I promised myself given the fact that I have an internship secured till next summer, I will grind leetcode to better prepare for the new grad job search.

I have around 170 lc, but I wasn't able to solve all of them by myself, but I feel like I am slowly getting better at it (I couldn't even solve an easy problem when I was starting out, compared to now I can often solve medium problems optimally within 10-20 minutes).

Is there any redemption for me? Is there anything else I could/should have done better or should be doing so that I don't have the repetition of my mistakes?"

ra3wxd,6,2021-12-06,Should I move back in with my parents or stay in large city for networking purposes?,zevix_0,OSUOnlineCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/comments/ra3wxd/should_i_move_back_in_with_my_parents_or_stay_in/,"Hi! So I'm probably jumping the gun with this but my cousin who's a SWE told me about this program and it has me really interested. 

Long story short I'm a rising senior in my undergrad who discovered a love for programming around last year. I've been self-teaching myself ever since then, but I really want to get the degree if only for the internship opportunities and the HR checkbox. Since I could graduate within \~2 years this program is really appealing to me especially as someone nearing their mid-20s who doesn't want to spend another million years in college. I've already made sure to sign up for Calculus (doing Khan Academy right now to prepare) and a Public Speaking class so prereqs are covered. If I move forward with enrolling I'll probably enter Summer 2023.

These are my main two options for living situations (I'm currently living in Utah but I'd rather not say the specific town). If you guys have any advice for what sounds like the better plan let me know.

**Option 1: Move down to Salt Lake City and work full-time**

**Pros**

* SLC and Lehi have a booming tech sector. Lots of startups and I don't see the job growth here slowing down anytime soon. They also like hiring locals so that's a plus
* Lots of networking opportunities. On Meetup.com there are dozens of tech related groups that meet regularly. Silicon Slopes is also a huge group that regularly has meetings and networking events
* I have a few family members that work at tech startups here who could help me get connections

**Cons**

* SLC's cost-of-living isn't terrible for a big city but it is still high. Even with my GI bill stipend I'll probably have to work full-time to pay rent. I have family in the city, but I don't think they're the type that would let me live with them.
* Since I'll likely have to work full-time that means there's less time I'm able to dedicate to my studies and side projects
* Mormon culture sucks. Although SLC is definitely the most tolerable area to live in Utah in that regard

**Option 2: Move back home with my parents in a rural East Coast town**

**Pros**

* By living with my parents I have the opportunity to really focus on my coursework and side projects without worrying about bills
* My parents run a small-business I could work at while in school so I would have a lot of flexibility with my work schedule in case I run into a class that ends up being very difficult

**Cons**

* Tech sector is non-existent. No startups, virtually no large tech companies. Meetup.com shows zero tech-oriented groups in the area (nearest one is literally 2.5 hours away). Very few local colleges and almost all of them are liberal arts or community colleges. 

**Option 3: Move to Oregon** 

* Honestly I'm only really considering this for the purposes of getting the full GI bill housing stipend and maybe the opportunity to go to career fairs in person. This is definitely the option I'm least likely to go with.

Also I should add I still have two years of a GI bill to use so money tuition-wise isn't an issue."

I would love to get advices from you guys about my future career in finance and what I should do to maximise my profile.

I’m a curious person and interested about a variety of positions but ideally I would love to get into an M&amp;A analyst at a boutique or in an Investment Banking position.

In January 2022 I’ll start my gap year and I secured a 6 months internship as a ""financing and treasury intern"" in the financial direction of French company with 2Bn€ of revenus but the company is not famous. I already got an internship last summer but the one in January will be my first internship in the finance field.

Questions :

Since it’s a gap year I’ll have to do another 6 months internship in July and I was wondering first of all if my profile could interest U.S companies since I would like to get an internship abroad. Also is it common for French people to get to work in the US (with the visa thing and all) ? 
I know that summer/ off cycle internships are great but should I get an other internship before applying for these ?

If any of you guys works in finance in France don’t hesitate to give me your opinion about how my profile could fit for a role in a big bank or in a M&amp;A boutique.

My manager sat with me and told me he is really sorry that the ongoing projects require FTEs and since as a student I am working part time it is hard to assign me to some projects at the moment. Then he noted that we will have another meeting in January and we will talk about future involvements. At the moment it partially sounded like there is a possibility of getting a layout.

Few days later I had a feedback session with my supervisor and got really positive comments about my work. We also spoke about the meeting with manager and possible lay off and my supervisor told me that she does not know any details but if it was her she would mentally prepare for the worst.

I got a call today from her and she scheduled a meeting with another manager and told me that it will be about the things mentioned above.

So over the last few weeks, I've been going through the interview process and steps for a management position for a DevOps team for a sister company of the one I currently work for. I wanted to make the switch because my current position has become stagnant over the last few months, and my ultimate career goal is to become a people leader. This will be my first actual ""management"" position with people reporting to me.

Background - I'm currently 27 years old, I have my Bachelors in Information Technology and am currently pursuing my MBA. I've been an automation-focused devops engineer for about 4 years now (basically my whole career after college), doing a year and a half at my old company (12 person team) and a little under 3 years at my current position (10 person team). I've been designing and tweaking processes, developing new processes, training team members on new technology, collaborating with project managers and dev team managers, managing the hiring of interns at both positions, and leading migrations and deployments of very highly used production code.

That being said, I threw my application out there for a DevOps/Automation management position at the sister company of the one I currently work for just to see if anything would come of it, but fast-forward to today and I have an offer. I would like to take the position for various reasons - new challenges, (very very high) salary bump, jumping from engineer to manager, but there are 2 main concerns that I have -

1. Cultural differences - I currently work in the tech industry in Philadelphia, and the new position is just outside NYC, also in the tech industry (like I said, sister company). I have heard the culture of NYC is ""cut throat"", especially when it comes to management. Is this true? Is there really that much of a cultural difference between the two cities?
2. Team size - I will be leading a team of 8 engineers, most likely 4 devops engineers and 4 automation engineers. I've trained teams and have been on teams of that size, but I've never been a ""manager"" before with people reporting to me.

What do you all recommend I do? Like I said, it's a great opportunity, and most if not all of my close peers are pushing me to take it. However, I'm worried I'll be in over my head, especially with the team size. What are your thoughts?"

I have about 10 months of SWE internship experience, coding and testing (unit, integration) shouldn't be an issue.

DM me if you're interested!"

Code Redemption: You may not use any code on any site other than those associated with your purchase. Doing so will result in me requesting that you pay the listed price for the second use of the code, and refusal to do so will result in a report to the mods of this subreddit. Any points or other bonuses associated with a code are not included with your purchase unless specified in the post.

""Should Port/Upgrade To 4K"" Codes: I make no guarantees regarding 4K ports/upgrades. If a code that should port/upgrade to 4K does not do so, I will direct you to the relevant support team.

G&amp;S will charge a $0.49 + 2.89% fee. If a fee is incurred, a refund would result in PayPal keeping some or all of your fee, which I will not reimburse, so please be careful.

Engineering at Circle:
In 2020, Circle unveiled Circle APIs: a set of solutions and smarter technology to help businesses accept payments in a more global, scalable and efficient alternative to traditional banking rails (spoiler: we’re using USD Coin under the hood).

Over the next 12 months, we’re going to rapidly grow our API customer base and enable even more businesses to easily integrate and benefit from the breakthrough of programmable money on the internet.

If you’re data-driven, interested in building something meaningful and would love to work in an entrepreneurial environment, we can’t wait to hear from you.

You will aspire to our four core values:

    Mindful - you seek to be respectful, an active listener and to pay attention to detail.  
    Driven by Excellence - you are driven by our mission and our passion for customer success which means you relentlessly pursue excellence, that you do not tolerate mediocrity and you work intensely to achieve your goals.

rae2md,5,2021-12-06,Interviewing for the first time in four years how to deal with interviewer incompetence and leetcode?,Revolutionary-Driver,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/rae2md/interviewing_for_the_first_time_in_four_years_how/,"I have been working for Amazon as a DevOps engineer since I left undergrad (CS major) over four years ago with some IT internships at banks and other big tech firms prior to that always had excellent feedback and I have moved up two levels since starting. I have a specialty within Amazon for network security hold the CISSP and a few other AWS related certs. My team is required to go back to the office next spring so I decided to look for a full time remote role. I have received a response from over 95% of the places I have applied pass the recruiter and culture fit no problem but I always run into issues in the technical portion as the interviewer has no idea what the job is about or they are just wrong altogether. An example I was interviewing and the guy asked ""Explain a time in your career you have encountered a security issue that involved DNS?"" I went into detail about how I had encountered a client that had malware that communicated using DNS over HTTPS and how my mostly automated environment allowed the client to find, rebuild and better secure their network with little downtime and no loss of customer data. He just said the correct answer is DNSSEC and spent the next few minutes explaining what it is to me even though I easily could have easily provided an explanation and times I have implemented it and the call ended with an HR rejection letter the next day. The same thing has played out in other interviews misusing basic terms such as S3 for EC2 etc and when I ask for clarification or try to imply if they meant the right term it typically kills the interview. Another is the introduction of Leetcode I can script pretty well and do so daily for my current job however I am not a software engineer. Some technical interviews have been nothing but Leetcode I can pass the easy questions like FizzBuzz type stuff but struggle with the harder stuff I was told in one that my performance was terrible for someone with over five years of work as a software engineer and I just replied I am not a software engineer and the position I applied for does not even have scripting as a requirement or anything programming related it its listed duties. He just shrugged and said I cant recommend you and the rejection letter came a few days later. I am losing my mind and wasting a lot of time going this far into interviews just to fail at the end. Are devop and cloud roles right for me? Should I be applying for another title? At first I thought it was the startups and remote places I applied but 10 plus failed attempts is making me think the issue may be with me?"
rae9ir,7,2021-12-06,I feel silently judged about my shortened work hours,MicrochippedByGates,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rae9ir/i_feel_silently_judged_about_my_shortened_work/,"I'll be honest, this isn't strictly anti-work, since I don't hate my work. However, I think it still fits in the spirit of this sub. This is not a complaint about my workplace, which is probably about as good as you could ever get. This is a complaint about societal norms. 

Now do bear with me, since I do have what many people would consider a golden opportunity. Supportive colleagues and higher-ups willing to work around my problems and try and bring out my strengths (and since I'm very definitely autistic, I do need some external organising and coaching). The office dog isn't good at giving love since she's entirely robotic, just to paint a picture of the kind of environment I work in. But that's not the project I'm working on, I have a smaller but very fun and creative tech project that I would have considered doing in my spare time (and would actually have been affordable to me, I've actually got half of the required parts at home). I'm an embedded engineer and one of those hacker/maker types who love to invent and create tech stuff, which is basically the entire job description. Working hours are good too. I mentioned that when I did my internships I just didn't have the energy to do anything after 8 hours of work and could barely even do things in the weekends. No problem, I simply got a 4 hour a day contract instead. Just start easy and slow, and see where we end up. And no one cares if I come in at 8am or 2pm or whatever. 

So where's the problem, you may ask. Seems like I've got all my ducks in a row right? Well, it's that 4 hour workday. I do feel the pressure from societal norms where 8 hours are expected. Sometimes I wonder if my colleagues don't think I'm lazy by leaving well before them, or by coming in as late as I do. They're already there before me, and leave after me. They've given me 0 indication of any judgement, but I almost feel a need to defend myself anyway, just because society expects me to work a 40 hour workweek. Working as little as I do feels deeply wrong. I've been wonderfully supported since I started working, and it still feels completely and utterly wrong. The feeling of being judged by my colleagues has subsided at least a little, but even then I feel judged by society itself as well.

I guess that just goes to show how brainwashed we can be. Completely indoctrinated by this idea that you have to be maximally useful. Even if you get everything you could ask for in a job, it still feels wrong. Like we we should have a shit job, and if your job isn't shit you're just doing something wrong. And if you're a square peg that can't fit in society's narrow round hole, you're taught that it's wrong. That idea persists subconsciously, until you're in a position where reality clearly doesn't match up with that subconscious ideal, and then you become *really* aware of it all. And this ideal is clearly just wrong. It should not exist."

They said that they'd get back to me no later than one week after the interview. I don't think the first half of the interview went well, but during the second more technical portion I spoke with intentionality and was really on top of my stuff, and heard of a lot of ""that's a good answer"" from my second interviewer. I remember I took my interview as early as possible, so I'm thinking that perhaps they're still interviewing the other candidates by the end of the week. I'm just anxious, I just got denied from an internship I really wanted and reconsidered for a more testing oriented role so I really hope the BofA role pans out the way I'd like it to. The trouble is, I feel like they'd be eager to extend the offer as soon as they were ready if they could, and there's only one day left to hear back :\^("

* **Total budget (in local currency) and country of purchase. Please do not use USD unless purchasing in the US:**USD: Ideally under 2,000, but that's less than I got my current device for. I'm expecting more like 2,500.
* **Are you open to refurbs/used?**Yes
* **How would you prioritize form factor (ultrabook, 2-in-1, etc.), build quality, performance, and battery life?**Prioritize performance above everything, then battery life, form factor, then build quality (looking for a minimum specs of 16gb+250gb)
* **How important is weight and thinness to you?**I like my current 3 lbs / 0.61 "". Either can be increased marginally if justified.
* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.**I'm very happy with my current 13""; I'd be willing to go to 14"" if convinced. Otherwise, I just a docking station in my apartment.
* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run.**Necessarily Simultaneous for research: Zoom, SPSS (via Citrix &gt;.&lt;), Excel, Chrome (Moodle, virtual drive access, viewing PDFs, googling stuff, library database queries, news pages, sometimes youtube)
   * Also Minecraft (vanilla or joining an outside server), Stardew Valley, Spotify, Discord, PDF X-Change, Citrix Receiver, eventually Python and (hopefully) academic data visualization softwares, including geographic information systems
   * For light graphic design work for presenting research: I'm highly skilled in Photoshop and may receive a copy for internship work etc; light video editing (on my Mac I just use iMovie); I'll launch Illustrator a few times a year.
* **If you're gaming, do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?**Minecraft: for playing arcade games in big online servers; Stardew Valley; Rogue Fable III; stupid chrome ram-sucking online games.
* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?**
* Reliability: needs to last (in terms of being able to adequately complete coursework; run SPSS + excel + chrome while on Zoom; etc)
* I literally only have thunderbolt ports right now so I'd actually prefer something more streamlined like that in terms of ports. Less places for dust to settle or problems generally from my backpack.
* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
* Im currently on MacOS that I custom ordered myself which was pretty pricey, but starting to have performance issues after more than 20 months of running Zoom &amp; Chrome (about 10 tabs open for class) together, often alongside Preview, Excel, SPSS, and/or Word. Looking back I should have ordered a step up in terms of processing power. I'm trying to learn data processing for social sciences and I literally cannot do so effectively while running Zoom or Chrome.
* The laptop ended up being a HS graduation present. but I didn't know that. If I knew I would have gotten more RAM and a separate video card, since my program emphasizes multimedia form &amp; communication for social sciences.
* I'd be willing to invest in another MacOS if you all endorse it in terms of lasting performance &amp; meeting my specs, but also happy to explore what Windows might offer me, since I expect I can still use this laptop for Mac-specific tasks for some year (at least 3?)"
raghtr,2,2021-12-06,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/6/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/raghtr/weekly_job_qa_thread_1262021/,"Hi all,

Here is the 101st installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

rah7jk,24,2021-12-06,FUCK EVERYTHING!!,lfg_dnd_5e_,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rah7jk/fuck_everything/,"When I was very little my parents taught me if i did well in school and got a good education, didn't get arrested, addicted to drugs, or anyone pregnant I would be able to live a decent life.

So I spent since I was like 10 learning everything about engineering. I had a woodshop in the garage since then I learned construction and carpentry.

 When I got to highschool I joined a robotics team and learned manufacturing, design and programming. Everyone was supposed to go to 1 of 4 sessions a week I went to every single one even if I couldn't do anything, I watched and learned. I learned to weld, machine, design, program, and wire robots from scratch. 

 Then I went to college and got a degree in mechanical engineering WHILE being in every robotics team in college AND returning to my robotics team as a mentor to continually learn from my robotics mentors as well as teach students. So I how to help lead people too. Then I got a dual major in computer science too! Where I took classes on project management, and did internships. Btw the whole time I was in college I was living at home and using the family car and eating ramen to have the minimum student Debt.
On top of all that I got certificates and my hobbies double down on all this (read builds robotic stuff)

I did all this so I could get the very basics a house, with someone I care about and have kids, get a thing of brie on the weekend.  I don't want crazy expensive shit just somewhere nice to exist and grow my garden with my family.

I followed all the rules and with all my experience my first job is paying shit. This includes a job offer from NASA (!!!) that wanted to pay me the SAME in a DRAMATICALLY higher cost of living area. (WHAT THE FUCK!!) On top of all that the job is hourly with no pto so I can't go on vacation without feeling like I'm stealing from my future self and possible children. With a place to live, car shit, American health care bullshit, utilities, food, student debt in maybe 10 years I could afford the down payment on a house where I grew up. (IF the house prices dont go up anymore, which spoiler alert of course they fucking will!)(AND that's if I keep living with my parents)( And god forbid I get hurt because then I lose everything!!) I had a HUGE fucking blessing with how much my parents gave me a head start and that's STILL not enough for the FUCKING BARE MINIMUM of a life. 
FUCK EVERYTHING AND EVERY BILLONARE BUILT OFF OUR BACKS, I CANT STAND THIS SHIT ANYMORE!!

Thanks for coming to my ted talk, I'm going to smash my head into my cubicle wall now.

Note: not looking for a group now, don't dm me about it."

I need any advice to prepare for my upcoming Virtual interview for Amazon Propel Program(APP) internship.

Eventhough I am currently a sophomore in CS I am not well versed with CS topics like most of my folks as I just changed my major from mechanical engineering this September. The only CS background I am riding on right now is Javascript self study I had during late summer on freecodecamp(that the only reason I jumped into online assessment tbh).

they say virtual interview will last 45 min to 1hr remotely covering questions related to design, data structures, algorithms and basic coding, as welll as behavorial questions. this is my first interview so I have no referral to what any of the mentioned areas entails especially behavior questions and design.

any advice or resources recomendation is appreciated."

Ron showed up to get us the next morning. He was idling outside in the parking lot, sipping a coffee. ""What happened to your car, again?"" he asked as we approached, jumping right in without saying hello like he always did.

""It's a long story,"" I replied, patting him on the back through the open window. ""Thanks for coming to get us, man.""

""No problemo. Needed to see you two with my own eyes. You must be Marina.""

""It's nice to meet you,"" she said, shaking his hand as she slipped into the backseat.

""Likewise. So is everything I've heard on the news true?""

""Depends."" I ducked into the passenger seat. Looked at Marina in the side mirror, gave her a little wink as I caught her eye.

""Well, the whole you thing with you and Tony, and a warrant out for your arrest""-

""Yeah. Let's not rehash all the gory details.""

""Fair enough."" Ron was the kind of person who you could trust with something like this. He was maybe the only person I could trust besides Marina. At one point, I thought Tony might fit into that category.

We rode down the road, hopping on the interstate toward Columbus. Ron was twenty-four at the time, taking care of his little sister Caitlin after my aunt and uncle died. He used to live closer to me, and we had the kind of friendship that was more like we were brothers. I saved him from a number of dumb situations he found himself in, over and over and without being asked. Ron still looked remarkably young, like a teenager really. He was small and wiry with a big grin and dressed like a California surfer even though he lived in Ohio.

Marina and Ron got along well from the start. He got her laughing, even cracked a few chuckles out of me. He always managed to do that. ""You really thought I wouldn't ask any questions, man?"" he asked, his tone serious all of a sudden. ""You thought you'd show up here after months and I wouldn't have a single question for you? I have a ton. Like, would you rather fight a horse-sized duck or twenty duck-sized horses?""

Marina dissolved into giggles. ""Clearly the horses.""

""No way. They'd knock you down and stomp all over you!"" Ron managed to keep a straight face while he went on about this. ""It's the duck for me, man.""

""I wouldn't dare go up against a giant duck and its giant bill,"" she insisted.

We continued like this for the duration of the drive, Ron teasing me about having a lot of questions, and then offering up another nonsensical would-you-rather. Things began to feel normal. Being in the presence of someone from my childhood grounded me. The panic and chaos of the past couple weeks started to wane. I didn't forget - I couldn't forget - but everything was fading and falling into the background.

Ron offered to make us breakfast once we got home. ""Caitlin's probably sleeping in,"" he said.

He helped us lug our bags inside the house. It was my first time here, to the house that Ron and Caitlin's parents had left them when they were killed in the car accident years back. The neighborhood was nice, suburban, but with space between each house. Tall trees lined either side of the yard, which instinctively made me feel safer. The place was a large cape with a fenced in yard and a basketball hoop in the driveway.

""This is really nice, man,"" I said to Ron as we walked in through the side door. The house was clean, tidy, and suspiciously devoid of beer cans. Ron had really pulled it together. Once a partier to rival the hardest, it seemed like having to be responsible for Caitlin had been a wake-up call.

Marina looked like she might cry of relief. She put her arms around me and was smiling wide. ""Thank you so much for letting us stay here, Ron,"" she beamed.

""Oh, of course. Mi casa es su hideout. Let me show you your room."" He led us through the spacious downstairs to a guest bedroom on the far hall with a private bath. ""This is your abode, for as long as you want it."" He clapped a hand on my shoulder and bounded off to the kitchen to get breakfast started.

""You don't think this is Jupiter still?"" Marina asked after a minute of staring out the window at the piles of leaves raked neatly on the sprawling lawn. ""Everything's too good."" She glanced back at me, her eyes full of tears.

""No, Mar,"" I took her in my arms. ""We just reached the end. No more running. No more hiding. We can start fresh here.""

Caitlin came running in then, giving me a huge hug. ""Cousin Johnny!"" She even threw her arms around Marina. ""I'm so happy you guys are here."" She was about sixteen now, her wavy dark hair halfway down her back.

""I can't believe how tall you are,"" I remarked.

""Yes, Johnny, time passed."" She did a little Vogue model spin. ""Ron told me you're a singer!"" She turned to Marina and gushed, ""I want to hear your voice. What do you like to sing? Do you know anything by Justin Bieber?""

Marina giggled. ""Not really, but I could sing you something else.""

I watched as they walked off together toward the kitchen, Caitlin chatting on while Marina turned back to give me a genuine smile. Her eyes carried a kind of renewed energy. I glanced around the room, at the queen sized bed and the writing desk, the massive closet and the clawfoot tub in the bathroom. We had finally made it.

About a month passed with us living the high life. We had an amazing Thanksgiving together the week after arriving, all pitching in to make a killer meal. Marina baked her tried and true pecan pie recipe, and Caitlin showed us how to make cranberry sauce from scratch. Ron got me a job at a warehouse nearby, one that didn't ask for any kind of ID and paid me under the table. I moved boxes of auto parts and filled orders on an assembly line. It wasn't much but it paid well and the boss asked no questions.

Meanwhile, Marina helped Ron with the housework. She was looking into local music stuff, but was a bit scared about actually reaching out in case someone had been following the news from back home.

Things started to go wrong as the weather turned, getting colder and brisker. A few early morning frosts left the ground hard. The daylight hours were dwindling, shrinking bit by bit. One day in mid-December I got home late from work. I had stopped off at the store to buy Marina a Christmas gift, a tennis bracelet that looked a bit like the one she had been forced to pawn. I found her in the bedroom sitting at the desk, singing a beautiful melody as she stared out at the bare trees. ""What do you think about Serena?""

""What?"" I asked.

""The name Serena?""

I paused at the door, wondering for a split second if she was pregnant.

""I'm thinking of going to the college radio station. They're looking for interns. I could use the name Serena.""

""It's pretty,"" I said, and something like sadness swept over me.

""Of course, they're going to need references, and a resume, and..."" She continued to stare out the window, a vacant gaze.

I put my arms around her and she leaned back into me, squeezed my arm. ""Something feels off,"" she commented.

""What?""

""I don't know. It's like a heaviness. Do you feel it?"" She spun around to look up at me. There were wrinkles around her eyes. Little crow's feet, spreading out around the corners.

""Mar? You okay? You look... tired,"" I frowned, looking down at her. She was only nineteen. Those hadn't been there that morning.

""I was just thinking the same thing about you."" She gestured to the mirror. I staggered over to it, seeing the hollows under my eyes. My cheeks were drooping a little, like I had somehow turned the clock forward by a few years.

""Jesus,"" I took a step back, startled by my own reflection.

""What's going on?"" Marina was studying the backs of her hands, which were beginning to prune up.

""Maybe it's the lighting."" I walked into the hallway, where the overhead light was beaming down through the deep autumn early evening dark. The golden mirror at the end of the hall reflected my sallow skin, the creases around my mouth, the puffy jowls that had somehow formed in mere hours.

Marina gasped as she joined me. ""What is going on?"" We studied our aged faces.

We could hear Ron and Caitlin preparing dinner in the kitchen. Marina was almost afraid to go face them, wondering aloud if she should put some makeup on. ""We're probably just tired,"" I attempted to explain.

""I've rested more this past month than I have in so long,"" Marina said. ""I mean, I guess it could have caught up with me. We barely slept while we were on the road."" She was still poking at her skin, at the tiny divots.

""You still look beautiful, Mar."" I leaned down and kissed her, feeling a hint of panic. Things had been so good. It was so real that now I liked to imagine that whatever had happened to us was just from paranoia and lack of sleep. I knew deep down that it wasn't true, but it was easy to pretend. Easy to slip inside of that reality and occupy it fully.

We walked down the hall tentatively, about to see if Ron and Caitlin needed any help with dinner. Marina gasped as we turned the corner. Ron's hair had turned from a dark blonde to a silvery gray, with the hairline receded up his forehead. Caitlin still had her back to us, chopping vegetables.

""Oh my God,"" Marina said.

""What's up?"" Ron looked at us, his face looking like he was approaching his mid-forties.

I hesitated to say anything, because he seemed unfazed. Caitlin swept around with the sliced carrots and added them to the soup they were making. Her face had become more mature, that of a mid-twenty-something rather than a teenaged girl.

They both talked jovially, making jokes and chatting about their days. Caitlin went on about her high school basketball team, even as her face continued to age, dissolving into that of a thirty year old woman.

As the meal was finally served up in bowls and placed before us, Ron's sallow skin was sagging. He sat down at the head of the table. A beard had begun to sprout from his chin, growing down, gray and wiry.

""We're aging slower than they are,"" Marina commented under her breath. She still looked the same as she had in the hall mirror. Meanwhile, Ron and Caitlin seemed to gain five years every time we glanced away.

""They seem fine mentally,"" I commented.

""What's that, cuz? Wine? Can't legally give you wine,"" Ron joked. ""How about some soda?"" He appeared like Gandalf, with wizened face and long graying beard dangling down to his stomach. I couldn't look away from his skin, the jagged crevasses of wrinkles, the colorless tone, the pockets of flesh that hung down his cheeks.

Caitlin, too, was turning gray now. Her long hair was streaked with silver, and her face resembled that of a crone. Her lips were shriveling, disappearing into the center of her mouth like she had sucked a lemon. A heavy feeling was hanging over the whole room. Marina and I noticed it; it didn't seem like my cousins could. It was palpable and thick, like all the joy had disappeared from life. My limbs were heavy. I could move them, but I could also feel myself growing older.

Marina and I were aging, but at a much slower rate than Caitlin and Ron. I could feel my joints aching, the gradual decline of my body becoming more apparent every few minutes.

Marina stood up so suddenly that she knocked her chair over. Caitlin rose to help her, like a gray witch with gnarled clawlike hands. Dark spots appeared on the skin of Caitlin's once young face. She hobbled to get the chair, her back hunched and her posture shaky.

""I'm s-sorry,"" Marina stammered, backing out of the room as the impossibly old cousins stared at us. Ron was now slumped over his soup. He had stopped responding, was now so old that his skin had lost all shade. His eyes were disappearing in the vast network of wrinkles. His beard was lying in his soup bowl, continuing to grow like a silver spiderweb.

Marina, now appearing in her mid-forties, ran back down the hall. I followed her, jogging at a comfortable pace for my new body. ""Mar?""

She was crying in our private bathroom, sitting on the edge of the claw foot tub. ""This heaviness. This feeling... it's too much.""

I sat beside her. Our reflections in the mirror showed me a glimpse of what we might look like someday, the pair of us pushing fifty. That would have been something to aspire to, but right now it left me feeling sick.

""Johnny, it's Saturn,"" she realized. ""The god of time,"" her green eyes glowed, the same green eyes as always. I held fast to them, trying not to see the illusion of her aging face around them. It was an illusion; it had to be.

We heard a crash in the other room. Marina and I got up and ran back to find Caitlin, collapsed on the floor, a white-haired woman with the body of a wrinkled prune. Ron was unmoving at the head of the table, appearing older than time itself.

""We... we can't stay here,"" Marina cried. ""We tried, but the spirits are after us. Ron and Caitlin don't deserve this. They were only trying to help us.""

""Marina,"" I pleaded, watching as cobwebs grew up around my once twenty-four year old cousin.

""We have to leave.""

Somehow, somewhere in me, I knew she was right. The feeling in the air preceded our decision. It held sway over everything. It was darkness and coldness and the sensation of being utterly alone. We staggered to the room and began to pack our things, our bodies now that of sixty year olds.

""Saturn!"" Marina sobbed into the room. ""What do you want from us? How can we help you?""

The answer came like a knowing, the way you know the sky is blue or that 2 + 2 = 4. A fact, more than a belief, something as sure as anything else.

**-You are shirking your responsibility. You do not get to enjoy yourself. I'm looking at you, Johnny. You do not get the gold at the end of the rainbow. You have not yet paid your debt.**

We both heard it, we both knew it to be true. The fact came wrapped like a bundle. As I followed the train of thought, more knowledge unfolded. I knew if we left that the effects of aging would be gone. Ron and Caitlin would be fine. If we stayed, that seemed to remain a mystery. I hurried as fast as my old body would go and we grabbed what we could carry in our backpacks.

We staggered down the hall. It felt like we might not make it. The heavy feeling was weighing us down, slowing our steps. My limbs felt like they were made of lead. Devastated, we hobbled out the front door, my own beard growing down my chest in a shade of mottled silver.

My white-haired Marina was ahead. Two steps across the lawn and she fell to her knees. ""Johnny,"" she cried in a voice plagued with age. We weren't going to make it.

I bowed down to get her. My back ached and my muscles screamed. I grabbed her frail body in my sagging arms and hauled us forward across the freezing lawn. Pleading to whatever higher power might be out there, I used my last ounce of strength to roll with Marina over the edge of the property, into the street beyond. My eyes closed. It felt so easy to slip away, to ride into the blackness. To give in to the end, to leave this ancient body behind."

Environment is startup like, dk about return offers and competition among interns

**Qualcomm -Design verification**

Very good return offer rate for intern and new grad roles, possibility of transferring to san diego office in the future in diff team as well, plus not too much competition among interns

Pay - 30cad/hr + maybe housing

I have minimal experience in anything hw related yet (just took 1 course in digital logic and design), its a 4 month role, but theyll train + give me tasks to do so will get a good intro to the field, kinda wanna learn more about hw/embedded, fw in general plus i feel a lot of uni run clubs are anyway doing similar stuff with web dev, so getting this experience would be tougher without a professional setting

Im leaning towards qualcomm, does my reasoning sound legit?

raj4ym,14,2021-12-06,What's with this idea of justifying slave work,lucaslizama3,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/raj4ym/whats_with_this_idea_of_justifying_slave_work/,"I'm a programmer, I quit my job about three months ago, I was tired. Today I went to theophthalmologist for a check up, i greet the doctor and he asks what do I do for a living, I tell him I'm software developer... a programmer (I don't really know if evryone knows what software developers do, so I say programmer) and he starts asking technical stuff like, what languages do you know? I tell him, I know various languages without being specific, then he continues with, and do you know the React framework and NodeJS, at that point I was thinking, ok this guy knows a little at least of what he is talking. So I tell him a little of my background, I do knew everything he was asking me, I just wasn't in the job mood, I was there for a checkup not a technical interview XD.

The thing is that the guy has a startup, he has people developing an app to help people find appointments with doctors outside the system of the medical center or hospital where they are working, or something like that, like finding lost appointments easier, etc.

Anyway, I was leaving after the checkup, I tell him, good luck with your startup, and he tells me if I'm ever in hte mood they need React Native developers. I really wasn't in the mood for job talk, and also I'm done with startups that are not mine to begin with, so I tell him ""I don't think you can afford me Doc"", it wasn't with any bad intentions, more like, if I were to work somewhere again right now, a startup wouldn't be the place, also I have a lot of experience in selling myself short, so yeah, told him that. Then corrected myself, and told him, that I wasn't trying to be mean, and then he starts...

A monologue, about the kind of people he is looking for to work with. People who like what they do, people with motivation, drive, people who you tell them to do A, and they tell you, boss but we could also do B, C, and D. And they would do that all for themselves, people who would work long hours and under pressure (Literally said that). Right there I stop him (Cause I was feeeling the cringe) and tell him out of good will. ""Doc you lost me at the work under pressure part"", and he continues, well that's how it is, we are not a big company we are a startup, we are the guys who are building this thing, so we wont be working 8 hours, we'll be working 20 hours sometimes. ""Yeah, all I'm saying is that if you want people to come work for you don't tell them that tehy will work under preassure, you will scare them away"", (At this point I'm almost telling him, you want to be evil, ok, but don't market yourself as evil so early XD), and he continues, nah, better if they go running scared, cause it means they weren't the right people for this job, I don't want to work with them if they can't handle it. He then proceeds to tell me analogies about building a rocket, you dont build a rocket in 40 hours a week, you work 80 or a 100 hours if it's what's needed (Not sure if NASA exploits their engineers but it's his analogy not mine), and he finishes with, cause WE, the ones who work all those hours building the company, are the ones who get rich in the end, cause I suppose they get a part of the company instead of money for their work(?). THen he tells me that I'm a big company guy, the type who works his 8 hours and goes home, like it was something bad. I really felt condecendence in what he said. For reference I've never worked in a big company, either small or medium. And each of them was as exploitative as the last.

I'm sure I tried telling him that it wasn't a good idea this way of thinking and he told me that he talked with people in Silicon Valley and that's how things get done. I'm from Chile by the way, and I've always wondered where this idea of treating programmers as slaves comes from, now I know that Silicon valley is at least one source of really immoral management.

To all programmers and IT guys, don't work for this kind of people, if you are fresh from school and think you really need the job for the experience or whatever, let me tell you they prey upon guys like you, cause you will do whatever they want, and wont complain at least for a year or two, investigate your rights, and remember your work has value even if you aren't a senior developer. And for gods sake don't be a yes man/woman, if you let them know you are willing to do anything they will milk you dry, they don't care, you will be replaced with next year interns. Fuck this guys, fuck this companies and this way of thinking. If you have a company big or small care for your people for gods sake, we are not as replaceable as you think we are.

Sorry for the tangent.

TL;DR: Went to the doc, he turn out to be an asshole CEO of a startup making a health app (He think's he'll get rich XD)."

rakfli,4,2021-12-06,Bummed to have failed a class,majockster,Concordia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Concordia/comments/rakfli/bummed_to_have_failed_a_class/,"For context, im a 3rd year CS student with 4 classes this sem. Im currently taking a 400 level COMP class (wont say the number to not expose the class) and boy i didnt know that class was the most unforgiving class i had yet. Wont go into the details but it was hard for me bcs 1. Obviously exams (fair enough)
2. Programming ssignments were impossible, the least i can say was that i had to learn how to use a library (with poor documentation) and the slides that were related to said assignments were far from helpful, and most of the time i couldnt get accurately the expected behavior (innocently thinking that the TA will be lenient like any other comp class I had before) or worse i couldnt get it to run at all before the deadline.
If i cant get the exact correct behavior i automatically get a failing grade.
3. The class was super competitive, we had a discord channel, where students can ""help"" each other out and access their grades that were posted publicly, YES publicly. It was strong to the point where i saw a lot of people getting high grades for deliverables that were extremely hard to me. So you could guess that it doesnt help at all with my morale. ALSO i say ""help"" in quotations bcs students would give half-assed answers when i reach out to them privately for help, and i still get confused despite their ""help"".

What didnt help was that i had to pass all components of the class to pass i.e. exams, assignements, etc. No matter how well i did in the other components, i learned recently by my prof (no effort to help whatsoever) that despite my efforts im failing this class only bcs i failed my (impossible) assignments component. In my defense, i had really huge projects and assignments from other classes + interviews for internships, which already make me so tired and done with school.

Anyone else just as tired and done as me? Or was in a similar situation?"
rakgv7,1,2021-12-06,WHY Only IT positions why not software engineer or developer?,vectordude47,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rakgv7/why_only_it_positions_why_not_software_engineer/,"So couple of weeks back I made a post about getting my first job as IT supply chain at a company which will start after my graduation by participating in my Universty career fair. I applied software developer position in all companies which were in career fair but my first offer was IT and since I have no internship experience I accepted the offer since that was the only offer I had and I was afraid that I won't getting any other offers. But after accepting offers I got reached out by some more recruiters  and I have interview setup soon but the email says again that position is IT. What I don't understand is that when I said or told recruiters that more interested in software positions but they take interview for IT why can't I go in software engineer. I made my portfolio website, did projects in different languages  seems like it didn't work. So what I wanted to know is am I getting IT because of the reason I am being hired for diversity reason because I saw others peers got into software engineer or because I am brown that's why automatically that made me an IT person. 

Second question is if I join company with IT position later can I move within the company to software engineer position. In US does companies allow switching of jobs. Means switching from IT team to software developer team? 

I want to know what are your thoughts or advices or reasons you can think of. I have no issue in starting in IT and move to software it's just I don't wanna get stuck in IT because all those sleepless nights learning and developing will go to waste. I am still learning and planning to get full stack knowledge by self learning."

I am currently an MSc student looking for a SWE summer internship in 2023. I had a few interviews with some big companies but could not pass the first rounds of interview. To be honest, I was considered because I had the opportunity to meet these companies in an event. 

Sadly I feel like only a few company propose summer internships in EMEA and US companies don't even answer. Recently, I applied to Databricks, received a mail to pass a CodeSignal challenge and got rejected two hours later. I did not even do the test. Sadly, I don't have much more options.

I would appreciate any advice on how to get an internship. I already applied to most of the companies here :  [enumcase/EMEA-APAC-Internships: Summer 2022 internships list for EMEA and APAC regions. (github.com)](https://github.com/enumcase/EMEA-APAC-Internships)  

However, some are only for PhD students or are 5-6 months internships. 

I am currently studying security / ML / distributed algorithms / data science / networking and working on two projects. The first one is an analysis of a bank of millions of citations extracted from US newspapers. The other one is to evaluate the performances of complex-valued neural networks on real-valued applications. 

Here is my resume: [https://snipboard.io/r9y3QZ.jpg](https://snipboard.io/r9y3QZ.jpg)"

Now hear me out. This isn't something that I'm posting because I never got a reply from google or facebook and I'm heartbroken. NO. 

I'm an Gradate Student at UMD studying Cybersecurity. If you should know, I've applied to around 50+ internship positions related to my field. Around half of them get back and let me know that I'm not selected. The other half don't reply or haven't replied yet (Its been around a month). On top of that I wasn't able to apply to certain Internships at all because they need a ""security clearance"" or a candidate that is able to obtain one. On top of that, in every application, there's a question which asks whether we will need sponsorship to stay in the US now or in the future. Being an F1 Student, you have to say ""yes"" because ""in the future"" also includes when the status expires even if it is after the duration of the internship. (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Now, I'm not finished yet, let me tell you about my experience with  ""Cyber Governance, Risk &amp; Compliance (GRC) Intern (Summer 2022) position"" with MassMutual. They have this automated virtual ""Self paced"" Interview process which is basically a chatbot with pre-configured questions and answer suggestions.  Here's what happened - [https://massmutual.modernhire.com/smstoweb?interviewid=17957588&amp;h\_interviewid=pZ%2bCSd%2fPc5f3yaQ47UE84Xosucd%2bXkkbDqH1rA5Jg1sB5qMsRRHeoA7Kdq%2falaNyKvOTNP866NW3yj%2bRz%2b6aUA%3d%3d](https://massmutual.modernhire.com/smstoweb?interviewid=17957588&amp;h_interviewid=pZ%2bCSd%2fPc5f3yaQ47UE84Xosucd%2bXkkbDqH1rA5Jg1sB5qMsRRHeoA7Kdq%2falaNyKvOTNP866NW3yj%2bRz%2b6aUA%3d%3d)  


As soon as I let them know that I will require a sponsorship, they tell me ""Thank you. Your responses have been submitted. "". That's it. The interview is over.

(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  


Now, before you say something, I'd like to add that I'll still continue to apply to relevant positions. Hopefully, for some company, the value an intern provides would be greater that if they require sponsorship an year after they're done with the internship.

ALT + F4 Rage quit till then.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: 

Internship question: Will you require sponsorship? No-- Rejected.  
Internship question: Can you obtain security clearance? No-- Don't apply."

ranm0u,7,2021-12-06,Sharing My Experiences That Led To My First Internship Offer,qstorm94,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ranm0u/sharing_my_experiences_that_led_to_my_first/,"I am currently a junior in CS and just received my first SWE internship offer. I wanted to thank this sub for all the information that helped me along the way and share my experiences to hopefully help someone who could be in my same shoes.

To start off, here are my internship search stats:

* Applications - 56
* Rejections - 5
* OAs - 4
* Interviews - 1

(I also got 1 HireVue request, but fuck that.)

&amp;#x200B;

I first found this sub at the end of my freshman year. I go to a below-average Midwest state school and they do not put much of an emphasis on internships. The thought of an internship never even crossed my mind until I saw this sub. I saw people talking about how difficult it is to get a job without internships and didn't want to be stuck in a position like that.

Over the course of the next year I worked on some projects here and there to put on my resume. I wish I would've applied to internships for this past summer, but I didn't feel prepared enough yet. One thing I made sure to do is contribute to at least one open-source project because I didn't have many group projects and thought that it would make up for that.

I spent a couple weeks refining my resume to make sure I had given myself the best chance for it to be viewed. Since I had no work experience, I knew it would be harder for it to be looked at. I made sure to put in all those fancy keywords that recruiters are looking for and had it reviewed by many different people on reddit. I'm glad that I spent a good amount of time on this because I think it helped a ton.

The 6th place I applied to ended up sending me an email to schedule an interview. This had caught me off guard because, from what I had seen on this sub, I did not expect to get a reply so quickly. I had done no leetcode up until this point. I scheduled the interview as far away as I could, so that I had as much time as possible to practice. I had a little under 2 weeks to prepare. I was working through CTCI problems while I was in class, and doing leetcode when I got back to my apartment. There were 3 rounds in total and the whole process was about 5 weeks long. I was doing this grind for most of those 5 weeks. It was miserable, but it ended up being worth it.

I wish I would have started doing leetcode problems much earlier, so I didn't have to grind so hard when I actually got an interview. The process probably wouldn't have been so stressful if I had been more prepared. It is always said on here, but the earlier you start, the better off you will be. 

I also spent quite a bit of time preparing for behavioral questions. I would say I have decent people skills, and I knew I had to really excel on the behavioral portion to make up for my leetcode skills. I prepared to answer questions for everything I had on my resume and had multiple stories for different questions they could ask me. One other thing that I focused on was to make sure I was always talking and explaining my thought process during the coding portion. I believe that both of these things really helped to show that I was a good communicator and could explain my train of thought, even if I couldn't finish the problem. I actual had the interviewer coding out the solution for me when we were running out of time in the last interview. 

I don't know if this information will be of any use to people, but I wanted to share just in case it would help someone because I got so much useful info from reading the experiences of others. A lot of people complain about this sub being toxic, which it very well can be, but I would've never gotten to this point without everything I learned here. Thank you everyone.

TL;DR - Contribute to open-source projects, perfect your resume, work on communicating, and don't overlook behavioral questions. It is also never too late to start working on leetcode skills, but it's better to start early."

Because I will be sharing many deidentifying pieces of information, I have chosen not to write on my real account. I believe this allows me to share much more detail while still preserving some sense of anonymity. I hope that not only will this additional level of detail, of which seems to be uncommon in success stories will more than make up for any missing credibility by posting on a new account. I do not believe my story is particularly exceptional, but in the end people will need to make up their own mind.

I have provided my background and where I came from because it may help inspire some people. I think success stories are often less impactful than they could be because there is always a sense of ""well you must have had x, or you were privileged in the following y,z ways."" I don't intend to complete resolve that by sharing my background but rather just to make it less ambiguous. Some people will always have some excuse as to why they weren't or can't be successful. My goal isn't to make it sound like a ""if I can do it, anyone can story.""

# About me

I grew up in a lower-middle class family in the US. My parents had a nasty divorce when I was young and there was constant custody battles, I attended many schools, had no friends, and was constantly bullied. The police were not uncommon visitors to my house. In high school, things settled and I gained some notion of stability. Up until then, I had no vision of a future, no idea of how I could possibly make it in the world and no confidence. This began to change after I became inspired by the Japanese Anime Dragon Ball Z (yeah I know). It awaken me to the fact that one could self-improve through discipline and perseverance. This initially took the form of physical conditioning and after a while my confidence grew and for the first time I a ""passion."" From this came my first vision of a future - I set out to join the military with the goal of becoming a Navy SEAL.

I graduated high school (with a 2.1 GPA) and attempted to enroll in the Navy. However, I soon discovered I am medically disqualified from service. I had an undiagnosed kidney issue that barred me from enlisting. However I remained hopeful that if I could get it treated I may still enlist. So I began a 2 year process of treating the disease in hopes that I could get the levels of proteinuria (the diagnostic) to an acceptable level. But after being strung along by recruiters, I eventually got a hold of the recruiting command who said that even if my condition was cured, I would never be elidable for service - in any military service. The mere history of having it was permanently disqualified. That didn't matter in the end because the kidney disease is IgA nephropathy and is incurable and progressive. So here I was back to square one with no hope of a future.

I worked for a time as a fitness instructor and I continued to work on myself, personally. I soon become inspired again. I had always been interested in science, but I never thought I had a future in it.  However, I had gained the confidence to pursue the academic route. I knew I wouldn't get into a decent university with the traditional route given my academic history (GPA 2.1, and ACT 18). So I went to a community college and did very well which allowed me to transfer to a good university from there. I took out student loans to cover tuition and expenses. By this time I was able to claim myself as an independent on the FAFSA and thus allowed me to get enough loans and grants to cover most expenses.

I had set graduate and pursue an MD/PhD. I wanted to practice medicine and I liked science. Most MD/PhD programs are completely funded and thus would allow me financially to pursue an MD. However, I failed in this pursuit. I had one particularly rough semester which sent me into a spiral of depression and self-doubt. I believed that since these programs were extremely competitive, there would be no way I could achieve success. In hindsight, I probably still could have been admitted. A big failure on my part was my failure to seek mental help. I had a certain sense of pride which prevented me from doing so. All my success until had been self-driven and I believed no one but me could help me, I didn't have the capacity to ask for help.

My depression spiraled and I was at risk of getting dropped from my program (biology). One semester I failed 3 out of the 5 classes I was enrolled in. I eventually completed my required courses by the skin of my teeth and graduated with a 2.7 GPA, but I found myself again (in my eyes) back to square one. Only now with a massive amount of student debt. I realized I could get some lab tech job, but I had no desire to pursue this route. The pay is poor and the work is not intellectually challenging. I was tired of being strapped for cash, living paycheck to paycheck and I thought if my life was worth living, I needed to have a decent income. So I went back to doing what I though could amount to a decent pay - fitness trainer.

I worked as a fitness trainer for a few years but I began to realize, this is a dead-end career for me. It was too intellectually unstimulated and I did not have the personality required for a long and successful career. I hated approaching people and I hated pressuring people to buy training. Eventually I heard about machine learning/deep learning. Up until then, I had no interest in CS or programming. But learning about deep neural networks greatly intrigued me. The level of empiricism involved reminded me of the natural sciences - experimentation, observation, etc. So that's when I started reading about the CS field as whole and I became even more fascinated - not to mention the pay is good.

# My pivot into CS

Until then, I had presuppositions about what it meant to be a programmer/SWE. One of the big ones I had was that you had to be really good at typing in order to be a successful programmer, which was unappealing to me because I've always sucked at typing and had no confidence I could be proficient to a high level. I have large muscular hands with little finger dexterity. Obviously, I eventually realized this was ridiculous. So now I had my third inspiration for the future - become a software engineer. But with a BS in biology and a 2.7 GPA, I had to find a way to find a way.

After researching what the best approach was for me I decided that pursing a masters degree in CS would be best. That way I could feel like my bachelors was not a complete failure and I could theoretically graduate and have a job in just 2 years. I was ineligible for most graduate programs because of my undergrad (most need 3.0 at a minimum). However, I landed on DePaul University's Master of Science in Computer Science which had a 2.5 GPA minimum. Just as important, they allowed you the option to test out of the introductory CS coursework if you can pass the proficiency exams. This was huge for me because it meant I could save over $20000 and graduate a year sooner. The FAFSA direct grad loans were just enough to cover full-time tuition. I applied and was accepted to the program, to begin the following Autumn quarter. This gave me about 5 months to self-study and attempt to pass the proficiency exams (you only get one chance).

# My CS journey

To do this, I discovered the ample amount of study resources available online. This included, reddit, edx, coursera, and youtube. However, the most valuable resources I discovered came from the open-sourced materials and lectures from elite universities like Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT. I ""audited"" several courses in preparation. Here are the audited courses and the corresponding DePaul courses I used to prepare for.

I also realized that gaining some experience ASAP was crucial, so I began sending out applications for internships anywhere and everywhere. I was lucky enough to encounter a programming internship at a university research center which specialized in biomedical research. I think my bachelors in biology helped me land this even know I had no formal experience in programming. I started the summer before my first quarter began and I worked as an intern there the entire time I was in graduate school.

During my studies, I continually supplemented with additional material, auditing other courses. I wanted to land a good job after graduation and while I was glad to be admitted to DePaul's MSCS, the program was weak and I knew if I wanted a good job I would have to go above and beyond the coursework. I graduated with a 3.9 GPA and landed a new grad role at a F100 making 120k in a med CoL area at 34 years old.

I prepared for new grad roles through all the ways you frequently read about on here. Grinding leetcode (about 30 easy, 80 med, 10 hard over 2 months), doing mock interviews on platforms like Pramp, and applying to lots of places. I couldn't grind any more than that because I was working (20 hours/week) and going to school fulltime. I failed several interviews. However, all you need is one success and eventually I found it."

Grinding leetcode (about 30 easy, 80 med, 10 hard over 2 months), doing mock interviews on platforms like Pramp, and applying to lots of places. I couldn't grind any more than that because I was working (20 hours/week) and going to school fulltime. I failed several interviews. However, all you need is one success and eventually I found it."

raosl7,9,2021-12-06,"I have received a job offer today, but I am still applying for another companies and I must give my final answer tomorrow. What should I do?",zuv50,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/raosl7/i_have_received_a_job_offer_today_but_i_am_still/,"Hello,

Recently I concluded my BSc. in Engineering, and I have been looking for a job for a few months... The job market where I live (outside US) is a bit harsh at this moment, so it is difficult to find an opportunity where my experiences fit well, since they are more research-oriented and I am looking to work in industry.

This morning I went through an interview with a consultancy company for a Trainee position, and they really liked my profile. They work with software development using a proper system and provides solutions to a wide range of industries. The company is based on the US, and has an office in a city close to mine (approximately 1 hour, and again, outside US). In the afternoon, I received a call from the HR offering the job for the aforementioned position, but the person gave me only one day to return my answer.

I have been feeling a little bit apprehensive and concerned for a few hours now, because I had no success in negotiating a possible extension of the deadline. Additionally, I will have 2 more interviews this week (tomorrow and Thursday) and wait for 3 answers regarding another positions. At first, I noticed some potential redflags during their recruitment process:

1. The first interview was delayed by half an hour
2. No deadline negotiation
3. I told the managers in the second interview (this morning) that I was applying for another companies as well, so they do have in mind that asking an answer for the job offer in 1 day would be... Unrealistic

A brief background about my impressions of this job...

**Pros**

1. It will be fully remote since I don't live close enough to the main city where they are located (no costs with moving)
2. Intermediate salary comparing to another positions I am applying
3. My area would deal specifically with more industry-oriented solutions, so I'd be in contact with a lot of different sectors and clients

**Cons**

1. Fully remote - this may sound controversial, since it was established in the Pros section, but as an Engineer I feel like I still have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to work in cooperation (i.e. in a collaborative environment). I would argue that most of my research experiences (considering college and internship) did not contribute so much to this aspect
2. From one side, I am trying to have an open-mind regarding working in another area. On the other hand, I feel insecure about the job conditions and if I will be able to work properly (I had some bad experiences during my internship, and I don't want them to happen again). IT and software dev. are both beautiful areas, but I have some doubts if I will really enjoy it and also have the opportunity to use at least a fraction of my skills learned during college

&amp;#x200B;

I think I shall accept the offer tomorrow if I don't receive any feedback from the other companies, but I am unsure if I should commit to it.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my first post here, and I am open for suggestions (or clarification, if couldn't make myself clear at some point)."

So, I am currently a fourth-year student studying Aerospace Engineering in Southeast Asia. However, I want to make a career change to software development field. For the last 6 months, I have been working as an full stack web development intern at a certain startup. I had gained a lot of experiences and quite happy with the job. 

However, during the last few months, I felt a bit bored of the product at the startup, so i started working on my side hustle which introduced me to game programming. I have tried working on both Unity and Unreal Engine 4. It was really fun and challenging at the same time. Since my internship contract will end at the end of November, I need to start applying from another one.

The result of the application is that i got 2 offers from both startup and enterprise company (as a backend engineer) and an offer from a AA game studio (as a game programmer). I really like all these companys, but, in the end, i have to make a decision. So, I would like to hear what you guys think about my situation.

raq5ig,1,2021-12-06,Internship Choosing Advice,liberty711,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/raq5ig/internship_choosing_advice/,"Hi everyone!

SO my conundrum is that I have internship offers from the same company at two locations for different positions and I don't know which to take!!

The first is for my major EE but is 60ish miles away, in person at least four days a week. It is about power distribution which is something I am interested in pursuing and my college doesn't offer classes on that so it would be my exposure. But again, its really far. This position would be out of my comfort zone because I don't know anything in that area, but they must know that from the interview?
I would be afraid of burning the bridge by not accepting this now, I would want it in the future for sure when I can travel easier. Of course I would email the manager thanking them for the offer and saying I would love to reapply in the future, etc. But would they be mad or annoyed now and not want me in the future??

The second is for my minor, cyber security. Its 40ish miles away, but with traffic would be similar commute time to the first location. Its in the same city my dad works in, so we can carpool and I can save money on gas. Its hybrid so less than four days in the office. The guy said it would be geared towards my interests, like if I like coding I can do coding. I do want to work on my coding but I don't think cyber security is what I am going to end up pursuing for a job. The guy was also really nice.

I don't know what to do!!!! This is my first internship. One take is to push myself for EE, its for three months and suck up the commute.

Another is to acclimate myself, get my foot in the door with the cyber one and move around in the company.

Just looking for some different opinions to help me decide!

Also - I have no experience or notable skills to speak of. I am actually in complete shock to have these offers. For reference, I have my associates in EE and just transferred this fall to a 4-year to get my bachelors. So to my fellow internship seekers, I think personality really boosted me to get these offers over skills. I've also applied to a million of them, this specific company I applied to back in October for the summer internship so it was really early.

Thank you everyone!!! :)

Edit: that I can carpool for the cyber one"

And I'm starting to feel bad for trying to push her youngest brother out.

So I am 22/F who is in college and I live with my mother who is in her 60s (how it's been all my life). My uncle is in his late 50's (57 to 59) and he has been living with us for almost a year (since mid February 2021). 

*\*this is a long one\**

He makes me highly uncomfortable and irritated. From early childhood their has just been a bad vibe I feel around him and I've told my mother once I was able to voice how I feel to my mom when I was 12 and she sorta just moved passed it. In 2014 he stayed with us for **like 3 to 5 months** to be closer to his then GF (now 2nd ex-wife; name DW) and I mentioned to my mom again that he give me a bad vibe and I would prefer if he did not stay with us and again I was brushed off. 

&amp;#x200B;

He get married to DW in **2015** soon after my grandfather passes (July 2015) During the day before the wedding I have be come his favorite family member, the only one who understands him (I'm 16)and the next day (Wedding day; around sunset), he comes down the aisle drunk enough to were he can't stand without help during the ceremony . He's drinking and passes out around 11 pm.

**3 Years later** and they have had a good amount of fights and she claims that he's drunk most of the time and gets violent with her (DW) but she loves him so much so they just take a break during Christmas. 

*\*I am trying to remember so somethings are missing\**

He comes up North to Grandma's house, me and mom got up there a day earlier, and I opt to stay down stairs with grandma since I don't like being close to him leaving him and mom upstairs. \*It might have been a day or 2 after he gets there\* He comes downstairs to the kitchen to eat, drink, and talk SH!# about his wife DW with mom and grandma and I stay in Grandma's room. His 2 children come over (my cousins; BT &amp; ST) and a couple of hours go by and a couple of drinks go down and I just hear yelling and he's getting belligerent and loud calling everyone ungrateful and saying no  understands him. 

&amp;#x200B;

And he starts curing out my mom, his own kids, and my grandma. He goes upstairs to get his keys and my mom meets him at the top of the stairs trying to tell him to go to his room and sleep off what ever he's been drinking and he tries to push my mom out the way while yelling at everyone \*Mind You THEY ARE ON THE STAIRWAY; she has about 30 or so steps that are chunky af\* So he goes to his room and slams the door but his son (BT) wasn't done since his big sister is crying crying and grandma is in the kitchen prying and trying to calm down my female cousin (ST). 

BT was going to get a say in and then they start fighting like a fight fight. ST is yelling up trying to go up the sets my mom blocks her, I'm trying to calm him down since ""\[I'm\] to only one to understand him""

It gets louder and ST and mom are upstairs trying to stop them fighting while I'm standing back letting them fight. They separate and BT is crying ST is crying and yelling, I'm telling him give me his keys, and mom asking why is he calling his kids ungrateful.

I get his keys and he goes for the door but mom doesn't want him to leave since he's drunk and it's cold and he's shoving her. 

After like 5 minuets they let him go and everyone is upset and I start crying BT and ST are saying thank you to me and telling me sorry, mom and grandma give me a hug and I'm just tried, upset he was pushing my mom and yelling cause everything was fine till it wasn't. After like 30 minutes of everyone pulling they self together BT goes after uncle and ST is with mom and grand, and I'm in grand's room. BT brings uncle back and ST &amp; BT go home after 15 minuets of debunking and what not with grand and mom. 

Uncle goes home early the next morning (lowkey was trying to sneak out) and we don't hear from him for about **9 to 10 months** (almost a year if not than a year) till he calls because he got arrested of a DUI and being rude/ back talking to a cop ad he calls my mom.

So hear my mom goes calling people and doing this and that and then when he gets out he doesn't say anything to my mom. He actually tries to walk back home after my mom and myself (I'm there to make sure mom is okay) have been out there for almost 12 hours to day he gets out waiting cause mom know he does not have a car and his license has been suspended.  

&amp;#x200B;

She drives up the street and finds him walking and you can tell 1) he doesn't want to be seen and 2) he's acting like he doesn't see us. But he gets in the car and we drive him home and he just says thanks sis to her and tries to hop out. \*I cant remember what happed after or if my mom even let him go in the hose alone\*

&amp;#x200B;

**Then we're in mid February 2021** and he get's taken back to jail because his wife DW called the cops saying he had ""hit her""  \*I wouldn't be surprised if he did\* and we're off to the jail house again to help try to A) get him out and B) see when he can get out. He get's out and he has to come home with us because DW has filed a restrain order, but not only that Uncle decides he's going to divorce her too. He staying in his room and has to use my bathroom to pee cause he doesn't shower for like 3 day \*fucks that up all to hell since he doesn't know how to clean up after himself\*

**3 to 4 Weeks** It goes through and My Mom and I have to go get his stuff because he's not allowed over there and I see so much weed and apparently he's been sleeping in the basement.  I ask my mom how long is he staying here since 1) I'm not use to living with men \*it has only ever been me and my mother\*, 2) he's not showering, and 3) he does not clean after his self. 

\*When I say does not clean I mean my floor is sticky near to toilet, he's bread hair is all over the sink, the toilet bowl looks black af.\* 

Mom says 3 to 4 months.....No, by June **I AM** being sent away to grandma's house and he get to stay in the house to do an internship up North (It was nice, but still). Before I go I get hella drunk because I can't take it anymore with the fact my mom always seems to chose others over me since I was I 1st grade no matter what and no I'm getting sent away because an almost 60 year old man who can't get he's shit together but has $$$, doesn't clean, doesn't cook, smells like A33, and talks to your 21 year old daughter about fucking women is more important. OKAY 

&amp;#x200B;

So I come back at the end of July for 3 days just to pack my things for school and I leave. A**ugust 2021 to Now** my mental health has gone to HELL. I started engaging in NSSI: Sharp things\*not going to say what per say, drinking heavy, and smoking (not cigs). Oh and I have an axinity attack like 3 out of 7 days a week. \*fun\*

&amp;#x200B;

I ask her if he's leaving soon since it's almost been a year....no but she's looking for a new job  closer to Gran....and ""He'll have to move by then""............

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do because at this rate because I losing it. My own mother keeps running away, my mental health  is gone, I don't feel comfortable in my own home, and I don't have any money . I just can't anymore."

rastn3,2,2021-12-07,Trying to find the best option to break into the CS industry - Any guidance appreciated!,GoldenMonkey34,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rastn3/trying_to_find_the_best_option_to_break_into_the/,"Hey guys! I made the decision a few weeks I wanted to go back to school for CS and have been doing a ton of research on what my options are. It's been a little daunting with all the different directions people can take to become a SWE, so I was for a little feedback on what some of you would do in my case.

A little background (and I'll try to keep it short), I did terrible in high school, like barely graduated. Went to a CC about an hour away to get the ""college experience"" because it had dorms, and flunked out that same fall semester since I had no study habits. Took the spring off to get my shit together and save some money, started going back to a more local CC that summer and did much better, got my AS in BA with a 3.54 GPA 2 years later. Tried to transfer to a local state school with a good business program, but didn't get in that specific program because of my first go around in college (had 3 Fs and 2 Ws for that flunked semester). Minimum GPA requirement was a 3.25 and I thought I had it in the bag, but had no idea they would combine my GPA from both schools together. Being mid summer already, I had to scramble and pick a different major, figured Econ was similar and a lot of my credits went towards that. Pretty much all the Econ prerequisite classes were filled at this point, so I was stuck taking econ electives I was not prepared for. Finished my lone semester at that school with a 2.48, and decided not to go the next semester after being frustrated and had no idea what I wanted to do. Very shortly after that semester ended, I some how fell upon some reddit discussions about rental properties, and said that's what I'm going to do. Buy rental properties and retire early. 

Over the next 3 years up until now, I bought 3 properties, (2 duplexes and 1SFH) and they all cash flow well. Took a lot of grinding to purchase them and pay contractors to renovate some of them. Made some mistakes, but my lord I learned a ton. Mortgages, rehab costs, basically how to run a business with systems, and made some good relationships. I Even got my Real Estate license, sold a few houses and represented myself on 2 of the purchases for myself. I bartended through college and have continued doing that full time, as I make about 75k-85k a year doing that on average, while also having some side hustles like churning credit cards to fund all this. There were definitely struggles, like when COVID first hit and I lost my job, so I had to Instacart 60 hours a week to pay for the renovation costs on my first property, but I think it was worth it. 

Although I would say I've done well and want to continue to buy real estate, the grind of bartending has really got to me over the past year. There's absolutely no way I can do this for another 10 years until my rental property business catches up. I want to continue buying rental properties, but its a slow process. Plus, my goals have changed a bit. The idea that I need to retire as early as possible isn't as appealing.  I want to find more meaningful work that challenges myself, that's makes me use my problem solving skills and makes me try to learn new things. I feel my protentional is completely tapped out with bartending, like... this is it. There's really no room to grow from here, financially and skills wise. CS was the first thing that came to mind when exploring other careers, as it fits all those things and pays well. I've had interest in it at other times in the past, and have always thought I would at some point learn to program on my own and create some real estate involved software after growing that business. I've played around with a little python from Youtube and I seem to enjoy it, as it clicks well with me. So here I am, 24 with a new inspiration, trying to find a path in the industry with a few different ways to go. Here are the options that seem best from what I've looked into 

1) Go back to CC for a year to complete the CS pre-reqs. I would already have the gen ed stuff done from my AS so it would only take a year with a couple summer classes. I could then transfer to a state school with a good program to finish off my bachelors (we have a couple here that are top 40 in CS). Total time would take about 3 years. Cost maybe $30k. I could pay it all out of pocket

2) First, go back to my local state school and finish my BS in Econ. Would probably take 1.5 years, maybe 1yr  but that would be a stretch. Then, because the the CS program doesn't seem to be very good there, transfer to another state school with a good program to do my masters. Total time would take 3.5yrs, cost a little more at about $40k. Main concern with this is if I would prepared for a Master CS program while not taking any other CS classes before. I would definitely have to do a good amount of work on the side to get myself prepared (not that I wouldn't be doing that anyways)

3) Instead of transferring to a good CS state school after 1 yr of CC, I could go back to the local state school I was at before and get my CS BS there. Like I said before, It's not a very well known program, so I might have a hard time getting internships, but this school is local so I wouldn't have to do any traveling/moving, and would probably be less challenging judging by the course work allowing me maybe finish quicker/have a higher GPA. 

Bootcamp was also something I looked into, and I'm not sure I really consider it an option. It seems like a hard way to stand out, and I'm not sure I would learn as well compared to a school environment. Plus if at any point I decide programming isn't for me, at least with school I'll have credits to show for it instead of a very large lump sum of money gone. obviously if others feel different on this please shed some light

Sorry, I made the post this long, but I figured the more details on my situation the better. I'm not sure if I can use my experience with real estate and my AS in BA to help leverage into the industry on top of all this to make me more marketable for a better job, so any insight on that would be appreciated as well."

To be honest I never thought I’d be in this role this early in my life it kind of just worked out unintentionally but I love it so far as I love learning and staying busy! 

Currently majoring in data analytics I had some technical knowledge w/ SQL, R, and Python. The study focused on applying these languages and frameworks to real world business applications to solve questions that a business may have. I first applied for my internship when I turned 20 as a business analyst but the recruiter told me the position was filled so I began to look for more options. She then mentioned their’s something else that might interest me which was in software development. Originally I frayed away from it but then I realized I didn’t really have options at the time (as summer was approaching soon) and it wouldn’t hurt to try something new. For my first interview they gave me some technical questions that I was able to put together somewhat which worked out as I was offered the position. I was really confused as I thought I botched the interview but the company that hired me said they based their candidates more behaviorally than on a technical basis. 

Anyway fast forward a few months after learning Js, node, and react enough to begin cranking out tickets. I was able to get a full time offer which is fully remote and I’m just amazed at how different of a path I have come down! 

I just wanted to share this with everyone so you can get away from your comfort zone and try new things even if you’re not close to ready!"

my current WAM is 85, but it almost takes all my times to make it. 

Is the experience of internship much more important than WAM?

A few weeks ago I was accepted to the BS computer science program at IUPUI with a 18000 USD scholarship resulting in a Cost of attendance of approximately 20k USD. Furthermore, I recently received a notification that I also received transfer credit (32 credits) based on my high school curriculum (A-level) as follows:

You have received credit for the following IUPUI courses:

* MATH 16500 (4 credits)
* CHEM-C 105 (4 credits)
* CHEM-C 125 (4 credits)
* PHYS-P 201 (4 credits)
* PHYS-P 202 (4 credits)
* 8 undistributed computer science credits
* 4 undistributed math credits

I may or may not decide to attend IUPUI based on the answer to the questions below. I hope you can help me out:

1. I know that, especially in Computer Science, the university you graduate from does not matter but what matters are your skills. However, I may decide to go back to my home country or pursue a masters degree at a top 10 university in US or abroad. I know that Purdue is recognised throughout the world, therefore it is important to me that I get a Purdue University degree at IUPUI. I would attend Purdue University but It does not offer the same amount of scholarships as IUPUI for international students. Is there a chance that an agreement may be broken between IU and PU and we would not get a PU degree? Is there a chance that what happened at Fort Wayne would soon happen at IUPUI?
2. Based on my transfer credits, will I be able to complete my degree (120 credits) in 3-years
3. How are the professors, campus/party life?
4. Are there any co-op/internships/research opportunities for computer science students? Job fairs? Same amount of opportunities as the west Lafayette and Fort Wayne campus? I am already working on my data science skill and multiple projects so is there a chance that I can get an internship at an average to good tech company in Chicago with the help of IUPUI?
5. Can I transfer to the Purdue main campus in my last year and graduate within 1-year (i.e will all the credits be transferred)?"

I am a Non-EU student studying Msc in CS in Germany. I am currently working as a working student for a start-up and I got an offer to do an Internship in Hubspot. I can not decide which should I choose that is better my career forward. I can not do both of them because my work authorization doesn't not allow me to do so. I will write the Pros and Cons of each option in my opinion.

HubSpot Pros:

Salary is higher than start up as a full time If i got an offer. (Probably?)

Looks good on my CV. (Probably?)

Better learning opportunity than start start up.  (Also Probably? I have no idea really)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HubSpot Cons:

It is not guaranteed to get a full time offer after the internship. This is really important for me because I don't want to graduate and then be stressed while looking for an offer as I want to stay in Germany. The start up promised me to join as a full time immediately after graduation as they are satisfied with my work.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Startup Pros:

More money overall. (Not that important tho)

I will have more experience as a working student. But idk which is better: 1.5 years of experience as a working student or 3 months full time internship at Hubspot.

Have full time offer after graduation.

The company uses new and interesting tech stack that I have no idea about such as Docker and kubernetes. I enjoy my work using the company's frameworks to build full stack components of the company system and the environment is relaxed.

Thanks so much for your time and I would really appreciate any advice."

raxd6g,40,2021-12-07,Just left my well paying job to do nothing for a while,Bigal267,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/raxd6g/just_left_my_well_paying_job_to_do_nothing_for_a/,"**TL;DR** I’m taking a 3-month hiatus from working and wondering if anyone has any suggestions for me on how to get the most out of that time.

___

Hey everyone, been lurking on this sub for a while, and I wanted to share a recent event in my life. 

Yesterday I handed in my 3-month notice. I work for a big tech company as a software engineer, very well paid, had a good work/life-balance, good benefits, worked with a great team, all that fun stuff. I’ve worked at this company for about 4 years after interning there and then rejoining as a university graduate. There was a lot I liked about them for a while, but it always got to me a bit that I wasn’t really doing anything that helped anyone. 

A lot of what I worked on felt like finding ways to get people to spend money, rather than creating compelling experiences that someone really wants to use, and that always felt very unfulfilling. I realised that the biggest reason I was hanging around was just because I really like the team I work with. And that’s fine for many things, but isn’t enough for the long term. Lately, we were moved on to a new project where none of the people in charge seem to know what’s going on, and the work that comes up gets supplanted before it’s done by the next “big important thing”. This constant mental-whiplash had a really negative effect on my mental health, I was finding it really hard to keep up and therefore, hard to switch off after work. This lead to being too tired for many of the things I enjoyed and needed to do in my real life because I needed time to recover from work. I was starting to pay for my work life with my personal life.

I also had some bigger, fundamental issues with working. Since we are very young, we are conditioned to have a “dream job”, and to think about our career when making subject choices at college, then degree choice for university, then industry choice for internship, and so on. I feel like I’ve been on this non-stop track for years and years, and I’ve never stopped to ask myself if I’m in a place I really want to be in. I deeply resent the 5-day workweek, and the notion of having to give up my time to work for someone else so that they give me the money I’m literally unable to survive in the 21st century without. 

With that in mind, I’ve been putting money aside for a little while, so I can pay for myself to have a 3-month break from working, without impacting my savings much. I’m aiming to take the first month as a complete rest and reset from this job, then the following 2 months to think about what’s next for me. I’m posting this because I wondered…

-	Has anyone had similar feelings? How did you deal with that?
-	Has anyone else taken a brief working hiatus like this? And if so, do they have any suggestions for me on how to make the most of it?
-	Anyone out there made a really radical career change? What’s your story, and how did it go for you?"
razerd,1,2021-12-07,Software Engineer Internship,BoredPerson11111,Resume,https://www.reddit.com/r/Resume/comments/razerd/software_engineer_internship/,I have done 5 different internships (4 months each) as a Software Engineer intern.

rb0cjk,5,2021-12-07,I'm about to become a one-man team again. How can I be more professional?,Downhouser,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb0cjk/im_about_to_become_a_oneman_team_again_how_can_i/,"I'm a 3,5 year sysadmin of a small solar-power company of around 60 employees. We sell and install photovoltaic projects. Our IT infrastructure is a series of connected services (BPM, CRM, Gsuite, AWS database), mostly through Zapier or other stuff. I do development, operation, support and data analysis.  


I'm not very good at this. I started my internship as an electric project designer (I have an energy engineering degree) when the company was around 10 people and then started automating stuff here and there and then boom: I was in charge of the IT division. I mess around with a lot of stuff and the company decided I needed an intern to help me out. Today our second intern left the company after 3 months of work saying that ""it didn't had as much dev work as he'd wish"".   


I'm frustrated. I also share the ""not enough dev work"" feeling as I spend hours on my week helping people with low level demands like manually inserting values on the database which got caught in an automation hiccup, returning tasks on our BPM, restarting our server, checking for new exceptions that caused automation hiccups and many other boring stuff. Some of my colleagues from other divisions are getting better jobs in other companies as they are growing professionally, whereas I feel like I'm stuck on this.  


I feel like I need help on how to structure this division, which is about to become a 1 man team again. I use a ticketing system for bugs, demands and new projects. My week hours are divided to work on those tickets by type, but I feel like all of this is very chaotic as demands are always coming in from everywhere and I always need to stop something to work on something else. What are some tips you guys have?"

rb2pod,918,2021-12-07,I feel guilty about having a network and mentors that are banking on me being great one day,sad-cloudz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rb2pod/i_feel_guilty_about_having_a_network_and_mentors/,"I have been working really hard to build my network this year. I’m a senior in ME but picked up a second major in Physics so I’ve got a few years left. I figured it’s a good time to start networking and I unknowingly chose the best mentor I could have while still in high school, My trade school instructor who is hooking me up with a ton of people in the industry I want to work in (Advanced Materials). He convinced a company to take me to conferences and hire me on as an intern, and my role is to literally network and connect companies with each other… so I’m at a place where people are starting to know who I am and giving me internship offers and I feel like a FAKE BITCH. 

y’all I have a 2.7 GPA. I have failed 6 classes, got kicked out of the ME program (but ultimately got back in due to a medical issue triggered existential crisis… gave up on life for a bit, thankful they let me back in). I’m 🤏 this close to not making into the professional program. I was never a star student in high school despite constantly being labeled as an over achiever. In reality I’m just fucking ADHD and have to do EVERYTHING I want to do all at the same time to keep myself from being bored. No it’s more like damn I’m bored, I need to do something else, then I have bursts of obsessions that lead me to make impulsive decisions. Last night I decided to minor in philosophy and I don’t even know where it came from. I started in Physics cuz of the philosophical aspect so it should make sense, but I just don’t… think things through. But That is the only damn reason I have the experience that I have. And through experience, you meet people… and now I’ve gotten into an awful habit of trying to prove people wrong when they talk about how “great” I am doing. Maybe I can do multiple things but I don’t do them very well… so I just feel inadequate and I don’t want to lead people on. 

I had some drinks with my mentor and had an intense heart to heart, me about to cry telling him how bad I’m actually doing and that he’s hyping me up too much and that I felt he deserved to know how much I struggle before he continues vouching for me. He still does. I hella fear letting him down now. Of course im appreciative and I probably sound really annoying and like that bitch that fishes for reassurance but I really just feel like a poser. I don’t want to let everyone down so I figure being transparent about my mistakes and failures will give them fair warning.

This has just turned into a stupid and bratty sounding rant but the imposter syndrome is real. Now I’m at a point where I’m trying to help some of my classmates get to where I’m at because I know a handful of people who fucking deserve it. Idk how I ended up where I’m at but I do know that this shouldn’t be a hidden secret, students should experience how far networking will get them, and not in ways they think. 

We love Imposter syndrome. We doin our best to stop being annoying and just roll with it but it’s hard to feel adequate when you’re societies stereotype of a shitty student. I know it’s more than a GPA but it still feels… wrong.

Edit: I know gpa won’t matter in the future.. and the reassurance of it is great, I appreciate y’all. ~however~ I’m in my last semester of pre-professional and am riding the edge at 2.79 when I need at least a 2.8 to qualify to continue engineering. Tbh sounds like a damn scam to me, if I’m here and I’m paying and I’m willing to fail over and over again until I get it right, why can they kick me out? Idk it’s really frustrating. Finals are my last shot at making my goals come true, it’s a very intense time right now haha. Pray for me 🥸"

rb3ar6,206,2021-12-07,Feels weird knowing that it's my absolute final time at UCI,jeffreytown,UCI,https://www.reddit.com/r/UCI/comments/rb3ar6/feels_weird_knowing_that_its_my_absolute_final/,"Just finished my last finals and it feels so weird. I'm graduating this quarter so this final (other than commencement) is the last thing I'll be doing at UCI. This feeling is different than the one I felt when graduating high school because back then I knew that at UCI I would still be under the wings of my parents, doing the same thing (studying), and not worrying about much other than getting good grades, extracurriculars (internships, clubs, etc.), and having fun. 

But now that I'm graduating from UCI, I know that I'm not going to be under the wings of my parents since I'm moving to another state for the job I acquired. I'll be paying my own bills and making my own choices. I'll be living alone for the first time in my life and it's a bit scary knowing this. 

I didn't have the best time at UCI. I came as a freshman in 2019 and during Spring Quarter (I believe), COVID took over and I was at home for more than a year. So I only got to fully experience UCI for a year and even when in-person I felt inactive. I wasn't very active in clubs nor was I able to meet anyone that I could call a true friend. However, I'm still glad I came here because just the career center alone made me feel more confident in my future, and while not all, there were definitely professors that were really great and loved what they were doing which made me love being in their class. 

Well, I just wanted to say this out loud somewhere so thanks for reading. For everyone doing their finals, good luck to you all and I know that all of you will do exceptionally!"
rb3bl5,1,2021-12-07,Self Taught Developer Job Hunting,WidePalmSlap,Frontend,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/comments/rb3bl5/self_taught_developer_job_hunting/,"So I finally made a reddit account since I wasn't really sure what else to do next. I've been self learning code for about a year and a half now (after graduating but in lockdown due to Covid), but it still feels completely impossible to find a job. 

Every time I look at job postings in Canada (where i'm from), I see that I typically know how to use and implement the technologies, however, don't get an interview even with a portfolio and degree in Science (Immunology).

I am focusing primarily on the frontend (React), however, I also have MERN development experience. I try to stay up-to-date with technologies, learning Redux and TypeScript that have both been implemented in side projects.

I don't know many people in the industry, but the 3 people I do know say I have the skills to do an entry level job, so it adds to the feeling of being lost.

Luckily, I landed a 6 month internship for a company that ended in October, however, it hasn't helped me with landing any interviews, and makes me question what to do next

I'm really looking for guidance or even possibly an opportunity, since as of right now I think I need to do a bootcamp to show some sort of certification/redirection of my new career path.

Keep applying? Bootcamp? Another 3 years of university (first year overlapped with current degree)? Someone help a lost self taught programmer"
rb523v,3,2021-12-07,25M UK Won’t ever get to achieve what I wanted from life after studying oversaturated degree.,Jayyyy20,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/rb523v/25m_uk_wont_ever_get_to_achieve_what_i_wanted/,"Where do I begin? Well I only just graduated 6 months ago in BSc Business &amp; Management with a first. Other people would be happy with that but since 2018 when I quit an internship that I got forced into I had doubts about corporate environments but saw no other option due to my escalation of commitment. Did an exchange year instead but now I’m 25 with no relevant experience and I feel like I chose the wrong path completely.

All I’ve ever wanted from life was to permanently live somewhere with a better climate as it does wonders for my mental health. The UK for me is so shit and unhappy I feel like giving up most days in winter and have zero motivation. I have lived somewhere like that on exchange and genuinely felt 100x better, so it’s not a “grass is greener” case.

Here’s the catch-22, I’m still applying for these corporate jobs because I feel like I have to but due to how saturated they are I know I’ll never get a visa sponsor in any of these lines of work, so I lie to them and say how much I dream of working for them from their office in Milton Keynes or Worksop or whichever shitty grey commuter town they’re based in.

I did try and study a conversion masters in CS as it would open a lot of doors to my aims but I dropped out after 3 weeks (lol) as the expected understanding and learning rate was a complete joke and the staff were just patronising. Maybe I’m just too dumb to understand computers, seem to be pretty shit at everything else.

Anyway, what’s people’s take on this?"

rb8g9k,2,2021-12-07,"I'm a broke fresh graduate with no savings, and my new part-time job at a restaurant brings back my trauma of being bullied and triggers my anxiety.",flyingroachez,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rb8g9k/im_a_broke_fresh_graduate_with_no_savings_and_my/,"((Trigger warning: Bullying, Anxiety))

I'm a fresh graduate who lives abroad. My family's economic condition went downhill since the pandemic, which forced me to fully finance my own self ever since I graduated from university earlier this year.

Unfortunately, the job market in where I live was (and still) affected a lot by the pandemic, and I wasn't able to get a full-time job during my first few months after graduation. So I decided to just took any opportunity that was offered to me at that time, just to keep myself survived. I ended up working 2 jobs for a while; a full-time internship and a part-time job as a private tutor.

I love both of my jobs and I can pay my own bills from them. But my contracts for those 2 jobs will be ended in a couple months, and now I have to find a way to sustain my income after my contracts ends.

Knowing that I'm looking for a job, a friend of mine offered me to work at her workplace at a restaurant. I'm no stranger with working in a restaurant, I've work on similar roles for years in the past, so I thought I can do a great job. 

I applied to this new restaurant last month and I work there for only a day/week for now. This way it doesn't affects my other jobs a lot. However, I feel that my new job at the restaurant is giving me negative effects lately, especially on my mental/emotional side.

My boss at the restaurant is a nice lady and I genuinely like her, but she have this tendency to raise her voice and screams at her employee at work. She have warned me about her being loud at the beginning, and I totally understand that her action was never meant to hurt anyone. That's just how her personality works.

Working there was fine at the beginning. But later on, I feel that her scream voices is somehow brings back bad memories from my past. 

I had a handful experience of being bullied during my childhood/teenage years, and there was a moment in highschool where I was intensely being screamed at and harassed physically and verbally. This was happened a long time ago, I already forgive everything and left that memories in the past. But the trauma, that I thought already gone, comes back again once I work with my new boss at the restaurant.

The sound of her screams and my old memories of being bullied haunts me to sleep, even on the days where I don't work at the restaurant. At first I thought it was just me being sensitive, so I never really think about it and just distract myself with other things. 

But lately, I noticed that I have recently started to develop a binge eating and an excessive nail-biting &amp; scratching habits, which I'm well-aware only happen when I'm stressed or feeling anxious. I have never been to therapy, but the last time I have all these habits happened at the same time was when I was working on my graduation thesis. 

I've been keeping myself a healthier lifestyle since I finished my thesis and this kind of things never really happen until now. Thus, my biggest hypothesis is that my new work and boss triggers all these feeling and effects.

(Well, it could be that I'm also exhausted from all those 3 jobs as I work 60 hours a week. But idk anymore)

I'm know this is a red flag and I have an option to resign from my work at the restaurant before things are getting worse. But at the same time, I only have a little amount of savings. Working at this new workplace will help me keep myself alive abroad after my contracts (for my other jobs) ends, and I can save some emergency funds from here as well.

Sure, I do have an option to go back to my home country and live with my parents. It's cheaper and easier. But my home country has a toxic working culture and an extremely low minimum wage compared to where I live right now, which makes it a bad decision for a long term.

Now, I'm not sure whether I should resign from my restaurant job and hoping that someone will hire me for a decent full-time job shortly after my internship and tutoring contracts end. Or I should just keep working there, financially safe, but (potentially) emotionally and mentally hurt. Any advice on this? 

TL;DR - I'm a broke fresh graduate with no savings, and my new part-time job at a restaurant brings back my trauma of being bullied and triggers my anxiety. I want to leave, but I need money. What should I do?

I'm currently a third-year BS electrical engineering student and I was wondering if I should take Winter and Spring Quarter off do do this paid Co-op full time. This co-op seems really interesting and I feel like I could learn a lot from it. I'm in this situation where I'm at a loss at what I should do. For context, my university would offer me credits for this co-op but the credits would not progress me towards graduation. However, I since I took summer classes remotely for the past summers, I will be able to graduate in 4 years taking the regular course load, taking the 2 quarters off.  I also have a software engineering internship lined up for the summer. I'm not sure if I want to do hardware or software out of college, so this co-op would be a good opportunity to figure that out while also gaining some skills and work experience. I've also heard that getting internship/co-op experience immensely helps with getting a decent job out of college.

&amp;#x200B;

In sum, is it worth it for me to take 2 quarters off of school to work a co-op, or should I just focus on my classes and worry about a job when I graduate?

Thanks!"

I recently signed an offer for a software engineering internship at Google this upcoming summer (guaranteed team match), and I was wondering if any previous interns or full timers could shed some light on interning at the NYC office vs. a Bay Area office?

A lot of my friends will be interning in NYC next summer as well so that would make housing arrangements easier to organize. However, outside of my personal circumstances, I'm curious as to what others see as the advantages and disadvantages of interning at each office, and if there are any opportunities that I would be missing by interning at the NYC office vs. Bay Area office or vice versa.

Here are some things I want from my college journey:

1. (College where companies will look to hire students as employees - cs students) -- this is very important to me, my whole college list will revolve around this!!
2. (Hands-on learning - learning by coding)  -- this is also important because I want to learn the skills to get the jobs. 
3. Want the college to be cheap and/or give loads of scholarships to international students (i need scholarships if I want to rent an apartment and buy groceries, and clothes  😂  )
4. Internship opportunities - for OPT
5. Extracurricular - clubs
6. Warm weather (doesn't matter honestly)
7. Like-minded students - want to succeed, start a business (I would like to start a business but idk), proactive, A+ students, party and have fun, do things out of their comfort zone.

Hope I don't get slain by automod for typing from a fresh throwaway. Probably gonna be a long one too but I'll try to keep it quick. 

I'm a 26 y/o and this year I landed a service desk support job, L1,5 at best for a western European company, of course it's not a dream job but I really enjoy it after wasting 5 years doing stuff I didn't feel at all.

--------- skippable part i think----------

A bit of background: I dropped out of uni before I even finished my first year in a uni in Poland, I got really discouraged thinking I'm too big of an idiot for a serious IT job so I ended up working in sales and afterwards in Key Account, almost 5 years.

Somewhere during those 5 years I tried applying for IT jobs, even internships that paid bare minimum but didn't get a single interview which discouraged me even further. This year I decided to try again and after absolutely optimizing my resume with a friend who works in recruitment I managed to get a junior support job.

I know high school, especially in a country like Poland isn't much challenge, I wasn't some prodigy kid but I managed to finish like top 3 of my class, turning in all my projects written from scratch for better grades.

The problem is I did all this and ended up nowhere, and people who couldn't build simple java functions are working as Devs today and I'm thinking... When and what the fuck went wrong?

--------- end of totally skippable part ----------

I'm not sure if I downplayed my skills too much or what but... the support job feels so easy it doesn't even provide real challenge. I'm involved in ""incident Management"" but that's basically an escalate the case to the right L3 team or external vendor and see what happens role.

I feel like wasted 5 years gaining irrelevant experience that is already obsolete as sales is something I don't want to do ever again (unless I'm selling my own things which isn't happening soon) and I'm starting with basically nothing with a junior entry level position at 26yo.

The real questions that I have start here:

* I have a feeling that the wasted 5 years close a lot of doors for an actually meaningful career in IT, whether it's Dev/automation testing/whatever. Wondering if that's just me downplaying again or if it's really much harder to score anything without experience and degree after so many years since leaving HS. I feel like I have the absolute last call to make a meaningful decision if it's not too late already
* How hard ACTUALLY is it to get and keep a job as a junior Dev without any experience. At the moment I only have basic knowledge of multiple languages (C# and Python being the top ones) but I don't feel confident enough to say I'm proficient in any. I have an option to take a course that my employer would pay like 3/4 of costs, but obviously that comes with some extra commitment to the employer.
* How actually important algorithmics are to become a Dev/tester, during my brief time in uni we've been told to study ""Introduction to algorithms"" by Thomas Cormen, the book was very hard for me to understand and it took super long for me to get why the described algorithms actually work, and when I reopened the book just to briefly remind myself what was in it, it took me a long time to interpret simple algorithms like sorting or similar.
* Are there any other interesting routes to consider If it would be too late for a Dev path? Right now I'm a jack of all trades, master of nothing, but there are some fundamentals to work with.

Getting any input from you guys would be great, I know the wall of texts are hard to get into. Been feeling really down today but some of the success stories here are quite heart-warming.

Sorry if there missing words or letters, I've proof read the entire thing and there was a lot nonsense so I probably skipped something

Tldr: 26 year old just scored support desk job this year, previous 5 years of experience is irrelevant, wondering if there's still time to do something bigger than IT support."

My uni is well known, at least here in Germany, though not necessarily for CS. 

Suppose I'd have a relevant internship+GPA of &gt;3.8 and some side projects, is that enough to at least have a chance to interview with Google or the like? I did hear many stories from my colleagues where they never ever got an interview with Google, even though they had  good grades and relevant experience. 

Passing the interview is another story altogether, I know that, but I would just like some clarification as to how high FAANG standards are over here in Europe to invite you to an interview in the first place."

This will be a bit stream-of-consciousness, so bear with me.

**Background**

I graduated in 2012 with a degree in philosophy. I switched majors 3 times during the 6 years it took to finish my first bachelors. In those 6 years I went from jazz performance, to history, and finally to philosophy. I accrued 9 W's, an overall 2.9 GPA, and an in major 3.6 GPA. I worked full-time as a server and bartender through much of school. Living in a city and working in a restaurant through much of college, college definitely took a backseat and I never really took it seriously. I also struggled with undiagnosed and poorly self-treated mental health issues which contributed to my performance and lack of direction.

The day after graduation looked much like the 6 years before. I woke up that morning and went to work at the restaurant. I never took seriously the idea of transitioning into professional work and to try to actually use my degree. I enjoyed philosophy and was pretty passionate about it. I considered graduate school but never really pursued it. Considering my overall transcript I figured it wasn't worth the effort.

I continued to work as a bartender for the next few years until burnout hit hard and my work performance dropped dramatically. I was fired. I had no idea what to do. I was a 25/26 year old college graduate with nothing in savings, no prospects, and ended up moving in with my Dad. Pretty low point in my life.

I decided it was time for a change. I tried getting random jobs from insurance claims to t-shirt salesmen but nothing really worked out. Computers were always a bit of a hobby. I was a PC gamer and enjoyed building and fiddling with computers. I decided to apply to Geek Squad. I got a job as Consultantion Agent, which was basically customer service and sales, with the hope of a promotion into a repair position, where I'd get to work on computers. After about 2 years at this job I was recommended by the in-store Apple rep to apply for a support job with Apple.  I then worked as a AppleCare advisor for about 2 years. By far the worst job I've ever had. It was absolutely draining. The burnout hit hard and fast and for the second time in my life, I was fired.

**Rejected by OSU**

Luckily this time I had some savings. I took my time and decided it was time to ""upgrade"" professionally. This was the first time I applied to OSU's post-bacc CS program. I had attempted for years to learn how to program on my own with little success. Going through self-paced courses on Udacity and Team Treehouse. I had learned a bit of HTML/CSS/JS along with a bit of Python but with the lack of direction and nothing pushing me to stick with it I gave up each time quite quickly. My application to OSU was rejected and swiftly gave up on the idea, again.

**The Job That Turned It All Around**

I then found what was to my most pivotal job, providing both the professional growth and confidence I needed, as well as the push to pursue software development. I was hired by an EPM software company as a software analyst. The role was basically a hybrid of support, consulting, and data analyst. After a year in this role it was clear to me that there was nothing I wanted to do more than code. I loved the little bit of coding I got to do at work. Mostly writing SQL and some small scripts in Python to automate tasks and ingest data. Turns out I was pretty good at my job and was promoted twice within a few years into a senior role within the team. With the tuition reimbursement, the steady 9-5 hours, and tech company environment in a technical role, I had the mental bandwidth and confidence to take seriously the idea of making a career in software development happen.

**Accepted!**

I signed up for a calculus course at the local community college for the spring of 2019 and applied once again to OSU's post-bacc CS program. After receiving a 99% in calculus and including this new, untarnished, single-course transcript with my application, along with a decently well written personal statement, I was accepted!

**Start of OSU**

I took 161 and 225 together my first term along with working FT (which I continued to do throughout the program). 225 was quite challenging to say the least. Having taken a lot of symbolic logic in my philosophy coursework and recently completing calculus, it wasn't as difficult as it likely is for many other students but learning how to juggle a FT job with CS coursework was a struggle.

**Here was my coursework breakdown with the difficulty level of each term from D1-10 and enjoyment level from E1-10:**

**Note:** I worked FT throughout the program

Fall 2019: 161/225 D7 E6

Winter 2020: 162 D5 E8

Spring 2020: 261/290 D6 E8

Summer 2020: 325 D9 E3

Fall 2020: 340/361 D4 E7

Summer 2021: 372 D5 E5

Fall 2021: 493/467 D6 E7

**Internship Hunt**

During the summer of 2020 I began prepping and applying for internships. All told I did about 90 Leetcode problems over \~3 months and applied to \~90 companies. I heard back from 2, failing 1 technical assessment and 1 final interview. I was feeling quite defeated but on the recommendation of my advisor, decided to attend the Fall 2020 OSU Career Fair. Because of the pandemic the career fair was virtual and I was able to schedule time to meet with a handful of companies. One of those companies ended up offering me a Software Engineer internship after a few subsequent interviews, which is where I continue to work today.

**Quitting my FT Job for an Internship**

This was a pretty tough decision. I was paid well at my company but no FT dev roles were available. I decided to take a gamble, accepting the internship offer and quit my job June 2021, starting my internship a few days later. The internship was a great experience. I learned a ton and impressed both the team I was placed on and my manager. They were impressed enough to offer me a FT job. I was in the middle of FT job hunting but happily accepted after a bit of salary negotiation.

**Last Term, FT SWE Job, and Up To Today**

This last term I took 493 and 467. I also started my FT software engineer job with the company I interned for. It was hard to code all day at work then code all night and weekend but 493 was a great course. The instructor approved me using C# .NET Core for 493 and I enjoyed the projects. I use C# .NET Core at work, so the feedback loop was great. I turned in my final assignment a few days ago and have been enjoying for the first time in almost three years just having to work. I've used the spare time after work to spend time with my girlfriend, watch hockey, and just veg out. It's been great.

**Conclusion**

Not sure this post had much of a point. I just wanted to share my story from directionless bartender to Software Engineer. Hopefully the post serves as inspiration to others. Also might be too long and no one ends up reading it. If so, oh well. It was a cathartic release that benefited me. If anyone has any questions feel free to PM me or just leave a comment below!

I had known these two for years. My best friend was in the frat I was in but we were in the same clique so we got really close. I knew his girlfriend before they started dating but when they got together I got to know her more since she was around a lot. I always had a crush on her but I honored the bro code while they were dating. Over the years, her and I became really good friends.

Over the summer, his girlfriend and I became neighbors and helped each other move in. We were some of the only ones from our friend group on campus since she was working as an intern for a nearby company and I was doing an online internship while working as an evening/night-shift liquor store clerk. We would always get small groups together to go to the bars and after my late-night shift I would usually get some beers to listen to music and hang since we both were up late at night. We got really close but there was no hint of anything romantic going on. Although I did still have a small crush on her, I only looked at her as a friend.

One night over the summer, my friend came to visit campus because he was leaving the country to go work for a couple years and was packing things and also hanging out with our buddies before he’s gone for a while. He got really drunk and we had fun. I mentioned how cool his girlfriend was and he went on this tangent about how it hasn’t been going well for several months and he wanted both of them to start seeing new people. He had been cheating on her and since he was leaving soon, this was the time to get out.

Shortly after that night, I went over to his girlfriends after my shift for our usual hang out sessions. We did our normal business but she mentioned that she and my friend broke up, just to let me know. We talked about it but she wasn’t sad. Their relationship had become really toxic this past year and he was abusive. They hadn’t had sex in several months and she had wanted to get out of it for a long time but couldn’t because they lived together. We stayed up all night doing our usually shenanigans- showing each other music we found, going on walks around campus, and then eventually coming back to my house to watch a movie. We just didn’t want to go to bed for some reason. When we were watching a movie, she got closer and closer to me until we started cuddling. Then kissing. One thing led to another and she was taking a shower with me before we both headed out for our days. 

We hooked up every night for the next 15 days till the conversation came up on what this exactly was. I was worried that it was just a hook-up deal because I really liked her. She really liked me too so we started dating. We still kept things on the down-low because my friend (her ex) was still in town and we were also worried that all of our mutual friends would disapprove of our relationship. 

It was funny to me because we would hang out in one of our houses or go to the bars and I would leave early because “I had to go do stuff” but in reality I was going to this girl's house. But word spread quickly as I told some people what was going on and I also posted my nights out with her on social media. First couple of days after our relationship officially started, my friend (her ex) showed up with some of our friends at her house after she and I had just gotten home from the bars with her friends. Everyone freaked out but he wanted to talk to me and had nothing to do with her. I was expecting to get into a 3 on 1 fist fight with my friends but basically he told me that he’s happy I’m dating his ex, she’s a good person, but I should’ve told him that I was seeing her at least. So that was that, the crisis was averted. 

We ended up dating for 3 months. Things were really great. It was a dream to date my best friend and we did everything together. Every day one of us would come over to our houses and we’d cook food, do homework, watch movies, and sleep together. Every weekend we’d go out to the bars with our mutual friends who ended up loving us and rooted us from the start. We went on a lot of road trips to go camping and other adventures. We made a lot of plans for the future and even played with the idea of life together after college. We were so good together and I absolutely fell in love with this girl. 

But there was some residual trauma from her past relationship. Like I said, it was really toxic and my friend was abusive to her. I loved him but he was a bit of an asshole. Although we had a healthy sex life, sometimes she wouldn’t be in the mood because it reminded her of that trauma. He basically manipulated her and borderline raped her. Even though things were great, I could tell that some other things were on her mind and it stressed me out. She could tell that I was worried sometimes so we talked it out and she said that she just hasn’t felt that she was the best version of herself and sometimes it really worries her that she can’t give me her best. She wanted to quit drinking, work out more, and other stuff to improve on her self-image. I assured her that she’s everything I wanted in a woman and that she didn’t have to worry about that. I care about her mental health and asked her if she wanted to take a break so she can focus on that. But she really didn’t want that because she really loved our relationship and didn’t want to lose it. We were good for each other and we can work on it together.

A week passed after that talk and things had been good. We allotted some time in the day to do our own things like work out and work on schoolwork alone but we’d still talk over phone and meet up to eat dinner together. The weekend following that week was great. She felt better and even wanted to go out and drink with friends. It made me so happy to see her feeling better and we even had a lot of intimate moments when we got alone time. 

One night I had a panic attack from all the things going on in my life- my dad’s cancer, applying for internships/jobs, and her mental state. I had received some bad news and it just broke me after hearing it. I went on a rant to my girlfriend about life and how everything seems to be on a rollercoaster. I kept accusing her of wanting to leave me from the talk we had a week ago and she was completely blindsided by what I was saying. She said that things have been going so great and it sounds like something I wanted to do. I didn’t but decided to sleep over it because a lot was on my mind. 

The next day I regretted all that I had said. I was just in some sort of blind rage and was really self-destructive. I told her that I didn’t mean anything that I said last night but she still wanted to meet up and talk. We talked later that night and it was basically a repeat of the talk that we had a week ago except that she felt that it was best for us to take a break to sort our stuff out. She really liked me but she feels that we’re the right people at the wrong time. I got emotional again and told her that I’d rather break up and move on because I don’t want to be waiting around. I wanted to stay together because I was so afraid that things would change if we separated. But she really wanted time away to work on herself, besides our relationship was going really fast and especially since we started seeing each other romantically the night she got out of her past relationship. She was just overwhelmed with everything going on and it was affecting her mental health. Her being worried about making me happy finalized the decision to take some time away. So we broke up. We talked here and there the week after and decided that after some time away we can try to rekindle what we had but right now we need time away.

It’s been 2 months since the break up and it’s been tough. Even though things ended on good terms, we have barely talked to each other since she has expressed the need to be alone. My last interaction was giving her a thing of flowers a couple weeks after we broke up but she said that what I want is too soon and she needs more time to herself and maybe I need more time too. So I have been respecting her space and spending that time working on myself. Overall I’ve had a fairly positive outlook on it all. I want to become the best version of myself out of all of this too, whether we start talking again or not. There is no doubt that I have had rough patches on this journey, I miss her and am still in love with her. There have been times, especially right after the break up, where I would just cry all night. Some other times I would just be so mad at everything going on. But that’s just life and I need to keep chugging forward. 

Anyways, I’m going on a tangent about that. I’m so sorry for the mountain of text and I congratulate you for reading all of it if you did. Writing all this has made me chuckle a bit and helped me get some of my thoughts straight. Looking back at it all, I think it was such a funny and crazy adventure. Writing about it helps me not to fixate on certain details of the ending and look at the bigger picture. I just think it’s a funny but tragic series of events to put on TIFU.

TL;DR- Basically I stepped on my best friend’s toe by dating his ex right after they broke up which caused a lot of drama. Then I completely fell in love with this girl which came to kick me in the butt when she wanted to separate to work on herself because she felt she couldn’t give me her best from the issues in her life and the traumas of her past toxic relationship."

So I got into the OIT After hours consulting position. Since I'm a commuter, I don't know if it's safe to come at 10 pm on Busch and then leave at like 2 AM. However, this would be my first IT experience, which I definitely need to land more internships. What do you guys think? Should I go for it or nah?"

TL;DR, long term friend is struggling with mental health and stressing, maybe endangering his pregnant wife. Idk how to help him, and barely have my own head above water.

I (24M) have a friend who I went to a super religious highschool with (25M). I he got married 3 years ago, about 2 years ago, I began leaving the religious community we were a part of. His wife (20sF) is pregnant with their first kid. 

This friend has had chronic anxiety, migraines and depression issues for as long as I knew him. In fact, the only time that hasn't been depressed was while he was working as an electrician's apprentice the few months before he started dating his wife until a few months after they were married (less than a year.) I have never really spoken to his wife; she is too religious to have a conversation with a man, but he tells me that she has said she would not have give it with him at all if she'd known about his mental health.

My friend just told me that last night he's screamed that he wished he'd committed suicide before getting married so he could do it without hurting his wife, and then bashed his head into his refrigerator until he got a concussion. He also told that while this was his first time getting so violent, he'd been talking out loud about suicide and failing to complete basic adult tasks for a while already. He is currently working as an intern psychologist while finishing up his online master's.

I have always supported him through his issues, and he mine, but I really feel helpless here. I am currently living rent free in my grandfather's attic, working 3 jobs, applying to law school, struggling with all of it, unable to quit because of the commitment involved (two teaching jobs, high school and middle school, I teach 100 kids in two schools 9 periods on weekdays, 4 periods in Fridays, and I suck at it) I'm lonely, helpless, depressed, and just overall weak. I'm barely able to take care of myself.

I don't know how to help him, I can't bring myself to do the things I know I need to do to help myself, I'm lost. Does anyone have advice for me? For me to give to him?"

I just feel very awkward and don't know where to slip into conversations. When I was an intern I didn't go to those events much, now that I got a full-time job, I still don't want to go.

I get along with my team very well, but I'm not much of a talker. I chitchat when people start it, the rest of the time I work. I maintain good professional connections when working, but never at those events. I do my job very well.

Another thing is, I don't drink. I'm in my 20s and barely had a drop of alcohol in my life. Sometimes it makes me feel like a weirdo. But truth is I just don't enjoy those.

So I don't know, is it bad I don't attend those events?"
rbfqds,795,2021-12-07,ADVICE: Dad quit his job with no plan going forward.,katichichori,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/rbfqds/advice_dad_quit_his_job_with_no_plan_going_forward/," 

Hi everyone, I’m (21F) from an Indian family living in Adelaide, Australia for 6 years now. My dad recently quit his job as a project manager in an IT company today. He told his reasons were that he was tired of being in the rat race. He wanted to have peace and wants to go on a spiritual journey on his own.

For a bit of context, my mom and dad were fighting for a few weeks because my dad wants to bring his mother (my paternal grandmother) to Australia for a visit as she has never been here since we moved. But my mother does not want her to be here because my paternal grandmother is a narcissist who continually bullies, belittles and humiliates my mother “for taking her son away from her and moving so far from her”.

My dad is sounding very depressed and has clearly mentioned his suicidal thoughts. He later said that he didn’t want to put his children through that and will not kill himself which is why he quit his job instead.

We have many finances to take care of which would be tough to manage on my mum's salary alone. I have also just finished uni and was doing unpaid internships until I would find a paying job in my field (currently unemployed).

My mother is very angry and upset at my father for this decision and says he is doing to punish her as she stood up for herself.

I feel like they both need individual and couples counselling. (My mom has severe childhood trauma). But both refuse to go due to internalised shame and cultural reasons (“only mental people go for counselling” mindset)

What can I do to convince my parents to go for counselling?

EDIT: I’m not actually getting any useful advice on the question that I asked for. Instead I’m getting abuse on my mom. I obviously do not stand for that. It’s best that I delete this post.

EDIT 2: Thank you everyone for responding. I’ve revived some genuine advice on how I may handle the situation now and will be working on that. I will also be focusing on things at home and getting a job and will not entertaining any more replies from this post. Thank you all. 

For those who abused my mom and I, I hope you get the help you need."

rbgq8x,3,2021-12-07,Is AllPCB a good resource for beginner PCB design?,JohnScottMVP,ElectricalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricalEngineering/comments/rbgq8x/is_allpcb_a_good_resource_for_beginner_pcb_design/,"Hello,

I'm a second year electrical engineering student who is looking to get into hardware engineering. I have no prior experience with hardware or PCB design and am looking to learn a bit on my own. Hopefully I'll be able to make some sort of a small project over the winter break. 

I installed the student version of Altium Designer (since I see a lot of jobs that favor Altium) and am currently reading up on design tutorials on Altium's website. I'm hoping that learning Altium on my own over the winter will help me get a more interesting summer internship.

I was looking around and found a website called ""AllPCB"" which apparently makes your PCBs and ships all for free, and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with this website? Providing everything for free has me a bit skeptical because these types of websites tend to be sketchy.

Also another question, what is the process like for designing and ordering a PCB? Do PCB designs have some kind of universally-recognizeable file format that can be used on any PCB-ordering website? Could I open PCB design from another design application on Altium?

Any general advice is also very much appreciated. Thank you."

I also don’t have any SWE work experience and am an Econ and stats student trying to switch into CS so I feel my side projects probably have to be especially good. Are there certain skills I should focus on showing off in my projects? Or do I stick with the “just do what your interested in” mantra

My mind blanks as how replace nested loops with a faster and perhaps a less wasteful way? I know they can’t always be replaced but when is a good time to replace them.

I figure this will come with time but does anyone have any general or specific tips, use cases or examples of how to replace loops  or improve on this. I feel like this what’s turning good ideas into lame or unimpressive by speed issues. 

Been practicing algorithms in c, JavaScript and python for about a year and I seem to constantly get slower solutions when doing leetcode for example.  Self taught udemy, books and cs50x.

Ideally I like to refactor and improve a python script I created with interns and others that read 100,000 reviews and creates moods similarity recommendation engine that indexed and sorts by mood but it take 7-8 days to update it. But then I upload csv to database and works in fast. But had times where something went wrong and took 21 days to get a file. But before doing that I like to learn in general so I can make better decisions coding."

So far I like it, I haven’t started any project as it’s my first week but it’s a lot of economics and looks like a lot of modeling/forecasting work that I desperately need. 

I took this job because I desperately needed experience. I had no internship, no experience outside of sales, and was out of school for two years. 

Although I like it so far and can see myself sticking with it for multiple years. I hear it is a low risk, low reward career. Do I like getting off at 5 no matter what? Ofcourse. Do I like the job security? Forsure. But I’m thinking ahead and want to make sure I won’t be stuck in public finance for forever. I want to eventually take my skills and go in the private sector for that riskier but higher reward type of work. I’m ambitious and scared this career I’m starting will stunt my growth and future income. So am I overreacting or am I onto something?

From what I found, ideally you should be networking while in college and getting referrals (that's an advantage of attending top schools), or hopefully a place you intern at extends you an offer after college.

rbj3st,22,2021-12-07,overachieving friend thinks i'm toxic because i'm overachieving ;((,excellentlamb,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rbj3st/overachieving_friend_thinks_im_toxic_because_im/,"so I come from a pretty large school district and I’ve been living here all my life… I have many friends I grew up with since elementary school but also many I’ve only met in freshman year / this year etc.

I have a friend, call her S, whom I’ve met in the beginning of freshman year—I thought we had similar work ethics so we bonded fast. We’re both were really strong academically, taking APs in freshman year when not many in our school does that, and we’d be the people whom everyone would turn to when they needed academic help. (S is stronger academically than me though, but we’re still the top) Beyond that, S is really motivated, has been (and is) founder and president of many clubs, participates well in all her classes, seeks out extra internships and programs etc. I’ve considered her my competition but in a natural and healthy way (well until recently) and I consider her one of my closer/est friends.

S is a naturally accomplished person, but she doesn’t show too much of it— that she got a perfect SAT score, qualifies for National merit semifinalist, that she won a National competition etc. But I’ve always know these things because S either shows it subtly or because I’ve seen her name in the news etc. S has motivated me to try my best, to engage in extracurriculars etc. and when I achieve things, I’ve always felt like she should be one of the first ones to know, and that she’d congratulate me the way I’d do to her too. S is the kind of person who’d say she did poorly on a math test then gets the highest in the class, and she’d also be the person who’d say something that’s really difficult was easy—and I understood that. Sometimes I envied her intelligence, but I thought of her as a friend who would understand and laugh with me when I’m the one to call a hard test easy or an easy test hard and still get an A.

Maybe this was a one sided feeling, but I always thought S was the overachiever, and that she liked obsessing over grades with others, being 100% nerds, sharing achievements with each other etc. As the only sophomores in AP science classes (all juniors and seniors), we’d agonize over the difficulty, as president of many clubs, we’d be constantly sleeping at 3 and doing things last minute and overachieving amidst the stress and everything. S tells me how she procrastinates every day, and I would also tell her I’m exhausted / tired / stressed etc.

Apparently though, S has been complaining about me for a few weeks now, that I am bragging and always sharing my achievements, trivializing my accomplishments, saying that academics are easy, that I’m the teacher’s pet. Looking back, I do think I’ve been this way, but it was because I thought she’d understand and that she has reciprocated that to me. I thought S would understand the surprise of winning national awards, of being the only few to get an A on the essay and stuff. S regards me as toxic and wants to cut me off for that, while I want S to be a friend that I can share good and painful memories with through high school. S thinks I want attention and thinks I’m not a genuine friend.

S thinks I’m way too over accomplished, while I think S has always had a higher starting point than me and that she has been a source of good competition and support. Honestly, I’ve never shared that many wins with her but as a very “google-able” person, she knows. I personally never thought of myself as wanting attention and I actually don’t want any of that, as an introvert and insecure person. I only let S and a few others know about a very small portion of my accomplishments, and it’s usually out of impulses of joy. I think I should stop sharing that with others honestly, bc I don’t want them to undermine themselves because of it like S.

I’ve always been the more negligent and worse friend tbh, I told her I’d like to join her club but didn’t end up making any of the meetings due to other commitments. I think I’ve missed lots of her texts (bc I was really not up for it due to mental health issues, not specifically for S but in general) and failed to reply in time. But there's been many instances where I felt S was doing that to me too—just because we're really busy and not out of malice. 

S doesn’t know that I am aware of her feelings about me (and before I knew I thought everything was fine). Looking back, S does seem more distant from me and we don’t talk too much anymore, but I’m really sad about that as I still consider her one of my closest high school friends.

I want to mend the relationship with S, and show her that i'm not a strictly overachiever and academic friend. You know, I have a life too and that i'm the weird dude who watches too many movies, has fun over the weekends, and has many lows. I will definitely try to refrain from sharing my accomplishments with her directly, or complaining about my wins (like how literally everyone hear does) as S thinks of that as bragging and toxic. **But i don't really know how to heal this relationship and any advice would be appreciated**.

Tbh, maybe I’m just too afraid to break friendships. I really haven’t much beef with anyone bc I’m always the quiet person who follows and agrees to everyone, so even things like this really get to me. I also overthink way too much, and am bogged down by small things like this. It’s been getting to me and today I’ve done nothing because I’ve overthought this so much. I also have some heart problems with stress and it’s really getting to me because I can feel the pain in my heart."
rbjdi6,130,2021-12-08,Realizing my dad has been trying to live his engineering dream through me like those sad washed up sports dads do,jbogs23,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rbjdi6/realizing_my_dad_has_been_trying_to_live_his/,"Not really asking any questions or looking for advice here. Just thought I’d share my story. Maybe its just a rant but if even one person finds it interesting or relatable its worth it to me lol. I’s love to hear who or what got you interested in pursuing an education in engineering!

TLDR: Just a little story about how I got into engineering, and the way my dad helped get me here (for better or worse). I added headers to the paragraphs so feel free to skip around!

Preface:
I guess I have always kind of known this, but I finally confronted it head on the other day and its borderline sad. I want to preface this by saying I am a year away from graduating with a civil engineering degree, so if I was *truly* miserable or didn’t want to get this degree, I would’ve quit by now. I’m still not 100% certain I see myself doing engineering for life, but I want to get this degree for myself. I think it would be a shame to not even try it as a career after getting a degree in it.

My Dad:
Okay story time now. I love my dad. He has been a huge influence my whole life and I wouldn’t be half the person I am without him. He is one of the smartest dudes I know. He was always a math and science guy. He was one of those high school came too easy and now college is kicking my ass type people. I suppose I got that from him lol. He went to college for engineering, however, he failed a few classes his first semester and then quit. Decided to switch to a math major with the intent to become a math teacher, as more than half of his family works in education. He went on to have a great career teaching AP calc and whatever other math classes need filled that year. He is very happy with his path, but has admitted to me before that quitting engineering after one semester is one of his biggest regrets.

Childhood:
Ever since I was in elementary school he was always pushing me towards math and science. I liked it, I was good at it, and I’m glad he did it! He even started referencing engineering when I was in like 3rd grade. But this is where things start to get problematic… This was the forgotten memory that prompted this post. When I was in 6th grade there was a career fair and architecture peaked my interest like crazy. It was like the perfect cross between everything I like. Math/science and art being the big ones. Also I should note here I have always been very “artsy” and still am. I came home to my dad so excited to tell him about the career fair and architecture. He IMMEDIATELY shut the idea down completely. Proceeded to tell me “more than half of architects are unemployed,” “architects are poor and don’t make any money.” All of this despite not knowing a single architect. At the time I took his word for fact because well, I was just a kid.

High School:
My dad continued to push me towards engineering through high school, but by then I had already decided it was what I wanted to do. At that time I was naive and still thought it was 100% my own decision. We had a really cool engineering career tech program at my high school and I did enjoy it, definitely was the deciding factor for picking my major. I am grateful I went to a school with opportunities like this. I was able to figure out what I was interested in well before college. I was always (and still am) way different than the other engineering students and have never been able to make a true friend through my education. And it isn’t for lack of trying, I have no problems being friends with people who are different than me, and prefer that to someone who is a carbon copy with the exact same interests. They just have never seemed to vibe with me. 

Beginning of College:
Cut to college. I have a TERRIBLE first semester. Much like my father, high school was a joke to me and came way too easy. Even with taking only college credit plus and AP classes. AP is definitely a scam but thats a different discussion lol. I was not prepared for college. I wanted to quit/ switch majors immediately but my dad talked me out of it. THIS I am actually extremely grateful for. He clearly saw me going through the *exact* same thing he did and gave me the support and motivation he wished he had when he went through it. To this day I am beyond appreciative of him giving me the loving kick in the butt 19 year old me so badly needed. 

Middle of College:
Unfortunately, this is when it gets problematic again… he talked me back into engineering THREE MORE TIMES. And these weren’t times where I had failed classes or anything. My grades were just fine, not *great* (mostly Cs with some Bs) but I feel like most of you will agree that being able to consistently pass engineering classes without constantly feeling like you are close to failing is an accomplishment in itself. It was me truly realizing I am completely different from every student in my major, struggling to make any real friends no matter how hard I tried. It was me realizing that just because I *can* do something, I don’t have to do it just because society deems it a more “respectable” career. It was me realizing my heart was only half into it, and that there were many other fields I was more interested in. He would use fear to keep me in it. He implied that if I did literally ANYTHING other than engineering that I would be broke, jobless, anxious, depressed, etc. The ironic part is I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety and depressive bipolar disorder so I will be those things no matter what lol. Basically he scared me into staying in engineering. Its sad if you think about it because he is basically saying that I have no chance at getting a career in something with a smaller job field. I don’t think he realizes that even if the job field is bigger, and the growth is better, engineering is just as much, if not MORE competitive than careers with smaller job fields. I feel like I would have an easier time getting a career in something less intense where I could be in the top of my class, versus engineering where I am near the bottom of my class at a non-prestigious school. Even if the other career has a significantly smaller job market than engineering.

Almost Done With College:
By the time I finally was aware of what he was doing, and felt that I had the strength to stand up for myself, it wasn’t even worth it. I was over halfway into my major and I’m not a big school guy either way, so the best option is to just finish it out. Again I do like engineering A LOT and am glad I am pursuing it. My heart just doesn’t seem to be in it nearly as much as my peers. At this point I am mostly doing it just to prove to myself that I am able to. That being said I will continue to work my ass off. I’ve had an internship and am currently pursuing another. I definitely take this stuff seriously.

The Realization:
I can’t help but feel like my dad has just been projecting on me this whole time. Its like what those sports dads do who are sad they couldn’t play beyond high school, so they start training their kids for one specific sport year-round before the kid is even 10. When you start a kid that young, you are essentially making the decision for them. Even if the kid says they want to, when you are that young you almost always want to do stuff your parents are excited about. By the time they realize that maybe this isn’t what they want to do they are already in too deep. What my dad did is essentially what I just described, but with engineering. 

Coming to Terms:
At the end of the day I am very happy with where I am at. Finishing this degree will be my greatest accomplishment thus far. I love my dad very much and appreciate everything he has ever done for me, as well as making me who I am today. It just sucks looking back and having to question if I *truly* made the decision of my career on my own. My plan is finish this degree, work my ass off to find a job, and give it my best shot. Best-case scenario I find out that school was the part I disliked and have a long fulfilling career. Worst case scenario I try it out for a few years, decide I don’t want to do it, all while making more than enough money to pay off my loans. If I end up wanting to do something different, maybe after all these years I can FINALLY give architecture a shot :). Structural engineer turned architect would be sure to give me at least a slight leg up on other applicants. Anyways, sorry for the obnoxiously long story. For the two of you who made it this far, thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed my story and can take something away from it, and above all… FOLLOW YOUR PASSIONS!!! Again I’d love to hear what got you guys interested i  engineering :)"

I’m 25 and not getting any younger. CS is more rigorous and would add roughly an additional year of schooling and living costs to my plan, and that’s if I never fail anything. Im not entirely sure of how difficult the higher level maths and physics would be for me. it would be better for my overall career I believe.

rblnno,57,2021-12-08,Hardware or Software?,whalehello_there,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/rblnno/hardware_or_software/,"I am a final year undergrad from a top school (not in the US), studying EE. I accepted a job offer from a company a few weeks ago, doing hardware verification, for modules written in VHDL/Verilog which are to be run on FPGAs. I worked at the same firm as an intern, and I enjoyed the work. Life was good.

But then I see my software friends getting crazy offers from companies. I enjoyed the courses that I did in EE and would like a job which requires the same skillset, but as far as I’ve seen, software jobs pay you more than any of them. Even for different roles at the same company, the hardware role pays less. Naturally, this gives me the impression that there is a low demand for Hardware Engineers in the market, and the company does not value the hardware engineers enough. By Hardware I mean, Digital Design, Embedded Systems, Comp Arch, and so on. These are the fields I am really interested in. 

In my 4 years at Uni I have learnt how to write pretty decent code: but algorithms, data structures and so on never really appealed to me. I was more into the low-level stuff, embedded systems, computer architecture and so on, and never really ventured into the software side of things. But seeing the pay gap between the software and other roles, I am tempted to look for a software role instead.

Is there a low demand for Hardware Engineers in the market? Moreover, do hardware jobs ever catch up to the software jobs as you gain experience, or education (MS), in terms of compensation? Are there any advantages of working in the Hardware Industry over software(and also the other way around)? 

tl;dr: I like working with low level stuff (hardware) but turns out that software jobs usually pay you more, but I don't really like them, but can do a decent job. What should I do?"

I'm currently a college student in my 2nd year trying to develop side projects to put on my resume to apply for this years round of summer internships. I currently have only developed two side projects one being a Carbon Footprint Calculator website and my current project which is an app that takes two users playlists on Spotify and creates a new playlist with all the common songs between the first two playlists.

I have finished making the webpage using HTML, CSS, and developed the back-end using python with the help of Spotify's spotipy API. I've been working on it for weeks, and was ready to deploy it yet as it's fully functional.

However with just my luck, Spotify themselves just came out with a new Blend feature which does exactly what my app does but better. I am devastated, and demotivated. This is especially demotivating since this is one of my first projects and I was excited for it to be a very solid project on my resume to help me land an internship. Now that Spotify released this feature I feel as if this project lost a significant amount of relevance and impact and that all my effort has gone to waste.

That being said, I am still very proud of myself for creating it and I've learnt a lot about API's and front-end development through this project. I was also wondering if this is a project still worth putting on my resume to apply for internships."

A few days back I interviewed with a startup that I'm very interested in. During the interview they asked me if I'm able to relocate for the internship. At the time I didn't know if I would be able to, so I said I'm not entirely sure. 

After speaking with my current boss, I now know that relocating isn't an issue (I'll still have my current job when I'm done the internship).

Should I email the interviewer and let them know that I would have no issue with relocating? Would this be considered at all when selecting candidates? 

Thanks in advance 😊"

for a customer I need a user in an AD who only can get PC into the domain and move them around in the AD. As I understand I need to give the user also rights to delete machines - this is what I don't want. Is there any chance to get this done?

The user uses usually automated powershellscripts and xml-files after deploying Windows (unattended) to join newly set up clients to the AD and moves the client to the correct OU after joining. 

So I need this user since the admin at the site needs / wants to move PC into the domain by himself (also some interns, what makes it more tricky). Any suggestions to get this done? I don't want to allow every user to join.

both offers are from san francisco offices

nasdaq

pros:
- *important* this role is more aligned with my career goals, interests, and skills. i am a data science major and i want to be an MLE or ML researcher in the future
- someone said this looks better for transitioning into MLE/DS roles later
- very impactful company
- not as many interns in the past, would make my resume stand out more?

cons:
- not a very well-known, structured intern program like that of salesforce
- i wouldn’t be completing any actual projects, more like going around different offices all day and doing exactly what full time team members do

salesforce (heroku, defense operations team)

pros:
- higher intern pay, TC, return offer almost guaranteed
- free $9,000 (for relocation, but i don’t need to buy a place in SF i have family there) which i’ll just bank, great for me financially in the long run
- security-focused, security is a hot and new topic i can learn
- more structured intern program
- big name on resume
- some data analysis/science might be involved. team doesn’t have a data scientist yet but is really interested in getting one

cons:
- not as aligned with my skills and interests, no machine learning involved
- many more interns, my resume might not stand out as much
- team is fully remote, but i can come to the office for other events

I graduated with a four year bachelor's degree in English (Rhetoric and Media Studies) in 2020. For almost a year I've been in a Marketing and Communications internship at a small company in my home town, which has been alright.

I've also got a minor in Spanish, because the person I was with all through uni is Latino and I wanted to be closer to him and his family. We visited each other back and forth quite a bit through those years; we are still close and love each other very much. However neither of us are interested in marriage. Please pretend that is not an option lol. We've been together for a long time (at least five years), but it's just not for us.

My goal is to live over there with my own job and be an independent person. Even if we got married, it's not like I could just magically start working right away. I know that getting a visa over there isn't that easy either, and if I understand correctly, I'd have to be sponsored by a company. 

My question ultimately is, **what are the first steps I should be taking to find a job over there**? Specifically, I'm looking to work in southern California, since that's where his job is. Is it likely that anything related to my field would be open to sponsoring me? (Is that even the right question to ask?)

I know that if I went over there I would have a family away from home who would make things less lonely, and of course a boyfriend that I could split rent with (I know it's damn expensive down there). My point is I do have a bit of cushion that could help me if things go to shit, so I can afford to take some risk.

Any starter points, or even some honesty on how this might not work, is very very appreciated. I just need any insight at all from people a little experienced in this area. Thank you so much in advance!"

I am currently a double major in computer science and software engineering; wondering if I should continue with this or is it pointless? A little backstory: 

I went to community college and the last semester decided I wanted to pursue software engineering. I wanted to be a dietician and was on that track where I was taking chemistry and biology and not classes like calculus or physics. I applied to a state school (let's call it school A) for SWE and didn't get in because I hadn't taken any calc or physics. Got into a different in-state school(school B) that offered a 3+2 program where I could do 3 years at school B and graduate with a degree in comp sci and then 2.5 years at school A and graduate with a SWE degree there. 

I have an internship right now at a small start up and both of my mentors didn't graduate with a degree in computer science or software engineering and they are both doing super well. One of them has had an incredibly successful career. I am wondering if it's even worth it to have a degree in both? If I am more interested in Software Engineering, should I drop computer science completely and just transfer over to school A and start SWE? If I get my degree in computer science, could I learn SWE along the way?   


Any thoughts are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading!"

I'm still working to get my bachelor's at a school with a very good cybersecurity program, which is the industry I want to get in to. Now I'm torn between getting certifications and getting in the industry earlier but without my degree while I work and school part-time, and devoting time that *would* be used to study for COMPTIA tests on my classes and getting my degree first. 

If I were to take the first option, what sort of starting pay should I expect for having my Associates, A+, Net+, and possibly Sec+ (I can't find much research of having certs AND a degree, people seem to go all in for the BS or Certs. I also live in Texas, which apparently has lower average salaries for IT, on top of me probably getting a pay cut for a year or more despite all that investment. i.e. I'll be going from making $19/hr at current job to $12/hr customer service at a local tech support contractor my friend works at). I may find a better paying job if I'm lucky, but I regrettably havent networked much, so I don't like those odds. Would my AS and current enrollment in a BS program set me apart from other entry-level applicants who only have the same certifications?

The second option, to finish school quickly I think is straightforward. I'd have to look for internships instead of steady income and I have an almost hour commute to campus, so I'd like to make sure I can afford the transportation costs and have am emergency fund just in case."

Currently I'm an Economics Major with a CS minor and I have several internships: an ""engineering"" internship at a small startup, a Cyber Security/IT internship at a large company, and a FANG SWE Freshman internship. I also have an upcoming SWE internship at Oracle OCI this next summer. I recently made the change to Economics because I kind of just fell in love with it but I also love programming. I was wondering if it's worth doing a double major in Econ and CS but taking one semester extra and working quite a bit harder or if my current Resume would be good enough to start a career in CS with just a minor? Right now I'm currently a Sophomore/Junior so even after the OCI internship I at least have one more summer available for another internship but I'm at least one semester behind and I'm kind of getting to the point where I just kind of want to graduate. My future plan is to get into the Data science field but I'm guessing I'm going to have to take a masters or get quite a bit more experience in the field.

rc2531,111,2021-12-08,Got my first job offer- is it a good offer and do I take it?,IamHamez,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/rc2531/got_my_first_job_offer_is_it_a_good_offer_and_do/,"Hey guys- so I recently got my first job offer, and I have mixed thoughts on it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. No other offers on the table currently.

It's a financial advising role at one of the top US firms, offering 58k plus a 5k signing bonus.  PTO is high teens in terms of days a year, and I never work more than 40 hours a week. Work-life balance is important to me so this is nice. They also help me while I get my Series 7 and 63 licenses. I would be based out of a mid-sized city in the southeast.

In terms of my experience, I had one internship at a top insurance company in a sales position. I have a mid 3's GPA with a Finance degree from a large state school with a decent-ranked business program.

I was thinking it was decent, but then I saw other people's offers here and maybe it warped my perception a bit. But my hold-up is the job itself. I would mostly be speaking with clients the whole day. My goal was originally a position that is more on the back end of things, which I would prefer as talking with people all the time sounds somewhat draining to me. I'm open to working there a few years, but I would want to transition to a back-end position such as an analysis one in the future, or maybe management.

My main questions are:

* Is it likely I get a job in a role that I would prefer that offers similar benefits at this stage in the process if I were to say no (I graduate this May)
* Would the skills and experience from this job enable me to leverage it into a job more in line with what I want to do in the future if I were to take it?
* Can I do better?

I'd love to hear your thoughts!"
rc2f16,3,2021-12-08,First Semester Woes,VLRNON,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rc2f16/first_semester_woes/,"I am honestly at a loss at where I even begin. Currently my classes are going absolutely like shit, and I’m scared to see what effects that will happen on my GPA. 

I am a freshman student, with a 3.1 GPA before I entered college with around 10 hours of college credits already earned from my AP &amp; dual enrollment classes. 

Currently my grades are - C+, C-, D+, A+ and A- with some of my favorite classes already being in the lows which sucks. 

Not to mention, I don’t think I am a bad student by any means. I go to class every lectures, I finish my assignments as soon as before the due dates, and I try to study for at least 3 hours every week for my classes. 

I also tried to make some friends, but honestly all I got are people I consider acquaintances. I mean they’re nice people, but I realized they’re all there for a purpose which is to basically be the same as me - a leetcoding person trying to get their first internship and degree in Computer Science. 

I could go on about my internship search, leetcoding woes, but let go back to the main passage. 

I also realized that my health is going slowly shittier and shittier as well - I’ve been sleeping on average 3-4 hours a day, and haven’t been exercising unless you count me walking from my dorm to class which is a 15 minutes walk for me. Total calories I burn at the end of the day is 200-300 calories which is nothing compared to the 2400 calories I eat everyday as a shorter person. 

All I can hear is that I’m not getting the “best time of my life” as dictated by college lifestyle and honestly I never had a good moment in my life. All I want to do now is just graduate as early as I can - maybe take an online degree program instead such as UofF Online or WGU - these programs at least on paper seem more suited for me, but I doubt the reliability. 

I just want to time travel to me getting my degree and then just starting my life up. I just don’t care about anything anymore, as all I can hear up to this point is that I now hate where I’m at."
rc2wef,3,2021-12-08,Optiver Internship Trading Questions,QuantRecruiting,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/rc2wef/optiver_internship_trading_questions/,"I received an offer for Optiver for the summer of 2022 Trading Internship. I'm super excited! But I'm also a bit worried and wanted to ask some questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. What's the percentage of interns that get a return offer from Optiver? (I heard they have 30 interns this year which is the most amount they've ever had before)
2. How does Optiver compare to other prop trading firms like Jane Street and Citadel?
3. How is the work life balance?
4. What is the pay progression like? Will there be a high chance of growth?
5. How is the culture? I've heard different things on this. Originally I heard it was a bit toxic, but nowadays they've improved. Is this true?
6. I feel like a pretty average college student, and I don't necessarily know if I'll be smart enough to do quant trading. Assuming I don't get a return offer, I'm worried this might hurt my chances at recruiting when I become a senior and actually need to find a job. (Note I'm a CS major, so I don't think this will help at all for my CS resume). Is this a valid concern or am I just worrying too much?
7. In the end, my dream job would probably be to go into Venture Capital, but I'm not sure if that's even possible if I start in quant. Is there a valid career path from quant trading to VC?"

I heard that most people get offers and matched in December, so even if I pass the interviews is there a high chance I won’t get the job because all the roles have filled up?"

And instead of typing out ""Scoreboard"" or ""PA Announcement"", can I assign each a value, let's say ""1"" or ""2"", respectively, that will allow me to type that into a cell and have it automatically type it out (without a macro)."

rc5tx3,1,2021-12-08,How to find the right field,Zayers,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rc5tx3/how_to_find_the_right_field/,"I am sure this question has been asked before many times, but an extensive search through both the FAQ and subreddit itself didn't bring up any posts with useful information or comments so here I am.

A bit of context. I am currently studying CS at a pretty decent university and that is filling up most of my time now.

I started to realize a while ago that a lot of the best performing students already knew exactly what they wanted to do after university or are already working on side-projects etc. and I am afraid to be left behind and come out of university one day, degree in hand, and end up in some random cs-related job I don't want because I neither know what I actually want nor built any sort of skills in that area.

I know that I want to co-found my own company, or at least be a very early employee of a startup. That has always been a dream of mine and right now I'm actually working part-time as an intern in a startup working with Flutter, but to be honest I feel like I might be let go as both Flutter and the app itself seem too complicated for me to be able to understand them quickly enough with the little time I have each week to provide value to the company fast enough.

The two main problems I am having when it comes to deciding what to learn are that firstly I don't have that much time, so unlike some of the recently graduated or unemployed I can't just spend 40h a week to learn a new thing and then at the end of that week be good enough at that thing to decide if I want to commit to it long term.

The second problem I am having is one that has cursed me my whole life and that is my ability to be ""interested"" nearly everything but never finding anything I am ""passionate"" about enough to fully commit to it on a long-term basis or even actually start properly learning it instead of just reading about/watching stuff that masters at that thing have created. I just can't find a project that is both interesting to me but also not so complicated that any attempt at it is doomed from the start.

Currently I am reading ""The C programming language"" as C seems really interesting to me and also something that is valuable to learn and I need it for university anyways.

Honestly, anything that produces some kind of ""visible"" result is absolutely fascinating to me, AI/ML finding new ways to do things (for example that popular tag demo video released a while ago), or the simulations by Nils Berglund, anything that has to do with visualizing interesting insights from large amounts of data and also pretty much everything done by Sebastian Lague. On the other end of the spectrum I also have an interest for low level stuff like operating systems and that sort of thing, although I'm not sure if that's really something I want to invest a lot of time in or just understand its concepts.

Anyways, I'm getting distracted...as always...

Are there any resources on how to find something you are actually passionate about?

Would you be so kind as to share how you personally found the thing you now do for a living?"

rcbui4,0,2021-12-09,I want to be a better student but have no motivation &amp; have been taking things for granted. Crying as I type this. How to change?,bakeneko019,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rcbui4/i_want_to_be_a_better_student_but_have_no/,"I was born &amp; raised in a different country, went to a really shitty English-speaking international school since middle school and came here for college. I'm reluctant to blame even just a tiny portion of my academic inadequacy onto cultural differences &amp; English being my second language (there are so many other international students out there absolutely crushing the American education system), but oftentimes I ponder the possibility of being a smarter kid if I was born in a different environment. No one except myself cares about my performance, and no one except myself gives me pressure (a double-edged sword, I guess). My parents and siblings don't really want to learn about what I study.

For the record, I've conveyed my situation to a couple of people before and always got the same response: ""You're already doing great! There are people doing so much worse than you!"" But I want to do better. I know I can do so much better than this; I just don't know how to. 

I'm a bio major at a prestigious uni with a 3.6 something GPA (not straight As), am in a couple of clubs (kind of passionate in all of them but not enough to go above &amp; beyond for any), has a lab internship (does the job &amp; my advisor doesn't hate me) and a job (super easy clerical stuff; the only time I get huge compliments). I feel like everything I've done kind of fulfills the checklist but doesn't make me stand out in anyway. Of course I want to get straight A's, to work on a project so hard that I don't sleep for 3 days straight, and to be the last person that leaves lab... But I somehow just can't do any of these. I don't have the drive, at all. 

Every time I fuck up an assignment/exam, I tell myself that it's okay and I'll just do better next time. But I don't. I can't devote myself into school work; I fuck around on the internet for hours and choose resting/having fun over studying. I still study for at least 4 hours per day, but none of these hours just seem to be helping my performance. I never pull all-nighters and find excuses to skip discussion classes because I just don't want to go. I avoid competition. I love what I'm studying; but so far they've been really fundamental and I can't really do anything with those knowledge. 

In general, I'm just seeking advice on how to go above and beyond for my studies. I feel like I've been taking everything for granted; I'm so privileged and fortunate enough to not worry about personal wellbeing or finance, but I feel like this lack of challenge is making me a useless person. I don't want to be a mediocre student; maybe not the best student either, just a great one. I'm thinking of going med school but there's no way that my current mentality would get me somewhere even close to that. Thank you to all who are willing to share their experiences with me.

tl;dr: I don't think I hate school; I just hate myself. What to do HOMIES"

rcemtk,7,2021-12-09,A little bit of a rant about grad school…,alargerballofanxiety,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rcemtk/a_little_bit_of_a_rant_about_grad_school/,"Hello all, 

I don’t often post but I needed a space where I could just talk about my course currently, and maybe get some advice from people who have been here and seen it all before! 

I started my Masters course in September and in all honestly it’s been very disappointing, the course was so promising and very enticing - it has a major module devoted to employability, with a lot of links to our sector who are willing to take us on for internships and such so we have at least 6 months if relevant work experience. All of this seemed great, I loved my undergrad experience, and I figured that even changing uni, I would love to continue with the work that I had been doing previously. 

But, in all honesty, the course feels like a mess. Deadlines change at will. Essay titles are rarely reviewed by other members of staff for clarity. In one such case the questions rarely correspond well with the taught components - and that’s the core module. Staff have a tendency to make snide comments to the class at large, one such lecturer does so frequently when no one is able to answer her questions, but the questions are often hidden within her long, rambling explanations. There’s little in the way of guidance for coursework. For example, presenters have been penalised for having 20 minute presentations, which were advised, but praised for presentations of 40 minutes or more. 

That’s not to say I am complaining because I am doing badly, I am doing well, perhaps not brilliantly but achieving a solid merit in all courseworks, barring one which I will admit was my fault entirely for failing to submit the correct document.  A silly mistake that I am very unhappy about, but as it’s not worth a great deal I’ve simply focused on doing better in the larger coursework.  

My question is: is this normal? 

I know all masters are a step up and less scheduled than undergrad but this feels excessive. Perhaps it’s just me? As I came from a different university , maybe I’m just not as aware as the others about the way things are done around here? I’ve met others, though admittedly I have found it hard to make close friends when almost everyone has friend groups from their undergrad, and this seems to be normal for them.

Sorry for the long text, and thank you for reading if you got this far!"

- Is getting a master’s worth it in said field (there would also be an internship)? From the ease to get a job, the pay and other related stuff
- I’d ideally want to be in R&amp;D, would it be better to get the master?
- How much math is there? The more math the better, specifically calculus related stuff. Always felt I wanted more math/delving deeper into it.

All of this is meant for someone that would get the master in Europe, and would work in Europe. So the European perspective is preferred but not required. Might sound naive, so If you’d like to inform me of something obvious I might be missing please tell me.

Granted, sometimes I was doing work and sometimes I was just being on the internet, but I worked super hard at that job. I had to do the embarrassing walk with a box full of my stuff out the door.

Ever since then I've had super low work productivity and I've been laid off/fired from 3 other companies, with two of them giving me severance packages. While I'm not the best worker, I have skills that can always find me another decent job. I am at a great job now where I work only about 10 hours a week and am getting a master's to do a career change for lower pay.

The first time I got fired I cried but every subsequent time I found it funny. I learned early on to not have loyalty to a company. 

I always thought something was wrong with me because I never cared that much about my jobs and rarely lasted anywhere longer than a year. I would slack off during work and always joke with my friends that I was a bad worker. Sometimes I'd get motivated for a few hours to work on a project or problem solve something, but I almost never took initiative (although I do in my personal life).

Don't judge me because this isn't easy.

I  graduated with Business MIS, and in the courses we learned Python, SQL,  Excel, Tableau, along with the general business concepts like project  management and such. However, the major is so broad that it doesn't  delve deep in any one software skill like how Computer Science or the  engineerings focus on Java, C++, etc. This is both a strength and a  weakness.

I'm having trouble  finding a job after graduation, it's been almost 1 year now and I feel  exhausted and desperate. Worse, I held off on having a part time job  (living with family) for months to focus on the job search, thinking I  would land one soon, but it never came (will aim for a part time now and  resume the full time search after). Even worse, I made the *heinous*  mistake of graduating during the lockdown, and unfortunately did not  secure an internship because of said pandemic. I didn't waste my free  time during college though, I did a lot of student leadership and  extracurricular which taught me other skills (leadership, teamwork,  event planning, virtual adaptation, hosting meetings, philanthropy,  volunteering).

The early portion  of post-graduation I focused on applying for Data Analyst jobs, but soon  discovered it was too advanced and not entry level friendly, too  catered towards CS degrees. I focused then towards a mix of nonprofit  administrative positions and business admin / database admin type  positions, or anything tech, but to no avail. Currently, per  recommendation of some friends and my sister who switched from  accounting to IT, I am gunning for IT. Except the entry curve is just as  difficult if not moreso (college education apparently doesn't matter much) and I am stuck needing to go for Help Desk Support if I want to start this career path.

To be  honest nothing about any of those fields excite or motivate me (my  choice of major wasn't the smartest even though lucrative), perhaps I'd  be most interested in certain types of nonprofits that promote ethnic  justice, education, helping others, etc. But nonprofits just pay less,  and I'm particularly jaded after a nonprofit (where I've personally  known everyone and volunteered with for years) that had a full time job  opening still did not accept me after the interview stage due to having  no professional experience in the nonprofit management industry. It was  after that I decided to gun for IT, but now I have doubts. If I need to  go for Help Desk (which I'm struggling to get into) and spend loads on  certificates to advance, am I and my skill-set even a right fit?

What  am I supposed to do? Which path do I go down? What is the most entry  level friendly (not that 2-5 years minimum experience BS please) given  my developed skills and experiences? And I've tried to rework my resume  and interview skills but it's just not working, what do I do?"

5.  *Redacted* Award (highest academic honor for consistent academic excellence from 9th to 12th grade in HS). Only 10 out of 250 students received this.

**Essays/LORs/Other:**

\- Eco teacher: She has said over the years I was her fav. I was the most (purposefully) engaged student in her classes throughout junior &amp; senior year. 

\- Eng Teacher: Was closest to eng teacher; worked w her on the eng club. Scored highest in eng throughout HS.

\- Counselor Rec: My counselor has explained the strict marking in our school in 9th and 11th, mentioned how I got highest despite that. I was quite involved w counselor coz of Activity 2, had shared all of the details w her as well.

I don’t mean to exaggerate but I think my recs were *the* best my teachers have ever sent; they write pretty well and they literally told me they took a lot of time (like the maximum it has ever taken them) writing them coz they were rooting for me!

**All RD Schools:** 

TEST BLIND: Cornell (Top Choice)

(Cornell is *test-blind* for Business school applicants; not optional; https://admissions.cornell.edu/apply/first-year-applicants/standardized-testing-policies)

Add’l Context: Applying to safeties in other country w affordable tuition. 

**Final Request:** In addition to the Chance me, could someone please suggest more schools? Especially public schools that might give an int’l option to pay in-state tuition or even other need-aware private ones suitable for Business Majors."

**My top choice (Cornell) is test-blind for Business Majors.**

**Marks:** 

9th Grade: 94%  (Highest average in HS; counselor has attested to this in LOR, hopefully)

2. Tiger Case Competition, one of the top 10 teams in region.

3. 2nd place, National level debate competition; 1st in state, 1st in district. (I was felicitated by DIG as well a minister; can’t name would easily be doxed)

**Should I even consider top schools** (Harvard, UC Hicago, Rice, Dartmouth etc) as a test-optional applicant in case I don’t get above 1470 in SAT? I'm serious. 

**Add’l Context**: Applying to safeties in other country w affordable tuition. 

**Final Request:** I'm mainly looking for advice on adding more schools to my list and wanted to understand if I should apply to the aforementioned schools or not. I'd really want to go for a Business major at a school that also has Design (UX/UI or other niche in design that helps in marketing). Considering the fact that I'm asking for aid I understand my options are limited, so just b-schools would be fine (w/o the design). AID is a significant factor.

rcn2w2,4,2021-12-09,Do most companies check students transcripts that apply for an internship?,throwawayahaon,DevelEire,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/rcn2w2/do_most_companies_check_students_transcripts_that/,"With an internship coming up next year, my grades leave a lot to be desired. Once I've passed a module, I do the bare minimum as it doesn't count towards my final degree grade which i I know is a bad mentality. 

Will poor grades be a deal breaker to get an internship at good companies despite a good cv and a decent github or will they not even look at them?

Thanks in advance."

rcowov,3,2021-12-09,New Grad: IB vs PM,horiozns,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rcowov/new_grad_ib_vs_pm/,"Hello!

I am currently a STEM senior who will be graduating with my undergraduate degree in Spring 2022. I have been on the search for a post-grad opportunity for the last few months, looking specifically at finance/IB, analyst, and PM jobs. My major is pretty versatile in a wide-range of fields so I've been fortunate enough to have a diverse internship/academic experience (previously interned at Santander Bank and tech companies). Ultimately, I would like to work in the FinTech/Finance space.

Finally, my countless hours of searching and interviewing paid off because I got offered an IB summer internship as a summer analyst in NYC. It's been my dream to move to NYC to start my career. This internship is originally for juniors, but at the time of applying, I thought I was going to get a master's in my bachelor's major (I've since decided to postpone this). This is a great opportunity to break into IB, which is something I've been wanting to get experience in specifically.

A week later, I receive a full-time offer at a large credit card/banking/finance company as an Associate Product Manager, starting this upcoming summer after I graduate. This job is not in the location I wanted (in my home state), but again, it's a great opportunity to break into PM, I am also very interested in this career down the road too. I can see myself really enjoying the work of being a PM.

While I thought this meant I would have to choose one over the other, I realized that the start date for the PM role is **after** the end date for the IB internship, so I'm wondering if it would be okay for me to do the IB internship this Summer to get a feel on whether or not I like IB, and then go back home to start working as a PM. Depending on my performance this summer at the IB internship, there is a large possibility (80%) of getting a return offer from the IB company to start the next year, so September 2023. This would allow me to get a feel for being both in IB and PM, and ultimately choose which career I want to pursue for the future.

As a new grad, I am so incredibly thankful to have these opportunities and now I am wondering if I am legally allowed to do this? I don't want to harm my chances at either opportunity, but also don't feel confident enough jumping 100% into a career in either IB or PM without working experience in both. I think doing the internship and then the full-time role would be a great opportunity to not only develop skills in the financial world, but also help guide my future. I would really appreciate any inputs and insights you all have!"

I'm having trouble and need advice. My gf of over a year dumped me over text a year ago on NYE. While break ups happen, I have gone through hell. She said she felt distant and embarrassed and disrespected by me, not being number one priority in my life. What she didn't know was what I was hiding. Prior to us dating, I was molested and had struggled with intimacy and impotency all my life. It wasn't till I got saved and went to college did I finally start to not feel guilty and could get hard and desire a family and someone to love. I recognize what I endured warped me: turned to porn and other outlets just to feel something and have little self-esteem because I feel used, undesirable, and dirty. But I tried to clean up, after getting saved turned from porn and felt better. I started dating this girl from my hometown while in school an hour away: we went to church together and hit it off. I was infatuated, and not sexually but emotionally and personally. We clicked like I've never clicked with another human ever. She made me a better man: I was reading more, more disciplined, and more positive about myself. Covid hit, and I lost a lot of outlets that helped me cope and feel confident, moved back home, and hated living there, and I was applying for jobs entering my senior year. We broke it off for like a week after I kept getting rejected for jobs, she asked about marriage, and frankly she and I had our first sexual act together and frankly I wasn't prepared or ready at the time and she wanted to take me on vacation with her and I boarded up and said it be best to call it off. I loved her and regretted it, prayed, and called her up and apologized. I told her I went through some stuff and realized I don't wanna go through life without her and was a coward and want to work with her to build something special if she'd forgive me. She did and we were better than ever, I would cry and thank God daily for her and the positivity she gave me. We ended up seeing each other a minimum like three days a week, things moved quick, and we had sex for the first-time each. We both said we were saving that aspect for marriage, but I was a weak man and felt those rushes and lust for the first time and loved her so much and I wanted her to feel loved, pleased, and know she can trust and love me. I'd tell her I hope to spend my days with her forever, and wanna talk about marriage after I graduated in 4 months cause I was super stressed out and didn't wanna throw that onto the pile. I got a job at a firm a few tons away and my commute was 45 minutes. While in school, working a internship that could lead to a full time nice job, and working at my ice cream store I opened with my parents, I was working 60 hour weeks and was exhausted. I started saving money for her ring and to take her and her whole family on vaca after I gradate to the beach to propose to her. She started asking me around Christmas/Finals if I loved her and if it was all too much she'd understand if I wanted to break up. I was scared and heartbroken, told her I loved her but was stressed, and I'd ask if shes ok. She'd say ya, just wanted to make sure, and would affirm she loved me and would send me sexy pics, we'd have booty calls, and still have wholesome date nights. I wasn't myself cause I was burnt, and one night I said I didn't like when she'd ask those questions cause it made me feel I'm walking on eggshells with her and that she didn't love or trust me. I had invited her to my family Christmas party and other stuff and she declined prior to dumping me so she made her mind up long ago. The night before she dumped me, she called me for a booty call, after I held her and she said she loved me and wished we could spend together forever, She dumped me days later after a miscommunication thing for a party.

After her text, I was a mess. I sent her flowers, gifts, sentimental mementos, and wrote her poetry and letters expressing my love, my sorrow, guilt, and asked for forgiveness. I told her what I was going through, had planned, and went through: she responded she didn't believe me. She never met me in person ever again. I spiraled into depression lost 20 lbs, couldn't sleep for 4 months, and nearly took my life. I felt like a failure, but most importantly I was hurt that I hurt her, drove her away from me, and felt guilty I had took her virginity away like mine was stripped cause I was in love and wanted to treasure and please her, and that I was a cruel person to her. I haven't been able to forgive myself over hurting her and making her feel unwanted or unloved ( despite the fact that was never the case) and for letting lust and sin cloud my vision of her and my judgement. On top of that, I had double back surgery after we broke up, and every night for 2 months I dreamt of her and would awake at night crying and upset and lonely. I pleaded to God but was weak and turned back into the old vices and sin that I used to get into. I became impotent again, lost all desire and will and motivation to do or strive for anything, and have recognized I am now a weak, loser (which was something I was never: I was a 21-year-old business owner, college grad with a good internship but all that means nothing to me now). I got a puppy and hes been wonderful in making me feel loved and useful and not hurtful but I can't forgive or get over losing someone I loved, my best friend, and someone I shared every vulnerable moment with. She was my first everything. I still can't find any reason or hope, feel unwanted and like I can't trust, and all I want is to try again (she blocked me and dated someone she knew through work like weeks after she dumped me and her family said its over). Any advice? Please pray for me, all I want is to love a girl and make her feel happy, valued, pleasured, and treasured and uplifted and honor her like God asks and for what was stripped of me. I know some may not be religious, but I loved someone, wanted to honor her and found my life it’s most fulfilling loving someone and that compassion and vulnerable relationship we had was magical and something I never experienced or thought I would ever be worthy or enough to have. I was never intrigued in being a family man till her and it became all I could have ever wanted but thought I’d never have, and now that I’ve tasted love, desire, worth and value, and trust and it all be taken in at a loss and feel purposeless. Please help, I’m once again spiraling down that dark path again."

I recently finished in June a BS in Biology but I have not done anything with it that can be considered real experience apart from an unpaid casual internship at a clinical lab which I did not enjoy and do not have a license to work in anyway. I have never held a real full-time job in my life but I have come up with the below list of things I believe would make me happy and satisfied in a job and need help from experienced people matching them to suitable roles/industries/careers:

1- I enjoy meeting people.

2- I enjoy learning new things.

3- I enjoy working on tasks and projects that require me to think, plan, organize and strategize (mental work).

4- I enjoy being creative.

5- I like flexibility but lack strong discipline and time management skills.

6- I enjoy collaborating with a team, but am more focused and productive on my own (a mix of teamwork and solo-work is preferable)

7- I enjoy helping people and doing work that is meaningful and has a positive impact on the community.

8- I like being a leader but I need to work on my confidence and other skills that make me stand out.

9- I have many and varied interests and passions and am always curious and hungry to figure out how things work and how to make things better.

10- I want to make enough money to be comfortable without having to work over 40 hours a week or lose out on benefits and vacation time.

11- My strong points are: excellent writing skills, organization, academically gifted, extroverted and good with people, good at science and math, I read a lot and am sufficiently proficient with a computer (i.e. I know how to use MS office, google drive, slack/clickup, and navigate the internet).

12- My weak points are: I get nervous sometimes, especially when I feel confused and lost as to what/how to do something or when I feel unappreciated or disappointing by managers. Also, I don't know how to code or use any advanced tech or software yet. I am still working on my discipline and time management but get frustrated easily when I don't feel like I am making progress on something I am working on.

Note: Although I have a BS in Biology, I am open to opportunities that do not have anything to do with my major, but not opportunities that would require further education investment.

Thanks you for your support."

I am an 18yo (close to graduating) high-school student from Germany, who has been freelancing in the Wordpress field for a year now. I have done some internships at smaller IT-companies for a couple of weeks in the past and have build some CLI tools in Python from scratch, that I needed for private stuff.

My work currently is focusing on things like Wordpress servicing, so there's not much code-work involved. However, I am able to fluently write JS and Python code or even build a small little website if I need to for private projects.

Lately I have been thinking about expanding my freelancing services to not only involve Wordpress, but to accept offers to code small landing pages for local companies.

However, when I tried to do some pages from scratch, I oftentimes got overwhelmed by things like navbars, responsiveness, image-scaling, flexboxes, etc, and my websites turned out to look like sh\*t, so I ended up falling back to css-frameworks.

Don't get me wrong. I know how to code, I consider myself being a back-end dev, but I really want to get comfortable at building good looking, responsive, front-end UIs from scratch without checking tutorials or guides.

Does anyone have some tips for me how to achieve this? How long would that (re)learning take in my case?

Thanks in advance :)"

During the interview I was asked about this specific skill (SQL) that I've learned in the past but it has been a while (6-12 months)- I'm learning other skills currently. I answered as much, mentioned the courses I took but admitted I would need to refresh my knowledge. The interviewer asked if I would need some time to prepare for a technical interview and I said I'd need about a week. I've had a busy workload with all my other projects so I'd rather be honest than say I'm ready and then bomb the interview.

What is your perception of my response? Did I sound unsure? Since the interviewer was just a recruiter should I have just told her I know the software? Should I try to be better prepared next time?"

Born in classical musician family, living in medium culture town in eastern europe. Graduated music school, graduated highschool in physics mathematics. While doing this really fell inlove with filming skateboarding, designing grafiti and making beats on computer. All my classmates went to engineering, but i decided to follow my gut and study this program new media art. 3 years later ive gained experience academically about modern art, exhibition and work production, freelanced as graphic designer, video maker, dj. Graduated with virtual reality work with spatial audio design as a tool of immersion. Decided not to do go to job or to do masters, so i started to work as personell in concerthall and for almost one year i got the chance to hear concerts for free. While that i worked on my electronic music album, and meanwhile in that period i got chance to make music for two different theatre plays. And also, at the same time i was intern in commercial audio studio, tryed to help develop spatial audio studio. It all went on for about year, and what i did i quit the concerthall personell job, to continue with my music. And i quit with the job relations with audio studio because i had misunderstandings about vision and moneys. So i continued with producing another album. Im living in one bedroom studio apartment type beat with my girlfriend at the time. I had good deal with those teathres with royalties, so i got some finances from there + i had some freelance sound design jobs. Basic ones for videos and 3d ambisonic audio for virtual reality and 360°videos. Boom covid. Royalties stopped, but i got some basic funding  from culture institution to support creative work. In this case i had nice opportunity to fund my own project, and we decided to make 360°video immersive concert, so all that summer we filmed the city, and edited really cool psychedelic video art, but we did not showcase it publically as an exhibition or show, only uploaded it online. Then in fall i finished that new album i was talking about, but this time this was my first album where i wrote lyrics and sang and rap, and this project i also uploaded and did not showcase. I felt really burned out, and it was dark autumn. + but on the bright side, in the september we got married! So in the winter and like whole past two years we also experimented with just going hiking and filming 360 videos and recording 3d ambisonic sound field recordings. And funny thing is, that we also went back to uni to do our post-graduates, but as the first lecture started we understood that this is major BS, because of the lectures being remote and not getting the full effect of school and creative environment.+ it seems, that no one quite understands what we are all about, but ok, we somehow passed and now we have our second, final year, but its so hard to gather motivation to do this thing because it logically makes no sense, i kinda feel that by studying my whole progress of selfdiscovery art enterpreneurship stopped a bit because of non contextal advice, like you see how bad the idea processing academics have!! Ok, the main thing is, that while studying all that bs what we already knew from bachelor we experimented more with abstract painting and illustrating, we have like boxes of artworks, not shown to any public. So yeah. Basically, we havent progressed from covid and at the moment we moved out from our original city and came to live in countryside with wifes parrents. My wife is like my best friend and she likes to draw characters, but she is more specialised in 3d and vr. I liked to make beats and im doing live finger drumming with pocket operators, and i like to do yoga. I also recently self-diagnosed autism, so it explains why i havent integrated in capitalism. Not sure what should my goals be and what direction to go with my experience and skills. I also have worked as workshop host in different interdisciplinary projects. Last two years i also have been interested in crypto, so i also have been thinking about nft and web3, i see how that could positively change society, but basically i feel really depressed in this dark period, so im going to portugal in next year. I just want to live simple quality life. Active, healthy and creative. Oh by the way i love cooking, especially plant based recipes. And pizza. Thanks if you made this far. Probably there is something i didnt say so please ask me some questions to dive deeper in this case."

Quick highlights:

- I graduated with an engineering in 2015. The internship that I worked at in 2015 was a fairly decent sized aerospace company. It was sold and changed names in 2018, and laid off most of its staff in 2020 due to the vid.

- I then worked for a year in a small company of about 20 people designing fire truck bodies from 2015-2016. In March 2016 I was fired (I was bad at my job and didn't try super hard lol. But also...). They went bankrupt and closed in May 2016.

- From 2016-2019 I worked for a large automotive company. I really liked that job, but I worked way too hard and was taken advantage of. Like my base salary was around $60k and I made $120k with overtime. One year I worked January through March with no days off. They gave me average performance reviews after I was working that hard. Fuck them. They're still around but I think their days are numbered due to EVs. I give them 10 years. Consider yourself hexed, bitch.

- From 2019-2020 I worked for a shithole automotive company. I was initially excited for the role, but quickly learned how shitty everything was. The building was literally falling apart. When it rained there were easily 15+ leaks from the front door to my department. There was no ac or heat. They put my department of CNC machining next to a semi bay that wasn't large enough for a semi to completely fit and shut the door. So the temperature fluctuated a good 30 degrees with the door open in the winter to offload the truck (not good for machining). Along with tons of other management shit, such as our plant manager of less than a year quit with no notice one day lol. Anyway, I just learned TODAY that they're closing by 2023. Which is what made me have the realization for this post.

- I work at a new place now. Which is going fine I suppose, but mostly I'm on reddit all day.

I'm thinking about adding ""touch of death"" to my resume for my qualifications for special skills. You know that tweet that was like ""I bring that ""we should all quit"" energy that bosses just hate""? I am like that plus your company will die.

I don't feel like businesses close all that often, but my record for being on losing teams is pretty outstanding. I'm quickly running out of references."

I’m not too proud to admit I have lost and am 100% not cut out for this. I’m more posting this to show in future searches that it’s okay to fail out of this career field and want out. This isn’t a do or die, and you should do what makes you happy. I’m taking a nearly 70k pay cut to 90k if it goes through and honestly i don’t care. I just want to be happy I want out of big boy coding and just manage VM’s and servers and all that."

I'm doing my master's in computer engineering. I have a backend development internship under my belt and a few small projects and I've been trying to switch from electrical work to coding.

I got some interviews but these interviews are really tough. The Algo questions are insane for an entry level. One company gave me some problems to do on my own time and I cheated just to see and I still failed! This for an entry level position but They said I did better than most people with five years of experience and they still want to invite me to another technical interview (I'm not going because I feel defeated and I cheated it feels wrong) but wth am I supposed to do. 

Every job posting asks for a million languages and frame works deep technical knowledge and I have to crush the interview process. 

Is this just not for me?"

If I took it, I would have to take two classes during the internship and two in the summer. 

My professor I consulted doesn’t recommend I take the internship because they think that many students don’t finish school after taking an internship during the semester.

I don’t have any other internship offers for the summer so far and it’s been tough as a sophomore finding local companies to give me the time of day because of my grad date. 

Should I take this internship for the spring, or just focus on school and hope that a summer internship falls into my lap?"

Math teacher: 6.5-7/10 Pretty  average since I've only had her one year. Counselor: 8/10 She pretty  much helped me all throughout high school and knows me pretty well so  I'm assuming a good letter from her.

Coursework: AP CSA: 5 AP CSP: 4 AP Physics 1: 2 (not submitting but took the class) *Note:  my school only has 4 aps and I took 3/4. I am also doing a full dual  enrollment right now with a local community college (8 classes total).*

Been lurking here for a while and always thought I wouldn’t make it since I had no internship experience, average GPA and halfway decent programming skills. You can really get by as long as your personable and can properly apply your resume to the job. To the people in the same boat as me keep trying!

Anyone got experience working for JP Morgan Chase or being a software dev in Chicago all open ears to anything you guys have to say. Also I was offered 90k base plus 10k sign on. I’m pretty happy with this offer but as always it would be nice to get more. Do I have any room for negotiations without another offer?

Anyways super pumped about this offer and just wanted to share with you guys and please let me know if you got anything to say I’m all ears."
rd0e61,2,2021-12-09,Taking Graduate Probability/Measure Theory or Statistical Modeling,getrektsai-d,quant,https://www.reddit.com/r/quant/comments/rd0e61/taking_graduate_probabilitymeasure_theory_or/,"Hey all,

I'm currently a student in math, CS and stats at a target school who's looking land a quant trading internship come Summer 2023. 

I've taken a breadth of math courses at my university, including an honors sequence in analysis and abstract algebra and the introductory sequence in mathematical statistics. As a result, I have the option next semester to take the first course in the graduate introductory sequence in probability and measure theory, building up to topics like martingales, Brownian motion, and stochastic calculus. However, I also have the option to take a basic undergraduate statistical modeling course, which centers around statistical computing in R and applied regression techniques. 

I'm not too interested in being in roles similar to a sell-side quant at a bank—I would rather try to land myself in a DS/ML/SWE role at a FAANG/Big N company, which is actually what I will be doing Summer 2022. I hope to use this experience as a foundation to land buy-side positions in prop shops/HFs come next recruiting season. 

Given this, which course would likely benefit me? I've read that stochastic calculus is used primarily on the sell-side and may not be of use for a trader trying to build alpha-generating models, but on the other hand I feel that an introductory statistical modeling course may also not provide as much benefit either as I plan to take a machine learning theory course the next semester as well, and the rigor involved in a graduate math course would help sharpen my critical thinking and problem solving abilities."
rd0o8x,4,2021-12-09,Mat Sci class is suffering,sad-cloudz,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rd0o8x/mat_sci_class_is_suffering/,"The fact that so many of us get together just to stress out about it. The smartest people I know are worried about not passing. Professor let us do retakes on Tuesday and Today. 

Average for exam 1 was a 74. The retake was a 73. Okay big deal it’s only one percent difference, frustrating to be confident about understanding things better than you did at the start but whatever. 

Average for exam 2 is a 69 (not even passing in our program, need C- or better). Retake average is a 64. 

I have a brilliant friend who has 100% on all the assignments and perfect attendance points, but she might fail the class because she is averaging on the exams. I need at least a B or I get kicked off the program for good. 

This class is so difficult for no reason. There’s so much content they want to smash into our brains, and our prof can’t even do a half decent job at delivering it and just makes sexist jokes and immature sexual innuendos. 

I’m just mad that this is a thing the university does. And it’s normal. Everyone is projecting 1/2 the class will fail. It’s an intro Material Science class for 2nd year ME students. He isn’t curving shit. Extra credit can bring us up 1% in total but the assignments are 1. Get an internship 2. Get on a club committee 3. Do substantial research with grad students. Loved that he let us retake exams but when he decides that exam 2 will be 100% computational a week prior, how can he expect us to have a fair chance."

From my studies I feel pretty confident, however we have not learned much programming and I have not done much outside of my schooling either. I'm assuming for most entry-level positions I probably won't need to know much about the subject, however I want to set myself up with the best possible odds of landing a nice gig, partnered with my certifications and my internship experience.

Are there any online credible programs where I could grab some skills outside of school and could list on my resume that could be like, ""hey, I know how to do this"" or would I just have to rely on being asked related questions in an interview and answer them? 

Just a little paranoid about entering such a competitive field and being underprepared. If someone could provide some input it would be greatly appreciated.

They would reply ""Yeah of course, we are your friend!"".  
Well that is a fucking lie. I have 4 friends (Sad I know). I will name them A, B, C and D.

Whenever voice calling, it will be me, A and B. D is currently in intern and C rarely joins the voice call.  


I would always be the one initiating and asking if any of them wants to play games.  
For example Valorant, I will ask A and B if they wants to join but they will decline and say stuff like they don't feel like playing today. And after a while I will see them playing together without me.

A and B plays CSGO without me, and recently uninstall because its boring and not their type. I ask if they want to reinstall CSGO and play again, they replied no and never. But suddenly C joined asked if they want to play CSGO and suddenly their CSGO is reinstalled.

  
A and B plays Mobile Legend without me, I will always ask if they want to play and mostly they will reply no and phone no battery or not in the mood. But whenever C or D joins and ask if they want to play, suddenly their phone is fully charged and their mood has changed.

Because of this, It makes me overthink, makes me depress because all the things in my mind are ""What did I do?"", ""Did I do something wrong"", ""Have I done something wrong?"", ""How should I find out?"", ""Why did I do something I didn't even know?"" It makes me overthink and causes me to sleep late at night and wake up fatigued.

I always feel like their second choice, whenever their friend leaves to do something then finally I appear back in their life ""Hey how you doing?"", ""What game you playing"". Why fucking pretend to care when you don't at all? Am I overthinking this? Why do I do this to myself? I don't expect any replies I just want to rant out whatever I have."

**Demographics:** 

Male, Indian citizen, private school, applying without financial aid, no one else from my school is applying ED to Brown.

**Intended Major &amp; Background:** 

Engineering - I have always loved learning new things, many incidents have led to me being this curious. Amidst all this, engineering and innovating mas remained close to my heart. I enjoy making new projects and tinkering with stuff, with many of my projects aimed at helping society at large. This, and my passion to learn new things is more or less the USP of my application. 

**ACT/SAT/SAT II:** 

ACT/SAT Not given, IELTS 8.5

**UW/W GPA and Rank:** 

My school does not give GPA or rank. But I have consistently topped all classes, which has been mentioned in my LORs. If converted from my predicted (which I am guessing, but I am quite sure of) would be 4UW and 5W. 

**Coursework:** 

I have been in a bit of a unique situation. I topped my IGCSEs at my school and then went for IB. However, due to the pandemic, my parents did not want me to go to the USA so I switched to AS and A levels as it is better recognised locally. However, last month they agreed to me going to the USA and I could not switch back due to school policy. This has been explained in my application and LORs. 

The grades stand as follows - IGCSE (9A\*,1A), IBDP (42/42 in mid-terms). AS/A Level (3A\*,1A predicted). As per online resources, an A/A\* equals a 4UW and 5W GPA.

**Awards:** 

\- Quarterfinalist at a national selection and international debate event (2 separate events).

\- 2-time winner of a state science quiz competition (1st prize 2020, 2nd prize 2021).

\- 1st place at a state-level innovation competition (organized by a prominent government agency).

\- 3rd place at a state-level innovation competition (organized by a school in my state).

**Extracurriculars:** (Check edit at the bottom too)

Cannot give specific details unfortunately (PM me for specifics), but I believe they are strong overall and more or less relate to my major and social causes.

\- Created a technological solution to a major social issue, this was presented to high ranking officials in the government and the project was felicitated by them as well.

\- Wrote a book about all the engineering/robotics projects I have done over the years, I was invited by the government to present these to them in more detail as most were pragmatic and useful to society.

\- Started an organisation with 3 others that connects high school students to international and domestic NGOs and firms for volunteering opportunities and internships during the pandemic. Responsible for web design and managing. We connected over 200 students succesfully.

\- Co-organizer at several events such as a fundraising cyclothon (1L INR / 1300$), a fund for ensuring safe education of 500+ children during the pandemic (38K INR / 500$), 2 fully student-led TEDx events at my school (event manager in 2017 and lead organizer in 2019). The amounts raised may not seem like much, but given the cost of living and average income in India, they are pretty significant.

\- Started an organisation with a friend where we taught underprivileged students about tech and IT at a computer lab built at a local NGO. We went weekly before the pandemic and made videos on the same topics and covid safety (with 10 other volunteers) during restrictions.  

\- Interned at a company with 100M+ USD valuation, as a developer for a dashboard to give real time order and analytics data from the company's records.

**Essays:**

My Common App essays revolves around an incident surrounding stamps (PM me for details) which made me more curious in life, and I have explained how that incident has pushed me to learn and try out new things. My Brown video is also based around this, about my love for learning new things and how I would spread this to others at college and learn from them as well. I had this essay and other supplementals read by people at school, and they do believe they are nice. I would surely rate my essays highly.

In the Additional Information essay, I have mentioned how I used the time during the lockdown to improve my graphic designing and web design skills through courses and used them to make websites and do the designing for social and personal organisations. I also mentioned the entire boards switch thing explained above.

I have also uploaded a link to my personal website (PM me) and resume where all my projects have been mentioned in more detail along with photos and links to their separate events sites and social media.

**LORs:**

My LORs are a solid 10/10. I have taken LORs from my Physics, Chemistry and English teachers in addition to the counsellor LOR. All of them are surely stellar as I have shared a great rapport with the teachers. I was also able to get a LOR from a Brown alumni (this is Brown specific, so only uploaded there under the Additional Recommender section), and this is also definitely well written. I asked my Physics and Chemistry teachers to mention the projects that I do related to engineering, and they have assured me that they have mentioned those things. I also requested them to mention my personality at school (cooperative, helpful and a leader) which they would have had incorporated.

**Schools:**

Brown ED, MIT EA, Caltech EA, UCs (Berkely, San Diego, Irvine, Santa Barbara and UCLA). Depending on the EA results, I would apply to Cornell, Stanford, Harvard and safety schools. I did not have a lot of time to plan this as it was quite late that I was sure of going to the USA.

Thank you so much for reading it through! Please tell me what you think.

EDIT: I have also been part of many school activities such as the Science Magazine, Yearbook and others which I didn't put in the ECs as they are well explained in the LORs as told by my counselor. Therefore, I have filled my activity list with things which I believe are stronger."

I've always been a motivated student throughout my Bachelor's and gave my job absolutely everything. I love what I do and I've been wanting to study in this European country since I was 16. It wasn't feasible then but I hustled to maintain a good GPA, taking up an internship or volunteering opportunity at every possible moment and gaining good, relevant experience for my application. I didn't go to business school (for a BBA or anything) but was determined to make my marketing career work. It's happening but my grad school ambitions feel dashed due to 3 dreaded letters. G R E. 

This exam has made me question whether I have what it takes to make it to my target university. No matter what I'm doing I'm not getting any better and everything I've been working for for 7 years seems so fruitless. No matter what I do I feel like it won't make up for my abysmal score. I have scheduled to retake it but the dread and anxiety have drawn me into looking into the pit of low self confidence which just looks like a mirror at this point. Is it time to call it quits and settle? My work experience and knowledge of the local language helped me get into another university in the same country, but my dream college just seems so out reach. Sigh, back into the abyss of 10 grade arithmetic and vocabulary I suppose."

Currently I am working in a fortune 500 company as a Software Developer and my work involves a C++ project. Also recently I got an offer from a Research Institute Bangalore for the position of an Engineer(This company will provide a brand value). 

1. Now my question is does brand name matter while applying for masters? 

2. Currently my work involves learning more about the business than technical. And the position that I am being offered is more of a Technical role. Both involve programming only. Will the kind of work matter, cause if it does then I suppose the later would be a better option.

3. Will it create a negative image - of having to switch jobs within the first 8 months - while writing SOPs?"
rd9ec9,2,2021-12-10,IBM Extreme Blue or Ocado Internship(UK)?,lucidmath,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rd9ec9/ibm_extreme_blue_or_ocado_internshipuk/,"Hi  there, I have two offers for the summer and I'm trying to figure out  which one makes more sense. All salaries are in British pounds.

IBM  -&gt; Free accomodation, 18k pro rata, in a nice village (Hursley),  more prestigious, less of a straight software engineering internship  more a self directed project

Ocado  -&gt; Slightly better pay (30k pro rata, but no accomodation), probably  more technical, but less well known company/program

I  don't care that much about the money, this is my first job and I'm  looking for the most valuable experience. IBM sounds like a more  interesting experience overall, but I'm concerned that it might not be  technical enough, however that might vary wildly depending on the  projects that are happening this year. Ocado is solving a very cool  problem, but I don't know how much interns actually contribute, and I  don't know whether it is as well regarded as IBM when it comes to  graduate recruitment. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

I am an international student who will be attending college in the US coming fall 2022. I have been accepted to IUPUI, which is a merger between Indiana University and Purdue University, and I will graduate with a Purdue university degree in BS computer science from the Purdue school of science. The university is in Indianapolis and not west Lafayette.

I am confident that I will be admitted to a few top European and Canadian Universities, but I will most probably decide to study in the US because of the vast internship opportunities the country offers before graduating and the scholarship the university is offering me. I was leaning to study in Europe because of the cost but I have been researching a lot and concluded that internships in Europe (specifically Germany, Sweden &amp; Netherlands) are rare to get as an undergrad (some even have a requirement that you must be graduated) and are not well paying.

Therefore, in order to make the most of college and studying in the US, it is imperative to me that I graduate with at least 2 years of work experience (at least 1 internship in each year of college). I have seen freshman in this subreddit getting internships in FAANG and good tech companies with no prior experience and only a few courses under their belts. To what extent is this true? Is this true for international students as well or do they face some sort of discrimination? 

I have a few questions below regarding internships in the US and I hope I can get some help answering them, and it would be great if you could offer some personal advice to get a good internship in freshman year and in college as a whole:

1. What should I focus on? I know leetcode/Data structures and Algos and projects are essential but I am a bit confused. For example, what should I be learning if I want to aim for a software engineering internship? I was really interested in ML/AI so I am currently learning Python and Data Science, but got to know that the industry is concentrated and competitive with people with masters/PhD’s applying for Data Science jobs. Keeping this in mind, what should I learn? There are different career paths (e.g DevOp’s, Full stack developer, web developer, backend/front end e.t.c.) but I am confused on which one I should focus on. It would great if you could offer some advice on which career path I should choose as a CS student that has many internship openings for undergraduates and is also well paying. Also a roadmap for the career path and things I would need to learn would also be great. I have plenty of time to learn as I am on a gap year and my university starts in Sept 2022. (I can create at least 2-3 Projects by then related to my career path)
2. Is it better to be a jack of all trades or a master of one? (i.e should I focus on one programming language or multiple?). If multiple, then which ones should I learn based on the career path you stated in the previous question?
3. At which time of the year do you apply for internships? Are summer and spring internships the same length?

Thank you for your time."

I'm almost 22 and I'm very lonely. I'm currently studying engineering and stay in hostel. My problem is most days of the week I'm sad and I'm constantly overthinking things. I'm most of the time surrounded by people but I feel I cant really connect with them most of the time. Most guys near me play physical games, video game or have girlfriends but I feel have nothing to enjoy to. I spend most of my time reading (fiction, nonfiction, textbooks) and other than that its social media or going to college. You could say I have a very empty life. I'm also very insecure of my looks. I'm below average in how I look and its been bothering me so much. I mean I constantly check my face in front camera as if I'll look better next time. I'm an introvert so I cant really do that much of small talk. There's also this girl that I really like since late 2019 but I couldn't talk that much with her and she probably doesnt like me either(considering how I look) and the problem is I cant get her off my thoughts. I tried to forget about her during the lockdown but now whenever I see her all those feelings come back to me and I know I can do nothing about it. Sometimes I really hate my predicament and I hate that I have to be through all these things. I know its my life and I have to get through these things, but man sometimes I cant help it and start crying alone in my room. Talking about my education, I've above average marks and I'm a good enough programmer but I've not been able to do anything with it. I'm currently in my 3rd year so I'm thinking of becoming a ML researcher but sometimes I'm really confused. I see people around me making connections, doing internships but I've not been able to do any of that. I hate the fact that I'm this unsocial but I cant do anything about it. Sometimes I feel its something wrong with my biochemistry that makes me this sad and low. Kei suggestions xa malai..?"

After internships I had two offers and via an online career fair I had another set of two. So I had 4 offers (which was fantastic because I thought I was screwed be of my graduation timing). 

One of the offers promised good work life balance and after a summer of hell at a manufacturing company I took that offer over another that was a good company, location, and hours but very low pay. It seemed like a good choice. The location sucked but the pay was decent and the hours were said to be manageable even on Glassdoor and the by the employees. 

I’m one year in an it’s been hell. I’m constantly working 60+ hours and basically on call. The people I spoke to when interviewing were the process team and I work I hardware. I didn’t know but, I spoke to the ones that have good hours while everyone that’s my actual colleagues work insane hours to. 

I was told a bold face lie. And via that lie I moved states, reneged on an offer from my internship company (the one with good everything but low pay). I basically burned a bridge and at the end if you divide up the pay by how much I work. The per dollar offer was the same. 

Out of all 4 offers this on was the worst choice. Bad location. Bad hours. No overtime. And so worst pay if you factor in the hours worked. 

I’m planning on leaving but, how do I avoid this in the future?"

I’ve been applying for jobs for a few months now but I’ve been having a really hard time finding anything. I have an internship which just offered me a full time position, but tbh I HATE the job. It’s really really repetitive and operational, I haven’t learned a single thing in 6 months… I haven’t accepted the offer yet, but I was planning to since I’m worried about graduating without a job. I don’t really have a lot of skills, plus it’d be better to have a plan B and keep looking for better jobs. 

However, today I just got the news that I’m moving to the last step in an interview process for another company (it’s the 4th round). It’s kind of an accelerated career program where you can gain a lot of responsibility in a shot time. I’m not super career oriented, but I think it would be a good opportunity. The company seems really good. I don't know exactly what I want to do with my life yet, but the department I interviewed for is also interesting. If it was in my city I wouldn’t think twice considering how much I hate my current job, but I’d have to move to another city. I know I haven’t got the job yet, but this is a huge decision so I feel like I should start thinking about it now so I can be ready to give an answer if I end up getting the offer.

My main concerns are that I’d be living on my own which would decrease my income a lot, and that this other city is incredible, but a LOT less safe. I also don't know anyone there. This isn’t my dream job, the kind you are willing to do anything and just go for it, it’s a good opportunity but it’s not something I’m 100% positive I would love. On the other hand, it’s a great chance to grow up and become more mature, and it’s the best opportunity I got since I started applying.

What do you think? Has anyone moved for a job before? I would love to know how your experience was, did you regret it, did you end up loving it?

Thank you so much!!"

All of my really close friends have secured an internships with amazing firms including international offers as well, this includes on campus and off campus offers.

I have been applying since June 2021 and its the end of the year. And now I am beginning to question if I really know anything. A few rejections that have actually offered a feedback say I dont have enough experience, what do you expect a college student to have? Mercari Japan rejected me because I didn't have knowledge of React. I have literally won a Major League Hacking hackathon built using React where my project was declared as the best among teams of international members, and the idea was completely new.
I am not really sure what is wrong with me anymore. I just keep thinking about it. It seems every bit of effort has gone to waste. The other day I wanted to fucking cry, but I couldn't coz I had a Machine Learning Project to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

I've finally made it! As of next week I will be finished my degree.  At the same time, I am applying for jobs.  I have an interview lined up for a job that I really want to work at, but there's one issue.  During the first round of interviews I was asked what salary I'm looking for.  I turned the question around on him and asked what salary they typically give to new grads.  He told me that they typically start at around 50k.  From there the topic moved on to more questions.

&amp;#x200B;

For this next interview I'm sure the topic will come up again if the interview goes well.  Here's the thing: This is for an embedded software engineering job.  I personally know a friend who got hired on a similar team at the same company and their starting wage is 70k, but they have done an internship at this company before so I can see why their starting wage would be higher.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that I'd probably get paid a little less since I've never worked there before, but I feel like a 20k difference is huge and unfair.  If they try to offer me 50k I want to bargain with them, but I don't want to be unreasonable either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm wondering, how much over their offer should I try to counter? Also, How do I say it tactfully without sounding greedy?"

rddeab,2,2021-12-10,First job feeling like a fraud follow up post.,dryo,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/rddeab/first_job_feeling_like_a_fraud_follow_up_post/,"So it's been a month since I wrote about my actual stance as a junior back end developer and well first and foremost, my boss apparently had a different expectation about me, and his boss, despite my shortcomings is fine with my performance so, weird situation I'm in.Again my background: I came out of a bootcamp and 4 months later got a job at a consultancy company, struggling with General Anxiety Dissorder and depression(already being taken care of).

What I've learned so far (**INTERNS AND JUNIORS read here**):

1.-**Do not take a role if the interview didn't include a technical test, for your own good, reject the position.**

why: As desperate as the company feels like hiring, the real test of programming acumen knowledge relies in the ability to solve problems, programming problems, I don't have too much experience doing so or at least the confidence, your boss may be misenterpreting what you know theoretically in comparison to your problem solving abilities in the language you will be working with, you can't obviously bullcrap your way out of solving problem eventually you will have to answer in code, you need to practice, go to leetcode,hacker rank,dojo whatever, ask a friend whatever it takes.

You don't want to be in the position I am, not being able to figure out a complex set of business rules.

2.-If you got the job and you're just starting, **Pay attention to the business meetings,write notes and DO NOT STOP ASKING QUESTIONS.**

Why:This is what's killing me right now, and it's the hardest part in almost every organization, you will be ending up in a series of confluence pages with scattered information about what your team is going to build, so, maybe, YOU will be responsible for making everything makes sense TO YOU, and there may be a situation in which the ""team leader"" is not so much of a leader and he may also be new, so be prepared to research alot and fit all the pieces together, from High Level to Unit level.Use one note,microsoft word, paint, whatever you need to organize what you need to understand,from company made API's and frameworks, to portals and databases.

3.-**Confirm all of the gathered information in the analysis phase,** make sure that what you're analyzing is correct and ask a more experienced programmer, this is where you're gonna start questioning your coding abilities because this is the first time you're going to see corporate level code, so be stubborn and ask everyone for knowledge confirmation and if you don't understand certain type of variables, google it.

4.- **Don't stay quiet**, no one cares how ashamed you are while comparing yourself to others in terms of skillset, if you're in the difficult situation where you feel alone and unprepared but the deadline is tight and everyone else is superbusy that they ignore you, **don't stay quiet**, talk to your manager about it. If you feel that your tasks are hard, talk about it with your manager aswell the sooner the better.

5.-If you're in a tight spot where you can't understand the story(tasks) because you didn't properly analyzed the code base or reference code(or confirmed it), or got into the situation that I am right now and yet your boss cannot explain it any simpler, **talk to another person about it**, this is pretty common while working with offshore teams and the accent can intervene with the understanding, **try to rationalize with your boss and make sure that, what you heard is finely understood by replying him back**, even if he gets upset, IF HE GETS UPSET....

6.-...in the situation where your boss get's upset because it's taking quite a while for you to understand something, and tries to offend you, **DON'T STAY QUIET**, you don't want to end up in the same situation like me, specially if you have a General Anxiety Disorder(or related), programming is hard enough for everyone just to also have a hard ass boss trying to humiliate you or making you feel like crap, there is no organization that I know of that allows that abusive behavior, talk to his manager or another person you can trust about it.

7.-**You will be on the spot**, be prepared, if you are prone to panic attacks or have performance anxiety and you're struggling with your tasks, I can offer you two options, read advise number 1,or **TOUGH IT OUT and get counseling** but don't quit on the spot, there will be times where you're gonna feel scared, unprepared, not worthy, ashamed, hopeless, stressed and sad because of all of it is coming up your through your skin and put you to your knees, **It's something that, unfortunately you will have to go through**, sorry for the crap news.

**YOU ARE LEARNING**, it's ok if you don't know, be kind to yourself, it still takes me some time to accept that, because all of these feelings can cramp up and reality punches you in the groin, but I know I want to be better and it's only been two months, is it getting worse? maybe, will it get better, maybe that's up to me, but what I truly know, is that, for better or for worse any shitty situation will pass and it will be an experience and I know that this will be better, than just being unemployed and dwell in tons of what if's, see it through, take it in, learn, add in more hours, exercise, breathe, walk, talk to friends, detach work from your personal life, the worst it can happen is that you get fired, but not shot to death, you can just find another job.

Hope this helps somebody who's also starting in this field and feels like shit right now, I'm not going to promise you will get better at coding because that's entirely up to you, but whatever you're going through emotionally, is necessary and you'll thank yourself in the future for having that experience.  


P.S, My grammar is crappy, sorry."

My situation:

* I graduated from Bsc last year during pandemic (degree wasn't computer science)
* Two internships during undergrad:
   * Software engineering at fintech startup.
   * ML computer vision internship.
* One year + in my current role:
   * Starting Salary: 36k base now at 41k
   * I love my current role, and the teams that I have been working on are super smart and amazing people, and I have learned so much.
   * The people culture is really great and fun, there is a drive to increase awareness and culture of inclusion and diversity.

I have some general advice questions, that I would appreciate some ideas around how to choose.

and have received 3 offers, all are so varied and i would like to soundboard and get some opinions:

* Company 1: Offer - 53k (original offer \~45k)- CV Research Engineer for Small team - working on researching / implementing solutions to problems they are finding with their product which is pretty widely used. I really enjoyed meeting the team, and got along with everyone that I met, and interviewed with. I feel that there would be a good mix of seniority where I could be mentored in my current role and grow academically, as well as getting along with great people. Located central to the city I live in / hybrid working when returning to office.
* Company 2: Offer - 60k - CV engineer on a small but growing team (I would be first in team of 4 CV engineers) to build out a greenfield product which uses computer vision for video analytics  and automation in a niche hardware product in a ubiquitous market - at home and trying to enter markets abroad. From the sounds of it, I would be the most be the most senior in terms of subject knowledge - but would be working along side product and other software engineering teams. That's a bit scary. Fully remote working - with very occasional office visits 1.5 hours train ride from city.
* Company 3: Offer - 70k (+ lots of great perks) - ML engineering role for big company, big name - I got along with everyone I interviewed with - the team was super friendly. The role would not involve research, or computer vision, also not necessarily any deep learning techniques. although there is time devoted to personal development (1 day a fortnight)). It would be mainly engineering. Located central to the city I live in / hybrid working when returning to office. 

I have the most affinity with the team and projects at company 1, as I feel that the research and  computer vision projects are most exciting, and I felt that there is a great mix of people, and potential for professional development and mentoring - I would like to work alongside experience and specialised colleagues. But the difference between the  now that I have also been offered quite a larger step up from both of the other two roles.

Questions:

Would anyone be able to give advice on taking a lower paid opportunity because of research (or interest in problems going to be solved in the role), rather than a higher paid role.

Can anyone give me some perspective on a research ML role vs. an ML Engineering role and how easily I could move from one to the other in the future?

And also does anyone have any advice on situation with company 2 - I would be the lead in the team which kinda scares me a bit as there would essentially be no one senior to ask any questions to (in ML terms). Has anyone ever been in a similar situation?"
rdi6hs,2,2021-12-10,Question for Canadian PhD programs regarding GPA.,GrimR3eaper99,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/rdi6hs/question_for_canadian_phd_programs_regarding_gpa/,"Hi Everyone, I am wrapping up my first semester in a STEM internship program and have had a rough couple days. I tanked a paper which dropped my grade from an A to an A- and have been overall feeling kind of shitty.

I have predicted my other courses will have final grades of either 4.33 or 4.0 for one of them with the last one being a 3.67 or a 3.33.

My program is unique in a sense where I have an internship but grades still matter. This made me thing what requirements are needed for a PhD program.

I have read that grades may not matter so much if you have lets say 5+ years of work experience or maybe have a couple publications. From my understanding this sub is mostly U.S based so I wanted to ask if grades attained in a masters program heavily impact a PhD candidate. What is the average gpa needed to apply? What other factors matter? 

I am currently 23 and at a stage in my career where I dont know if I want to pursue a PhD. My biggest fear is graduating with decent grades but then realizing I have to raise them in order to get into a PhD program or maybe even a second masters degree so I just thought I would ask.

Any help is appreciated."

So it's pretty straightforward of an issue but I can't seem to find a job yet and I've been searching for a while, so it raises the question of, ""am I the problem?""

I figured it was time to see if anybody else had some insight or advice to give for me and others in my position.

I just recently graduated this year in May and I've been really searching for a job since around early Aug and I haven't even gotten an interview. As humbly as I can say this, I'm a damn good coder so it's really getting to me that I have yet to have any success. I've only had one internship in my field unfortunately so I know that's got to be part of the issue because every entry level position I've seen has a requirement for at least one years experience (which doesn't make sense to me)

So anyway, how did you all get your first jobs? What can I try to do to get started? How do I get my foot in the door at least?

Feel free to ask me any questions about myself that might help us break down this issue and find a resolution lol"
rdipu5,3,2021-12-10,Apprehensions regarding my university selections (MS CS),lousybrick,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/rdipu5/apprehensions_regarding_my_university_selections/,"Over the past couple of weeks, after thoroughly checking yocket, [admits.fyi](https://admits.fyi), and this subreddit, the classification I made based on my profile seems mid-tier and whack compared to other applicants for the universities I plan to get into. I am putting forth my personal stats and the colleges that I am applying to - 

Here's my profile :

College: NIT Allahabad, IT

GPA: 8.1 (scored 8.8 in core CSE subjects from 2nd year onwards)

GRE: 164Q, 154V, 4.5 AWA

TOEFL: 106

Projects: 2 projects in computer vision, specifically for autonomous systems and scene-to-text generation, and 1 in Software-Defined Networking

Research work: Currently working on a research project on Multipath-TCP for video streaming

Work experience: 2 summer internships (both software dev) + 1 winter internship (data analytics) at startups 

My activities and achievements - Not a ton, but I am a regular participator at a lot of hackathons, coding events, etc. My best achievement was finishing fourth in a machine learning crunch contest at my college. 

SOP - I explained the exact thing I wanna work on and mentioned the key work by the professors and their labs that could help me work towards my intended projects. I've also explained my reasoning for my extremely poor grades during my freshman year. 

LOR - 1 from my professor &amp; project advisor, 2 from my professors (course instructors)

Applying for: MS in Computer Science

&amp;#x200B;

And here's where I plan to apply to - 

Hail Mary Throws (near impossible, but why not) - UCLA, UCSD, UMass

Ambitious - UC Irvine, Penn State, Univ of Minnesota, Texas A&amp;M

Moderate - CU Boulder, Stony Brook 

Safe - ASU (RIP hopes cause they're hella erratic this year), Northeastern, Univ of Pittsburgh 

&amp;#x200B;

So at the time of picking my colleges and preparing my applications, I referred to US News and some other people regarding my chances to get into these universities. A lot of them classified my chances just the way I put them above. However, just looking at other admits, rejects, applicants, my ambition to pursue a graduate program at one of these schools looks slim day by day. In fact, my anxiety is through the roof just looking at posts with ASU rejects (for profiles wayyy better than mine) over the past week. My ambition is to become a researcher, and at one point, a Master's degree seemed like the perfect transition and the right choice to prepare me towards a potential Ph.D., but now more than ever it feels distant to me as my university choices feel way too ambitious for a mid-tier profile like mine. 

Have I made the right call? Is there anything I can change with my selections? These questions pop up every night and constantly bug me. 

Now I know this post is unnecessary and feels like every other profile evaluation post, but it feels great to get this off my chest and get some reassurance about my prospects for an MS in CS at these selected universities. 

Thanks to this subreddit for the constant support and guidance!"

Some of you might recognize this post, and yes, I've made one before on another account. Long story short. If you are a CS student trying to get good at coding interviews  (you know, Leetcode style questions and such for tech companies) to get software engineering internships for top tech companies then I am here to help you!

A little about me, my name is Álvaro and I've interned at Snap during the summer and Facebook during this fall semester, and I will work full time at Snap once I graduate. I came into university not knowing anything about programming and since I didn't know any upperclassmen or anybody in the industry the entire process of applying to jobs seemed super confusing at first to me. As a result, I want to help my fellow Terpit@s navigate this process since it can be very confusing and stressful.

Out of the people I helped during the summer 2 of them got offers at Facebook, 1 at Microsoft and 1 at Appian, so my plan for this next round is to hopefully help more people to get offers at great companies like these.

* This is the study plan I gave my mentees (no need to follow it strictly, especially if you are already familiar with many of the concepts, but it's what I used)  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ri9rqwiNDAsAVyF0xYjEkN3T3XWJc3\_N\_RmT-6pfxo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ri9rqwiNDAsAVyF0xYjEkN3T3XWJc3_N_RmT-6pfxo)
* One of my mentees from last summer that got an offer at Facebook and I will conduct mock interviews on a weekly/biweekly basis (we'll figure out details a bit later) to help you sharpen up those interview skills, so that by the time that you arrive at the interview you're a bit less nervous and have an idea on how to act, speak, and solve problems throughout the entire interview
* We will also help our mentees with their resume, giving them the ones we used to apply to these companies and giving them tips on how to fix them.

Due to the nature of the interviews, we'll only be taking as mentees people that have completed at least these courses by the end of this fall semester: CMSC131, CMSC132

So if you're interested, DM me on Reddit! I will try to get to everyone (sorry to the people I didn't respond to last time, I got flooded with messages, but I'll try to respond to everyone this time)

Also, if you're someone that got an internship/full time offer at a great tech company and want to help us with this, feel free to reach out as well, I'd love to get more help so we can interview and help more people!

I am expected to graduate in Fall, 2022 and I am kinda puzzled about what should I do after graduation. Personally, I am interested in deploying ML stuff to solve real-world problems.

I think the possible choices are:

1. Be a programmer. But unfortunately, I am kinda naive at coding (spent most of my time on math-related &amp; algorithm-related stuff). However, I can easily do the medium/hard Leetcode questions.
2. Do a Ph.D. But will there still be a (good) job market for Machine Learning researchers after 5 years? I am not sure. And I don't want to pursue a career in academia (e.g., a faculty position).
3. Be a research engineer. Can I be a research engineer without industry experience (yeah I haven't done any industry intern before) &amp; without a Ph.D. degree?

Any suggestions?"
rdl500,2,2021-12-10,"I'm struggling to keep going, but my will is faltering",974545,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/rdl500/im_struggling_to_keep_going_but_my_will_is/,"Never really wrote much about everything that’s been happening to me these past few months, but I’ll try to keep it short.

I’m 23 years old, just finishing college (2 or 3 months left) and currently sharing a house with a college graduate from my campus.

My dad passed away when I was 13, he had been hiding a cigarette related cancer for some time, until it got too unbearable to hide. It all happened in under a year, the discovery, the deterioration of his health, the hospital and then his funeral. It hit me really hard, as I was extremely close to both him and my mom. 

Fast forward a year or two, me and my mom moved towns, without family close by (130 km to the city where my aunt lives). She was doing fine, got two jobs, I was trying to get back to normal at school (my grades went rock bottom), we were settling in on our new lives without dad. Then she discovered her cancer, which thankfully wasn’t cigarette related, but was in a stage too late for removal surgery. The doctors told us her life expectancy was 6 months at best.

Following that, I came to know the extent of the strength of the greatest woman I’ll ever know. After the initial surgery for biopsy and the rest period, she took 12 sessions of chemo, and 12 again after that in the span of two grueling years. She lost her hair, which she loved and cared for dearly, lost a lot of weight, going as far as having to be carried by 15 year old me to the shower and need help bathing, then gained weight due to swelling after the initial 12 chemo sessions. It was so much pain for her that I can’t even remember how my day-to-day was, only a blur of disperse memories. But it was worth it in the end, she got better against all odds, her tumor got as smalls as an olive and stayed that way. Next came the oral medication, a lighter chemo of sorts, which kept the tumor stagnant. That worked for another 5 years, which I dearly wish I could’ve spent more by her side. By the end of 2020 she started having lung problems, diseases she developed during these 7 years, which got progressively worse to the point she had to use constant oxygen.

Fast forward several hospitalizations later, in August she was at her physically weakest I’ve ever seen, couldn’t even get up from her bed, nor sit upright. That was harrowing on so many levels, seeing her that way, after all she went through.

On a night I had gone out to talk to my girlfriend about my situation, as we were having problems because of my situation, like needing to stay at home with my mother when she was unwell (she knew about that even before our relationship of 2 years started), my mom called me saying she wasn’t feeling too good, short-breathed and tired. I ran home as fast as I could, got there and stayed with her till she got a little better to sleep again. That dawn, I woke up with noises of pain and discomfort. Her oxygen saturation was below 75%, her skin was getting bluer by the minute, so I called the paramedics as soon as possible. They arrived fast, but when they saw her, she was instantly rushed to the nearest emergency room.

Once there, I was denied to talk to or even see her. The medic at the time just asked me how she was at home and by the time I listed all the complications, she just up and told me she wasn’t going to survive. She was then intubated, stabilized and over the course of the next 2 days, it was a rollercoaster of getting a bit better or getting worse, until she passed away in a Monday morning. I got the call at college, but only knew what happened when I arrived at the hospital. That moment was when my whole world came apart. Even now I’m still reeling from the loss of the person I loved most in my life, at a loss if this will ever come to pass. I know it won’t, we just get used to the pain while turning our heads to what is left of our happiness, and I say that out of the pain I still feel over my dad’s death.

Since then, me and my girlfriend broke up, over jealousy because of the place I was gonna move to (that graduate I share rent with is a woman), she got engaged with someone less than 1 month after our breakup, I’m saddled with crippling debt over the first treatment my mom did, which was a paid one (we have free healthcare here, but we had to be as fast as possible), my college and research obligations are piled up, I can’t keep up with them and my superior is calling me out on that every week. It seems everything goes awry, my car broke and the repair took most of the money I managed to save, then my computer broke and I lost days of work, I even got covid while in my (unpaid) internship.

My future seems bleak, I feel no happiness anymore, even with my family more present now than ever. The suicidal toughs I have since I was 13 only grow stronger, I’ve got plans upon plans, several alternatives to end this in the least painful manner. I keep giving myself justifications to keep going, like how my friends are gonna feel, reminding myself about the report I owe the research team at college or the help my uncle and aunties gave me during the rough first weeks.

The thing is, every day is harder than the last.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m doing therapy, and it did me wonders, but no therapy can mend the pain I feel every time I remember I’ll never see her again, the desolation and anguish in knowing that I’ve lost both my parents, that I’m alone now.

I’m gonna ask my therapist for meds next time we meet.

I’m not strong enough to keep going like this anymore, not without her.

Sorry for the long rant, but I had to get at least a bit of this off my chest, today was a rough day."
rdlrmu,27,2021-12-10,Passed Security+ at 18 in Under a Month,DaEclipses,CompTIA,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/rdlrmu/passed_security_at_18_in_under_a_month/,"I’m 18 years old and am currently working on a bachelors in CyberSecurity (provided no help for the Sec+ since I’m only in my first semester). I decided to start working on certifications early to help me with obtaining higher level internships and the first one I decided to go for was Sec+. I chose to skip A+ and Network+ because they seemed like a waste of money given that neither would be relevant once I obtain my degree. I have experience in the past (about 4-6 years ago) with programming (high and low-level) as well as some experience with security (through CTFs) but came into this with extremely limited knowledge of infrastructure or security practices and wasn’t even planning on pursuing a CompSci career until about two months ago when I dropped out and transferred after realizing that I wasn’t going to be happy in medicine after four weeks as a pre-med BioChem major. The reason I'm sharing my background is to show that even though I'm 18, a full-time college student, a college athlete, and inexperienced in the field of IT I was able to study for and pass Security+ in under a month meaning that anyone can do it with the proper motivation.

Here's my list of resources and my timeline for utilizing them:

1.) Mike Meyers sy0-501 video course (watched at 2x speed) only got to around 50% before realizing SY0-501 wasn't the correct exam

2.) Network+ Summary Video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrh0epPAC5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrh0epPAC5w))(watched at 2x speed)

3.) Jason Dion's Udemy Course (also watched at 2x speed for a baseline)(73% on Practice Exam first try)

4.) Mike Chapple LinkedIn learning (watched at 1.5x speed) (could be substituted for free using ProfesserMesser's videos) which I used the one month free LinkedIn learning trial to watch

5.) Reviewed Jason Dion's study guide (comes with Udemy course)

6.) Jason Dion's practice tests (80%+ on all 6 prior to step 7)

7.) This is the most important step and it involved me making a copy of the Exam Objectives pdf ([https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives](https://www.comptia.org/training/resources/exam-objectives)). I went through the file in a pdf editor and crossed out every concept that I was completely confident on, and highlighted items I was semi-confident on and had little to no understanding of in two different colors. I then went back through and watched professor messer's videos on my ""iffy"" sections and would cross highlighted sections out when I felt comfortable.

9.) Simulation Practice (free at [https://getcertified4less.com/uploads/file/SecurityMiniCourseHandbook.pdf](https://getcertified4less.com/uploads/file/SecurityMiniCourseHandbook.pdf))

9.) Jason Dion's Practice tests (95%+ on all 6 after step 7) and ExamCompass tests

10.) Took test and got 785/900 in \~70 minutes

Some notes about my methods:

* Watching at 2/1.5x speed is hard at first but once I got used to it I became much more efficient
* I took my test during finals week for college just to get it done (not smart, make sure you schedule it during an easy week)
* Timeframe was 2.5 weeks learning, 1.5 weeks reviewing/taking practice tests
* I wasn't consistent and my first two weeks I crammed and the second two weeks were very lax

My tips for the test:

* Majority of people on this subreddit will say that you should save PBQs for the end which I 100% agree with after taking the test. I took the test at home on a Mac and the PBQs were not my best friend when it came to being responsive to mouse clicks. They also required a lot of second-guessing which took up a lot of time.

* Schedule it early so you don't spend too much time stressing. I woke up 70 minutes before my test time which gave me enough time to eat, get some caffeine in my system, and mentally prepare myself. I logged in 30 minutes prior as suggested and was able to get in 15 minutes early
* Lastly, the flag is your best friend. Answer the questions regardless of whether or not you actually know it but flag any that you are unsure of. I can recall coming back to multiple questions and realizing that I actually knew the right answer or put in an answer that would have been completely wrong

The best advice I can really give is to motivate yourself with the fear of failure. I worked my butt off over the past month to get this test done and as I was falling asleep last night all I could think about was how sh\*\*ty it would be to have to study any more than I already had. My mindset going into the test was based on that thought and I am almost certain that it helped me to succeed.

Edit: I spent no time on weekends studying to let my brain rest"
rdltgy,7,2021-12-10,What steps can I take to transition from a technician with a non-engineering degree to a real engineer?,Borgnorg,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/rdltgy/what_steps_can_i_take_to_transition_from_a/,"I’m currently in a weird flux position as a technician at a manufacturing company, working under electrical engineers but not nominally an engineer myself. I am trying to figure out the best path for me to advance to become a real engineer.

I always wrote off engineering as something I couldn’t do. I was never really that good at math, some time around trigonometry I started having trouble and by calculus I was pretty lost. I was always good with concepts, just for some reason not able to process higher level math that well. However, I am pretty good at imagining abstract concepts and visualizing things in my head. Also, I’m good with logic.

In college, since I didn’t know what I wanted to do but I knew I liked computers, I chose an information technology degree. I still kind of kick myself to this day because I feel like it was a lazy degree. It is sort of like computer science, computer engineering, and MIS wrapped into one degree but without much specialization. I also picked it because it only required a couple pre-calc classes and as I mentioned I had previously struggled with math. However I did pick up some useful skills and internships.

After graduating, I was struggling to find employment, again kicking myself for picking what was in my opinion a half-assed degree. I ended up taking a job as a mechanic at my company. I have pretty good mechanical ability, and during this time I also learned some machining. However, I kind of disliked that position because of how greasy and laborious it was. After about six months, a good opportunity opened up in the neighboring electrical department. With my experience, they thought I might be a good fit there, so I moved there temporarily, and now permanently.

I now work closely with a senior electrical engineer and have developed sort of a mentor relationship with him. He has taught me a lot of things about electricity, but also what it means to think like an engineer. I was able to use my knowledge from some classes in school to really excel with computer systems, but my electrical knowledge is lacking. I am at a point where I can now complete most projects independently. Given my experience with a lot of things, I can typically do most things myself, ranging from programming to machining parts. The senior engineer has told me that he sees a lot of potential for me to become move to the engineering department, but it is up to me to take the steps necessary if I want to advance more quickly, which is a challenge I want to accept.

I am wondering what my best option is to become a true engineer rather than a high level technician. I’m willing to do more school (I actually like school) but I’m not sure if I have another bachelors degree in me. That could take a decade while working full time. Does it matter that I don’t have the word “engineering” in my degree? Will my lack of a solid math foundation be a major hang up for me? Is a masters out of the question without a solid engineering foundation? I feel like I have a ton of practical experience but am lacking in theory and the refinement necessary to move to the next level."

Up until now I was prehealth, but I've come to realize I don't want to pursue medicine as a career, and my GPA was not super competitive for med school anyway (\~3.3 cumulative, 3.7 major specific). I decided to switch to tech because I enjoy coding, but have never really pursued it, as well as the WLB.

I've had some basic exposure to coding throughout college because we used Python and SQL for some modeling in my physics courses and I also took a Java course where I was introduced to data structures. I also know HTML and CSS because my friends and I used to mess with it in high school and make fake websites. Other than that, I don't really have coding or computer science coursework, and obviously don't have any software internships under my belt either.  I've been teaching myself JavaScript in hopes of creating a website to store future projects I work on, as well as a small project in Python that's a password manager using SQLite and tkinter.

With all this said, what should my next steps be? Ideally I would like to apply for internships, but almost all the ones I've seen require you to be in school, and I don't think I have enough developer experience to apply for entry-level positions. A coding bootcamp is something I would consider only as a last resort because of financial reasons. Should I continue self-learning and hope a company gives me a shot for an entry level position or should I sell my soul to Revature for 2 years since I've heard they have good training and are always hiring?"

rdmq55,1,2021-12-10,Should I finish my Degree?,YourUncleGreg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rdmq55/should_i_finish_my_degree/,"TLDR at bottom;

Long time lurker here and looking for some advice as I really don't have many connections in the CS field. 

A little backstory on me: I've got a bachelor's and master's degree in music performance.  I started an associates degree in ""Computer information technology"" with an ""emphasis in Applications development"" at a local community college a year and a half ago as I've been self studying CS for a while and wanted to have a relevant degree to help get myself past the HR panel when it comes to applying for jobs. I've completed 3 semesters and have one semester left. I cannot emphasize enough that I have learned NOTHING from this degree and have been completely self taught so everything I've taken classes in has been review.  I'm not trying to be cocky, just trying to demonstrate that the value in this degree was solely in the piece of paper to list on my resume.

I started interning at a fairly large software company (not FANNG) about four months ago and I could tell I was exceeding their expectations as they were giving me a lot more responsibilities than other interns and were treating me like a junior dev.  Today, I asked for a meeting with my boss to ask if there was any way I could get health insurance coverage while interning and as my coverage from my parents health insurance will be ending January 1st as I just turned 26.  He informed me that it would not be possible without being full time, but that being said, he'd like to offer me a full time position starting at 75k (currently making 25 /hr interning).  

For one, I've made up my mind that I will take the offer as the sole reason of me going back to school was to get a job and now, I've got the job.  However, it is still a possibility for me to continue my degree elsewhere completely online while working and just extend it an extra semester.  My other option would be to start a brand new BACHELORS degree where I could study much more in depth topics and maybe have a more relevant degree for future jobs. I think a lot of my credits would transfer.  The last option I guess would be to just keep self studying and working hard at my job and hope that that will carry me far in the field.  
My goal eventually would be to move on to a company with higher pay and remote work opportunities as this company will not allow remote work and that will not be changing any time soon. 

**TLDR:**

So, my question to you all is the following:

Having already completed a bachelor's and master's degree in music performance and now having a full time job as a software dev, how relevant would it be to finish an associates degree in ""Computer Information Technology"" with an emphasis in Applications Development?  Would it worth while to start a new bachelor's from a legit program in CS now that I can afford it and I'm sure a lot of my credits would transfer AND I can take my time with it now that I have full time employment?

Also just want to say that I appreciate all of you as I owe my advancement in CS to youtube and reddit in terms of guiding me to the appropriate resources in teaching myself."

A bit of context, my whole family have worked in the public school systems, none of them have ever worked in an office setting.

I now work in an office and it's been a tough transition amonog my fellow peers and I (Those I graudated with.)

1. We all work at different companies but all of our companies, we find ourselves actually working overtime most days. Instead of a 40 hour week, it looks more like 45-50 hours salaried (No overtime pay). We are all stressed.
2. I have struggled with ADHD most of my life but in the school system I found people were forgiving with feedback and little mistakes not so much in design post-graduation
3. I'm 4 months in and the senior designer training me is suddenly gone-we don't know when he is coming back to the office. There are days where I really don't know the answers to questions
4. In school I always made the deadlines on time and was punctual with my work, even in team and large scale event projects, and at my internship. But now at my job 2-4 people are always in my files and deadlines get complicated with sudden changes and late feedback.
5. I feel like my physical and mental health are not doing their greatest. It's like a slow burn.
6. Getting used to office lingo and business culture is really strange. People are indirect and sometimes I'm not sure if I understand them fully.
7. My mom and family always sticked to one job, one place of work their whole life- that's because in the school system their pay was based off of the years they worked there, not completely tied to performance, I feel so stressed at my new place of work and always feel the need to step up and say yes to working overtime even when I know I shouldn't for that hope at a raise
8. Most of my circle are in the same situation I'm in but for even less benefits and pay. I can't really complain as my workplace isn't toxic but I feel like I struggle a lot and put a lot of pressure on myself to succeed. It's so hard with adhd as I'm constantly missing tiny details or rereading things. If you've made it this far thank you for reading my post. I miss college and didn't know what I had until I didn't have it anymore. :("

After that, I have been working in a consulting company for about half a year (current job). 

The company's main focus is data analytics, although more and more projects are towards data engineering (mine included). 

Here are the things: 

* I don't really see myself into analytics or data science. I kind of like data engineering, since it is more of technical job, and closer to computer science. But, i still feel more comfortable with stuff related to the Cloud and DevOps (I have the most experience with these, among my team). 
* Consulting seems way too demanding (hard deadlines, constant change of requirements, not enough time to learn something new and implement it the correct way). That being said, I really like my work environment: nice pay, great amount of PTO (and not once have they denied it to me), my boss doesn't have unrealistic expectations for me and helps me whenever I'm stuck. 

So my question is: should I start looking for other opportunities, more related to Cloud engineering and DevOps (possibly in a non-consulting role), but possibly with a worse work environment, or do I try and get involved with more of the data engineering projects in this company? Does either of the roles looks like it's going to drop in demand in the next years?"

Here's the gist of it:  It was a goal of mine to join this company because it is one of the few that deal with geopolitics and international relations, which is my passion. In late 2018, I was ecstatic when I finally got a researcher role. The management saw my eagerness in the field, despite being an entry-level. In the past years, I progressed jumping from one role to another, taking on more responsibilities, and even leading a team. I really enjoyed the work itself but here is the dirty part. I was promoted to a higher role in 2020 and they made me feel somewhat special by giving me a 14% increase in my salary. Now a disclaimer: I am not earning that much by international standards so this 14% is probably pennies for other people. 

When I got the new role, they hired another girl for the same position. A fresh graduate from the UK who had no experience in the workforce. We became really good friends during and outside work. Unfortunately, they fired her in less than a year, which they claim was over performance but we speculate it was because she sassed a couple of the top-level executives. 

We never discussed salaries but it was obvious that she was earning more because she managed to get her own place in a nice area while I am sharing flats with roommates. However, out of anger, she confirmed that she was earning 60% than me! That moment killed me inside. I was already job hunting in 2019 even before I got the promotion because I am aware that this company was unfair.  Her confirmation of the numbers crushed me: to think we were doing the same workload and she's living a fancier life while I eat noodles to survive. From then on, I have been aggressively job hunting but I wasn't getting any luck because my skills were pretty niche and COVID happened.

 I couldn't afford to quit because I live in a city where I depend on a company to sponsor me to stay. Financially, I cant' support myself because I am not paid enough, as mentioned before. Going back to my home country (Philippines) is not an option because I hate it there. The solution must be a simple thing to an outsider, just quit. But no, I am an expat who is basically stuck. 

I have had interviews with other competitors and I confirm that similar positions definitely pay someone like me 60-80% of what I am getting now. I have been unlucky with my interviews that I am definitely starting to doubt if there is something wrong with me.

Recently, I found out from gossips that one of our interns, who is Egyptian and was still a student at the time, was earning a bit more than me. I'm screaming inside as I write this.

I say this is racism because 80% of the employees of this company come from my country. Given their lifestyle, I can say that we are at the same rate and we are deprived. They give managerial positions to white people. I have contacts in the accounting that no Filipino in the company ever received as high as the white people even if they have stayed in the company for 10 years. 

My biggest frustration is that the Filipinos in my company never complain. 5 to 10 years and not a single complaint about the salary.  The company got so used to exploiting my people that if we complain, we are ungrateful and whiny. 

I am confident that I will get a new job by 2022 (Oh help me universe) but I have no choice to stay in this company for a while. I am definitely disgusted but I have to bear with it. I refuse to give them a pass for their racism and I want to let them know clearly that we are aware of their BS. My year-end review will be on Monday. I will tell them their bullshit (diplomatically of course), ask for a raise, and leave in a few months for a new job, hopefully. I came here to rant but tell me what else to do."

I had the privilege of going to an essay workshop at UChicago and they were saying this same thing, you've gotta be personal. This is the ONLY shot on most applications to express yourself so please be sincere and genuine about it.

My supp was super simple. Talked about a certain club, the nice location and change of scenery, my first-gen status, and how all of that would contribute to my goal of working in education specifically at Cornell.

I  am in full time job since one year. Since last 4.5 months I'm working (about 16-20hrs on weekends only)  on a research project under a scientist from a government organisation in my country. 


I know , a research project is supposed to be very intensive and probably a full time gig, but when I got this offer, I couldn't deny as it was something that aligned with interests well. And also because the advisor agreed to let me work mostly on weekends only. 


Also , all of this was possible since I'm working from home , both in my full time job as a software engg, as well as in the internship. 

My question is , if I mentioned in my application that I'm doing a part time research internship/project along side a full time job, is it going to look like  some sorta RED FLAG  to the admissions committee ? 


Is it a bad idea to mention this in my application ?

5 month internship experience at a fortune 500 company.

Currently I am working in a fortune 500 company as a Software Developer and my work involves a C++ project. Also recently I got an offer from a Research Institute Bangalore for the position of an Engineer(This company will provide a brand value). 

1. Now my question is does brand name matter while applying for masters? 

2. Currently my work involves learning more about the business than technical. And the position that I am being offered is more of a Technical role. Both involve programming only. Will the kind of work matter, cause if it does then I suppose the later would be a better option.

3. Will it create a negative image - of having to switch jobs within the first 8 months - while writing SOPs?"

During my honours project I realised I really like coding (did some data analysis using python and R, nothing major) and would like to change course into development. That's one reason for me looking into this. The other reason is that there are no job opportunities in bioinformatics in South Africa, and programming-related jobs (data analytics, data science, software dev/eng, web dev etc) are so numerous and not easy to fill since there are less cs graduates/skilled persons than there are jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

My initial plan was to do a a bootcamp (during my masters) with a place called [hyperiondev](https://www.hyperiondev.com/bootcamps/onsite-capetown-software-bootcamp/) in Cape Town. They have multiple bootcamps for different programming-related fields like Data Science, Software Dev and Web Dev. Based on their curriculum they seem like a typical bootcamp you'd find all over adn they run for the typical 12 weeks. I recently came across another program called [wethinkcode](https://www.wethinkcode.co.za/modules-overview). The thing about wethinkcode is that it runs over a 2 year period with 2 internships, and it's free. Although I won't be able to do my graduate degree and would have to commit two year full time.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is:  are the two curriculums really that different? Which one of the two would you recommend? I'm not attempting to go into tech because of the pay. Starting salaries in tech in South Africa aren't glamorous compared to the US. Any insights (especially from those who've been in the field for a while) would be appreciated.

I have had 1 internship experience as a sophomore in asset management and I have an internship lined up at a F50 tech company for a corporate finance role next summer. Recently I've been feeling like a career in finance (specifically corporate finance) is not what I want to do.

After talking to a few friends that are CS majors at my school (Texas A&amp;M), I've narrowed my options down to these:

1. Get a CS minor while learning to code myself and doing projects on the side and try to internally network during my internship next summer to get a role there and if that doesn't work out then potentially go for a masters degree in CS (an extra 2 years in school)
2. Completely change my major to a BA in computing which is essentially the same curriculum as the CS program at my school, just without any engineering prereqs or research requirements - this comes out to about 48 hours of school I have to do so an extra year or so, maybe more and a hell of a grind, but this will give me extra time to get a CS internship and give me more focus on CS

I've been thinking about making the switch since my internship last summer and what really sparked this for my was reading a [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/r68c07/is_it_just_me_or_does_tech_seem_way_better_than/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) on this subreddit last week (linked). A lot of people on there regretted not going into tech for some reason or another and made it seem like an overall better place to be.

I also feel like the switch from a SWE job to finance is a lot more manageable (perhaps with an MBA) than the opposite should I ever decide to switch.

The question boils down to this: would I be stupid to switch out of my finance degree since I only have 34 hours left? or is the change worth it if I'm sure I wouldn't like a job in finance."

After my graduation I would like to work in ML related roles in the Big 4. I had the following questions regarding the MS in CS program:


1. How is the MS in CS program at Rutgers? Is it course intensive? Asking this because I plan to pursue a thesis track and would like to dedicate some time to open source as well.



2. How is the AI/ML (specifically Computer Vision and NLP) research at Rutgers? How are the professors teaching courses related to AI? Are they approachable?



3. How is Rutgers in terms of job prospects and internships? Does the location help with the Internships and Jobs? I have seen some of its alumni working in really good companies like Microsoft, Google, Nvidia etc.



4. How is the student life in and around the campus?



Sorry to ask a lot of questions! But choosing the right school is important and I hope some current graduates and alumni of Rutgers would share their views.

About an year ago, I took up an unpaid internship opportunity to work for someone in the police department. They came up with this rather nice idea of making the country crime free. All they ended up doing was making a YouTube channel with a ton of content indexed to their name because they were about to be thrown out of the department. The channel resulted in them getting a rather cushiony promotion.

This whole channel is built on the long hard work of unpaid interns who the owner of the channel wakes up at 5 in the morning to work. They don't care if the students are sitting in the middle of the exam or not. 

All the time this dude wanted to meet the requirements for enabling ads on the channel. He kept telling us this was for enabling mobile livestream. (I have managed some other YouTube channels, it is near impossible to bullshit me in that department.)

After the agreed upon period of the internship ended, they chose to extend it for 15 more days. However they certified us only for the original 30 days of work.

I came to know recently that they are still forcing my friends to work for them. How do I put an end to this? 

(They are unable to reach me directly because I blocked the employer everywhere.)

What advice do I give to my juniors so that others employers don't abuse them or they don't end up in situations like this?

When I asked my recruiter if it is possible for me to move the internship to fall, I was told than Meta does not offer offseason internships starting this year.

However, as I was browsing LinkedIn, I saw a post saying that s/he will be joining Meta next Fall as a Software Engineering Intern. May I know if anyone else managed to get a Fall SWE Internship with Meta? If so, how should I approach my recruiter about this?"

I have a Business and Management BSc and a Supply Chain Management MSc. I have experience with HTML, CSS, Python, R, a bit of PHP. I'm really a beginner, so I started self-teaching programming like 2 weeks ago. My plan is to learn, practice everyday as much as possible. I'm working full-time but I'm very committed and motivated.

My plan is to get into a very entry-level, junior IT position next year and won't stop learning. I think I'm going to spend the next 7-8 months learning after work and then at around next Summer I'm going to quit my job and start learning and practicing full-time for 2-3-4 months and trying to get a job.

A senior software engineer guy from a big company told me that my CV is already really great and my Business degrees and internships will help landing a job after I learned programming. Is this true? Also, I've got invited to a junior DevOps interview, can someone tell me why, without IT background?

Thank you!"

After 3 years of working my ass off to maintain a high gpa, doing side projects for my university, and grinding leetcode, I'm finally starting to see results! The best part (aside from the fact I wont be broke my senior year) is that I will actually be doing something I'm interested in - machine learning.

I'm still shooting for a FAANG internship, but it doesn't make this offer and less exciting!

Good luck to everyone internship hunting!

Edit: For those of you asking, here's a rough timeline of the process and the questions I had:

I applied end of October and got the OA early November. The OA was two hackerrank questions, both leetcode medium level, and 3 multiple-choice questions on databases/API/circuit logic. 

A week later I got an invite to the first round, which was a 30 minute interview on my technical knowledge/projects/languages I was proficient in. At the end of it they told me I'd be advancing to the final round. 

I didn't hear from them for 3 weeks, then I got an invite to the final round, which happened the second week of December. It consisted of a technical and behavioral interview, each one hour long. 

The technical interview had a review of my code from the OA where I walked the interviewer through my thought process, a leetcode medium (on hackerrank though) and a use-case diagram question. Nothing was too hard although I wasn't given much time to solve any of the problems. 

The behavioral had a lot of standard questions about challenges I'd faced, what I'd do in this scenario, etc. And of course, they asked why I wanted to work for GAP. 

They called me with an offer the day after the interview, which was nice and fast. "

Meanwhile, I am reminded that I am still stuck in this house after three whole years with only 25 credits under my belt. I am in no way trying to downplay their success, I am glad they are able to achieve what they want out of life. It's just that I get reminded that I can't do that stuff. Being stuck under two helicopter parents with a disabled stepsibling then being stuck under two parents that bicker at one another and are too busy with their own lives to help my sister and I start ours. Throughout this life, I feel like I am forced to look out a window into other people's lives knowing that I don't have the power to fix mine. I'm 24 years old and many of people I know have achieved their desires, yet I can't because reasons. Maybe it is about time to end this unfair suffering and try to start over in a new life, where I'm not shackled by the situations I am in now. I know that whatever I do, it won't fix my life. I think it's way better off to off myself and start over in a new life. The situation won't get better, this is my peak, no matter how many times I try to deny it. I'm sorry if it hurts others to see me die, but I can't continue this facade of happiness anymore."

I have been programming for 8 months however am nervous that I am not capable of being a successful intern. The internship requires that I have basic knowledge of an object oriented language which i do. However, I still have a hard time writing code by myself even though I have been learning to program for 8 months. i am aware of the 4 pillars of OOP and have knowledge of what they do, but am still unable to write code by myself. I feel like i'm not a very good problem solver/critical thinker/innovative thinker. I have moments were I have brain fog when learning to program and this hurts my learning process.

On a positive note, I consider learning to be a passion of mine, and do not mine spending hours, days, or weeks submerging myself into learning. I hope my passion of learning can help me break my negative thoughts and also deepen my understanding of programming to the point where I am confident in my abilities.

I am extremely stressed, anxious, and nervous because I feel like programming might not be cut out for me. Don't get me wrong I absolutely love to program, however, I have been struggling in my class and my lack of ability to write a program by myself is extremely discouraging. I am hoping that this interview does go well, however, to the point I get offered the internship, in hopes it allows me to expand my skills and knowledge. I just hope I don't disappoint the company and the team I would work under with my capabilities coming in.

rebqnf,3,2021-12-11,What is the best way to make an important life decision between two opportunities?,morgainethewhite,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rebqnf/what_is_the_best_way_to_make_an_important_life/,"   Ok so here's my situation. I'm 26yo and ended up moving back home after some circumstance and only finished the first year in my fine art school. I did very well, can draw like a master and would like to move back and finish so I can paint realistically too. Had a falling out with former instructor but that hatchet was buried. I'm living in a city I fking hate, words gone around that I'm living in my car and I'm easily bulliable after some shit happened with a job and other bs rumors, getting shit and laughs from random people every day. On the other end I visited my state college for art, took a tour, and the professor accepted my portfolio on the spot and said it was the best she'd seen, I could go anywhere to learn and had a future in teaching, that I should feel very proud despite my journey and I honestly do. 

   After I was done touring I stated my whole purpose for college would be to study illustration and animation, my original intent and purpose for being an artist. I was using fine art as a stepping stone and still do want to paint like the masters because I would stand out. Being in that animation studio and concept room I kinda geeked out, like I was 18yo again. Like all my struggles and survival had brought all that to me and I could finally reach out and take hold of my dreams with an internship at the end that could put me overseas like I wanted. I'm only struggling to make this decision because I want to finish my academy training and take my acccuracy and painting to the masters level plus show everyone back home I'm not a failure and finish what I started. I want to use painting to paint like frazetta and do fantasy art if I wanted in Illustration. So much to be gained in the fine art schools. I would end up going back to get my BFA anyway. Friend said it might be a waste if I don't get a job painting right away anyway and would have to stick with blue collar instead of getting job training with this school and who knows what could happen in those 2 years. I feel at loss, can I get some kind of advice? My father said go with your first inclination but I'm not sure which it is."

reell0,3,2021-12-11,[M/20] Just found college isn’t for me… Now what?,OutOfPureCuriosity,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/reell0/m20_just_found_college_isnt_for_me_now_what/,"So I think I put all my eggs into one basket; I thought for sure I would want to become a Crime Scene Investigator, and thought I’d go to a community college for 2 years, transfer to a university and get a Forensic Science degree and since the job is in demand (at least it is according to wherever I checked online) I’d easily land a job and that’d be it. I’m in my second year into college and I’m failing - bad. I’m not sure if it’s due to online courses or not, but no matter what I can’t seem to force myself to put in the effort required for college. I rarely have issue with understanding the material itself, however the structure of the school just makes me apathetic about everything. I don’t believe it’s a work ethic issue either as the few “jobs” I’ve had (an internship 2 years ago and working with my dad) I would often work into breaks and/or ask for another task when I completed the previous one. 

The problem I’m having is figuring out what to do now? I haven’t had any work experience outside of working as a paid intern under a nearby city’s public works department and working under my dad in remodeling houses (I’ve only done minor things so I haven’t picked up much skills to advertise myself on in this field e.g. painting, grouting, replacing outlets, etc.). Outside of that I’m a 20-year-old who’s never truly entered the workforce as I thought, “I’m going to do X, so working a job in Y won’t help me as it’s in a completely different field”. 

I used to dabble in art, music and editing a bit as hobbies, however I never truly dedicated myself into honing my skills in these fields as I thought “I’m going to do X, doing Y won’t help me as it’s in a completely different field”. These fields are seen as “dream jobs” by many including myself so I never really gave entering them much thought as it’s a very competitive field, and by now, everyone around me is definitely much better in these fields as they took it seriously. 

I’ve picked up **very** rudimentary skills coding, reading French, and visual design, but I never really focused on seriously learning these skills, as I thought “I’m going to do X, learning Y skill won’t help me as it’s completely unrelated”. I **do** believe I can dedicate myself enough in these topics to learn it, but I’m worried that I may never get a job in these fields despite that as I have no experience in them, and I’m unsure if I can truly master them enough to land a job. 

I really have no idea what to do with my life right now."

reg48x,2,2021-12-11,I am not sure of anything anymore,thehatthinker,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/reg48x/i_am_not_sure_of_anything_anymore/,"Good night to anyone that is willing to read this. I just need to be heard off and sorry if do not express myself correctly as this is not my native language.

Here I go,

I am not sure of if I am a good person or not.

I am one of those that takes a lot of time to think about everything, my mistakes above all. I am not hurting myself with this because I always move on but I like to try to make mends with the people that I had a problem and try to see my mistakes and try to work on them.

The thing is that I have this one friend that whom I left out of a plan (we decided to meet in a place with a group of friends) but we move to other place as we spent 2 hours wandering around. We forgot to tell him where we headed off. He texted us but we were talking and drinking and we didn't notice about him asking where were we. Then some friends noticed that he was asking but several hours had passed and he went home and start doing some stuff. Now is when my nightmare starts. Some of my friends started joking around in the text group. Then he left the group and when I came home after some hours he started insulting me and telling me that I was gossiping about him, telling lies, or making fun of him. It shocked me but as I am a calm person I tried not to fire things up and just read and some times answered to some things that I did not know I did. I waited to the next day to talk with him, expecting that he would be calmed down... We started talking and I tried to defend myself, it was true that I talked about him but I did not feel like I was talking with malicious intentions... (Maybe I discussed with friends how were where doing with the degree, our weakness and virtues...) and he told me things that I do not remember saying. As he felt bad about this I apologized and swore not to talk about him... then he threaten me not to do so... Since then we never talked again. I spent many days thinking about if I really said those things... I felt shameful because I pictured myself doing such things and I decided that if that was the case, and I did say those things, it cannot happen again.

Now is where the worst comes. This friend and I were preparing for our year of internship and we had everything prepared. Some weeks after the discussion we tried to talk everything out... he was not receptive and maintained that I was guilty of everything he said. After some time and talks we ended up deciding that we will try for some days to live together... if things did not work we split up and continue our lives apart. At first everything looked fine, we had a discussion because I got late for a meeting with him.

I started to think more of how not to make him angry than being myself. We have a common text group of friends, and as him and others of the text group usually does not (or back down at the last moment) to the group plans we ended up making other text group with the people that are more actively. But we never stopped using the main text group and they were told of any plan, the new group was just for day-to-day talking, continue conversations of our meetings and so... I had nothing to hide because I see this as normal (maybe I am mistaken), and one day he came to my room and saw the group. He went mad, he thought that we made the group to gossip about the others, made plans without him, exclude him... well it repeated all over, and I for the first time had my first breakdown. I told the others of the group to come over to talk about this because I felt guilty about the situation (as he got mad with them too), but when they came he told me that it was not me to decide when he would talk about it... We talk it out the next day and it seems that almost everything is solved... but I feel like shit.

I am not the kind of person that talks about himself to others (in a sense of how I feel, or how I am doing) but I had a mental breakdown and I had to free myself of everything and (despite promising to not talk about him again) I asked my best friends back home about this last incident... I ended up crying, first time in my life, and my friends backed me up in everything... but I feel like shit.

I was always a confident person, I am in my 25s and I never had this kind of problems... I always solved everything by talking and trying to improve myself, and I can not stand that other people can get hurted by my mistakes (this friend or the people related to him)... I can not stand being a bad person... I can not stand this situation...

I have lost any hope with this friend as I tried several times to sort things out and I have not found any way... As I said maybe I am the villain of this story...

Anyhow I want to thank you from the bottom of my hearth, I am feeling shitty right now because I promised that I would not tell anyone about this situation and I am publishing it on the internet... I do not want to hurt anyone but I can not keep saving this..."
reg6p5,78,2021-12-11,Is it possible to skip a HelpDesk role and jump straight into a Security role?,sneezyyyy,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/reg6p5/is_it_possible_to_skip_a_helpdesk_role_and_jump/,"I just finished my 7th semester as an undergraduate and will be graduating in May with a Bachelors degree. in ""Information Assurance &amp; Cyber Security"". While on winter break, I want to begin applying to a lot of ""entry level"" Cyber Security positions such as Cyber Security Analyst or System Administrator roles. Entry level in quotations because I have seen many times on this sub it's hard for your first job to be a cyber security role.

I have had two internships during the summers of 2020 and 2021 as a help desk technician and have the security+. Many people recommend that the only way to get into the Cyber Security industry is to start with a help desk job because experience &gt; degree in this industry. I'm hoping with my degree and experience I could skip that step. I guess it would feel very disappointing for me if I end up with a help desk role when I spent thousands of dollars on the degree. Basically, if I end up with a Helpdesk role I will feel like my degree wasn't worth it and I should've just applied to Helpdesk jobs right out of high school at 18 years old.

So my question is, anyone who graduated with a Security degree, what was the first job you landed fresh out of college? How long did it take you to finally break through in a security role?"
reha61,5,2021-12-11,"Does anybody here use anything other than Jira at work? If so, what do you use?",paulitician27,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/reha61/does_anybody_here_use_anything_other_than_jira_at/,"In my previous 2 internships, I used Jira at both companies.

In my personal time, I like to use [asana](https://asana.com/). I prefer asana because its transformative UI is very optimal for me. It has List View, Calendar View, and Board View (Kanban) options, which is very good for information processing. Its free version is also great for individual use.

I have heard of [monday.com](https://monday.com) and also Trello, but I've only used Trello on like GitHub projects in my personal time since it is integrated into GitHub. I haven't heard of any people who work with something other than Jira at work though. I have only heard of someone at asana who uses asana, so no surprise there.

What do you use if you use something that isn't Jira and how satisfied are you with it?"

At what point should I start applying for internships? Is it way too early?

Also, I want to work in fintech so I was playing on minoring in finance, but I heard minors don’t really mean anything.

rei2bk,14,2021-12-12,The absolutely evil organization I used to work for is still ruining careers and I want to do something to slow it down,Lubricuntt,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rei2bk/the_absolutely_evil_organization_i_used_to_work/,"I worked as a developer for a software solutions company in India. While working for them, I witnessed and went through what we can call atrocities. Everyone was pressurized to work overtime. Once a few female workers were threatened by the manager that if they don't complete a certain work before going home, the company will harm their career. Obviously scared, these poor ladies stayed till 1AM at night trying to complete their tasks, they weren't alone in the office because it was not an uncommon practice for men to work overnight sometimes (again, unbelievable). One of the girls was harassed while she was trying to get transportation back home. Next day in the meeting, she cried and left the meeting room when the manager asked her why she didn't have a 'smile' on her face. Nobody went out to check on her and manager just sat there going, ""what happened?"" And everyone shrugged their shoulders going idk. I was a new intern and didn't know this was common, so I got up and went to check on her (which was also frowned upon) and she told me how scared she was for her life last night and she was still shaking in fear. She was traumatized. I comforted her and went back to the meeting room, where everyone was STILL sitting silently and I told the manager what happened and I shit you not, he literally said, ""why did she work so slow that she had to wait till 1AM to complete it"" when the work he had assigned was impossible to complete in a day and everyone else in her team was working that late because of what he had asked them to complete. I was FURIOUS. Being a guy, I'd shit my pants if I was in her situation, and I can't imagine what she went through. I took the lady to the HR and the HR who also was a woman, unbelievably said ""you shouldn't have cried, you're negatively impacting the environment"". It was appalling, and my first fight with the management. Oh yeah, they made my life living hell after that.

This was just ONE example. They entrap freshers out of universities with 2 year long work contracts, force them to overwork, underpay. 2 friends got fired because they didn't invite a manager to one guy's birthday party. The director is a class level creep who would hire beautiful business interns and constantly pester them to spend time with him despite him being married with a kid. Employees not allowed to use washrooms inside the office, they have to use unhygienic public ones outside. When working from home, they use a software to monitor your productivity based on how many buttons you press per minute and your salary for the day will be deducted to half if you log even few minutes less than 9 hours. Every day there was something new that would make your blood boil. They will force you to fool clients for money and make you follow bad practices and not allow you to learn new things which will negatively impact your career in the future. ACs turned off in summer to ""save"" on electricity bills when the director went on a las Vegas trip with his entire family. They would also tear your contract down and write a new one which suits them better because there's a sentence in the contract which says they can ""update"" the contract if needed. And so many things that will make you pull your hair out in anger and if I wrote it down, it would be a novel.

What's worse is that their ""exit"" policy is that you handover credentials to your email account which is basically a random gmail account they create for you when you start working. Then they write a 5 star review for themselves on Glassdoor using that account. They're still thriving and making lots of money and luring in poor students with their stellar 4.3 Glassdoor rating and oh, Glassdoor magically removes almost every bad review anyone ever left that would bring their rating below 4. They blatantly threaten everyone who speaks ill of them. I've moved on in my career with an amazing job but sometimes still find my heart skip a beat everytime my teams app goes off or an email dings. I have to remind myself that I don't work there anymore. I'm traumatized. 

I want to do something to at least slow down this organisation from ruining more lives. Any Glassdoor review I put, no matter how well balanced it is or well written. It gets removed a few days later. Any ideas will be appreciated."

Should I take it?,uiuc-yeet,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/reia56/how_is_the_cqf_perceived_in_industry_should_i/,"Are there any stereotypical connotations associated with the CQF in the professional world that I should know of? I'm currently a sophomore undergrad who really wants to get a quant internship the summer after my junior year, so I'm planning on taking the CQF next semester to potentially stand out in interviews next Fall.

I know that the CQF really isn't necessary and that it's early to take it, but I really don't have much else going for me that shows I know quantitative finance (I'm double majoring in math + cs, and stats, and I've only taken an intro finance class). I'm hoping to get a software / data science internship this coming summer, and I'm sure that would help with getting another internship after junior year, but I'm not even sure if I can get one this summer. 

I don't think the cost or material difficulty for the CQF will be a problem for me, so I just want to know if it would be a good time investment. If it isn't perceived that highly by interviewers, then I might not take it."

I want to apply for schools as soon as early decision opens next year, if possible. I'll have to bring my math and Spanish up drastically first; tested into Algebra I, and flunked even w/ full help. tested into Span II, and was mediocre.

I graduated a top public college prep hs (Niche 4.5 stars) 2019, signed up for college to study pre law, so was in philosophy before then; 1.5 semesters total (fall 19, summer I 20), but actually took far less; math was dragging me down and I sacrificed courses.

I wouldn’t consider myself a huge “tech nerd” but I enjoy programming and attempting to problem solve, even though it may take a bit of time sometimes. 

I’m getting my way through university (sophomore, so pretty new) and I don’t know what to expect. I see a lot of terms being thrown around in this sub that I’m not necessarily familiar with, and sometimes I feel like I’m in over my head with CS and “not good enough.”  

My overall GPA through 45 credits is a 3.92 (not flexing, trust me it will tank…), and I’m majoring in general CS. I sometimes feel like people may be “doing it better than me” because they seem like they know A LOT more than me. 

So, if there’s anyone in here that’s already in the industry.. what matters the most in college? What should I be doing now? Should I just continue taking classes and doing my best? I plan on getting an internship next summer once I have proper experience. I feel like I’m missing something though. 

Basically, I just need general advice. (Could someone also explain what Leetcode is.. I see it a lot on here)."

I'm a third year student and I study electronics and communication engineering in a pretty good college here in India. Now I'm not sure if this happens in every country, but here in India, during the 4th year(the final year) a lot of companies actively come to the college and conduct exams and interviews to hire students. Even though I really love electronics, and actively do small small projects myself, I haven't had time or the opportunity to do a bigger one or get a good internship because of COVID. Only few Companies related to electronics do come to the college and select like 2-3 people from a group of like 1200 ECE students and I don't feel I'll be one of the lucky few. 

But one the other hand a lot of IT companies and other massive companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft come each year and offer amazing salaries (to the Indian standards). There's usually a minimum cgpa requirement set by each Company and you need to have more than that to be able to attend their tests and interviews. I have 9.45 cgpa and can pretty much sit for all the companies. Only problem is that their tests and interviews are completely based on programming and not electronics.

I feel bagging a job in Amazon or Microsoft will be huge and I don't wanna miss out on such opportunities. I've actively started learning programming, and I thought of starting with python cuz I have an exam for a job offering coming up in Feburary and it's going to be on python. The topics majorly going to be asked are programming fundamentals, algorithms, control Structure, collection, functions, oops,DBMS, SQL and such.

I started off a few days ago in hackerrank and can currently do math related problems, data type related ones and other ones using lists and dictionaries.
What's the best place and way to learn and cover the aforementioned topics and what else would you recommend learning in the long run."

He told me that I'll continue in the process and the next step would have a technical interview.

The only experience that I had in technical interviews was to get my internship in a Belgium company, so the first part of the interview was theoretical questions about functional programming concepts and OOP, the second part was solving a problem with strong concepts in OOP in Java.

I was wondering what kind of questions would have a technical interview without coding for a Junior Software engineer position. By the way, I solved my hacker rank challenge in Java.

repabz,1,2021-12-12,Are there jobs in operating systems development?,pyxiqitys,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/repabz/are_there_jobs_in_operating_systems_development/,"Posted before, but it's disappeared? So, a summarized (and far more blunt) version of what I already said:

I'm close to graduating with my CS degree, but with no internships or offers yet. I've only been able to find places looking for front-end web developers, but I don't enjoy front-end web development.

All of my projects are systems related: a simple preemptive round-robin process scheduler, building a memory allocator, writing a bootloader using UEFI, and some bare-metal projects on an RPi 4, etc. These projects aren't enough to impress anybody, and the stuff that's worthy of being open source doesn't get any stars. With only an A- average GPA, that doesn't help me either.

I'm not too worried about actually getting a job--there's enough web stuff out there that eventually I'll get something with what I have by just applying enough times to enough places. But I want to work on new and exciting stuff: work on new operating systems that aren't just versions of FreeBSD or Linux or something. There doesn't seem to be any systems research outside of virtualization, so I'd like to work in industry. Nobody ever sends me notifications that they're looking for this kind of work, but I get tons of stuff about front end web all the time.

I've tried looking through on every board I can for ""Kernel Developer"" and ""Embedded Systems Engineer"". Every job listing I see with these skills I do have seems to want someone with a lot of experience and for a very big position--not for juniors. The very few that aren't don't seem to actually be about systems development, but mention Linux in the sense of ""can you use bash"" instead of ""can you write a driver"". Am I wasting my time trying to get a job in an area I actually want to work in? Do systems jobs for new grads exist? Should I apply to these positions anyway, despite being totally underqualified? Should I just try to learn to enjoy web development?"

I have started to test the waters with job applications and I have two early stage interviews for different companies, both for software engineering roles, which seem like a better fit for me tomorrow. The only issue is I am not sure if I should mention in the interview that I am currently working as a software engineer, as I did not put it on either of the two applications (I was tired and just reused the one I used in Summer...).

Even though I have only been at my current company for roughly 3 months, I do believe I have learnt a lot more about software engineering in a production environment and therefore it would be a shame not to be able to use some of these experiences in the interview. However, will the recruiters think I am a risky prospect? Will they think “Maybe he will jump ship on us in three months as well”?

Both companies are quite different to my current company, one is in hard tech and the other is very aligned with work I did in my internship, therefore I could theoretically emphasises those points as reasons for me applying even though I already have a job.

Calculus Teacher - 5/10. During covid I would sleep through all my classes, so my calculus teacher at least knew my face bc I had her for two years. Knows I’m dece at math, and I met with her a little tiny bit for my Math IA

AP Gov/History Teacher - 7/10. Only teacher that I turned my camera on and participated in class. Met with him leading up to nationals to discuss the topic, which was a very AP Gov topic, so I think he wrote about that?

Counselor - ???/10. I got reassigned a counselor like every two months

Debate Coach – 9/10. He sent it to me after I got accepted. It was bomb. Provided a lot of context to my debate/leadership that I had no space to write

**Interviews**

It was fine! My interviewer had a son with ASD, so we talked a little about that and my role in the family. Not amazing, but nothing to get rejected over.

**Essays**

Common App - 7/10. Debate essay. Talked about how debate led to a period of personal growth in confidence and articulation for me and “helped me find my voice” (super generic but what can you do). Connected it back to a chinese storytelling motif and my family background. Not my fav but idt I could have made it better

Supplements – 8.5/10. I really liked them! I chose Dartmouths prompt about the problems I see with the world and how my course of study at Dartmouth could address them and wrote about how bail is a microcosm of unjust political systems that resist change and reform. The Why Dartmouth was about as good as a 100 word essay could have been. I thought my Dartmouth supplements were some of my stronger ones so I was about to be very sad if I got rejected

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Dartmouth (ED)
* University of Oklahoma (rolling) full ride
* Fordham (EA) full ride
* UVM (EA) 
* UMich (EA) 

**Advice to RD and Future Candidates:** 

I think it’s okay to slack a little bit. You don’t have to take the most rigorous classes or do anything you don’t really care about. I went through high school with the philosophy that I would only invest my time into things I cared about, but also that I wouldn’t half ass anything that I cared about.

For US applicants, I don’t really think that your IB score matters that much if you have an option to do AP. The score to credit conversions for IB are horrible, it’s easier to score higher on AP, and IB demands a lot of time that could be spent on things more important to your application.

Having *a* counselor in the picture makes applications a lot easier, not necessarily because they do a lot of work, but because it can help you feel more confident in your decisions and you’ll know you aren’t missing anything. Free, low cost, and school counselors are great options - the value of the counselor is having another eye guiding you!

Essays are underrated. Think about how important you think essays are, they are more important than that. Well written essays make your reader root and advocate for you, poorly written essays make them resent you. Do not half ass them!"

When is the timeline for quant internships (summer 23)? Big tech's peak is August/September but I think quant is about a month earlier?. I don't know if I'd be able to start before mid August. Is that too late? If not, will I be disadvantaged because I am applying late and they have rolling apps?"

The first thing I had in mind was a **Msc in International Accounting and Finance** then I learnt about **Finance technology**, It really piqued my interest as I'm well aware how technology and coding and data analytics has crept into Accounting and has opened new opportunities and career options for people in the relevant field.


So now I'm having a headache, I have done some research and not much information or details about it. Especially when you can consider take data science courses anywhere? I see finance and computer science together the future, but it would be very difficult to study, but the skills would very useful for future changes, But I have a soft spot just for simple accounting that I love, but I'm putting money into this, so I need to make a wise decision and I would love the insights some of you could provide!

So my GF and I are in similar majors at school and are applying for internships in these fields. My specific major is localized in only a few areas of the country, meaning I would have to relocate to do any. I've been thinking of applying to openings similar to my field near where I live.

The problem is, the only similar field to mine is the one that she's in. Meaning that we would be competing.

We both applied to an internship listing at a nearby company. It's specifically for her major, but I know people there (who recommended both of us) and they said they could get me in. But there's supposedly only one opening, and since it's for her major and we're both similarly-qualified, I think she would probably get it.

There's a power plant nearby that she's talked about applying to. I was being petty about there only being one opening at the previous internship and her probably getting it, so I looked into applying there (but didn't actually apply). I told her about it today and she got understandably upset that I thought of applying to a facility she was very interested in behind her back.

The problem is it's not the first time I've been petty like this. I also lied to her to get out of working on a test together (see this post). And knowing myself, I don't think it'll be the last.

I'm incredibly embarrassed that I do this selfish stuff and I need to be better. How can I work on this? I've already apologized but I think she knows it's just going to happen again, and I don't think she has much patience left with this (understandably).

Thanks"

I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me.

I’m an IT intern in a US sports industry. I’ve been with my franchise for over half a year (since July) and my contract was scheduled to end in February at the end of our season. My boss asked if I’d be interested in staying longer, however, and I gladly said yes since it’s been a great experience with them. He’s in contact with HR now to put in an extension request.

I want to ask for a pay raise considering all that I do. Our team was short-handed before me, with only three people making up the department. Since I’ve joined, I’ve…

- Ran our business office multiple times on my own and covered the office and projects for my supervisor more than once
- Handled small projects on my own from start to finish, including projects that had to be completed in very tight schedules
- Handled urgent problems on my own, including ones that exposed me to sensitive user data
- Transported expensive equipment over hundreds of miles
- Acted as first point of contact for some of our 3rd party hires
- Many coworkers, especially other interns and younger employees, feel comfortable enough with me that they never hesitate to come when needing help

And probably more than I can come up with right now. They trust me to get my job done well, and I’m getting more responsibility as time goes on. They loan me equipment for school projects (I’m a 3rd year uni student, comp sci) and trust me enough that they don’t press me about bringing it back- I write down everything that I do and share when necessary. 

I know that I don’t have a degree and I’m still an intern, but I also know I’m entrusted with a lot more important and time-sensitive tasks than interns in other departments."

rf8qci,1,2021-12-13,Immensely Stuck,alenabeex,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rf8qci/immensely_stuck/," 

Hi all --

I would like to get some guidance/ some advice for someone who would know how to help. I am stuck between my next career role, and am incredibly stuck on what position I would thrive in for my career growth.

I am currently a post-undergraduate at an age of 25 years old. I went to school for civil engineering and embarked on many internships for that field, and also dipped my feet into too many industries. I was also a DJ for 6 years, who has environmental art as their hobby. I worked for a year as an engineer, but I didn't see myself doing that forever. I did engineering because it stemmed from my love for design and architecture. I did not pursue architecture because I did not want to go into school for 8 years and not have a work-life balance. I chose engineering, because it was a pretty stable career.

Over the years, I have learned that learning something is so different from actually doing it. During my engineering job, instead of upskilling after work, I would be looking at the stock market. I wanted more out of my current job. I felt like there was so many rules and standards that became 100% part of the job. I felt like there was no creative freedom to produce your own ideas in the space. In the stock market, it's like a little experiment. You get to test things and forward test your own ideas, just like DJing and drawing as well.

I have been seriously trading in the stock market since 2019. Ever since then, I have been trading for about 2 years now. It took me a while to really understand how to learn to remove my feelings in the market but I think I have found somewhat of a system. Now, I am a full-time tutor who is tutoring statistics, business and math mainly and trading on the side. I then discovered that I have also had a passion to help people all along, on a personal and individual level.

Today, I am incredibly stuck. I am trying to process what I want to do next and really want to build it all the way through, but the problem is that I want to do it all. I have a love for stock market and finance, interior design and arts and music. I know that I am more prioritized in making money than designing/ arts at the moment, and I have been thinking about pursuing professional finance as a role of a trader/analyst and a personal advisor/consultant, or just straight up risking it all and starting that Youtube displaying nice architecture with chill music.

rf8qzr,1,2021-12-13,Possible to transition from Technical Consulting to Software Engineering role?,RepresentativeOwn776,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rf8qzr/possible_to_transition_from_technical_consulting/,"I’m in my senior year of undergrad majoring in CS. I have two job offers, one tech analyst and the other a rotational SWE role. I don’t have prior internship experience so I’m really grateful that I have these options.

I have yet to receive the written offer for the SWE role but I’ve already mentally decided on the technical analyst role. Location is a big deal to me and this role is in the city I currently go to school in (one of my favorite cities, I’d rate it 9/10). The city infrastructure is strong and has an expansive public transportation system.

The SWE role is in a city I know absolutely nobody in and where it’s winter for 1/3 of the year. The city has poor public transportation and overall would be less safe for me to live in alone. This offer is expiring soon (unless they accept my request for an extension).

With that being said, I was not prepared to find myself at this crossroad and I have to be quick on my feet. I do want to have a career in SWE but I do not want to disregard my mental health and overall well being. If I were to work as a technical analyst and begin a job search in SWE roles 1-1.5 years later, what could that look like?

I’m open to input and personal experiences being shared!"

My goal is to get a proper home despite the housing crisis and to be absolutely on top of my finances before starting a family. I have been looking around all of reddit, yt, glassdoor, linkedin and Blind to find out how to get into a high paying position within software. 

I have a very wide area of interest, I like talking to people, but also enjoy working alone, I am a good communicator, can learn fast, and work under pressure. But most importantly, I want to do whatever it takes to quickly rise the corporate ladder to get into a position that helps me accomplish my goals.

I want to know how to increase the value I bring but also be paid accordingly. I am willing to take on extra courses, work 50+ hrs and to grind leetcode all day for many weeks if thats what it takes. But I am afraid that in the EU companies dont look at all of that and just want good enough employees and give them average pay.

The only drawback is that I didnt study uni (bachelors of science) and dont have a masters, just bachelors of applied science. But I am willing to.

Currently my plan is to use my automisation experience at the government to my advantage by become a data engineer/automisation expert and work on multiple automisation projects as self-employed. They have offered me a job immediately after the end of my internship, but this job is average pay just like every other government employee. I am willing to take it till the end of my study but unsure what to do then.

What should I do to increase my market value? And what cs job/career path do you recommend?"

rfhvhy,2,2021-12-13,Mid-Life Crisis Before Even Starting Real Career,tandristyn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rfhvhy/midlife_crisis_before_even_starting_real_career/,"Hello everyone, after recent events, I feel like I just wanted to get this off my chest, so I think maybe writing this will help me. This will be a long post, so bear with me please. I don't really have lots of people to talk about this with.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty much all throughout my high school and college career I wanted to be an English teacher in South Korea. So I worked my way towards that goal, and I got a degree in Asian Studies with minors in TESOL, Global &amp; International Studies, and Korean. Things were going great, and I got accepted into a teaching program, but it turns out that I wouldn't even be allowed into the country pretty much because I take medication for mental health issues such as depression &amp; anxiety. They are very strict about these medications and mental health is still very stigmatized over there. I may seem dumb for not having ""researched"" this beforehand, but it had never seemed to be an issue for anyone that I was in close contact with, and I was able to study abroad there just fine with my medication. It is \*specifically\* for the VISAs for foreigners who are looking to teach English. That is one of the only VISAs that has this requirement/banning of the medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at this point, everything that I had worked for for years is no longer a reality and not something I can pursue. People were telling me to just lie about my mental health on the forms and not take my medicine for a few weeks to pass the drug tests, but the constant fear about getting caught and deported would just be lingering constantly.

&amp;#x200B;

So I decided to apply for a part time position with my University with the Education Abroad department, and was loving it! Right after I graduated in 2019 I worked there and figured that this could be a new step for me. One of my coworkers was leaving for another job, and it seemed like such a great turn of events. Everyone in my team wanted me in that permanent position, so I was planning on applying right when it was posted. Well, then came COVID. My University has been put on a hiring freeze, and from late 2019 till now, I've just been unemployed or working other part time positions with my Education Abroad department. I am currently in a marketing intern role here, and tried to apply for a full time marketing position as well. They all loved my experience and said really the only thing that was stopping them from hiring me was my lack of leadership experience. Which I haven't even had the chance to gain through having no chance in these past 2 years of part time positions. 

&amp;#x200B;

These 2 years of being in limbo has really wore me down pretty much. I feel like I have no more motivation. The one thing that I really had passion for is being blocked and is impossible to do now due to my own mental health issues. Theres still no sign of the full-time job of my old coworker ever being posted anytime soon, and I've been thinking about it, and if I do end up applying, and \*not\* getting the position, I have no idea where I will go or what I am even going to do at that point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely happy where I am in terms of living arrangements, and my grandfather who I am very close with was recently diagnosed with cancer, so I want to be close to him in proximity, so I don't want to move anywhere far now for a potential job. (which would have inevitably made living in Korea pretty terrible if that plan had worked out) I want to stay here and have a job, but I feel like things are just getting worse and worse and not working out. Everyone here tells me that they really value me as a coworker and that they are happy I am here on the team, but I have been getting rejected for most of these positions, and I wasn't even the first choice for the position I am in now.

&amp;#x200B;

If I do get this full-time position once it's inevitably posted, I've started wondering if I'm even going to enjoy myself. Do I really have a passion for this anymore? Or am I just grasping at straws trying to get ANY full-time position that I can? I am just feeling very lost. I feel like I just don't have a passion for any kind of work anymore, and that has been my goal since day 1. I wanted to have a job that I loved, and I'm really not sure if I'll ever be able to do that now. I feel like my qualifications are not useful for any potential future job that I would apply for, and I'm starting to feel like maybe I wasted my time getting that degree since I'm not able to go abroad anyway. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have \*any\* kind of advice? For those of you that may have lost a passion or had no idea what direction to go in for jobs, what did you do to help? How did you pull yourself out of a slump to find what made you happy again in jobs? Any kind of wisdom or guidance at this point is useful, and if you made it to this point, thank you for at least reading what I've written and heard my thoughts. I appreciate it. People tell me that I'm only 24 and that my career is just starting, but at this point I can't even see the starting line. I'm just in a weird space overall.

&amp;#x200B;

tl/dr: dream job won't work out, had part-time jobs throughout all of covid, have lost passion for what i really want to do, not sure what im going to do in life anymore"

rfi6r9,2,2021-12-13,Guaranteed intern/job path for Federal Position vs. trying my luck in Private Sector?,fitzlee,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rfi6r9/guaranteed_internjob_path_for_federal_position_vs/,"Hello all, I am in a local state school's CS program (graduating Spring 23) and also in a FlatIron coding bootcamp currently (graduating March 22).  

I just got a surprise offer for an internship for a federal agency, where as soon as I graduate from college, I'm promised a federal job starting at 72k, and in 5-10 years I can make around 100-130k with very low stress and lots of vacation days. I worry I can't handle the stress of a FAANG even if I could get a job there-- when I tried teaching in an inner-city school I lasted 3 months and did not have a good time.

BUT, friends say you can make a ton more money in private sector and that they're hiring quickly, like I could get a job straight out of FlatIron this March instead of waiting for the whole CS degree to finish. With a wife and kid, and student loans, that's tempting.

Do you all have an opinion on **federal vs. private sector**? Private sector seems to have poor job security, but also far more opportunity to job hop and advance."

I have no idea if US companies choose international students, or if they avoid it because I’ll cost them more or something. 

And also, If I find an internship, I really can’t afford to pay rent for myself as I already pay my rent here in France. So do companies take care of all the expenses coming with a foreign student?

Do I need to pass some test to be able to fit in the american system, maybe there are some conditions or specific certificates I need to have?

rfjqdn,0,2021-12-13,I’m choosing between a $20/hour internship and a $28/hour position that I consider a undeserved handout. What would you do?,GeneralKakashi,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/rfjqdn/im_choosing_between_a_20hour_internship_and_a/,"I’m a 23 year old Canadian who’s about to graduate from university in June of 2022. I’m getting a Bachelor of Commerce in Business Management and have minored in Information Technology.

Here’s my situation, I have the chance to choose between a 4-month paid internship that will pay around $20/hour that will likely lead to a full-time higher paying position or using a friend of a friend to secure a $28/hour IT position right now. The positions are similar and are comprised of some help desk and other low-mid level IT tasks. Both jobs are remote.

In life I’ve always tried my best to earn things myself and have never been one to take handouts. 

To already take a handout so early in life seems wrong to me, I would rather try and fail on my own then to know I just cheated myself of all the hard work I’ve done by taking the easy way out on the road to financial freedom. I don’t want to look back in 30 years and say everything I’ve achieved is because I knew someone who hooked me up, I want to say I worked hard and was self made.

In my heart I already know that I will choose the $20/hour internship but my question is if you were my age, what would you do?"

rfjse0,3,2021-12-13,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/13/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/rfjse0/weekly_job_qa_thread_12132021/,"Hi all,

Here is the 102nd installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

We've been told and made to believe that this course is basically the same as BS-CPE but with a more hands on learning system but we would still be engineers. But through further research I found out that we are definitely screwed. Apparently once we graduate with this degree we wont bear the title of engineers but technicians instead. Not only does our title and opportunity are low but also our average annual pay. We only realized this issue because we were so focused on creating side projects such as making games on unity and unreal as well as creating web apps to increase our proficiency on programming and coding. The purpose of these projects was to help us land a SWE internship at FAANGMULA. But apparently due to our current degree, this could be a huge set back even if we finish our 6th project now. I need your advice and comments on this, please."
rfm5um,3,2021-12-13,First Certification after BA in Cybersecurity,MrIntune,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rfm5um/first_certification_after_ba_in_cybersecurity/,"Howdy all.   


I am set to graduate in December 2022 from an okayish-university, its not Harvard but it was one of the only universities that offered an actual BA degree in cybersecurity, whereas the larger universities has a CS degree with an ""Emphasis"" in cybersecurity (which really meant one to two classes during your senior year, whereas I have had \~25 CSEC courses in my degree alongside the programming classes).   


Anyway,   


I also have an internship with a decent company, its not a summer internship and they have been speaking about a salary here in the short future - my role entails job requirements that are Tier I to Tier III, at-least according to job descriptions and what I found qualified a I, II, and III for the state of Texas. (I understand that part of the title system is how much work experience you have.)  


I took a few Sec+ Practice tests and scored around a \~650/700. I am not sure how relevant those practice exams are now since the test has changed to the 601, but I would have scored higher if I was more aware of more acronyms, (Like MTTR, MTTF, etc). Those have since been taught in class. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, I have not earned any certifications, and I am unsure which one to focus on?   
I am attempting to hit the trifecta: Degree, Work Experience, and ""the"" certification. 

**There is no ""the"" certification,** but there are definitely certifications that will not assist in my career, let that be because they are unknown to hiring managers, not included in Resume Skimming Keywords, or are just so out of scope of where I currently am in my career (Fundamentals, like CompTIA's ITF.) 

I have looked at Security Blue Team's BTL1, TCM's PNPT, eJPT, Sec+, Network+, and more. None of them seemed like a great certification to have. Also my work would like it if I learned more AWS security related information, but I am hesitant to get a certification for a job I already have, as it may not apply to the next position I am interested in. 

&amp;#x200B;

*I would rather come out of college swinging for the fences than just settling with base hit and hopping that something eventually gets me to home plate.* Think of this certification as a bat; In your opinion, what bat gives me the best odds of hitting a ""home run"", launching my career? I got on the team because of my degree, and I am in the batters box because of my internship, now I just need to hit the ball.   


If you would, recommend some study material for me to use to pass said certification, and feel free to let me know if I said something you disagree with.   


Thanks!"

rfnmff,8,2021-12-13,Roommate lied about being on the lease,ThatsAllFolks42,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rfnmff/roommate_lied_about_being_on_the_lease/,"My sister ""Jen"" is a college student in Virginia and has been living in an off-campus apartment (not affiliated with the university) since August 2020. She originally move into the apartment and cosigned the lease with a friend, but the friend unexpectedly and suddenly moved out in April 2021. In a rush to fill the spot since my sister couldn't cover rent on her own for more than a month, she invited a friend of a friend ""Hannah"" to join the lease and move in.

From May 2021 to August 2021, Jen is on the lease and pays half the rent, but is not in the apartment. She is out of state completely an internship for her coursework.

While she was put of town, Hannah moved in and started the application process. Over the course of the next several months, Hannah claims to be trying to get added to the lease but keeps having delays (not having a enough paystubs, starting a new job, etc). In July Hannah fails to pay rent and the ACH bounces. Online payment privileges are revoked and rent must now be paid in-person at the management office.

When Jen gets back in August, she nags Hannah until in September, Hannah claims she is now officially on the lease. During this time, Hannah repeatedly hits on Jen despite rebuffs and gets into a physical altercation with her (Hannah's) boyfriend who punches holes in two doors. Later the boyfriend also breaks a window in another fight.

Last week, Jen receives a Notice of Lease Non-Compliance Demand For Rent, showing that only half payments have been made for November and December and that the rent and late fees are due. Jen confronts Hannah who says she isn't sure what's going on and suggests Jen check with apartment management. Jen goes to the management office and learns that Hannah was never added to the lease and had stopped paying rent. In fact, she start the application in May 2021, but then never contact them further.

Jen confronts Hannah about the lies who claims she thought she was on the lease. Jen tells Hannah she needs to move out by this weekend. Hannah responds with verbal ""okay"" and ""mhmm"" to these requests.

Then yesterday when Jen asks for the keys, Hannah says no, she's not leaving. Hannah says she has 30 days from when the apartment management issues her an eviction notice, according to squatters' rights and she will not leave any sooner. Hannah's boyfriend has been hanging around and has been making threatening statements to discourage Jen from packing up Hannah's things for her.

The apartment management backed up this claim when Jen reached out to them. They said if they evict Hannah, they will also be evicting Jen and Jen will be financially responsible for the rent, damages, fine for unapproved guest, late fees, and the court filing fees if Hannah and Jen don't leave within 30 days of the eviction notice.

This seems insane. Surely Jen should be able to kick Hannah out some way? I suggested small claims court but we aren't sure how to proceed there. Do squatters' rights really work this way when there's deception like this involved? Is there any way for Jen to either kick out Hannah or move herself without having to pay thousands of dollars for Hannah's deception? Or is she going to have to pay and then take Hannah to small claims to be repaid? (Jen will need to get loans from family in order to cover all of these costs since she is a college student working a part-time job and an unpaid internship).

I'm tagging as Landlord Tenant Housing, but let me know if I should change it to small claims or something else."

&amp;#x200B;

**Coursework:** 

Freshmen and Sophomore Year, I did the MYP curriculum (Pre-IB) classes. 

These were all graded out of 7, I looked everywhere but there was no direct conversion for these into the GPA that included their weightings since they were not standard classes.

&amp;#x200B;

**Extra:**

The Netherlands went into a heavy lockdown again from December 2020 until March 2021 meaning online school and most places closed or unaccepting of internships. My family and I went back to Ghana in this time ( online school was pretty fun in the sun). To replace my ECs I found an unpaid internship at the local (albeit unlicensed) mechanic and computer repair shops.

&amp;#x200B;

**Common app essay:** About how I was not always perfect compared to my friends who are currently playing pro, making stacks from their businesses, or with perfect SATs &amp; transcripts, but i've come to realize to stop comparing myself with others and find happiness in the little things in life like giving back to others and the community. (I told this in the form of a story where I was the main character//English teacher said it brought a tear to her eye hehehe)

In my supplementaries I write about other parts of my life that arent football or MUN, like how I appreciate connecting to my roots, my life experiences etc...

&amp;#x200B;

**LORS:** 

Bomb letters from my DP Physics, CS teacher (EE supervisor), English teacher, Economics teacher, and coach. 

For the unis that are liberal arts I'll upload the economics and english

For the unis that are more research I'll upload the physics and CS teacher

&amp;#x200B;

What are my chances at any of those unis?

Any unis that I should consider more within my range?

If I dont get a better SAT score the second time round, should I submit test optional?

I have a final interview with Epic Systems coming up soon. Is it true that the final interview is mostly a formality, and they'll just try to sell themselves to me? I assume I did well on the coding test, and I have internship experience/a high GPA. I don't particularly struggle in behavioral interviews so I'm not really worried about it.

I don't love the idea of moving to Madison, WI but the compensation is insane &amp; it seems like a good way to start my career. Speaking of the compensation, I've seen $110k + $10k relocation; is there any stock including in that at all? Some of the offers on levels.fyi have stock, others don't. Finally, in case I hate it and want to leave, are there any former employees that know if you have to stay a certain amount of time to keep the stock/relocation bonus?

Thanks!

EDIT: Also does anyone know the details of their 401k match? I'd juice that thing like an orange."

So just as a bit of context, I've always been absolutely terrible at job searching. The one time I was cornered into doing it, I went to a company presentation that was being held at my college for senior students looking for an end of studies internship, gave them my CV there, got a call back, passed a technical interview where I basically answered questions about my skills (Python and SQL for datawarehouses), and I was offered the internship, and later the job.

Now after nearly 2 years at my current company, I feel grateful for the experience and the responsability I was given, but I'm feeling unfulfilled and aimless when it comes to skill improvement, so I want to start looking for new opportunities, but I just realized that I literally have no idea how to do it.

Should I send random emails with my CV ? Should I network my way to a recruiter ? Should I use LinkedIn ? How do I even know what would make my CV good with so much diverging advice on the internet ?

I already have an offer from Millenium management (as mentioned above) and Arrowstreet Capital in the profiles mentioned above. I plan to use the internship experience to go for better prop trading/hedge fund firms like Two Sigma, Citadel, DE Shaw etc etc. The possible pros are :

Millienium :

1. Front office role in a good team. Team is pretty friendly and has good development work in equities side
2. Role in Manhattan NYC. I live in Jersey City with less rent so wont need to relocate. The other is in Boston. Will pocket the relocation bonus
3. Brand : Bigger than ArrowStreet, which could be very useful for next year full time. Also, more of a ""trading"" environment than

Arrowstreet:

1. Quant Dev Intern: I am more inclined towards a mixture of coding and quant role than pure coding role, like the one at millenium.
2. Significantly better pay for an intern : The full time offer is also great, probably on the lines of internship not including the bonuses.
3. More interaction with quants and experts in the field (manager told me it happens every friday). Thinking of

Would love to stay in Boston for internship. Cant say the same for fulltime. Especially given that I lived in Jersey City for my first year at Masters and would love to be more in NYC."

**Extra:**

The Netherlands went into a heavy lockdown again from December 2020 until March 2021 meaning online school and most places closed or unaccepting of internships.

**Common app essay:** About how I was not always perfect compared to my friends who are currently playing pro, making stacks from their businesses, or with perfect SATs &amp; transcripts, but i've come to realize to stop comparing myself with others and find happiness in the little things in life like giving back to others and the community. (I told this in the form of a story where I was the main character//English teacher said it brought a tear to her eye hehehe)

In my supplementaries I write about other parts of my life that arent football or MUN, like how I appreciate connecting to my roots, my life experiences etc...

Bomb letters from my DP Physics, CS teacher (EE supervisor), English teacher, Economics teacher, and coach. 

For the unis that are liberal arts I'll upload the economics and english

For the unis that are more research I'll upload the physics and CS teacher

&amp;#x200B;

What are my chances at any of those unis?

Any unis that I should consider more within my range?

If I dont get a better SAT score the second time round, should I submit test optional?

Basically, I started college majoring in design media art or graphic design. I love art, I love doing graphics and colors and fonts and more. I even had an internship in a company. After 6 months of the internship, I lost confidence a little, mostly because things I made aren't the same vibes with the company so I wasn't the topped intern. However, I'd still do freelance projects on my own and with friends. I even have a pretty decent portfolio.

Then Fall semester rolled around, I took Psychology 001, and became pretty interested in the subject. I have a past with mental illnesses and psychology has always been a plan B for me. I loved helping friends and listening to their problems. So I met with my counselor and changed my major to psychology. At this point, I have already dropped graphic design. I thought Psychology was what I meant to do for the rest of my life. But after studying and looking for interns, I right now have already lost interest. Losing interest as in doing it for money and for a living, I still love talking about mental health, doing self-care, and stuff...

I also learned that becoming a therapist won't make much money. I value mental health a lot, and I want to do something that helps me pay the bill, I don't want to work too much. I'd rather not make a lot of money than work a lot for the money and sacrifice my mental health.

The problem now, I really want to go back to do graphic design, I haven't done it for a while. I am planning to make a book-cover-project (basically re-make book covers). I want to look for internships in the marketing and graphic design field, but I am afraid that I will hate it again and go back to psychology, and the cycle repeats.

I was thinking to make something that is not in my interest at all my career, but I have to be ok doing it. So that I can do my hobbies (art and mental health) and still be able to do a job that I don't hate to pay my bills and live a comfortable life. Has anyone experienced this? What would you do?"

My schedule next semester is looking like Data 100 (I REALLY wanna take it with Hug, don't know if he'll be teaching it in other semesters), EECS 16B (have to take it), and CS61C (need to take it as a prereq for most upper divs).

My plan initially was to take just 16B and 61C along with a couple breadths, and I thought this would be hard but manageable next semester, and then to get some sort of internship over the summer. However, I'm thinking it might be a struggle for me to do this and instead I should just take data100/16b next semester and take 61C during the summer. Is 61C during the summer feasible? This plan is better considering I might fail and have to retake CS70 next semester (which wouldn't be too bad bc I'd have already taken the class once before).

I'm also trying to decide if I should double major CS/DS, or switch to just one and try to minor in the other and I don't know what overlaps are actually allowed.

Please help me decide what to do thank u"

This post is not meant to brag at all I just am genuinely so surprised and excited and I don’t have anyone to share with besides my girl, and she’s just excited because I’m excited.

I am in my senior year of college in CS and I’ve been applying around for when I graduate. Today I got a call from a recruiter at a very well known video conferencing company telling me that they are going to offer me a new grad engineer role with 140K TC. I cannot begin describe how rattled I was hearing that. 

I go to a not very good school for anything besides maybe criminal justice(think lower tier state school), and have only been able to get internships from fairly unknown companies, and I had an existing offer for $76K TC and was planning to accept because I long accepted that that was the best I could do. 

I guess I’m just posting this because I want all of the new grads out there from shitty CS programs to know that if you’re able to get internship experience anywhere as a SWE, take it, and leverage that experience in interviews. And if you don’t get interviews- keep applying and don’t stop until you hear back. Someone out there wants you. 

If you made it this far, thanks for listening to me rant."

# Degree: 

BA in Media Study

# Work experience while in college:

**Social Media internship for a non profit**

Most of the content was curated and because of the general age of the board of directors they felt Instagram was a waste of time. The director had me curate content from Pinterest and schedule it in Hootsuite. We did two posts a day twice a week. I wanted to do more, but because of time allotment it might have fallen outside of the realm of an internship.

**Videographer for Marketing and Communications team of my universities Student Association**

I would film campus events or university lectures, it wasn't anything incredibly exciting.

**Assistant Editor for the Multimedia Desk of my school's newspaper** 

This was a lot more fun. I got to photograph performances by famous musicians and comedians as well as go around town photographing other events. I also played a small roll in helping to manage the staff photographers, I designed a motion graphics intro for our videos but it was never used because we all graduated so whoever was next in line probably didn't know about it, and I played a small roll in teaching a class. The editor was the one who headed all our meeting but I was there for backup if people had questions.

**Multimedia Content Producer for a college within my university**

This one was a great experience as well, I got to make a lot of video content and photo content that was posted on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, internal and external Newsletters, etc. The issue though is that while I was the one making the content, I played absolutely no role in writing the copy or making the actual posts or developing the campaigns. 

# Job after graduation:

**Digital marketing sales assistant/traffic coordinator for a CBS/FOX affiliate station** 

When I was hired I was starting to get a lot of training from the digital marketing manager. I designed banner ads, put them in using google DFP, I designed contests and ran the back end of selecting and contacting the winners, scheduling all of the promotional content on social media, replying to questions, etc. 

Then our station was sold. 

Out of panic of my job being terminated my manager moved me into the traffic department where I essentially did data entry.  It was easy and I was worried about my job being redundant since all of our digital marketing stuff was done at a remote hub in another state so I complied and was just thankful I had a job. Several managers I worked with were laid off, I presume because of age since they expressed they didn't want to retire but were given a really good deal. Then covid hit and we all moved to working from home. 17 months later management wanted to move everyone back. I expressed concerns because cases get bad in the winter. They used this as an excuse to fire me by saying I was being insubordinate. 

So that is my work history.

# I have earned the following certifications:

Broadcast Sales Certification (States Broadcast Association

Responsive Web Design Certification (Free Code Camp)

Fundamentals of Digital Marketing Certification (Google Digital Garage)

Inbound Marketing Certification (HubSpot Academy)

# I plan on earning the following certifications soon:

Google Analytics IQ certification

Google Ads Search Certification and others

Other various marketing related certifications from HubSpot Academy

# How the job search has been going so far:

I had four interviews last week, they are as follows

I had one interview for a virtual assistant position, but was told that the client wasn't taking anymore interviews so I can apply to other positions, which I did last week, and haven't had a reply back

I had one interview as a video editor for a non profit organization, but I was incredibly nervous during it, I have not heard back

I had one phone screen with an HR person from an ad agency in another city, but I asked if I could be allowed to work remotely and she said she would ask the hiring manager. I have not heard back yet.

I had one interview with a digital consultancy agency, but I feel I am way underqualified for that position and I have no heard back yet.

# What I am really looking for:

I am looking to get more into the traditional digital marketing space. I am happy doing content creation, but I want to take ownership of the channels we're using or at least play a collaborative role in doing so. The caveat is that I am strictly looking for something that can be done remotely which I do not think should be a problem considering we are still dealing with the pandemic. 

I think I have narrowed it down to that I would ideally like to be a marketing virtual assistant while I continue to grow my skill set and earn more certifications. I feel confident I could take the lead in a social media management position.

# What I feel is holding me back:

Simply the fact that while I have a lot of decent experience it all lacks the fundamental management role. Everything I've done is really just assisting other people to lead and I haven't had the opportunity to further my knowledge in regards to running email campaigns or ad spending.

The virtual assistant interview that I mentioned first everything was going well but I was asked to provide some writing samples. I've never written a blog and as I mentioned earlier I have never had the experience of posting the content I've made to social media despite making plenty of content for social media.

Also it could all just be genuine anxiety and impatience. I lost my job and my lease is up at the end of January. I feel that I need to have a job offer by then in case my landlord needs a proof of income. Hopefully I can just sign the lease renewal without a problem and that will buy me some time. That is honestly the biggest cause stress for me right now.

I'd also be open to doing anything customer service related, but the issue is that my experience is so focused on one industry at this point and I feel they would assume I would just be with them until something in my field comes up, which honestly would be true because despite this being a stressful time, I want to further my career since I have a good start.

Again, thank you to anyone and everyone who reads this and is able to offer advice, it really does help me figure out what to do in regards to finding a job"

A little background for me, Backend engineer with ~3 years professional experience, and 2 more years of fulltime year round internship experience.  
  
I have 2 competing job offers, both from reputable tech companies. I don't mind sharing so hopefully people can get in my shoes a little better.  
  
Offer 1 - Twitch: I got an offer to come in as an L4 (Entry level) at Twitch. The recruiter wanted to bring me in as an L5 but big daddy amazon said no and so the hiring manager and recruiter are telling me I that they would set me up to speed run an L5 promo. The culture of twitch seems awesome and the work is right what I enjoy doing. Throughout my interviews the interviewers gave me good insights into the company and despite my reservations about amazon, I think the culture would be a good fit. 170k &lt; Pay &lt; 200k  
  
Offer 2 - Google: I got an offer for an L4 at Google cloud (L5 twitch equivalent) on a team that does work that sounds interesting but is not what I am currently doing at my job (What twitch also is) Google seems cool and what not, but the main attraction is that lure of having google on the resume and how much that would help in my future career (or so I've been told). The culture seems fairly chill but maybe not as fun as twitch. The pay is much higher in the range of 250k &lt; Pay &lt; 290k.  
  
1. My question is how important is it to weigh the culture fit and where you think you would be happier day to day?  
2. Would I be dumb to pass up such a good opportunity at Google? Especially in the long term with the weight the name carries on a resume?      
3. Do you think that the ""speedrun promotion"" thing is just lip service, or is that something more common than I realize?  

Thanks so much for the help, I know its first world problems but I still cant help but be stressed out."

However, they will not tell me the team I am getting allocated to. \[I hate front end dev and have the trauma of being a Frontend dev at Microsoft\]
2. Tiktok is giving me a pretty exciting team that works on advt matching using RL and Auction Theory. However, the compensation is lower and the WLB is poor from the reviews I have seen.
3. I had the best experience interviewing at Lyft and as per [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) they pay the highest among the three options. I am yet to receive the final offer but my final round went pretty well.

I would like to hear the community's input on the merits of these companies and what points I should consider while making the choice.

I know I just need one yes from a company and I probably will not worry about having to get my first work experience as a software dev but it honestly is very discouraging to see the amount of work I put in my resume, or all the time I put into coding challenges, and I even had a week long one where I felt really confident with it, all to just at the end of the day not hear back or be denied.

I have a github consisting of several projects that I have done since I first started learning, I have a online portfolio page that also does the same thing, and I have my resume showing what languages, data structures, algorithms, and other things that I know related to software dev or engineering like APIs, unit tests, etc."
rg0krb,2,2021-12-14,Screw Almost Everything,ciderskies,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/rg0krb/screw_almost_everything/,"Screw the nepotism that perpetuates people getting into jobs, schools, or private sports clubs like it’s a birth rite, as though certain people can hardly accept failure at anything in their lives. 

Screw the grind workout culture that preaches going hard at the gym but shows no courtesy alternating sets for exercises round-robin with others, just for many of them to setback their progress by drinking hard a few days later. 

Screw the father-knows-best mantra that makes fathers think their life experience makes them know everything when in fact the world is changing and they come from one walk of life only. 

Screw the soccer moms who brag about their children being honor society all AP children at private academies to try and get them into the likes of Goldman Sach’s pipelines as interns without even thinking how there will always be a need for vocational, creative, and janitorial roles, among others. 

Screw when people say things like they’d never let their children play football or they don’t trust Roger Goodell yet they continue supporting the NFL week in, week out. 

Screw the businesses that have gotten away with environmental harms over the years. 

Screw the products that businesses get way with upselling unnecessarily, often in the super fine print or super quickly worded promotions on airwaves. 

Screw people who try to make others feel like they’re “buddies” when you question if they’re real friends. 

Screw e-commerce owners who demand their contractors deliver unrealistic expectations or requests for them. 

Screw in-person and online bullies."

Like many cs students at that time, I had a hard time finding a job. I really only had one unpaid CS internship throughout 4 years of college and maybe had some two good projects under my belt, so it was extra tough to find a job. Also, it didn't help that I graduated from a not so prestigious state school in Pennsylvania with a shit GPA (3.2). Unfortunately, I had to accept an unpaid internship after graduation with the promise that I may be able to get a paid developer role if I do show signs of improvement.

The internship was a completely unpaid full stack developer role that was also not remote so I had to relocate to Boston from Pittsburg. I worked 40 hours per week since June 2020 and Im still working at this startup to this day as an unpaid intern. Pretty much all the unpaid interns we had left after working for a year or even less than a year, and only one intern out of 23 interns we had got accepted to a paid role. Even after contributing a lot to the projects we have worked on, I do not feel confident that I will be accepted into a paid role, so Im now actively looking for a paid developer role anywhere in the nation.

After work, I work at a warehouse from 6 to 11. Plus, I work at a fast-food store for 10 hours a day on the weekends to pay bills since I don't earn a single cent from my internship. In addition, I have close to 80k in loan, and Im just barely paying the interest.

I literally have no time to study for interviews after work, and Im terribly burnt out already. Still, I’ve applied for 300+ jobs over the past three weeks and I have not gotten any response. I know that it is the holiday season, so companies won't be hiring until march or so. And Im afraid if I fail to transition into a paid role, I will be fired since they already gave me a 6-month extension for my internship.

Do I even belong in this industry? I clearly failed to get a paid position even after working for an unpaid internship for 1.5 years after graduation. Im terribly tired and stressed all the time and feel like I have reached my limit.

Edit: Will upload my resume after work. "

When I’m applying for the role (finance role), I have listed myself as a double major in finance and information system. Yet, I just realised that I could only officially declare my information system major upon graduation and from my uni portal, im still listed as “enrolled in BBA program”.

As I’m on the track of obtaining these majors, I would like to ask will it affect my background check progress and what do I need to do to explain to the HR?"

**Letters of Recommendation**

**Physics teacher and headmaster:** literally one of the two best professors I've had. Doing research and Extended Essay with him as well. Knows me and my aspirations well. He said: ""This is probably the best rec. I've written yet.""

**English and class-teacher:** wanted someone to give a perspective on how I'm like as a person, how I engage in the classroom, how I interact and fit in with others. I'm one of the best students in his class. IMO he thinks of me as a very organised, serious person—someone who takes a painstaking approach in everything.

**My past chemistry teacher:** The. Absolute. Best. Teacher. Ever. Made me love chemistry. Did research with her (she got to know me quite well), competed in Chemistry (again, time spent with her). She was a sort of a person that liked to talk about various thing with students who were engaged in her field (talked about politics, morals, other students etc.) so she had a very good grasp on how I was like as a student and a person at the same time.

**Counselor:** I'm probably the most eager US applicant she has ever had ( I might just know more things about how US admission works than her. Her info is outdated. E.g. she thinks the Common App essay should be exactly like the personal statement for UCAS.)

**Interviews**

Had an interview with an alumni (note that they did not take it into consideration)

**Essays**

\- **Common app:** started thinking about ideas for my story in the summer before 12th grade. Procrastinated on writing the actual essay till 2 weeks before the deadline. Basically once I got the idea of the story (what I wanted to get across) I wrote one draft and then revised it 2 times iirc.

\- **Supplemental:** researched a lot and made it quite personal (connected to my common app values and profile).

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *Cornell University CoE ED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*

**Additional Information:**

Just some pieces of advice for you 'all aid seeking international students out there: **THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE!**

Now for the real tips:

1. **Activities:** I have this philosophy about doing activities: **Do what you love as best/much as you can. Thats it. Thats the secret sauce.**
2. **Essays:** I'll recommend the 2 (imo) absolute best resources for writing your essays:
   1. u/College_Essay_Guy college essay writing course (It is free if you can't afford it). **The holy grail of college essay tips.** Eye opening tips, welcoming community, funny, engaging videos.

rg65s4,2,2021-12-14,Should I get a diagnose or am I fine?,Losspost,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rg65s4/should_i_get_a_diagnose_or_am_i_fine/,"Hi.

When I was younger I was diagnosed with ADHD. I got Medikenet for a time but after having side effects it was stoped. Later on when I was older (21) I got tested again and the conclusion was that I (not anymore) have no ADHD. I am not so sure on the second diagnose by a different doctor because I contained a lot of question which I am not sure if I not answered subconsciously that what he wanted to hear.

This is my daily life:

I often have the problem getting out of bed and starting work.I started a morning routine and its a lot better since then. The question now is if this is just a good coping mechanism or I really have no ADHS. Nevertheless what I notice is that when I am slipping my routine I easily wasted 2h till I am actually dressed an ready

I forget practically EVERY appointment and date. I accustomed to write every appointment, every test everything into my smartphone calendar. The last time I didn't I realised one day later that I forgot it.

Being focused for on studying is very hard. When I am in a lecture I at least daydream 50% of the time. And another percentage I scroll through reddit and stuff. When I learn on my own I really fast get the feeling to just stop. I also developed a few coping mechanisms which actually help pretty good. I hear background music with sound canceling earphones. I try to learn in rooms without window/window view. I prepare a list of tasks. My grades aren't bad and I successfully finished my bachelors in EE with a decent grade and I am now in my masters.

The thing is, I was for one year ""away"" from normal lectures doing my internship half a year and my bachelor thesis half a year. As I am now back in lecture I realised some of these problems more. While doing my internship I just hated sitting all the time on the computer making me almost going crazy. I actual loved the tasks which required to the change the focus multiple times a lot more than doing one thing over multiple hours.

Furhtermore I also had to sit still for a longer time. I move with my food or hand all the time and change my seating position at least every 5 minutes. When I am at home learning I also like to just stand up and moving randomly around with my arms and body.

Another important point is relationships. I only have few friends and I never had any girlfriend because I am to introvert to even talking to people fearing that I do or say something which could upset them and hate me.

I also have found the interesting fact that drinking coffins beverages like e.g. 1Liter coke at 22.00 doesn't create any trouble sleeping. I also dried out coffee in the morning recently (thought I am not sure if this is just placebo) and had the feeling that I could focus a lot easier.

TLDR: My life in general is fine. I have no big problems but I have sometimes the feeling my life is on hard mode hard for things like learning and realtionships. There also are some other points I forgot to mention.

My question know:

Should I go to a doctor again and describe my problems?"

rg6y1l,98,2021-12-14,At the verge of quitting. I feel like I learned nothing in 3-4 years of my PhD and start to think I am the problem.,Sensitive_Court1662,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/rg6y1l/at_the_verge_of_quitting_i_feel_like_i_learned/,"Dear comrades, I am a PhD working on S-composites as cathode materials for Metal-Sulfur Batteries - since I don’t know where else to pour my heart out, this is my story. 

Since my Masters I was interested in electrochemistry, especially in the field of (post Li-ion) batteries, and have to say that I am a „family person“. I get along very well with my siblings, my parents and my wish to have them in a distance that I can overcome within an hour of driving resulted in me choosing one of the nearer universities. Despite the fact, that there are other, farer universities that have more expertise in my field of interest. A choice I regret nowadays, a lot. 

My professor has a very broad scope of topics to offer for PhD students, let’s call them A, B(attery) and C. The B(attery) topic is something he stumbled upon by getting a PhD from an industry company that was interested in this field. For A and C the story is different, these are topics he either worked on during his own PhD or in the course of his PostDoc. And he has a LOT expertise herein.
This interest of said cooperation/company in topic B was at least partly passed on to my PI, even though he himself rarely or never became actively involved in the topic and still does not do so. Nevertheless, he always claims to be an absolute expert in topic B, even though there is no publication of our research group that has been published above an impact factor of 5-6 so far. He is at a level of knowledge where, even after over a decade of R&amp;amp;D in the field, we as students still have to constantly explain to him the elementary parameters by which these battery types are evaluated for quality and he has little to no understanding of even the elementary measurement techniques.

Now to my problem: I feel like I have learned nothing in 3-4 years of PhD and also never had a network to learn or benefit from in any way. Don't get me wrong, I have put a lot of effort into my research, read papers to the point of no return, developed and implemented my own ideas (5 co-authored papers published and currently 2 first author papers in progress), co-authored research grant proposals, supervised and corrected exams, supervised 5 students during their master thesis or research internship, worked out basics on measurement techniques (new to me) myself, was at a particle accelerator (SLS Switzerland) for the first time last week for an in operando measurement on prototypical batteries, which I planned, set up as well as applied for, in some major parts, completely on my own, etc. So: With none of the things listed before, nobody ever even helped me. Not my professor, not my colleagues, no one. No one cares what I do on a daily basis, and yet, in everything I do daily in my own research field, I find that I feel like a novice compared to the ""big guys in the battery field"". 

Here I am, comparing myself to my supposed ""competitors"" from other universities who are really well-versed in the battery field, and I feel like I am worth nothing. No matter what job I applied for now towards the end of my PhD resulted exclusively in rejections because someone was better, more accomplished or more experienced. I will never be able to make up for what these students learned in the course of their PhD through their network and their professor. I feel like I lost 3-4 years of time for nothing. Looking at my data feels more like ""Jugend forscht"" (research program for pupils) than professional science to me. My contract currently runs until the end of July 2022, I wanted to use the time until then to round up my started ideas and topics. Nevertheless, I am shocked to see that I am constantly treading water and am not making much progress on anything at the moment.

Am I the problem or should a PhD student become an expert in his own field even ""without an internal network""?

The problem is my university's counselling department is non existent. A lot of unreplied emails to the counsellor, hence asking here.

I wanted to know what is the best place to look for such opportunities and how to look for them (specific key words in searches, change regions, etc). 

I know Im asking quite a lot earlier than summer but I heard some companies close applications in december, hence hurrying it up.

Sorry for an irrelevant post.

My thought process here is that WGU's degrees include lots of IT certs, and as a student, I would be eligible for internships. My first degree was a social science degree from a low ranked school, I did not have an academically rigorous degree. 

SNHU is a totally different structure, it's not the competency-based model of WGU, so I might benefit from having more structure and having deadlines and a cohort you attend classes with. 

I've previously worked helpdesk, and I am hoping a degree would help me get out of that, especially if I am able to get internships that are only available to students, particularly remote internships."

\- Accepted: Baylor (20k/y scholarship), Northpark (15k/year scholarship)

\- Waitlisted: Trinity College, UMiami (specifically said due to financial aid yikes)

\- Rejected: UPenn, Amherst, JHU

I also just got rejected from Haverford ED1 (right after I took ACT... it was a DEPRESSING day)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, here are my stats:

 **Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: South East Asian

**Intended Major(s)**: Neuroscience/ Biochemistry

**Academics**

* **IB Predicted:** By semester: 37/42; 36/42; 37/42; 38/42 (no ranks)
* **Final IB grades:** 42/45 (Math AA: 6, Bio: 7, Chem: 6, Business: 7, Eng A: 7, another lang A: 7)

* IELTS 8.5

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. I have a small blog (500 followers). I write about MBTI, psychology, and sometimes philosophy. It doesn't make much of a visible impact but I think my blog posts say a lot about how I think and what I'm interested in.
2. Hold leadership position at a reputable student-led org in my country (several past leaders go to ivy leagues and top US schools). We have 30k followers and events with 300+ participants.
3. Founder, Head organizer of school-level science fair (never happened due to covid). Also the organizing team just didn't click very well and it just kinda flopped after a few months of me trying hard...

Biology teacher: He seems to be very impressed by me, but he has little experience with writing rec letters (6/10)

Literature teacher: We have a great personal relationship. She often writes in report cards about how I’m a very special student. But her first language is not English I’m not sure how well her message is conveyed (6.5-7/10)

**Interviews**

Did interviews with Penn and Trinity last year. I was a fool and did not do an interview for Haverford... I have very bad social anxiety though and some friends have said it makes me come across as unfriendly in the beginning. But I promise I will try my best this year...

**Essays**

Common App: I'd give it a 7/10, but I am trying very hard to boost it to an 8-9. I know my strengths quite well, now I just have to convey them...

&amp;#x200B;

For Wesleyan, I'm sort of counting on the fact that they don't weigh ECs as heavily in evaluation (according to their CDS). But I'm aware that for us intl the bar is always higher. I have looked at Bryn Mawr, Skidmore, Franklin &amp; Marshall and Reed for ED2, but I don't feel ready to fully commit to them yet... I also need a few suggestions for RD targets. I prefer schools in the North East area.

I have almost no experience coding and am planning on starting to learn once I finish up with finals - meaning there will be 9-10 months before I would be recruiting for my ""junior"" year internship (the last summer before graduation). I'm taking a few CS classes this spring and over the summer to finish up my degree and will start the spring having completing the 2nd introductory programming course (a C++ class) and data structures and algorithms.

I can't help but feel like I will be ""behind"" the students I will be competing against when recruiting next fall in terms of coding knowledge and will be overall unprepared for interviews. A few of my friends got internships during their sophomore years of college, so I guess I would be in the same spot so it is definitely possible.

How do I know when I have the skillset to begin interviewing and when should I start doing Leetcode problems to prepare? Obviously I'll do work outside of class on projects or just learning more in general (since I am so new) so maybe that can help bridge the gap?"

The compensation they are offering is, compared to the average compensations in tech internships in my country, surprisingly not satisfactory. Therefore, my question is: would I gain more knowledge that would help me in my desired career path than I would if I just focused on university and on personal projects? Furthermore, would my CV be boosted by the name of the company so heavily that it would make accepting this offer worth it?

I would greatly appreciate any opinions, especially from people who have started out in Support Engineering positions and switched over to Software Engineering.

During the start of my job search, I was able to make it to a final interview stage for a junior backend position, however I was not chosen for the role. I was depressed for a good 2 weeks, but this experience motivated me, and I have taken multiple courses since then. I have since made a portfolio site, multiple React projects and I'm currently practicing my ADS skills with JS.


The majority of roles that I have been applying to have declined me due to lack of experience and admittedly, I was not able to apply to internships during second year because of COVID, and third year I was completely oblivious to grad schemes and did not apply. 


Since then I have been looking for Junior/Graduate opportunities. Problem is I've been getting declined for a lot of Junior jobs, and these Grad schemes all start in Sept 2022.


After speaking to a family friend who is a Senior at Ford ltd, he introduced me to a free bootcamp, which spans the course of 3 months, and a job placement (at established companies like Ford themselves) after those 2 months. The catch is that this will require a 2 year commitment, and the job placement, although not guaranteed is highly likely. 

Also, I am familiar with a lot of technologies taught at the bootcamp, however I am not fully confident, therefore I feel like this bootcamp will be a good experience for me.

Since applying to this course I have been chosen for the February Cohort, however I'm unsure if I should take this opportunity or keep applying to Junior roles, as my family is pressuring me to get a job ASAP."

I'll try to lay this out with all the important background information. I'm changing careers after more than a decade at the same non-profit, I getting laid off a couple months ago. I'll be graduating at the end of the month with a BS in IT/IS. I've got management experience already under my belt and non-profit managers tend to wear a lot of hats, so it's diverse experience. I passed my CySA+ this weekend and I'll be taking the PMP exam in January or February. For the last 3 years I had been the defacto tech guy at the non-profit and discovered that I was really interested in the work, so I kept getting deeper and deeper. Doing things like installing hardware and cables, to networking, wordpress, to google admin. If there was an account, I had an administrative one. So I've got well-rounded, if shallow, experience, it was a small operation (10-20 users). I've got a well rounded education now too. CompTIA trifecta over the last year and then CySA+. So that's where I'm at professionally.

The situational contexts is that my partner is likely to be brought on as an ED for a non-profit out of state, so I will likely not be long for either job... less than a year for certain, about 6 months likely, about 3 months if something changes.

After spending the last 6 months looking for work, mostly applying for remote work because there isn't much in my area. You know the story ""300+ applications, 60 rejections notices, 9 call backs, 6 interviews, no jobs"" , until last week. 

So now I have a choice: small casino IT Tech or big school district IT intern. The casino pays 25% more than the school district. The school district internship is 3 months fixed, before moving to substitute. The commute to the school district is twice as long. Casino would be a smaller team, more responsibilities and they need someone in the next couple weeks. The school district is not desperate, I got this offer because I didn't make the cut for the IT tech position (they hired a sub, which makes sense.)

So, even with that, I'm torn. I'm leaning towards the casino for the tangible benefits (pay and commute) but if I stay at the casino for less than 6 months, is it still something I can include on my resume? I've been out of the job hunt game for a long time and I feel like I'm completely out of my depth/league in a new industry. I don't have a specific career objective in mind, but I don't really know what's out there yet. 

So what do you think? Is one going to set me up better than the other going forward? Does it matter? Does the short timeframe work against me? I'm keeping the situational info close to my chest, but I would try to leave on good terms from either. Plenty of notice etc.

If you read through all this, thanks. I appreciate you."

It wasn't my choice to be a contractor/consultant, I just couldn't find a full time job anywhere because I did not have any internship experiences out of college, so I took contractor roles that lasted about a year. This year, I was given a ""full time"" offer to be a consultant for fintech company. The consulting company tells me that this role will be good for the next few years as they need to rebuild their application and infrastructure behind it, while the actual fintech company just told me that they have extended my consultancy role for another 6 months and will re-assess my status at the end of the 6 months.

I have been at this company for now 6 months, and while I thought I was FTE (with benefits etc) and did not need to worry. But unfortunately, some things are just not adding up and now Im having massive anxiety. Mind you, the group I work with are excellent people, benefits are amazing and ideally Id love to stay here for a few years but the age difference between me and the next closest engineer is a 12 year difference.. Everybody else is in their mid 40s, 50s and even 60! The director at the client company even told me a few weeks ago they are looking to convert me to their company next year, and just informed me that I got extended for another 6 months as consultant and that was a bummer. My performance is pretty great, I mesh well with everyone but I am in uncharted territory and so is the client company as they are merging with the bigger company and might even cut down experienced folks next year if things aren't going well in the market.

So what options do I have here? Do I stick it out for another 6 months and potentially get my head chopped off at the end? Do I start interviewing with other companies? Do I be direct with the director at the client company and ask if they will hire me full time on their end? Do I take a 3 month break and recover from this whole burnout event?  

PS- the consulting company won't give me a straight answer about my employment prospects. They keep telling me I am good for at least the next 2 years, but clearly there is a differing of opinions."

I am currently a junior majoring in computer science at Arizona State University. If I'm being completely honest I am struggling in a lot of my classes. I've realized I'm not the best at coding and I don't want to get into the back-end side of software.

Unfortunately, most of the classes I am required to take for my major are geared towards software engineering and back-end development. It's really discouraging at times because the other students in my classes are amazing at coding and are doing so well. I had a really rough semester and I guess the classes I'm signed up for next semester are even more challenging so I've been pretty stressed out.

I took a class last semester about web development and I absolutely loved it. I've created a few websites since finishing that class and now I have decided to start learning JavaScript. Are there any good courses or programs out there for learning JavaScript?

Since I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life until just recently, I basically have nothing to put on my resume. I am hoping to get an internship for summer 2022 as a front-end developer or web developer. If anyone has any tips or advice on what a good resume or portfolio looks like or on how to stand-out I would really appreciate it."

There are applications currently open for Amazon internship within Germany for 2022. 

I have proficiency in Python and Ruby and working knowledge in C++. I havent done any leetcode prep. I believe I am not qualified to apply for it.

I am doing a 2 year masters, and the Amazon internship requires you to return to studies after internships, so I can only apply for this summer or I can apply next year and extend my studies by 1 year.

My question is: Should I start preparing (leet-code, cracking the coding interview) and apply now  with high likelihood of being rejected, or apply next year and extend my degree? Does being rejected cause any problem when applying for full-time roles at Amazon later on?

Any advice from previous interns or current software developers would be appreciated.

Thank you."
rgieqc,1,2021-12-14,Can someone help me understand the purpose of cin.ignore() in C++?,dcfan105,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/rgieqc/can_someone_help_me_understand_the_purpose_of/," So I've had an intro to programming with C++ course at the beginning of the year, and I've since been learning Python and trying to just learn more general coding skills partly because I'm interested and partly as prep for a firmware testing internship that starts next month and I figured I might as well try to brush up on my C++ specifically and maybe learn some C as well, since I was reading yesterday that C and C++ are the main languages used for firmware development. 

I just came across some example C++ code that initializes a string variable, has a cin for the value of the string variable, a cin.ignore statement, then initializes an int variable and does a cin for that variable.  I'd never seen cin.ignore before, so I Googled it and found some stack exchange posts about it, but I'm still kind of confused.  Several posts mentioned it having to do with clearing the stream and that whitespaces could cause problems. A couple people also said that you need a cin.ignore in between a cin and a getline command, but someone else gave an example that only used cin commands and string and int variables and said you needed to use cin.ignore in between the cin's for the int's and strings, otherwise the compiler would think the strings were just supposed to be whitespace. But why would it do that?  And what does the difference between cin and getline have to do with it?  And why do we have the clear the stream between int's and strings?  

I also tried looking up streams in C++, since I'm not very familiar with them, as my course didn't cover the concept, but there was just so much information I didn't even know where to start. 

I looked at the equivalent Python code for the example, but it didn't include any similar statement, which I assumed was because Python has built-in garbage collection while C++ doesn't. But I also looked at the equivalent C code and it didn't have any similar looking command either. I'm guessing that means C++'s cin has some kind of memory issue scanf doesn't have? Or does this not even have anything to do with memory? The mention of clearing the stream is what made me think it does."

rgihe3,1,2021-12-14,Been blacklisted by hospital?,michaelm7001,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rgihe3/been_blacklisted_by_hospital/,"Best hospital in my large city. Most of the best doctors are affiliated here. I've experienced excellent medical care, but...

I had a mishap happen by an intern which damaged my health permanently. I told the doctor overseeing her but no one else knows. I was not litigious and didn't cause trouble but he got very defensive anyway and stopped seeing me.

Problem is when I went to other docs, they were happy at first to help until they found out this previous doc was affiliated with the same hospital. Then for political and liability issues they decline to help me. So, I now have access to only 10% of docs in the areas.

Also, my health is not good and ER visits happen occasionally. I can go to other hospitals with no worries but the care is not as good for specialized conditions like mine and can mean the difference between life and death in such cases. I want to go to the main hospital but the first thing an ER doc will do is pull up my history records. I am afraid they will placate and dismiss me even in serious situation to avoid liability, if possible. You wouldn't think so, but I've seen some pretty disturbing things behind the scenes and some ER docs have surprisingly warned me of such telling me, 'You will be hard pressed to find a doctor willing to help do to potential liability, even in emergencies.' I am being blacklisted by the hospital and doctors for an intern's mistake. Not fair, but just wondering what to do.

For ER situations should I go to the main hospital and risk being blacklisted for the chance of optimal care or choose the smaller ones for welcome but less able care?"
rgilv3,3,2021-12-14,Has anyone here transitioned from science to cybersecurity/pentesting,Practical_Boss9258,cybersecurity,https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/rgilv3/has_anyone_here_transitioned_from_science_to/,"Hey everyone! I know that the general question of how to get into cybersecurity has popped up in the thread bazillion times but I wanted to narrow it down and ask you something more specific.

To tell a bit about myself: I am graduating with a BSS degree next year. My studies are interdisciplinary and although I mainly study neuroscience and psychology, I also had a course dedicated to Python and I am going to take Machine Learning next semester. My (relevant) job experiences so far include working as clinical researcher and I also did an internship in forensics and criminal psychology, in which we basically interrogated people using a polygraph, who were accused of theft, blackmailing, corruption, etc. I found out pretty late that I am passionate about pursuing a career in cybersecurity and more specifically, I am interested in the more offensive side of cybersecurity or working in the so-called 'red teams'. 

Initially, I was considering doing a second degree but after I gave it some thought, I realized that would be a financial and temporal suicide and by the time I finish it, I would be approaching my thirties and my brain would also become substantially fried after 10 years in academia. Afterwards, I started browsing through MS degrees in different countries to see what the admission requirements. Nearly all of them demanded an IT degree and the few programs that made an exception for that were looking for highly motivated students with some prior experience. In this regard, I wanted to ask: Has anyone transitioned from being a scientist to working into cybersecurity and if yes, how did it happen? I am really curious if any one of you got accepted in a IS/Cybersecurity MS with a partially or even totally different BS degree.

I know that it is widely propagated that you don't need to have a degree to work in Cybersecurity, yet all of the job offers that I looked at require not only a degree but also most of them want prior job experience in the field for at least 1 year. Realistically, I don't think it´s very doable unless you have some connections or unless you are abnormally good at what you do. I don´t think that applying for a MS in Cybersecurity is a fix-all solution and will get you all the skills but it seems to me that it would add a great amount of credibility to your future job application(s) and give you an opportunity to gain experience by offering you an internship. Working jobs for which you need to be highly qualified in Western Europe without a degree is a straight-up utopian idea and I am highly skeptical about achieving this, even with certifications like CEH, OSCP, and participation in CTF competitions. You have the full right to correct me if you think I am wrong because my perception is highly shaped by the place that I live in. I would greatly appreciate your input and support since all of my friends and family are highly skeptical about this idea but it is indeed something that I really want to do."

I graduated with no internships, because I did doubt my programming abilities in college and felt like I wouldn’t be of much value. 

Getting that little backstory out the way, I’ve been following this subreddit for a while and like many others, I’ve been constantly applying to jobs. While at the same time taking courses on Udemy to strengthen my programming skills. I’ve built multiple projects to work on my front-end skills as well as my back-end skills such as developing API’s and responsive front-end websites. I also created my own portfolio from scratch which has links to my live-hosted projects.

It has been a long journey and there were countless times I did doubt myself and feel like maybe this career path wasn’t for me. But I know myself and through my determination and perseverance, I kept ongoing. Kept taking courses and even got my certification with AWS cloud practitioner just cause why not. I did try my best to keep at it but you have to remember to take care of yourself and give yourself a break at times.
After sending out 700+ applications I’m thankful to say I got an offer today to be a software engineer in the city I wanted to work in! 

Also if you’re wondering. I’ve been living off the money I’ve saved up from my part-times in college as well as the unemployment money. So I’ve been unemployed this whole time, putting all my effort into getting a job. I’m so grateful it paid off and lucky it did because I was dwindling in funds and repayment of student loans was right around the corner.

If you’re in the same boat just know that if you keep at it and stay determined you’ll eventually get there. I wish you guys luck I really do. It’s incredibly hard to get that first job but keep at it."

I'm a junior in college studying math and computer science and I'm looking for some advice. 

&amp;#x200B;

I eventually want to end up at a quant firm/HF in a research role. I made it a few rounds into the process at two for trading but eventually got cut - I'm not great under pressure and it definitely showed. I recently accepted a summer internship offer from Morgan Stanley as a quant in risk management. I chose MS over a data science offer in the Bay and research at my school for a few reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The offer had a pretty quick deadline, and I eventually want to work at a smaller quant HF, both of which pushed me towards a finance internship this summer.
2. The program seemed interesting - in my interviews, I was told that there was a chance I would be allowed to work on their ML models because of my prior research experience in the field.
3. Prestige factor - the program is primarily for MS students, and I'm a sucker for things that make me feel advanced.
4. An older relative of mine who was pretty senior at another BB told me that risk analysis is a valuable skill-set to learn if I want to do trading.

However, I have a few worries. First, reading what people say on here about front vs. middle office, I am worried that it might be hard for me to move out of risk management. Second, I'm worried that quant risk management won't be as quantitative as I had hoped. Third, I am worried that I will have to work more hours a week than I was told in recruiting (40/wk limit). Can anyone speak to the validity of these fears? I would really appreciate some advice from someone who's been in a similar position or who has experience in the area."

I am a recent graduate with masters in CS. Right now I have two offers in London:

1. (Full Time) ML Engineer at FAANG, 80K base + 35K stocks + 10% bonus = 125k
2. (Intern) Quant Researcher at a big bank, 6K per month for 6 months with a high probability of getting a full time offer. I don't know about the exact salary for the full time offer.

I am inclined to take the bank offer since I already have one internship in FAANG and I wanna try quant finance. However, if I take the bank it means that first I need to do this internship and I don't have any idea about the TC if I get the full time offer.

What do you suggest?"

**Letters of Rec:**

* My Algebra II teacher and AP Psych teacher; he’s really nice. We’ve talked a lot personally and he knows me both as a student and person. Super candid, super chill, really amazing guy. Knows about my difficult home situation (abusive stuff, got kicked out once too) and has supported me through all of that. Gives me way too much credit and I dunno what he sees in me but it’s all good things! Said I was “one in a million,” and that “a lot of people with home situations like mine turn bitter but I’m proof that it doesn’t have to be that way,” among some other really nice things! I always had my camera on in his class when we went virtual and he said he’d write that in my letter haha-- also said that he’d make sure I get in wherever I want to go :D (9/10)
* Brit Lit teacher; shes amazing and super sweet. Had a lot of fun in her class although she doesn’t know me as personally because this was a virtual year. Wrote charismatic essays in her class (one was about Pride and Prejudice and Fanfiction, I submitted this as my Williams supplement lol). Candid as well, I’m sure she wrote something nice although I think I could’ve been more expressive. (6/10)
* My guidance counselor is an angel. She’s helped me through some really tough times and knows me almost better than I do; really cares about me which I appreciate a lot. She had to write a lot of letters so I dunno how good this one was but I don’t doubt that it was good things. Feel like she might’ve mentioned that I’m a little neurotic though hahaha she always tells me I am (affectionately)! (6/10)

**Interviews:**

* N/A, withdrew all my apps to schools I did interviews for (got interviews for Emory and Northwestern, though--also did interviews at Wooster, Reed, Carleton, a few others which I don't remember).

**Essays:**

* Started my personal statement at the end of May. Wrote at least 5 different drafts before settling on the topic I chose. I’ve linked it below so you can read it for yourself (I’ve already committed and my essay is shared with a bunch of people already haha--nothing to hide).
* I wrote about my cat and how I’ve grown through her eyes. I think I was witty and never took myself too seriously while also being genuine. Some parts were clunky, but overall I did well. I worried a lot about sounding bitter and I really tried to avoid that, not sure how successfully I did that but whatever!
* Happy with my JHU supplemental too (kinda... cringeworthy but hey that's me). Other supps were average, honestly. Just kinda wrote from the heart. They weren’t bad but they weren’t revolutionary.
* [LINKED HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQEauWft1RnjbPUdluLcy8UpFbsPzNx0C39CUbob_oW4WpYvU-ZQ6vh2lhjPnsoGSQuLb-UQ1A7bXIf/pub)

**Additional Information:**

* Explained my research and stuff a lot here; also explained my role as a marketing/data analytics/scriptwriting intern because that needed clarification.
* Explained my family circumstances very genuinely; abusive parents, mom has mental health issues, brother is autistic--how I’ve changed and grown from this experience, mostly, in a positive standpoint emphasizing my resilience over how I've struggled."
rgled0,2,2021-12-14,Does leaving mg job at the end of my probationary period make me look bad to future employers?,[deleted],careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/rgled0/does_leaving_mg_job_at_the_end_of_my_probationary/,"I just got out of college with my degree in social work. I wanted to do Geriatric Social Work, but I did not have the experience. The best I could find was an RA job. However, it is mostly nursing and that is not want I wanted to do. I've also heard it is extremely difficult to get into any specialized social work field if you don't want to work for CPS which is what I don't want to do. My minor was English. Due to the difficulty in getting to Geriatric Social Work and a bunch of depressing life events, I want my Master's to focus on employment with academic libraries. 

On my resume, I do have 3 months of private care to an elderly client already. Of course, that is not in a facility. My internship was also heavily focused on program planning and implementation for 3 months for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. 

If I stay at my current job for my 90 day probationary period, I will have 6 months working with vulnerable populations at least.  There are activity assistant jobs open at other facilities right now, which is actually what I was looking for at my current employer, but they said they could only offer for an RA position for the experience.

My question is:

If I decide not to stay at my current employer at the end of my probationary period, will that look bad to employers? 

Does saying ""After completing my probationary period, I did not feel the job was going to be relevant to my degree components.""

I also don't want to stay at my current employer because they understated what I could expect. I feel they falsely advertised and misled me. They were very quick to hire me and apparently have a high turnover rate."
rgm4nj,2,2021-12-14,A decade ago a professor discriminated against several of us students and he got caught and asked to leave - now a decade later they named an award after him. What should we do?,Professor_Problem,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rgm4nj/a_decade_ago_a_professor_discriminated_against/,"Hi all.  This is an extremely long story.  I'm going to TLDR the top background section and then put a line break where I tell you the current issue at hand.  I have the question I need advice on at the bottom of the page.  

Backstory TLDR: Professor graded the girl students more than twice as harshly as the guy students but got caught and retired in shame.  He nearly cost us our degrees and jobs we had lined up in the process.  We exposed him and got our grades fixed.  

----

I went to my local state college.  It wound up being a great thing because they specialized in a type of engineering that's not common and it turns out to be one of my passions.   

I was an A/B student.  All but for this one professor.  In my type of engineering there were only 6 female students including me out of nearly a hundred.  5 of us had the same internship schedule and due to the class schedules we wound up in a lot of the same 30 person small classes.  

This professor was rough.  He did most of his work in research and treated us all like idiots.   He would go over things quickly and not explain anything asked by a student.  

He taught a large auditorium class when I was a sophomore and we all scraped by.  One of the girls I was in class with had a perfect A average and she voiced that she barely kept it with him.  I made it out of there with a C+.  

The last year we had him for another class that was only 30 people.  We only had midterm, a test a few weeks after that, a project due two weeks before finals, and a final, with each exam being 3 questions with many parts that built on itself.  

At the mid term none of us girls did good.  We noticed that the grades we got seemed very harsh compared to the mistakes we made.  We started to ask questions and he told us all to hand the papers back in.   He didn't let us keep our midterms that were graded.  Note we were more than halfway through the class before we had any idea what our grades looked like so we couldn't drop the class anymore and even if we wanted to we needed it to graduate that semester.  

Several of us (guys and girls) talked after class and some of the guys said they made the same mistakes we did but he only counted off half the point we got graded off.   

The next exam we had a huge study group and prepared.  The one girl I mentioned before that kept a perfect A average led the study group and taught everyone the material.  We felt ready.  

We also made a plan to get pictures of our exams when they came back to see if he was really grading us differently.  

The exam sucked but we did it and moved on.  We didn't get this back for quite a while.   In the meantime the project came up.  We were working on a 3d modeling of heat transfer through a metal bar.  I was going to be absent the day it was supposed to be turned in so I requested office hours to review my project with him and turn it in early.  

He reviewed my project results and report.  He told me it looked good and that he had no notes.  This is important.  It was a week before the project was due and he told me to go ahead and turn it in as is.   I did - like an idiot.  

I'm absent the Monday they were due and return Wednesday.  He had already graded my project since mine was in a week early.  C+ with red ink all over it.   He asked if I would have time to discuss after lecture and I agreed.  

After class he told me *my project was the best he's ever seen* and he wanted the Matlab file I used to model it so he could show future students some tricks.  I spent so long on that project.  Many sleepless nights.  And he told me it was the best he's seen ***and he gave me a C+***!  I got angry and shouted that if it was a great project then why did he give me a C?  The doors were open so some people poked their heads in the see why someone was yelling and he grabbed his bag to leave.  He got closer to not talk loudly and said that I was trying to intimidate him and bribe him for a better grade with my project file and he'd report me.  I told him let's go on down and chat if he thinks this is bribery that ***he*** wanted my file even though he gave me a low grade.  

He left and never commented on it again.  I did have mistakes in my file so I couldn't really argue the grade too far but the mistakes were stupid ones like dropping a minus sign early on and he deducted points at every wrong calculation for the rest of the project.  I wouldn't have been mad about it if (1) he didn't tell me how great it was otherwise and (2) if he hadn't told me to turn it in a week early because he said it was good.   

Anyways the next week our previous exam finally comes back.  This is the last week of classes before finals week.  Again the girls all do worse that the guys but we had prepped for it.  One guy in front was intentionally asking him a lot of stupid questions about his exam to keep his attention so the rest of us could take photos of our exams to compare the points he took off the girls vs guys.   

For every mistake he counted 2 points off the guys.   He counted 5 points off the girls.  We took photos of it (smart phones were rather new but it was already common to have one).  He eventually told the guy keeping him distracted to shut up and told us to hand the exams back in because he wasn't taking more questions.  After class while I was leaving he also made a passive aggressive comment to me about doing better next time.  

With the bad first exam, bad second exam, and bad project I had to get a B to pass the class.  Let me be clear that had I only been counted off 2 points per mark like the guys had been I would have been at a B+ in the class.  Instead I was on the edge of a C-.  

My college had a weird loophole that sunk many students.   A grade of a C is needed in your core classes.  Any class you got a D+ in you could retake.  If you had a C- you were in limbo.   You had to get professors to sign off to ***allow*** you to retake it and many professors used that to get rid of students they didn't like.  It meant you couldn't graduate with your major.  I was in my final semester and already had a job lined up so I needed this major.  

If I didn't get a great grade on the final then I was screwed.   The girls and some of the guys had a meeting where we discussed what to do with the evidence we had on him.  The guys were pissed on our behalf, some from wanting fairness and some from being grateful for the one girl tutoring all of us.  

We decided to go talk to the Deen and the straight A girl would go into his office and we would be outside for support and to be called in as needed.  Action was swift even though they didn't talk to us long.  Out of the roughly 30 person class, 10 of us were there to complain about his mistreatment.  

I was only asked a series of questions that they had started asking us individually and told to go after though I did ask go add my experience with my project.  Luckily my project I still had the real copy of.  He had been using the excuse that he wouldn't let us keep exams so we wouldn't put copies of it online so he couldn't repeat that excuse for the projects.  I gave them my project and it was handed off to another professor for that subject.  He later told me that my project was great and he would have only counted off 5 points for the sign error because a professor had missed it on office hours.  

A true investigation started but we still had him for our final exam which was the first day of finals week.  He was very upset but wouldn't say why.  Exams were face down and we each took a seat and flipped the sheets over when he said to start.  

The questions weren't even about things we learned in class.   

I flipped to the second page for the next question and again I had no idea how to even start it.  The 3rd was the same way.   

I actually sat back and looked up and around the room and saw my classmates doing the same.  All of us knew we had no chance at this.  There was no way we could do this exam because none of us even knew how to start the questions.  

To be honest I just started crying here because I was sure I wasn't going to pass the class even though I would have if I was treated fairly.  I really thought I wasn't going to be graduating.  

I started writing out assumptions on the exam (there were so many unprovided details where the problems couldn't be solved so I started stating assumptions to have something to work with).   With my assumptions the problems were doable but I had no idea if that was even going to be allowed.  I finished all 3 but I thought I was going to get a zero.  I spent 10 minutes reviewing everything to make sure there were no errors.  I turned it in right at the end.  

I honestly lost it that night and really was in a bad place.  I was asked the next day to come visit the professor that had checked out my project.  I had a final that morning but went to see him afterwards.    He told me that my project couldn't be regraded because it was at the liberty of the class professor and I technically did have each of those steps wrong even though it was from a mistake in an early step.  However the professor was being taken out of that class and all his collected exams had been turned in for him (good professor I was talking to) to regrade.  He had called me in to receive my first two exams which he graded (in just a few days!) and my grade was up from D and C to a B and A.  That with the C+ project put me solidly in B zone.  As long as I didn't fail the final I was golden.  He then told me he was going to be grading the finals but that it would be after he graded his own class.  Spoiler alert - the exam turned out to be impossible and he wanted to ""see what we would do"" so the final was dropped from our grade. 

I talked to the other girls and that professor had similar talks with them that day or the next.  Turns out we were right that he did this to every girl in his classes.  

We never got an official word back about our complaints - just discussion with that professor.  However we did get told later that our professor would be retiring that year.  I got a B+ in the class.  

The straight A girl got an A- in her class which broke her streak and was the only A- she ever got.  That project grade brought her down from her exam grades.   She was our valedictorian. 

Since he was gone and they were going back to review his classes we all decided we wouldn't push it further.  We didn't want a big media story we just wanted our fair grades.  

-----

***NOW TO THE CURRENT PROBLEM***

I'm now a lot more self-confident and in my 30s.  I'm a subject matter expert for my company and am highly regarded in my field. 

 I was telling this story to a coworker recently, and he asked what the professor's name was.  I blanked for a moment then remembered and he said that name sounded familiar.  Later that night I got curious and Googled him to make sure I had the name right.  

I did.   And I saw that the college of engineering at my school named a fellowship award after him last year.  He didn't come back to teach but they were still honoring him as a beloved faculty member from years past.  

I'm furious.  

I sometimes keep in contact with one of the girls from school.  We chatted and we're torn on what to do.  From looking at faculty pages a lot of the people we went to with out complaints those years ago are no longer working there.  We think he likely got told to retire and they wouldn't release the info - so no one there now likely knows what he did.  

We're all on our fields now and he hasn't hurt anyone in roughly a decade (that we know of).  I couldn't find record of him teaching anywhere else.  

It is very hard to be a woman in engineering in the fields we wound up in.  You get a reputation if you speak out about somethings.  I luckily have worked for good companies that handled my complaints well (I've been grabbed, been told directly how many people want to see me naked, etc) and so my reputation hasn't taken any hit from my complaints.   

I am worried about making a stink on this.  If it gets to media my name will likely get out there.  If you have a reputation for sexual harassment complaints you get overlooked in this industry - valid complaints or no.  So far I haven't had the repercussions of it.  

But I seriously think my career would be in jeopardy in the future if it got out that I complained about this a decade after he no longer hurt me.   

-----

***SO NOW THE QUESTION***

Should I let it go?  He's a professor that ***did*** progress his field a lot and did make a lot of contributions.  He's just also a sexist pig.

rgn0dz,3,2021-12-14,Is This Normal?,Gemsteel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rgn0dz/is_this_normal/,"I get I may be shooting too high, but I filled out some help desk (tier 1) applications. I heard back from one company, so they asked for a personality assessment and schedule an interview. I did both. The invite was yesterday and the only interview available was today. So I scheduled. Got an email today from the same company asking again for the same thing. I filled it out again. Got an interview confirmed email.

I leave home at 2:15 for interview and arrive onsite for interview at 2:31. Interview went ok, but they will likely pass. I get home at 3:30. I check my email to see a new email sent at 2:23, that the interview was cancelled. 

I'm honestly really hurt, whether the cancellation email was a mistake or intentional. I'm so tired of the interview process. A lot of times, these interviews become you're too skilled, go apply for these types of jobs non-interviews. And then the interviews for web developer/it/help desk, the interviewers just seem incapable of seriously considering me or I just don't have enough skill or anxiety gets the better of me. 

I will never forget the interview I did 3 years ago for an internship. Where the guy asked me what program I used to write code. I answered Visual Studio Code, but I currently trying Sublime and Atom. And the other guy present leaned over and said, ""That's what I use."" Like, what do you think I'm lying about something so simple and straightforward? 

Or the interview where the guy stopped asking questions about whether I could do the job and started interrogating me about my programming skills, why I don't pursue a job in that, and personal hobbies.

If you are an interviewer, please just be straightforward with your interviewee. I don't care to answer personal questions and you are not a goddamn life coach. Be honest and save everyone some time."

I have yet to score an offer before I graduate which is pretty sucky but I’m hopeful I find something soon. 

Anyways, I applied for a job as a financial analyst at a T1 manufacturing company. I’ve been applying to everywhere because I haven’t had luck getting a job

Due to the pandemic my finance internship got cancelled and I wasn’t able to gain experience as an analyst. However, I have banking experience, money managing experience, customer service, leadership, sql, excel, etc. 

I got a call back for an interview. I met the basic job requirements. Now all I have to get through is interviewing. What are some things that can help me stand out? Any analysts out there who can spread a word or two or three?"

I’m graduating this semester with just under a 2.8gpa. For the most part i feel like i know what I’m doing but ik i need more experience. I didn’t do an internship because I was told to wait til i took more upper level classes then the next semester i was told i waited too long(this was last spring). Part of me thinks its just a lack of confidence bc after last semester i felt fine about my coding ability. This semester I am struggling to code some of my assignments in my last CS course(taking it online). I don’t know what to expect from a first job and that is stressing me a bit. I’ve been in toxic work environments (in my previous field) where if you didn’t grasp something the first something the first day they treated you like shit so i am nervous that since I’m not super experienced it will be like that"
rgolga,1,2021-12-14,Should I apply to new jobs?,Corrade1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rgolga/should_i_apply_to_new_jobs/,"Hey everyone, so I applied to a software engineering position back in June and the whole interview and hiring process took about 2 months. During that time the company was hiring one full time developer and two part time interns. I did pretty well on the interview according to my hiring manager but I did not have the expirence that they were looking for, which is totally fine. So I was offered the part time intern position. A bit of background before I continue further. I graduated in June 2020 and was jobless for 6 months until I accepted an offer from a WITCH company. So I obviously took it since an offer is better than no offer. Then after my training I was put onto a project that had no coding besides just copy and pasting some sql scripts where I just had to edit the values. I was trying to get out asap and was applying to places everywhere. So I landed this internship offer and thought it was going to be better than my expirence at WITCH. They said it was only going to be for two months and after that they were going to hire me full time if I perform well during my time. So I thought it was worth the risk. Now my expirence here has been amazing it's been pretty challenging but rewarding at the same time. With that being said it has been three months now and I am still working part time as an intern. They havent told me anything about converting me full time. Should I bring this up or just apply to other jobs and once I get another offer to try to negotiate with my current company. Now I wouldn't mind staying here for a couple years, it's just I'm not working full time nor getting the full time pay of an entry level dev at my company."

I've been given the opportunity to work at a big tech company full-time as an intern. I'm currently a 3rd year student and next year will be my last year. 

My question is, should I defer uni for a year to focus on this job, or should I do uni part-time, or full-time with 2 subjects per term?  

If someone is currently doing this, or has done this, what is/was your experience like? Did you have any free time? How did you feel? 

Cheers."

The treatment of healthcare workers in the US and general burnout and compassion fatigue make me lose all passion that I had in this field. I just got called in by my boss because I'm not current in the online training modules that we have to do to stay on top of our licenses. I know for sure that picking up other healthcare-type jobs won't fix that as I've already tried.

I still care about the patients, but I don't engage any further than making sure that they feel fine overall. No more friendly conversations, less smiles, I only think about getting them to a better place than where they're at. 

I'm just curious if there were any other healthcare workers in a similar situation. I guess I'm only doing the minimum to keep from getting fired. I'm excited to be leaving this field, I look forward to coming home and practicing coding every day, hoping to land an internship while I'm in school so I can leave sooner."

rgsk46,1,2021-12-15,Suggestions for a path for the future?,justonredditnow,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/rgsk46/suggestions_for_a_path_for_the_future/," Hi all, I was hoping to get some help on what I should do in my career.

Background:  Graduated high school in 2014. From 2016 to 2018 I was a Pharmacy  Technician while I got my AA degree in General Studies. I went back to  college in 2018 to get my BSBA in Management with an HR certification. I  graduated in Dec 2020. During 2020 I was a Procurement Intern for local  government for 6 months and a Manager intern for a gym for 6 months.  After months of job hunting I finally got a job in Arizona as an HR  Assistant with Amazon. It was a decent job but the company wasn't for  me. I was there from May to October. I've got something right now as an  account manager but it's not what I want to do.

What  I'm considering: I really enjoyed working in HR and have been looking  for a new role in HR. Have had a few interviews but so far, no luck. I  do plan on trying to get my SHRM next year but that's down the line and  depends on what position I can get in the near future. I've also been  considering making the switch to IT. I have little experience other than  taking an Intro to IT class years ago. I'm pretty tech savvy but I know  that there's a lot behind how things work. I've considered learning on  my own and getting some certifications (A+, Sec+, CCNA) and  transitioning over the next 2-3 years to an IT role. Not really sure  what route to take though. Of course the money is a huge motivator, IT  seems to be a good field to make some good cash. I know there's money in  HR the higher you get but I'm just not sure what route to take at the  moment. I've also considered analyst work but I don't seem to have the  experience for that and have no clue where to even start for that. I  originally wanted to work in Management, hence my degree, but that seems  to be impossible to break into without more experience. I applied to so  many management roles and nothing came from it.

What  I'm looking for: Just some advice someone else wish they received early  in their career. Maybe some info on the careers I've mentioned and how  to break through with more success. Please feel free to ask any  questions and for those who respond to this, thank you in advance."

In need of advice!,CheesecakeHairy8653,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/rgsxwh/college_help_please_in_need_of_advice/,"I’m in a two year tech program for precision ag. Precision ag is a degree dealing with how data is managed and utilized in agriculture to minimize variables in an ag operation. 

I had a very bad first semester of college struggling with balancing school and working up to 60 hours a week along with some mental health issues this landed me on academic probation. I had a phenomenal second semester scoring all As in my required classes but it wasn’t quite good enough to get me off academic probation. Then after some issues with my mental health and communication with the school on an internship I ended up failing not getting academic credit for my work which was 4 credits, and another F on my transcript.

When I met with my advisors who also instruct nearly all the credits required. They helped me develop a plan to get me off academic probation, and they pressured me to “work as hard at school as I do at work” and assured me I should continue on my two year plan to graduate. 

However because of that higher class load to make up classes I’ve failed and a whole new set of mental health issues my grades suffered and now I’m worrying about academic dismissal. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I could possibly work to stay in school? My advisors consistently show that they recognize my effort and voice how I’m a good person to have in the program, but I worry my enrollment will be outside their control. I also can not bring myself to talk about my mental health with the school or get accommodations. I just want to get my degree and push myself to get it as quick as possible but my failures as a student and over estimation of my capabilities keeps me from getting out of the hole I’ve dug. Any advice on steps to take is appreciated."

rgu4gx,54,2021-12-15,2022 Summer Intern hunt as an International Graduate Student,differAnt,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rgu4gx/2022_summer_intern_hunt_as_an_international/,"I am a 24 yr old MS CS student at a top 20 Univ in the US. Prior to my Masters, I had a 1.5 yr stint at a MAGA company as a full-stack developer in India. I wish to share my perspective of the journey of the last 6 months with this amazing community that has helped me so much.

**Background:**  Undergrad from Tier 1 Univ in India in CS.  3 Research papers in AI (2 decent, 1 crap). Leetcode : Over 500 solved, I am pretty good at it and only get stuck at some hard problems. (But to be fair this is my third time preparing for interviews, so very little that I have not seen). System design skills: basic. 

**Motivation**: Money and not doing a job that bores me.

US internship hunt is diametrically opposite to India. Here getting Interviews is harder than cracking it. Whereas I am used to an environment with ridiculously hard questions but assured interview if you get it correct.

**July August:** I started applying in July and almost all the big companies I applied to were with referrals.

**Akuna:** The first OA was from Akuna Capital for C++ and Python roles. Completed the problems and got a call for C++.  C++ was not very strong at that time but somehow I was able to manage the low-level design question in the first round. In the final round, I got high-level design and very deep C++ concepts, flunked in both. I gave a ton of OAs and was able to handle them easily, apart from Akuna, I did not receive any other interview call.

**September October:** I started realizing that Interview calls will not be easy to get even after clearing OAs. So I started applying in en-mass. Applied to around 200 companies during this period.

 **Hudson River Trading** was the only company that decided to give me a chance and the phone screen went very well. After a little research, I understood HRT is fucking goldmine and became very motivated to perform. I ramped up on C++ and System Design for the final round. The final round went ok, I was able to solve the questions but fumbled around in the middle. I got a rejection within 48 hrs.

Apart from HRT only Walmart contacted me and said they will move to the next round soon.

**November:** Most of my peers were getting Amazon and some were sitting with multiple offers. I started feeling a lot of stress. By this time I had applied to nearly 400 companies and 500+ positions. Before Thanksgiving, I got Bloomberg, Lyft, FB, Tiktok interview calls and Walmart finally responded.

Late Nov and Early December: 

I had at least 4 interviews every week, and it was really very hectic.

**Facebook:** Easiest interview, 2 rounds, 2 leetcode mediums each. Got an offer early this week.

**Bloomberg:** Gave me a popular leetcode hard in phone screen and the leetcode tagged system design in the next round. After the second round, they stopped the process because all slots were filled. 

**Lyft:** All three rounds were open-ended system/algo design with CS basic. I enjoyed Lyft interviews the most. Got an offer today.

**Tiktok:** It seems the Tiktok process is very team specific. In my first round, I got 2 math-heavy questions (equivalent to leetcode hard and medium) outside of leetcode. I believe the interviewer was using his discretion. In the 2nd round, I got a hard DP and a medium leetcode. This was followed by a round with the hiring manager, a 20 min chat. Got the offer today.

**Walmart:** After OA there is a take-home assignment open-ended, kind of like a course assignment. They expect you to write clean expressive code with testing and error handling. I canceled the final round with Walmart, scheduled tomorrow given that I would not be accepting the offer anyway.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things I did wrong:

1.  Should have applied even earlier, ppl who applied earlier in June got Amazon by September. I was deep into November without an interview process in hand.
2. Going all-in on Python was not the best idea for HFTs. If I had prepped C++ with time in hand things might have been different.
3. I had 1.5 yrs FTE experience, but in my resume, I dropped the months to make it appear like 2 years. Two different HR told me to specify the months. One even told me they often see this as a red flag.

I write this hoping that you may benefit from my experiences, just like how I benefited from so many of your posts on this forum.

PS: Most companies have NDA regarding questions, so don't ask me for specifics."
rgubp0,6,2021-12-15,How fucked am I at a WITCH (Cognizant),Pleasant-Incident423,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rgubp0/how_fucked_am_i_at_a_witch_cognizant/,"I am starting my first job as a Data Engineer at Cognizant in a month. I was really excited to start my career but I am just now discovering the stigma that Cognizant has as a so-called WITCH. How concerned should I be? I've always had in the back of my mind that if I really hated it, I could switch employers without too much struggle, so hearing that the presence of Cognizant on a resume is a red flag or even a deal breaker is pretty rough. That being said, I know these companies hire many employees from other countries which could be a factor. For some background,  I just graduated with a 3.0 GPA from a larger U.S. university, albeit not one particularly renowned for CS. I had one data science internship my Junior year and little else outside of personal projects in terms of experience, so I was happy to land a job with a big company in my desired field. I'll be working on-site remote at their Plano, TX location.

1. Is there a good chance my experience will be better because I am a U.S. citizen with a degree from an American university? (I'm not saying that makes me more qualified, but it's the reality of our labor market) 
2. How much variance is there among the WITCH companies? Are they all equally trash?
3. How true is the sentiment that a resume with WITCH on it goes straight to the shredder? ie. If I had the same role at a non-tech company, would I be better off? 
4. Say it's not unbearably bad and that I stick it out, what is the upward mobility at companies like this, if any?"
rgudun,0,2021-12-15,I am getting rejected for full-time positions because I am currently pursuing an online master's degree. What should I do?,swishswish82,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rgudun/i_am_getting_rejected_for_fulltime_positions/,"Long story short, I graduated with a Bachelors in Information Technology with a Minor in CS in 2019, but I couldn't get enter the workforce because life. It was more than 1 1/2 years before I got my life together, so at that point i had no chance of getting an entry level position.

I started a Masters program in Computer Science, and I landed an internship this summer. I am applying for internships this summer, but I am low on money and I would really like to get a full-time position.

However, it seems like pursuing a Masters has disqualified me from all the entry level positions - I can't even get into places where I satisfy both their minimum and preferred qualifications (sometimes I exceed both).

I would be more than willing to drop my Masters or take a LOA to pursue a full-time position, make money, and get my career started. Should I not mention my masters and simply keep my internship on it? I am worried that I would still get disqualified because of the big gap I have after undergrad program (at this point it is nearly 2.5 years since graduation).

I am not sure what to do. Does anyone have any recommendations?"

rgvumi,2,2021-12-15,How do you break the cycle of stagnancy and underperforming in life?,ForPOTUS,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rgvumi/how_do_you_break_the_cycle_of_stagnancy_and/,"A bit of info about me:

I am a 30 year old Black male who was born and raised in a Western, English speaking country to a middle class family. I currently live overseas and work remotely as an online teacher and occasional writer. I'm also in the midst of starting up a simple business of my own.

While things could be a lot worse for me in life and I am thankful for what I have, I can't help but realise that I could be doing a lot more with my life and the tools that I have at my disposal. I am not where I want to be as far as income, savings and wealth go. I know that money is everything, but it's a lot. Financial freedom gives you the breathing space and flexibility to do more to change your predicament and deal with uncertainty.

I have displayed some of the traits one needs to become more financially successful in the past. I was considered a special needs (it was thought that I had learning disabilities and struggled to cope well with adversity or negative emotions) student for almost half of my time at elementary school and I managed to eventually work through that. I went to one of the worst middle schools in my country, but ended up growing from a middling, underachieving student to a top performer by the time I hit high school. To the point that I ended up attending and graduating from one of the best, most competitive universities in the world (typically top 10).

But, upon graduation it seemed as if I got a rude awakening from the Real World. I spent a few months looking for jobs in my home country, but struggled despite my university background and me possessing what I thought was decent work experience (paid internships in multiple countries and industries). I struggled a bit with the rejection, but struggled even more with the overall job seeking process, which I found tiring, demeaning and at times, unproductive. I did graduate during a relatively difficult year for the economy (2013), so that didn't help, as I knew of peers who spent close to a year looking for jobs during that same period.

After a few months, I eventually decided to pursue English teaching in China. It made sense, I had traveled and worked there before and could speak the language a little. From there, things began to look up. Even though my initial job there wasn't the best in terms of pay and status, I was kept busy, and within six months, I ended up leaving in order to take on a better paying, more interesting job at an international school as an economics teacher in a bigger city.

Things were going well from that point onwards, but I quickly grew bored. I don't hate teaching, but it's not my preferred career choice - I can't see myself doing it for the remainder of my professional life. So I quit the job for a mini-break which I filled with studying Chinese as a full-time student for a semester.

Fast forward five years later, and I have taken on a bunch of jobs (both teaching and non-teaching), with many of them ending up with me eventually getting fired. Usually as a result of perceived insubordination, disagreements, or me simply not being up to the job at the time.

And here I am, back to first paragraph. I have done a few worthwhile things since then, I have become a paid columnist and professional video editor, a decent video essayist with online video essays that have managed to gain decent traction (generating an average of 10,000 views on a YouTube channel with 2,000 subscribers). I have traveled and currently live as a digital slomad.

But for some reason, I think that I could be doing much better, I could be getting a lot more mileage out of this car, but I'm not. I think that this is mainly as a result of two reasons: the first one being that I am not persistent enough. I don't stick to my pursuits long enough, and usually give up soon after results begin to stagnate. Secondly, I'm not the best when it comes to maintaining and fostering relationships with others. While I am not necessarily introverted, people tire me out, tend to be unreliable, and usually end up taking more from me compared to what they give (in terms of emotional energy, attention, care, advice, favours, overall help). I think that this has led to my wider network being very disperse and shallow as a result.

I guess that I am writing this to get some feedback on the turn-offs that you as a reader may get from me. You know, the points of improvement, however harsh and blunt it may be, please give it to me."

\- International Student from an okay-ish uni (3.77 GPA)

\- Major: Chemical Engineering

\- Minor: Computational Mathematics

\- Did 1 summer internship at a pharmaceutical company, which was mostly wet lab work and a little analytical chemistry

\- Have been working under a prof at my uni's dept. of biotech, doing computational drug discovery, for the past six months

\- Well versed with Python, R, Bash, PyMOL, Autodock; although didn't have the opportunity to take too many CS or Bio classes, and most of these skills stem from research experience.

\- I'd have a LoR from my project advisor, and one each from the dept. of ChemE and dept. of Math.

I was looking to apply to: Northeastern, Boston, UIC, UMich, JHU (biomedical with a genomics concentration), and UT Dallas.

I am currently enrolled (sophomore) at mid-tier university (if even that) and I am not satisfied with it academically. I am not a clout chaser but I had the scores/grades for much better universities I could not attend for various external factors. Along with less internship opportunities due to a low-level school I also do not have much time on my hands due to being an contracted ROTC cadet, which further cripples my internship opportunities and prevents me from getting a Summer internship my junior year (due to a month long training scheduled). It also prevents me from transferring to other better universities because my scholarship is linked to my school.

What I am debating is whether or not after I graduate and commission I get a masters degree from a better university like UF. I will commission into the reserves so half my masters degree would be paid for by the military and I am hoping that continuing my education will allow me to continue to apply for internships while also attaining a more valuable degree.

My fear is that once I graduate with my bachelors I will not have an attractive diploma (school wise) or any experience to allow me to land a full time job and that going for my masters might help me avoid both these problems.

Does anyone have any thoughts or advice on this?  Is my understanding of the internship process and it’s valuable ness misconstrued?

Edit: I believe I should mention that I do have some personal projects I am working on to buff up my portfolio, but again, my time to work on anything large is limited between all my obligations."

I have a BSc in Computer Science, and I want to polish my portfolio even more and apply for remote jobs.

I was wondering, do companies / startups abroad accept employees from developing countries? And is it possible to get internships / junior level jobs?"

rh9zhg,74,2021-12-15,An Average Girl in STEM Gets Accepted to Her Dream School (try to guess),ExcellentMention4114,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/rh9zhg/an_average_girl_in_stem_gets_accepted_to_her/," I wasn't going to make one of these, but it seems like it may help someone later on. Cuz I know I got excited when I saw someone with similar stats as me lol. 

Also, I said I was average and that completely holds true relative to the schools on my list. I'm not necessarily saying that my stats are average overall so just know that before you yell at me (and then you can).

Also, lets see if you can guess my dream school before reading the end lol. People diss the location a lot but the whole campus gives Harry Potter vibes which I'm in love with.

**Demographics**

* Gender: Female
* Race/Ethnicity: White, Hispanic (Europe and Central America)
* Residence: Rural Ohio

**Intended Major(s)**: Physics (i know)

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.93 UW
* Rank (or percentile): 6/120  And before you say anything my school does not weight ranks. So our valedictorian has taken 0 AP/IB/Advanced courses and has a 4.0.
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: AP Bio(4). I'm taking every AP available at my school (3). CCP Comp I and II, CCP Trig, CCP World History, CCP Music

**Standardized Testing**

*List all extracurricular involvements, including leadership roles, time commitments, major achievements, etc.*

I'll list these exactly as it was on the common App

1. Non-Profit Org. - Director of Management/Financials, Admissions Dean - I work with other highschoolers to create international, online summer programs like Youth in Physics, which had a successful first run in 2021. - 11-12th grade all year

3. Coding (With SQL, Python, and UI) - Independent - I apply myself to my different projects involving these languages (e.g. simulators, or ""graphers"") using online classes and Visual Studio. - 10th, 11th, 12th grade all year
4. Mathnasium - Math Instructor (Paid) - I work at a Mathnasium center, tutoring around 3-4 kids at a time and creating unique lesson plans based on their performance. - 11/12th grade all year
5. Modern Language Club - French President - A combined club of the French and Spanish group, I devise, organize, and conduct French and Spanish related activities for the school and education. - All of highs cool during the year
6. School Mentoring Program - Mentor - As a student mentor, I engaged with my at-risk middle school ""mentee"" once a week. We have weekly tasks, and also play games and just talk - 10, 11, 12th during school year
7. Kent State Science Experience - Intern w/Data Professor - I assisted virtually with Kent State University's data professor and his students for an academic term, working on a study on COVID19 mental health (to be clear I didn't ""author"" this study, just worked on compiling and evaluating data for said study) - 11th grade

8. National Student Leadership Conference - Attendant - I attended a summer leadership program   
at American University, focusing on Aerospace. I initiated group projects and learned about the   
field of work. - 12th grade

also by learning online. I earned highschool art credit by playing and improving. - 10,11,12th

designed a budgeted park with my team, and learned about Ohio government as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Awards/Honors**

*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*

1. College Board National Hispanic Recognition Award
2. National Merit Commended Scholar
3. College Board National Rural and Small Town Recognition Award
4. Academic Letter (4 years)
5. Student of the Month (September)(School-wide)(1st month of the school year flex)

**Letters of Recommendation**

I submitted three letters:

AP Bio/Regular Bio Teacher: 8/10 - She knew me very well having me for two classes, and she was very invested in my decision lol. I did get to read the letter, the only thing was she talked a lot about my ECs without really adding anything otherwise specified in my application.

Modern STEM Teacher (it's a class): 9/10 - Also had me in middle school and 2 yrs of high school, in a very small class. So he got to know me as a leader in-class and as a person as I would talk to him about my plans for the future and stuff. He also saw all my projects I did outside of school for fun, and seemed impressed idk, and I know he spoke about that. 

AP Calc/Geometry/Algebra Teacher - 9/10 - Had me three years and I always visited when I could. He wrote me a recommendation before and I got to read it and it made me cry so... And that was 2 years ago too. If I could have read it I would have given a 10/10 but I'm playing it safe with a 9.

**Interviews**

7/10: My interview was with an alumni and non-evaluative (that gave away the school I bet). It was only 25 minutes but we were both from rural Ohio and she was really nice. Pretty average.

**Essays: 7.5/10**

My essay was about how reading helped me to manage my ADHD and brought me closer to people. I started out with very vivid imagery all about books/libraries, and moved on to how reading developed me into who I am today. I thought it was average but given my ""lower tier"" ECs and course load it must have been good for them to accept me.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* *AND THE WINNER IS....* Cornell University (ED)!!
* Ohio State University (EA)

&amp;#x200B;

I do not have an aid package yet, but my EFC was around $5,000 so hopefully it stays around there :)

I'm so excited, I remember telling my principal and all my teachers Freshman year I wanted to go to so-and-so college...I was so happy to finally be able to visit last summer after seeing all the pictures online. And more importantly I CANNOT wait for the competitive yet supportive environment it has. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Additional Information:**

I was able to get a free college advisor for the year which has been a huge help during the application process for both the school and financial aid. She's amazing.

I also want to stress with this that no matter what your background is, where you go to school, your environment, opportunity can be found everywhere. The things that I did, while not astronomically amazing, came from hours of searching and applying. I always dissed my own school because there's literally 3 AP classes and 3 clubs, but I'm grateful I'm there for the small-school environment and now see that there is still plenty to do outside of school organizations.

And finally, I want to say that you can get into your dream school with the resume that you have, not the resume you think colleges want to see. Two of my listed ECs were mostly hobbies, but it worked out anyway! My personal statement wasn't about winning a big competition or being a huge leader in my community, it was about something I loved and what it showed about me. 

During high school, if you do what feels right at the time, without thinking of college admissions or Admissions Officers, everything will be fine.

rh9zt7,1,2021-12-15,SWE Internships as a CS Minor,Period5,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rh9zt7/swe_internships_as_a_cs_minor/,"Hello! I’m currently looking for a SWE Internship (probably a million of these posts on this sub) with no luck having applied to 100+ jobs and a total of one interview. A little bit of background is I am in my last year from a non target university in the US. I was originally an accounting major but started taking computer science courses last year and loved it . Eventually I decided to add a minor in CS and pursue a masters degree in CS next year full time in a one year program in which I am in the process of applying but have not heard back from any university quite yet. 

When applying, I state on my cover letter that I am a prospective MS in CS student, although I am well aware that should not be the only aspect to warrant an interview. I currently have one project in Java that was written when I watched youtube videos on Java and is fairly poorly written code but a very large project as well as a website portfolio. 

My question to you, is should I hold off on applying to more internships until I have accepted and decided where I am going to complete my masters degree? Should I complete more projects or expand my tech stack (my tech stack is limited to Java, Python, C++ and SQL)? Is there any unpaid or smaller jobs that any of you have encountered such as data analytics internships or unpaid SWE internships? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

rhbaov,4,2021-12-15,"Does Google allow moving summer internship to off-season, or a very late start date?",ItsBOOM,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rhbaov/does_google_allow_moving_summer_internship_to/,"In the three months after I applied to Google but before they contacted me, I accepted an offer at Amazon for this summer and I won't be reneging, I am happy with the offer. Google then contacted me for the coding test, which I completed about a week ago. I just received a candidate questionnaire/project matching form which apparently is an indication I will get invited to an interview, from my limited research.

The thing is, since I know I won't renege Amazon, I don't want to waste my time and theirs if there is no way the internship could either be moved to off season (fall, winter, even spring) or just such a late summer start (late August) it would essentially be Fall. At the same time, I'd love to get the opportunity to intern at Google which is why I am even bothering. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I contact the recruiter with my concerns now or wait? Any past similar experiences?"

I'm 26 and based in Toronto, Canada. I just graduated with a masters in International Commerce , and came out of an internship in corporate comms and PR (long story).

I've been grinding out applications to different jobs for months now and finally I've gotten a couple bites.

They're both very similar and will be three days from home, two at the office. One is an Inside Product Specialist role with Dell and it would take me through their sales academy first (I've seen some other posts on here about it, read lots of good things). Base is 66k. Office is midtown, not a really great location....nothing to do and very little social life. People there are much older and kind of dull.

The other is an Account Manager role with Meltwater. I have more interest in the industry it operates in. The office is in a great location downtown, from all my interactions so far the work culture seems more fun and generally has a younger vibe. We're still negotiating salary but they've straight up told me the most they can give me is a 60k base.

They're both bilingual jobs and showed lots of interest in me since they're both super desperate for French speakers. Not really sure what to go with here. Family and friends say Dell because it's a bigger name, slightly better pay and more in-depth training; part of me still wants to go with Meltwater for the reasons listed.

Not sure if the answer is obvious and I'm just missing something here. Thoughts?"

rhdgvr,24,2021-12-15,Leetcode - is it primarily for new developers?,murmur333,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rhdgvr/leetcode_is_it_primarily_for_new_developers/,"I have over 20 years experience with software development. ""Back in my day"" there wasn't leetcode and we wrote our code for interviews on whiteboards during interviews. That being said, I checked out leetcode problems as this is a new concept to me. Job progression has 100% been word of mouth references for the last couple decades so having to write tons of brain teaser code for interviews hasn't been a thing lately.

Regarding leetcode, even the hard problems seem to be what was commonly covered in my comp sci courses back in the day about 25 years ago. Some data structures, sorting, O notation measurements on efficiency, etc.  Pretty much the same as some of my interview questions with Microsoft in the mid-1990s for intern positions: sort a linked list under certain conditions, etc.

Purely out of curiosity, is leetcode primarily focused on new graduates to prove they've absorbed basic comp sci concepts? Or is there more to it than that which I am missing that would apply to experienced developers?"

I have been interning full-time the past summer at company A and part-time in the fall for the same company. I am scheduled to work part-time for them in the spring and already have my CPT approved. I will graduate in spring 2022.

My boss from company A just told me that he doesn’t know yet whether he will have the budget to hire me full-time in May. On the other hand, I have found company B which wants to hire me part-time for the spring.

Company B is way better than company A, has more interesting work, and there is no doubt that they have the budget to convert me to full time. I see myself working long-term for company B but not for company A.

Should I renege on my spring internship? I don’t care about getting banned from careerbuzz/career fairs but I care if GaTech does not validate my CPT with company B.

- Any comments would be much appreciated.

1) Visa (Hybrid)

- 88k (&amp; 5+% bonus, better 401k, 7.3k relocation)

  - Would need to relocate to MCOL and pay rent (1.2-1.8k/mo, and be tied to a lease)

- Brand name company to some extent, would be in tech city for other jobs, and could network a bit

- Hybrid (3 day office, 2 day WFH)

- .net Framework 3.5, Visual Studio 2015 (pretty old)

- Web Forms, React, and Angular (not sure how much of which I'll work on)

- fixing security issues, not sure how much new dev, but they said there is some (they won't tell me much)

- After 2 to 3 years, can be promoted to a Java team (but that's a long time to be there).

2) Pearson (Remote)

- 80k

- Remote (dev team is all remote now, but would still be harder to get mentorship I'd imagine)
  
  - (wouldn't have to pay rent as I'll just live with parents)

  - Might have to put more effort into self-learning (more stress, less time to LC/projects), have to teach myself things more, be blocked more for mentorship, less ability to network.

- More modern tech: .Net Core, moving everything to .Net 6 this year, one .net Framework legacy app

- Azure, Kubernetes (hosting various services), SQL + Cosmos DB, Angular 10 front end

- About 70% backend, 30% frontend projected work.

- EX Tasks:

 - Replace an old UI (use Angular)

 - Add data validations to imports

 - Build reporting feature.

 - Implement new search feature that allows more complicated searches.

-------
Thoughts in my head:

Tech: 

- I don't want to do C# (.net) stuff in the long run (which both of these are), but I'll make it work for now.

- Ideally want to do more Java+Spring, React, AWS (want to avoid MS, and Angular, in the long run).

Env:

- Would prefer working in-office for mentorship, but don't know if there is much to learn at the Visa job in-person due to old tech stack, red-tape legacy environment.

Tenure:

- Maybe stay 1 year max, and try and find something outside of MS stack (likely Java if possible, or just higher TC/more tech focused company if I improve LC).

- (Will focus on LC. And potentially a Java Spring project for resume, but not sure if I'll have that much time to do that and make something worth looking at, so that might not happen)

Pearson seems better tech-wise (modern .Net, and Azure), but not sure about working remote (not too excited for that).

 - (Did a remote internship, but in-person might have made it easier to get help).

Both jobs have no documentation of APIs (like Swagger), and very little unit tests."

Great pay

Heard some horror stories, but not sure as every team functions differently

In San Diego, also cool

I got hired right out of college(6 months ago) and found I really dislike my current company. 

The codebase is very disorganized, management is not very helpful on career growth, few people my age, paid minimum software engineer salary in a MCOL area, and overall I’m not enjoying working on these products the same way I did in my previous role. I plan to stay at least one year to keep my sign on bonus.

What can I do to prepare for my next role? What can I do to try and make the most of this? How much past the 1 year mark should I stay?

Any advice is welcome as I feel really lost."

First of all, I hate writing software. Front end,back end etc. I hate all of that, so SWE engineering is a no-go for me. 
I love hardware and ALL my electrical engineering classes. Circuit analysis was so easy. Basic electronics, which covers material lots of students struggle with like MOSFETs,amplifiers etc was a very easy A for me. 

I know I want to go into an EE position or just be working close to hardware and writing some low level stuff in C or something along that lines. 

I originally wanted to go into FPGA/RTL design, but unfortunately didn’t pass the only interview I got, and got ghosted by the rest of the companies. 
As it stands, I am probably going to get an EE intern role at a company whose manager sold the company so well to me that I haven’t been more excited to work anywhere. 


So, I’m stuck right now. Besides embedded-systems, what are some EE roles I should be considering? WFH would also be a big plus."

Unofficially, I'm focused on web dev and spent a lot of time practicing coding websites in my off time last year. I'm kind of burnt out of writing code rn and don't want to write more code for a website unless I'm getting paid for it lol. Unfortunately, none of my sites are being hosted rn but for a picture of what I can do - I wrote most of the frontend of a website with angular, angular material, and bootstrap that lets you create roadtrips. Basically a roadtrip has a map (using google maps js api) and lets you interact with the map adding/removing markers which represent stops. The stops then get additional info like title, decription, location. You can also comment on each roadtrip. The site has light mode and dark mode with a toggle button. [Here's a link to the code](https://github.com/IDrumsey/RoadTripsIO) for the website even though it's not finished. So I think my coding ability is average for someone whose never had a job coding. I did an IT internship which doesn't really translate to webdev but it's something. What do you think my chances of getting a decent job after I graduate? Do you think I need an internship or do you think I can just jump right into the field? thx :)"

I'm not completely self-taught as I'm currently taking Computer Science coursework in a postbaccalaureate program at a university, but it isn't a degree-seeking program. I also have a bachelors in biology, but I doubt that'll do anything for me while transitioning. Pretty much every posting I see for internships has the requirement that the applicant is in a bachelors/masters program. Is this a hard requirement? I would assume so at the mid-large companies, but should I apply anyway?"

So the new department get back to me and my interview is rescheduled 3 times. NBD, I’m flexible. I interview for the job on Friday of last week, and I’m given the offer a couple hours later.

My current boss (that has been in the loop during this entire process) offers to match their offer. So both jobs are two ranks above what I am now at this point. Then the other department offers to raise their offer as well. So I’m at two ranks ahead in my current job, and 3 at the potential job.

At this point I think both offers are fair (current job slightly less responsibility than offered job). The new job would likely pay about $10000 more, $8,000 more at minimum.

However, I’m starting to hesitate with the new department. Here’s why:

They asked me to give my notice to my current job without a formal offer in hand. Our employer is large, so there’s a lot of bureaucracy to go through and I know that, but I’m still not comfortable giving notice without a written offer.

When I said I was uncomfortable with that, they told me to wait until I’m given a formal offer, but then give only a week of notice to my current job. This is technically acceptable to my employer but I don’t feel right about it.

Although I heard positive things during the job interview and when I talked individually with the person currently doing this job, a person I became close with during my internship told me about how the boss who would supervise me asked her to come in on the weekend unexpectedly. (Current employee is leaving to attend school).

I feel stupid staying at my current job for less money. But I get along with my boss, and the minor issues I have with my job (low pay, stagnation) have been addressed. I’m also afraid to turn down the new job since I know they put a lot of effort into raising the title of the position.

Words of advice?"

Like I don't know what kind of roles I am qualified/into qualified for, what I think I want, what positions I should apply to, how long anything takes, what I should convey in a cover letter. I have basically no internship experience, I was being super stupid the past two years cause I had a student position and I didn't want to do something new but that role was not related to my field at all. I have literally not worked in a tech position for 4 years. 

Now in the past 6 months, I've realized just how stupid I was because now I have a shiny degree with nothing else to show for it and all the positions I want require at least 2 years experience and have these super long qualifications that make so nervous. It also does not help that I have adhd and cannot for the life of me remember what I've learned in my degree or know that I know what I learned. 

On one hand, I want to be like fuck it and apply to everything I see and hopefully something will stick, but on the other hand I don't wanna apply to things and then make a joke of myself because I'm massively underqualified or like I bomb the interview. I can't even talk to anyone about this because my grad class people all have at least 2 internships each and my friends aren't even in this field.  So I tried looking online only to see people wayyy more qualified than me not finding a good job for months and months so then I'm like fuck what will happen to me? I don't know what to do and I need to figure something out soon cause money is running out. Overall, I feel like I'm stuck in a cesspool of guilt, regret, anxiety and an overwhelming feeling of being completely lost. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr I don't know what tf I'm doing in life and I need a job but I am massively inadequate so I'm feeling horribly pathetic."

rhigk8,3,2021-12-15,What is the etiquette for contacting other companies after receiving a verbal job offer?,Scoopski-Potatoes,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/rhigk8/what_is_the_etiquette_for_contacting_other/," 

Hello! I am a college student who just received an email from a company's internship program coordinator stating that HR will be reaching out to me in the next few days with an offer. He said that he is sending me this email because it sometimes takes a while for HR to get all of the information together and because of the fact that I may be pursuing other internship opportunities. I found this a little strange, because I don't know if he sent this because he really wants me on the team or because he wants a yes or no decision by the time the formal offer is sent.

Because of this, my main dilemma is that I am wondering if it is appropriate for me to contact other companies that I have already completed the final interview stage with. The company that had sent me this email is not my first choice, and I want to check and see if other preferred companies would perhaps be motivated by the fact that their is another verbal offer.

I'm just not 100% sure of the etiquette in this situation and I want to make sure that I approach it correctly and with my best interests in mind."
rhii0g,4,2021-12-15,Can't tell if I sincerely have problems with how my job is run or if I'm overreacting,Artmage24,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rhii0g/cant_tell_if_i_sincerely_have_problems_with_how/,"Hi, first time writer. I'm a Graduate School student (25F) who is home for winter break and recently returned to a seasonal job I previously took this summer. It's an all around clothing - item department store I'm going to call Mitchums. Today was my second day back and I was so overwhelmed that I nearly broke down to cry in my car.

My role is front desk cashier, and I was vaguely informed ahead of my first shift that ""a bunch of new hires walked out on Mitchums for no reason"" and that they needed me to work an extra shift that week to fill out numbers. I thought that was a red flag if the reason for quitting abruptly was being belittled so I kept my guard up. In the last 2 days:

-A ""security guard"" (outside company paid by Mitchums) walked behind the front counter to skip the line and pay for a gift with his wife. He's not supposed to do that. He then proceeded to use his shift to continue shopping and left before he was supposed to walk our 6 female member party out of the store at 11:30pm. Several other male employees have also come behind the front desk and stood super close to the cashiers to get something they wanted without waiting. It seems this is a recurring problem and it does not make me feel safe.
-5 different types of noises ringing for 6-8 hours as I try to ring people up. Mostly me not liking to battle to be heard. Often needing to sit in a quiet place to regain barring. 

-Corporate mandated masks for customers again, but I was informed I was cleaning my area too much. Previously we were required to disinfect after every customer, but now apparently it's not necessary to spray at all since it's slowing down the pace of the line. I've seen too many people wipe their noses with their bare hands and sneeze without wearing masks at my corner and I'm only guarded by a 1/4 inch of plastic. I'm worried about my health and possibly spreading something like Omicron to other customers in the name of speedy service.  

-This one is probably petty, but my lunch was mysteriously thrown out. The entire fridge was emptied prematurely and no one knows who did it. The only people who interacted with the break room were two sketchy guys claiming to be the vending machine refill guys. They badgered their way upstairs and didn't really have any equipment or refill foods since the machines were still empty after they left. Had to use most of my intended 45 min lunch break/destress period ordering and waiting for replacement food and wolfed it down in the remaining 15 minutes. 

-No clear information on policies.  I've gotten 3 different conflicting methods regarding processing returned goods and no one will elaborate more on it with me.

- Most of the staff are Baby Boomers working over younger gen y/z/millenials and they often claim we don't want to work or are spoiled. They are all smiles when they talk to me, but I've been burned by manipulative authority figures in the workplace before. Mostly ones who hide behind a smile but insist that ""you aren't working hard enough/up to your potential"". 

During all of this, I forgot my anti-anxiety medication in my regular residence and had to order a back up prescription.  Until tonight,, I went 4 days without my meds and knew that my chances to keep working productivly were fading.. I could feel myself fading today when I wasn't able to keep up my ""cheery public service mask"" amongst the chaos in the store. Nearly crying in my car with a familiar 10000 yard stare, I wasn't sure if it was a sign that I needed to toughen up or look for another job.

My main job skills have been in public service and cashier work, and I'm currently filling out internship applications to apply my degree. I'm worried that I'll be throwing the towel in too early and won't be able to support myself realistically with my passion skills."

After around 2 weeks of scanning LinkedIn for internship/student job positions, I've been unable to find anything. To me it seems that most companies here want 
1) full time workers 
2) aren't willing to hire partime/offer internships (might be due to corona) 
3) aren't willing to hire someone who isn't fluent at Dutch

So I wanted to ask you guys if you knew of any companies that I should look into?

I would like to choose a career in this industry after school. I have a lot of issues with procrastination, but it is only when it comes to school, assignments, and exams, other then those I am pretty happy and successful in life. I am a fast learner, and I actually have 127 IQ. I have 5 pages of detailed report from a valid test at hospital at a psychiatric and psychological part, done with a psychologist. I would like to achieve some goals to apply for more competitive hardware engineering internship jobs.

There are two scenarios.

1. I am working 8 hours per day for this 4 months (paid mechanical engineering internship  ). I can fit 3 hours of studying per day and 18 hours per weekend. I would like to improve my FPGA development knowledge with VHDL, get better in C++, and learn Altium Designer and MATLAB from zero.
2. I am working 20 hours per week (regular minimum wage job). I can fit 10 hours of studying per day and nothing for the weekend so 50 hours of studying per week. Again to improve my FPGA development knowledge with VHDL, get better in C++, and learn Altium Designer and MATLAB from zero.

How much could I improve myself for internship jobs with these two different scenarios in 4 months?

I will need to choose between these two choices I would also really like to receive some recommendation with my choices if you find necessary such as cancelling something, or replacing something in my program with an alternative/better option (such as cancelling C++ and learning another design tools, etc.)."
rhmpn2,1,2021-12-16,I sabotaged myself,A_Human_Just_Like_U,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/rhmpn2/i_sabotaged_myself/,"It's funny, you see, I always wondered how some people could do things so last minute or not at all, when it comes to school work that is. I could never wrap my head around it, at least, until quite recently.

I was your average ""good kid"" who did well in school getting As &amp; Bs, never got in trouble, and had perfect attendance. Had advanced classes in high school and even managed to land a paid internship during my senior year.

Now, while I did well in school, I wasn't necessarily smart compared to others. I just behaved and did the work, even if HW was done incorrectly or rushed. I could never understand how some people would fail classes or not do the work during HW. I always thought to myself ""Aren't they afraid of what's gonna happen if they keep that up?"" and things of that sort.

Fast forward to my time at College. Got a full ride and my major was Animation. I did well first semester. Super time consuming but it wasn't too difficult, both in keeping up and work-wise. Then my second semester came and it was hell. It was tough to keep up weekly. I would go on days without sleep for weeks and skipped meals for that extra time. I knew it was bad for me but it's how I managed to keep up and not fall behind. I just didn't care about myself, I just kept telling myself ""Just get through this week."" So while doing that, I didn't just disregard my health but also ignoring quite literally everything that wasn't school work, which included a form I had to fill.

Finished that semester feeling like shit but was glad it was over &amp; I did it. Ofc, that didn't matter anyway because that form I didn't fill out by the deadline was just about to cost me my tuition. I was still able to turn it in but I needed another form first. I waited on it for months which I stressed about, thinking about it every night and just trying to distract myself from my stupid mistake during summer break.

Some how, I received a wavier super last minute and it seemed like everything worked out. I was so relieved I couldn't believe it and promised I'd never make a stupid mistake like that again. Well, that was short-lived as half way into my third semester I don't know if it was before or after my award letter changed (reasons were listed but not specified exactly why/what) , but I simply stopped caring about work. At first it was just an assignment. I'd skip one and wouldn't care for the world. Me, who worked my ass off to do all work last semester, refusing to fail even if I felt like crap. Me, who was always afraid of not doing one since I knew each was important incase I got a low score in a future test or something. This wasn't like me but I just continued. Although I knew I would have to leave this college because I cannot afford it or loans, I decided to just stick with the semester but I started being so irresponsible and lazy. Most likely after seeing my award letter changed probably made me worse or give up as I even didn't go to classes or didn't do major assignments.

Anyway, I'm failing like two probably gonna be three. I start on work then I see I'm taking too long and I shrug it off completely. I definitely had lots of time obviously, and it wasn't even work that was too difficult but I just didn't do it. I find it funny, confusing, and annoying how I don't even feel scared. It's so weird even right now how I just sabotaged myself. Even if I was going to have to leave, I don't know why I stayed or why I even just didn't do the work. Well, regardless of all that, I don't get how I can keep being irresponsible and don't feel worried or afraid. I just keep laughing at how I was always afraid of failure and yet I deliberately did it.

In fact, I feel relieved that it'll be over. Truth be told, there's so much I want to do, fix myself, and I know what I want to pursue. When I think of that, it's something I look forward to already doing, as if I'm about to finally have a new beginning or something. It's a lot of wishful thinking or maybe I'm just trying to make myself believe this. Either way, one thing that has never changed is my passion for art for all my life. It was the only class I enjoyed working even when I physically felt like crap. It's the one that took most time, but time would go so fast and I just wanted to put my full attention to take my time. I wanted to make something I was very proud of but of course, with other classes' work, I always had to rush it and hated that.

I'm actually going to talk to my parents tomorrow about asking if I may drop out. I'm not even afraid of that, both being a drop out and talking to my parents. That's how I know something is up with me. Well anyway, this will definitely bite me in the ass I know, but I can't change what's happened anymore and will just have to discipline myself here on out. I know there's lots of consequences right around the corner and I should probably transfer elsewhere because degrees are important, but when I think of how I can solely focus on my passion and go at my own pace, then I rather choose that. Either way, no matter how confused or lost I may be rn, I refuse to take out student loans and I refuse to give up on my passion.

Thats my rant, I kindly thank you for reading this. I'm off to do some Finals work that won't even matter but it's the last day so I guess I might as well do it"

Edit: Told him I couldn't give the assignment time due to personal commitments. Pretty decent guy, asked me to refer someone who'd be a good fit for the position. 

PS - If any of you guys are from India and want to pursue this opportunity ( Tech Stack - React, GraphQL, Typescript ). I'd be happy to refer you"

I kept thinking it was some subconscious rejection of the company, of the manager, etc. I would work for like a couple of hours a day and then just do something else. It became easy because everything became online soon after i joined, and i would just feel terrible for taking so long to do really simple tasks. About a year in, i switched jobs to another company (again big tech) amazing team, amazing manager, amazing everything.Things ought to have changed, but I still just feel so unproductive.

The team are made up of experienced traders from IB.

Some of the job description:

Trade execution using systematic models, manage risk of open positions, minimise transaction costs, research &amp; development of new strategies, calibrate risk metrics like VaR/drawdown

I consider myself very lucky as I went through all the interviews to the final stage and initially didn't get the offer, the other guy used the offer as leverage to stay at his current company so here am I. 

Never worked in front desk before, had a quant internship in trading product doing ML stuff mostly. 

How do I best prepare myself for the role? I know most of the basic finance/maths/coding stuff, any practical skills that I can learn that would help? I have like 3 weeks until I start.

rhp5th,11,2021-12-16,Advice on handling hard classes,FlorentineKnight,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rhp5th/advice_on_handling_hard_classes/,"I'm currently a computer science student and have trouble managing hard classes - I'm a second year and I'm approaching that part of my degree where the content becomes noticeably more difficult and time consuming. 

I struggle a lot with procrastination and time management (something I'm taking active steps with working on) but I want a way to do this more efficiently. 

Personally, I do great on assignments and projects - but I don't do very well on tests. I do experience testing anxiety but I also feel like I haven't figured out how to properly study. Any tips on studying for exams would be greatly appreciated.

I've had to retake a few classes because of dropping them for these reasons. However, I do have a passion for CS and programming that I pursue through my projects, which landed me an internship for next summer.

So I'd say it's not a problem with liking my degree, it's more of a problem of not knowing how to handle hard classes very well. Especially as I'm going to be taking harder classes in the coming semesters, I'd love some advice on how you all study, what to do when you experience burnout, how to lessen testing anxiety, etc.

Another huge cause of me dropping classes or not doing as well as I hoped is because I have bad luck with taking horrible professors. Obviously I also blame myself - but this past semester I've had professors who can't speak english very well and professors whose grade distributions made it very easy to shoot yourself in the foot (one of my profs this semester had 80% of the grade distribution dependent on 3 exams). So I'd say this is also a big factor.

Another question is how many courses do you all usually take per semester? My dad tells me to take five but I feel my limit is four; I do see my friends in the same major taking five which makes me feel like I should be doing the same, but I'd like input on this as well. Thanks everyone."

I decided I wanted to change career path to data science and went to get a cheap (but good) masters in data science in a top europe university. Because I wanted some experience (and money), I ended up getting the only internship I could, as a Data Engineer. I had no idea about Data Engineering before starting, just the basics needed to start: sql and python. 

After 3 months in this internship and about 5 months in my masters, I realized what I do at work is 1000% more fun than what I do at school. I’m starting to get bored with all of my classes, specially the basics: ML and Linear Algebra. There is just too much math and stats that I think is useless in real life. Like do people actually use SVM and kernels in real life?. It is just too boring.

What I don’t know if what it is like to be a Data Scientist in real life. Are you doing stats and optimization and using kernels irl? Are they basically researchers? Or depends on the title?. I’m more of a doer so that why I think I’m starting to like more Data Engineering.

Can someone who has made the change from DS to DE (or viceversa) give me some insight on jobs as a DS."

I am a non-traditional student (former military) so I will be nearly 30 when I graduate. I got my first internship last summer with a DOD contractor which I was super excited about at the time. The job itself was super relaxed with very low expectations. This calmed my first job nerves, however, I have been working part time through the semester and I am coming to a realization that this job may not be the best for my career growth. They do not have much of a software development process, we don't test our software (there is one single testing guy), my code did not get reviewed, there were no PRs (just push into main), and I was not really learning anything new. I just hit winter break and they want to put me in for a security clearance for when I come back after school is over, but I am contemplating turning them down to try to search for a job that is better for my growth as an SE. 

It has been a while since I have prepared for interviews. I haven't touched leetcode in over a year, so I am nervous about applying for jobs again. I have good grades though, I am an A student and now I have some work experience. Is it worth taking the leap of faith to turn them down and search for a better job? Or is it not as detrimental as I think it will be to work at this company for a year?"

However, I have been working part-time for an internship that I had over the summer and they really want me to go on full time. I have not told my current boss that I accepted a separate offer because I still want to work for them part-time next semester and fear that I would have to resign if I tell them and I want to see what they have to offer me (The job is in the finance side of a major hospitality company and they have not given an offer yet due to budget restrictions). I would enjoy either job just as much and the location is great for both of them.

I have a over year of professional experience in Software Engineering at my current position, a previous summer internship software role, and lots of resume-ready personal projects from as far back as 2015 that I usually find ways of tying back to relevant technologies/languages interviewers want to hear about. At my current position I’m making $62k/year. I’ve been applying for jobs/interviewing for a couple months now and the only actual offer I got was for the exact same salary range ($55k-$65k/year).

Is there something I’m doing wrong? Is this pay that unusual? I try to convince myself it’s not that bad, but I get pretty disheartened when looking at glassdoor or the salaries people post here with similar experience and realize they make almost twice as much as me. According to glassdoor, at my experience level in my current city apparently I should easily be making $26k+ what I’m making annually:

https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/des-moines-entry-level-software-engineer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,10_IM235_KO11,40.htm

Or, is this pay range totally normal and I’m just whining? Should I expect to make ~$60k for the next few years? I realize my industry experience is lacking and it might be a year or two until I’m more employable for higher-paying positions, but I can’t help but feel discouraged that employers think I’m worth tens of thousands less than what people with similar experience are making."

rhxdjw,2,2021-12-16,Best basic side projects before graduating?,BackgroundProgress08,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rhxdjw/best_basic_side_projects_before_graduating/,"I am a Junior now majoring in CS. I’m halfway through my degree, and had a small data and technician internship over last summer. Other than that, I have no side projects or experience. What should I do in the next few months so that I can apply to good internships in my area, and then get a good job out of graduation? I’m not planning on going to grad school.

Everyone in school who finds out I’m a CS Major talks about how smart it is to choose something ‘employable’ and how easy it will be to find a job after school. I don’t think they realize how competitive the field still is though. 

My first employer asked for examples of my work in GIT, but I didn’t have any.

TL;DR: other than side projects in GIT, what can I do as a CS student to prep for internship and job applications?"

Mi-a placut tot timpul programarea si la inceputul pandemiei am ales sa ma bag la informatica economica deoarece nu am avut medie de informatica si nici rabdare sa fac 4 ani la tehnologia informatiei sau stiinta calculatoarelor, sunt in anul 2, dar nu simt ca invat nimic benefic, mai repede prind de pe youtube. 

Imi place foarte mult partea de front-end, UI, avand si skill-uri de desen de cand eram pustan. Am invatat singur Html, Css si bootstrap, iar acum incerc sa intru mai adanc in JS, ma descurc si la C# intr-o oarecare masura. Am facut cateva proiecte mici precum: un calculator, un joc x si o, un cantar si 3 pagini web, am mai folosit youtube-ul pe unde m-am incurcat. 

Nu stiu daca ar trebui sa ma tin de facultate, am deja una terminata, iar la asta pana acum, am facut doar oop si putin c# in 2 ani. 

Ce recomandari imi puteti face ca sa pot prinde un post de junior sau internship. 

Multumesc."

rhyc1c,29,2021-12-16,Is it worth quitting my job for a 3 month internship at a big tech company?,candie23,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rhyc1c/is_it_worth_quitting_my_job_for_a_3_month/,"I feel I really need the experience or I'll never get hired as a software developer. I know my job is not going to wait for me to be done for 3 months with the internship. I know they will be mad when I tell them because the summer is the busiest time of the year. 

This internship would look really good on my resume even if I don't get hired after. The main thing I'm worried about is being without a job once I'm done with the internship if I do not get an offer.

EDIT: I have no prior work experience related to software engineering and the job I'm at now sucks. I only make 16 dollars an hour and I struggle to pay my bills. I also don't like my job. I really don't have many bills. I have about 1300 dollars in bills a month. My car payment is the main thing I need to keep up with which is 430 a month(also insurance which is 100) So that's the main reason I don't want to go without a job. This company isn't FAANG but it's still a big name tech company that's hard to get into. I haven't received an  offer yet. But it's looking promising! I'll have my bachelor's in Computer Science in December 2022."

I am basically an undergraduate student and a python console/app programmer. I also do problem solving using c++ in codeforces.  I have learned nodejs. Now I am doing an intern job where they are forcing me to learn typescript and do problem solving with it. I am struggling to use ts from python/c++'s perspective. For example it required  a lot of time to configure tsc for nodejs. Now I am struggling to take input from stdin or an input file which also requires extra efforts compared to cin in cpp or input in python.

Is there any way you guys can help me out? Maybe providing a resource to learn TS+JS from a C++, Python, Java Programmer's perspective?

ri0tz7,183,2021-12-16,[Very Long Read] Listening to my Asian dad cost me 4 years of my career and a lot of money.,StarDingo,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/ri0tz7/very_long_read_listening_to_my_asian_dad_cost_me/,"I come from an Asian family. My dad made a fortune working in the oil industry and was always viewed as one of the most successful individuals in our city. Naturally, I was always inspired to reach the same heights, so I worked hard as I could throughout the middle school and high school. Got straight A's and placed in several national science competitions in Chemistry.  I pursued Advanced Chemistry classes because I liked the teacher and liked to solve problems from the Chemistry books, not necessarily due to the love of Chemistry as a science field.

&amp;#x200B;

In my teens, I was also a tech geek, never programmed, but spent a lot of time reading about computers, the technical side of games, picking apart my computer and assembling it back, etc. I even made some money jailbreaking iPhones and repairing PSP's, before it even became a thing. In my junior year of high school, I told my dad my dad that Chemistry science competitions no longer interested me, and I had started to find them extremely boring.  I should also mention that I had been admitted to a prestigious high-school specialized in math and physics. The classes were rigorous, and we had twice as many math/physics classes as students at regular high-schools. They were also on the same level as Freshman-Sophomore level Math/Physics classes at US colleges. In our education system, to graduate with honors, you had to maintain all A's annually in all of your classes throughout the middle school and high school. So you can imagine that, despite transitioning to a much more rigorous school, I still had to be a straight A student.

&amp;#x200B;

The task of maintaining good grades came at the cost of my hobbies and teenage social life. I always loved martial arts and bodybuilding, and, when I transitioned to high-school, I had to abandon all of that because I couldn't keep up with the rigorous academic program. On top of that, I was pressured by my dad to keep competing in national science competitions in Chemistry. I voiced my disagreement but he would always gaslight me or bombard me with how successful I would become if I just chose to endure those years. I didn't have balls to just say 'No'. My mom also parroted the same thing as he did, so I had no  support from anyone. So the 2/3 years of high school (in my country high school is 3 years long), I spent attending classes from 9AM - 4PM, and then I would go to the Chemistry lab at the local university and attend the Advanced Chemistry classes for the national high school science team between 6PM and 10PM. There was no way I could fit any social life, love life, or any other interests. But I stuck to it because I thought I would be rewarded for all that hard work, sacrifice, and suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

By the senior year of high school, my depression and self-loathing became so bad, that I was a former shell of myself. From a popular confident kid, who was a soul of any company, I became a depressed lost kid who would get picked on for not fitting into the crowd.  It didn't really help that my dad was an alcoholic who would get himself drunk into oblivion in front of me. The stuff that I had seen is still stuck in my head. My mom never left him because, despite his drinking problem, he was still earning a lot of money, so our family always had whatever we wanted or needed. By the start of the Senior Year, I had run out of gas and had no desire to prep for college admissions. I had quit the high school science team and just studied for the high school graduation exams. In my free time, I played games, ate junk food, and spent the majority of my time alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Around Fall, I managed to win scholarship into US college. I was extremely happy. I thought things would finally get better. I graduated with high school honors and left to the US. I picked Chemical Engineering as my major. My dad accompanied me. After we arrived, he helped me settle. On the day of his departure, 1 day before the start of the classes in my very first semester of college, we were in my room, and he was eating a sandwich. I asked him politely to grab a plate because I had vacuumed the carpet, so I didn't want the carpet to have breadcrumbs on it. He started shouting at me, saying that I was ungrateful and a total piece of shit. I was shocked and didn't have any words. By that time, I had been so suppressed by my dad (and to some degree my mom) that I was too scared to openly oppose him. He left and slammed the door on his way out.

&amp;#x200B;

In around a week, my mom called me and asked what was going on. I explained the situation to her and told her that dad shouted at me for absolutely no reason. There wasn't any fault from me. She told me to be a good son and apologize to my dad. I really thought that it was all my fault, so I called him and gave my apology.  Things got quite for some time. Around the end of the semester, I realized that I didn't like Chemical Engineering and wanted to explore either Computer Science or Medicine (I considered becoming a surgeon). I called my family to discuss that with them. I told them that I didn't find any engineering classes interesting, and that CS had way more career opportunities. In addition, I mentioned that I had always been more attracted to IT than to  any other field. It was a logical choice for me. How do you think my dad reacted?

&amp;#x200B;

He started screaming at me, calling surgeons, ""butchers"" and software engineers, ""weird IT losers who didn't make any money"". He kept screaming until I gave in and accepted his opinion. (However, I am going to jump ahead and say now that I still picked up programming as a hobby in my Junior year). That day was the pivotal moment that shaped the years of my life until now. My post is already too long, so I am going to skip the details of how I had awful time looking for internships in my field (because no one hired international students with a ChemE Degree) , how I watched my former high school classmates (who were less successful than me at high school) get internships at Google, Facebook, Apple. They had stayed in our home country, picked CS, and got flown out to the US for their internships. They got paid 7k per month while I was scraping test tubes in our research labs for free because I couldn't find paid opportunities in my field.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in 5 years I graduated with a Degree in Chemical Engineering. Despite graduating from a well-known university with a thesis award and some experience working at chemistry labs, it took me 500 applications to find a shitty lab technician job that paid 19$/hour. All other recruiters, who contacted me for 70-90k jobs in my field, bailed as soon as they found that I didn't have permanent residency. As far as I knew, all my friends, who picked IT, landed cushy jobs and were promised permanent residency from their companies after 2-3 years. Back in 2018, the IT sector was already big, but not as hot as it is now. It wasn't that competitive. I had no other choice but to agree to that job.

&amp;#x200B;

4 years later, after countless programming classes, lost years of career, coming back home, and coming back again to the US to study in a graduate CS program, I am about to graduate with a CS Degree from a good college. I had landed a full-time job at a well known company that pays well. It is not my target company, but it is what it is. I argued a lot with my parents and expressed all the thoughts that I had about them. They helped me pay for my tuition and living expenses. My dad had lost a good chunk of his business due to the economical crisis and his mismanagement of the family money. When he was a VP of one of the major oil companies in my country, every freaking ""dog"" and ""rat"" made sure to stick their bloodsucking teeth in him and ""borrow"" as much money as they could. Eventually, he was left with almost nothing. The irony.

&amp;#x200B;

My parents helped me get back on the career track I wanted to be on initially, but I will never get those lost  4 years back. People of my age, who pursued CS as their Undergraduate major, are already Senior level engineers. The friends from my country, who chose CS, already got their permanent residency and are transitioning to the new stages of the lives: creating a family, looking to buy a house, etc. I have none of that, and I am just starting. I talked about that to my mom, but she just doesn't understand. My parents did a horrendous damage to my life, my mental health, and my career. After I start my job in January and start earning enough money to sustain myself, I will cut them out. My dad never apologized for everything he did. My mom tells me it's just in his character, and that in reality he is really sorry things turned out this way. I don't care. They didn't listen to my pleas back then, why should I listen to them now? I was a good son, I always respected them, barely went to clubs, never wasted their money on dumb thins, always tried my hardest to get good grades.  I have had enough. I don’t care. 

I wasted my life listening to other people. For once, I am going to listen to myself only and do as I want. I want them to suffer for what they did to me."

ri4l6h,53,2021-12-16,Worst Semester of My Life,anonimposter,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/ri4l6h/worst_semester_of_my_life/,"Just finished my finals, took Math 55 and 61B (pretty sure i failed both) in the same semester along with 2 more classes. I’m a senior majoring in CogSci with an emphasis in AI. I’ve been thru finals plenty of times, but something about this semester just took a ridiculous toll on me. I don’t know if it’s just because we were in person after being online for a year and learning how to re-assimilate myself into social life and going outside was hard, but it definitely did more harm than good. 

I got diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in October, my autoimmune illness made me ridiculously covid paranoid, had a plethora of a series of unfortunate events that happened this semester, basically had no social life this semester, and I got no return offers from my internships. 

Yeah it sounds like a bunch of mundane problems, but i’ve never had my academics take this big of a toll on me. I feel defeated, anxious, fatigued and unlike myself.

Thank goodness i’m graduating next semester, but goddamn has this school taken a toll on me. 

Tbh, I wish we were given an option to be entirely remote by choice and only come to campus for exams or something. All i know is being in Berkeley makes me ridiculously sad.

If you read all of this, thank you for listening to me vent and know that if you’re going thru something similar you aren’t alone"

When I graduated last year in CS, I had about 1.5 years of helpdesk experience from various internships. In school I really enjoyed the work, and my goal was to become a network engineer (and was studying for the CCNA), but, after months of applying post-graduation, I couldn't even land an interview for a junior position or anything other than helpdesk. I ended up settling for another helpdesk job that I've been at for the past few months and now I just feel burnt out and lost.

I've always struggled with my mental health and also figuring out what I wanted to do for a career: during college, I figured I could just coast from my degree and internships and land a job easily after school, ideally in networking. Now I've basically been doing the same work for the last 2 years and I'm not learning anything anymore (and my job is waaaay less technical than I was led to believe in the interviews). I feel *extremely mediocre* and I remind myself every day that I'm doing borderline menial work that is untechnical and underpaid (especially for my degree) which is killing me.

I guess I'm just confused and don't know what to do next. My current job has exposed me to some new stuff that I do enjoy, like privacy compliance work and also hardening/securing devices. I like automating stuff, namely with Python and PowerShell, and I enjoy networking (but never finished the CCNA). I am definitely leaning towards devops, but I am really daunted by postings even for junior positions.

I'm going to start applying again after the holidays. I plan on applying to more junior network eng and sysadmin positions, and potentially SOC roles as I feel like I need to just figure out what I *actually like* in IT. I know I could just get the AWS SAA (which I almost finished last year) and secure a job right away, but I don't think I'm interested in the cloud exclusively.

How did you figure out what you wanted to specialize in? Is SOC work as mind-numbing/tedious as I've read it is? Is a jr. devops role attainable for someone this early into their career?

Thank you all, I definitely wouldn't have made it this far over the last few years without this community. If you have some time, my resume is below and I would really appreciate any and all feedback, cheers.

ri71zw,81,2021-12-16,For people that feel insecure about their GPA… I have some good news for you :),stannieStan,collegeresults,https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/ri71zw/for_people_that_feel_insecure_about_their_gpa_i/,"**Note**
I don’t mean to come of as though I’m bragging, though I do see how parts can be read like that. I am giving you my honest feelings and knowledge of my experience.

I want to make this as cohesive as possible so please let me know if you have questions!

**Demographics**

* Gender: F
* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Indian)
* Residence: SoCal
* Income Bracket: Upper Middle
* Type of School: Wealthy suburban public school that is decently competitive, but among the other schools in my area, my high school is less competitive
* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): N/a but I’m a girl in STEM so ig?

**Intended Major(s)**: I applied as Environmental Science to my ED school but intend to switch to Computer Science or Economics

**Academics**

* GPA (UW/W): 3.86/4.00UW and 4.56/5.00W I think. It isn’t bad but I was extremely self conscious of my unweighted GPA since it was lower than most of my friends and many of the people that get into the schools I was aiming at. I got 5 Bs in sophomore year during our Covid semester because there was a lot of turmoil in my family at that time. I mentioned it in additional info but my situation honestly wasn’t bad enough to really matter, in my opinion. I was just sad.
* Rank (or percentile): School doesn’t rank but I’d guess that I’m bottom or below the top 10%
* \# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: AP Biology, AP World History, AP English Language, AP US History, AP Computer Science A, AP Macro Economics(self-studied) were the AP classes I took before applying. I dual enrolled in College Math and a philosophy class and took whatever honors class I could fit into my schedule.
* Senior Year Course Load: AP Comparative Government, AP Literature, AP Physics 1, AP Environmental Science, AP Studio Art, and College Math

**Standardized Testing**

* SAT I: 1520 (720RW, 800M). I took it 3 times and went from a 1310 to this. I didn’t want to keep taking it because people told me if I took it more than 3 times, colleges wouldn’t like it, so I stopped. I really felt like I needed a higher score however, considering my GPA was lower than average for the schools I was aiming at. I still submitted it to my ED school so they could see my progression.
* ACT: 35 (35R, 36W, 35M, 34S). I took this test once and I was really happy with my score. I used Kaplan to study and that was mainly it. The thing that helped me the most was drilling problems. 
* AP/IB: All 5s except for a 4 in Lang, Euro, and Bio

**Extracurriculars/Activities -**

1. Researcher (9-12): I was a research intern at a notable research institution for environmental studies. During my sophomore year, I decided that I had enough knowledge to pursue my own project, which is exactly what I did. I won 2nd overall at my local fair, which qualified me for ISEF, where I won a special award pertaining to environmental science. I. also competed in JSHS but didn't qualify past the state fair. I went on to present my research at 2 conferences locally and publish it in 2 journals. This is a lot of information, so I added parts of it to the extra information in the additional information section. 
2. Founder of Youth Advocacy Branch (10-12): Led a program in my school district, which happens be quite large. Keeping this vague so I don't get doxxed, but I'd love to explain if you DM me. This opportunity let me meet many important people so if you are interested, I would highly recommend it.
3. Robotics (9-12): Started in middle school and our team saw a lot of success locally, nationally, and international through the different competitions we did. We did rotationally leadership, so I listed my positions in the CommonApp.
4. Internship under my Congressmen (10 &amp;amp;amp; 12): Pretty straightforward. I never really got to talk to him besides general check ups but I worked with others to establish his digital platform during his campaign. He won but honestly, I think it was mostly because he's been in his position for many years.
5. President of an Academic Competition Club (9-12): This also had to do with the environment but I don't want to dox again. My team qualified to nationals under my leadership so I mentioned that.
6. Treasurer of Environmental Club (9-12): Managed the school garden and held events with local environmental leaders. 
7. Attorney of Mock Trial Team (11-12): We almost made it to state! But it was ok. Mock Trial is a great activity for anyone that likes to talk and act. Even if law is not for you, I highly recommend.
8. National History Day Participant (11-12): I did this by myself after my history teacher mentioned it when I asked her about history activities I can do. I am the only person at my school that does it, so I worked closely with my APUSH teacher to make it happen, which helped me develop a great relationship with her. FYI: I did Senior Website!
9. App Developer (9-12): I made Swift projects for the Apples WWDC Competition. I didn't qualify for an award until sophomore and junior year. I mentioned this award in additional information since it wasn't as significant as my other awards but it was cool because I love Apple!
10. Public Art (9-12): I've painted a mural in my city every summer. I really wanted to write my CommonApp about my experience on the street, but I chose another topic as you will later see.

**Awards/Honors**

1. Special award at ISEF 2021(I can't name the award because it would dox me but it was related to Environmental Science)
2. Climate Change Youth Award (for those interested, this isn't the actual name of it but if you go online and search up ""environment awards for high schoolers"" there are a ton a great awards you can apply for. I highly recommend!)
3. National History Day state award
4. Best STEM Youth of my City
5. Gold Presidential Award for Volunteering (I believe it was for doing 250 hours of work)

**Letters of Recommendation**

APUSH Teacher: My APUSH teacher helped me out with my National History Day project. Since I was the only one doing the competition at my school, my efforts to reach out and work with her were above the expectations of a typically history student at my school. This really helped me because it showed that I had ""intellectual vitality"", by Stanford's definition. Though I didn't apply there, she mentioned that trait in my letter of recommendation(since she is a Stanford alum). I think that really helped me out.

Chemistry teacher: I needed a letter from a STEM teacher so I asked my chemistry teacher. I don't think it was a stunning letter by any means, but it was really nice. She said I was one of her best students during the year I had her and mentioned how I was an energetic student. I told her about my ISEF stuff, which I did when I was a junior, and she was really surprised lol. I think that helped me get a better letter than I should have.

School Counselor: I doubt this letter was amazing but I asked her to specifically mention that I took the hardest schedule available to me and explain why I got 5 Bs in sophomore year. She also knew of my ISEF status, and she informed that the last time someone had gone from my school, he went to Harvard, so she was really excited by that and said she mentioned that fact in her letter to emphasize the magnitude of my award. She told me that 5 Bs wouldn't be a big deal, especially since it was during the pandemic, but I told her that having her explain to them why I got them would give me more confidence in her letter. I believe my counselors have a mini competition when it comes to admitting kids to great universities, so that helped me get a good letter (at least I hope so).

My mentor: They talked about my growth from middle school to now. Mentioned my style of leadership, which is from the heart over the mind. They mentioned times where I stood up for my teammates and addressed my tendency to put others before myself, which I learned to stop doing as much. I think it was nice because, as you'll see later, it reflected what I had to say in my essays as well.

Advisor for youth advocacy: Really sweet! She offered to write me a letter, and since she was a former English teacher, it came out really well and she talked about how I am a self starter, aligning to what my APUSH teacher said.

Research mentor: I've known her since 9th grade and she talked about how I am great ""women in STEM"" and a promising researcher. Talked about my technical skills, presentation skills, innovation, and ambition and talked about how well I worked with people in the lab, even though they were mostly Phd students or professors. I was sometimes invited to their group gatherings, so she mentioned my social skills, which I think is different, coming from a researcher.

Note: I think its really important to have consistency between your recc letters and your application. From my research into college applications, recc letters are considered a lot more than I thought. Because of that, I asked for my teacher letters really early, in fact, I asked for them right after AP tests! This way, I could send my teachers information about myself and keep in touch with them over the summer, which helped me build a more personal connection with them. 

**Interviews**

Interview: The interview was great. I talked to my interviewer about my interest in US history and philosophy, which he appreciated, considering they were a PoliSci major(I believe). He were not the youngest, probably around 60-70 and he mentioned his military background, so I took a more formal approach when talking to him. He asked me how my experience in STEM manifested itself in my love for history. This was a really good question that I took full advantage of to explain why I fit into his university. I talked about how I use a scientific lens to explore history, which is what led to my work with Digital Humanities(I know, this is a very Yale thing lol), where I created a transcription program and discovered patterns in writings from the past. I of course mentioned Eric Foner(who is a great history writer for those interested) and how I loved reading his work on the Reconstruction. Honestly, even though I was applying as an environmental science major, the way the conversation went, in my opinion, really showed how deep my connection to humanities is. Considering the way the universities curriculum and focus on philosophy and history, that really helped me. 
If there is one tip I can give anyone reading this, its to let your interviewer talk too. I am usually extremely talkative and tend to dominate conversations, but during the interview, I sat back at listened, which allowed me to bounce off ideas from him, leading to a more intellectual conversation.
I still keep in touch with my interviewer and can't wait to let him know of my acceptance! He told me after the interview that I was ""one of the most cultured young ladies [he] had ever met"" so I really hope that came through in his evaluation. 

**Essays**

CommonApp Essay: I read ""50 Successful Stanford Essays"" and read an essay where a girl reflected on her positive and negative experiences with a mentor of hers. One of my biggest mentors, who I've known for around 7 years, is someone I've had an extremely rocky relationship with over the years. I talked about his life growing up poor, discussed how he broke me to my lowest point, and what I learned from those experiences. It was quite a difficult essay to write and even harder to have people read, considering how emotional the narrative was. For anyone planning on righting an essay about someone else, please remember THIS IS AN ESSAY ABOUT YOU NOT THEM! Even though you are talking about them, focus on what you got from them. Reflection is really valuable for admissions officers so focus on that. 

I applied to __________ College so these were the prompts I answered.

List Questions:
* List the titles of the required readings from academic courses that you enjoyed most during secondary/high school.: Quite straightforward. A tip for those of you interested in applying to __________ is taking note of all the literature you're reading. We read a chapter of a book in APUSH but I really enjoyed it so I still included it. I also mentioned short stories and poems we read. I definitely wouldn't have remember these if I hadn't wrote them down.
* List the titles of the books, essays, poetry, short stories or plays you read outside of academic courses that you enjoyed most during secondary/high school.: Though I didn't do this on purpose, it turned out many of the books I read really aligned with ___________ philosophy. I read books US history like ""The People's History of the US"", lots of Eric Foner, books on feminism, philosophy books, presidents, the evolution of American politics, environmental advocacy, etc. Not sure how much the actually books helped, but the sheer quantity that I read probably helped. I read a new book every 2 weeks throughout high school so that helped.
* We’re interested in learning about some of the ways that you explore your interests. List some resources and outlets that you enjoy, including but not limited to websites, publications,  journals, podcasts, social media accounts, lectures, museums, movies, music, or other content with which you regularly engage.: I listed lots of podcast but they were far less intellectual as my other media. I really love Conan O'Brien so I mentioned his podcast, show, and Twitter account. I mentioned the news outlets I use, scientific journals, TED Talks, movies, and a myriad of albums I've enjoyed over the year(I love disco!) This part of application definitely was the area I used to show off my fun side.

Essays:
* Prompt 1: A hallmark of the __________ experience is being able to learn and live in a community with a wide range of perspectives. How do you or would you learn from and contribute to diverse, collaborative communities?: When I saw the ""how do you"" part of the question, I took that and ran, in the sense that I talked about what I already learned from __________. I talked about the school's history through the lease of the numerous status on campus. I believe this wasn't the most creative approach but it really fit in well with my story.
* Prompt 2: Why are you interested in attending __________ University? We encourage you to consider the aspect(s) that you find unique and compelling about __________.: I really just repeated what I told my interviewer, about the intersection between STEM and humanities from my point of view. I strayed away from talking too much about New York(even though thats why I like the school the most) because I heard quite cliche. I only mentioned it at the end.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*
* &amp;amp;gt;!Columbia University 🦁!!&amp;amp;lt; I broke down into tears and slammed my computer shut when I saw the video play, so my friends started comforting me on my ""rejection"" but honestly, I was just so glad that my worries were over and that I could stop my constant feeling of inadequacy as a result of my GPA. It was probably one of best experiences of my life :)
* ASU through rolling admission

**Additional Information:**
To summarize my profile, I am a lower GPA, high test score, spiked applicant. Because of my spike in humanities and STEM, I figured a school like &amp;amp;gt;!Columbia!&amp;amp;lt;, where everyone is learning both, would be a great fit for me. 

Edit: I do want to note that I am lucky in many senses to be in this position. I did research from freshman year onwards because my cousin did medical research as a high schooler and she recommended the experience to me. My parents also were very supportive and never shamed me for my grades. I had many opportunities available to me, but since some were not common at my school, like Science Fair, that made my application a bit more unique than it would have been if I went to another school.

I don't think that I'm the most qualified person to help by any means but I do have some tips to give while this is fresh on my mind.
1. Your grades ARE important. Do not underestimate them. Even though I got 5 Bs in the span of one semester, I made sure I had straight As from that point onwards. I really think that helped show that was just a one of thing that happened. Do note however, as you can see though my application, GRADES ARE NOT EVERYTHING. Do not lose hope in yourself; you can beat the odds, but the only if you forget about the past and look forward.  After I got those Bs, I gained a huge amount of energy to take my research more seriously than ever, and that, by far, was my biggest achievement.
2. For interviews, be yourself and be comfortable, but be the version of yourself that is most appropriate for them to see. I know not everyone finds it in themselves to talk comfortably with others, especially when they have a big role in something like college applications. Over my years in robotics, I find that if you talk to an adult like you are their age, they really like it(as long as you aren't acting like you're better than them). Before my interview, I did no prep besides reviewing my essays. That helped me remember what I wanted to communicate, but besides that, I tried to go about it as naturally as possible.
3. Your essay is your voice to AOs. That is the only time you get to ""speak"" to them so be genuine and honest. I liked to think of it as though I am writing an autobiography lol, so essentially, what I would say to people that want to know me well but not personal information because I don't want people coming to my house in the middle of the night.
4. PLEASE SPEND TIME TO GET GOOD RECC LETTER! They are more important than you think so please please please, develop good relationships with your teachers and honestly, become a teachers pet! This will help you a lot!

Over the years, this subreddit has been a great help for me, so please let me know if you have any questions and I'll answer them to the best of my ability! My DMs are open and so are the comments! Good luck with applications!"
ri7fs1,1,2021-12-16,How likely to get internship if switching into a cs major in sophomore year?,Pretty-Vegetable-411,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/ri7fs1/how_likely_to_get_internship_if_switching_into_a/,"I just finished my first semester of my sophomore year as an economics major at my T20 university. My school has an application system to its school of business, but i didn’t do so well in some of my prerequisite classes so it’s pretty likely that i’ll be rejected. It’s fine, however, i’ve realised that I absolutely hate economics, and so i’m considering switching into a BA in CS. I learned python in my statistics class and I really enjoyed it, and I signed up for an intro to programming class next semester. So far i’m not behind in the major since my first 3 semesters have mostly been common core classes, but I was planning on taking summer classes to catch up a semester’s worth of CS classes.

My dilemma is whether it’s a smart idea to switch now, or if that would screw me over when applying for internships next year. I feel like everyone around me had been coding since they were in high school, so i’m a bit worried about how my lack of experience in the field would affect my ability to get an internship. I have more experience in the field of business since I’m a marketing intern at my university and a volunteer tax preparer, but basically no experience with coding. Any tips or thoughts?"

I am interested in learning full stack web development. My husband is a senior backend engineer specializing in automation but I am brand new (though I do have a bachelor’s in Biomedical engineering and some medical school completed, if that matters at all for program candidacy). 

I have been offered an internship once I enroll in a course (boot camp or otherwise). I cannot learn myself because that would disqualify me from internship candidacy, and to be honest, during covid I really crave the structure. I was initially enrolled in the MIT xPro program but cancelled when I read the universally abysmal Reddit reviews. 

What camps or programs do you guys suggest? Thank you so much!"

She was amazing, simply put. I did not read my letter but she knew I did very well on the National Spanish Exam and in her class. She also knew me decently well as a person and her previous students that asked her for recs have had success.

Genetics Teacher: 8.5/10

She was also great. The only reason she's not a 10 is that I know she gets A LOT of letters so I know she probably had a template. That being said, I did extremely well in her class and we really bonded and she got to know me throughout my junior year.

**Interviews**

**Advice/information:**

As you can see, I did not have the strongest extracurricular profile. I did not have any fancy internships or international recognition. However, I think that you can get away with weaker ECs if the other parts of your application are very strong. For example, my LORs and essays were probably the strongest part of my application. Get started on essays very early and have them reviewed multiple times. An amazing essay will differentiate your application from the rest.

Also, I think it's important that you develop a theme for your application. Mine was tailored around environmental science and Spanish, which I think added a level of transparency and clarity. Participate in ECs and courses that reflect your major and you should be set.

So glad this process is over!!! Good luck to everyone still applying and congratulations to those already accepted as well. :)"
riauna,113,2021-12-17,Amazon SDE Intern 2022,Giggsy1999,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/riauna/amazon_sde_intern_2022/,"I saw other people posting about their interview experience for an Amazon SDE Intern on Reddit. Throughout the process I found it to be really helpful so I wanted to share my experience in the hopes I could help someone too. 

**TIMELINE**

FULL DISCLOSURE, I did get a referral for the position which I am sure helped. 

I applied for the Amazon SDE Intern position on October 28 2021. I applied to the Seattle and Vancouver positions (I'm Canadian). I received the part 1 of the Online Assessment from the Vancouver location on November 3rd. I received part 2 of the Online Assessment the day after completing part 1. On November 17th, I received an email stating that I moved onto the Final Round Interview and attached to the email was a link to a calendar where I could select all the days I was available to be interviewed. Then, on November 25th I received an email confirming my Final Round Interview on December 10th. After completing the interview I received my offer December 14th.

**ONLINE ASSESSMENT PART 1**

This was a Hacker Rank Coding Assessment with 2 questions and a time limit of (I believe) 70 mins. The first question was pretty easy. So easy that when I finished I thought I misunderstood the question and when I ran it I was failing test cases so I thought I did misunderstand it. I couldn't figure it out so I moved on to the 2nd question. The 2nd question was also really easy but that was because I got the brute force solution and I was getting ""Time Limit Exceeded."" So, I went back to the first question and after reading it again I felt like I understood it correctly the first time and when I went through my code again I realized I had put an ""=="" instead of ""&gt;="" so I fixed this. After that all test cases passed. I went back to part 2 and figured out how to not get time limit exceeded. It was a math question and from a strictly math standpoint I knew how to solve it but I couldn't figure out how to code it and I was running short on time. So, in the code I actually commented how you would solve it mathematically and that you should take the same approach when solving it programmatically but I didn't know how to. *Yes, I literally wrote ""I am not sure how to code this.""* 

Like I said, I received part 2 the next day but from my understanding everyone gets part 2 after completing part 1 no matter how good or bad you may have done on part 1.

**ONLINE ASSESSMENT PART 2**

There are two assessments in this part. The Workstyles Assessment and Work Simulation. These are both behavioral. 

The Workstyles Assessment is so simple. It is just personality questions where you pick ""Agree, Disagree, etc."" Honestly you can't really prep for that, it is just who you are. It is 20 mins long (I believe) but you can finish it in like 5-10 mins.

The Work Simulation is supposed to mimic a real day as an SDE at Amazon. You have an email inbox in which co-workers message you with issues and questions. There are videos as well of co-workers asking you questions as well that simulate a typical work conversations in the office. To prepare for this, study Amazon's Leadership Principles. I could tell throughout the simulation which principles each problem was probing me for. To be successful in this you really have to know the principles and what they stand for. For example, ALWAYS choose the customer first. No matter what the scenario. Amazon's first leadership principle is ""Customer Obsession"" and if you don't demonstrate in the simulation then it will hurt your chances of moving on. You get 90 minutes for this and again you probably won't need all 90.

**FINAL ROUND INTERVIEW**

As you probably guessed, I spent most of my time doing Leetcode preparing for the final round interview. I was first introduced to Leetcode about a year and a half ago. I am no Leetcode wizard but I had experience with it and had done probably 200 different problems at this point. DO NOT try Leetcode for the first time after you get your final round interview. Unless you are a genius, 2 weeks isn't enough time to properly understand all of the concepts and perform well in an interview. I had been on and off Leetcode for a year but a couple months before I started applying to internships, I would do 1 question a day, 5 days a week, just to stay fresh with all the concepts. I had a Software Engineer friend pick out questions and assign them to me as he was familiar with the types of questions interns get asked. I stuck with this 1 question, 5 days a week process even when my final round interview was scheduled.

Also, a couple of days before the interview I went over leadership principles again and googled ""Amazon Behavioral Interview Questions."" Each behavioral question is geared towards a leadership principle. So, I wrote about a time from my past experiences for each leadership principle ( that exemplified that principle). That was really all I did for behavioral, spent a couple hours doing that.

Okay so for the interview, I hopped on Amazon Chime (Amazon's version of Zoom). The interviewer hops on the call and lays out the interview process for me. He says we are going to introduce ourselves and then he will ask some behavioral questions, then he will ask a technical question and we will finish off with questions for me to ask. After saying all this, the first thing he asks me is ""are you good to go, do you need to get some water or something."" Honestly, I laughed. I wasn't expecting that and the laugh made me relax a bit and I could already tell the interviewer was friendly from the first few minutes. We introduced ourselves and moved to behaviorals. He asked me two behaviorals with A LOT of follow ups to each question. I wasn't happy with my answers for the first behavioral but I thought my 2nd behavioral was good. We moved to the technical question and at this point we had like 20 mins left. The interviewer prefaced by saying ""I know we don't have much time left so I don't expect you to solve this but I just want to see how you think. Be sure to communicate."" Immediately  (in my head) I was like ""whoa I don't have to get this right."" This calmed me down even more and I just focused on explaining my approach before coding. I probably spent 8 mins just talking about what I wanted to do and going through a couple examples before coding. Once I started coding, I continued to explain what was happening in every line (in reference to my original explanation of my approach). After finishing coding it, I ran through an example to make sure it was right and I was wrong... LOOOL. I didn't even realize, the interviewer had to stop me. So, I made a quick fix, ran through the example again and it worked. I ran through one more different example and I was wrong again lol. At this point I got cut off because we were out of time but the interviewer said ""Thank you for communicating and I know where you were going with this."" Lastly, I just asked him some questions about what he does on the job.

I left the interview with mixed emotions. Like I said, I wasn't happy with the answers for 1 behavioral and I didn't correctly solve the technical question. But, the interview itself went really well. It didn't even feel like an interview, more like a conversation. There were multiple times where I made them laugh and they made me laugh. Honestly, my interviewer was a legend, we got along really well and they made me feel relaxed the whole time. I was hoping this was enough to hire me. 

**CONCLUSION**

As I said earlier, I did get the offer. What I took from this interview process was that COMMUNICATION IS KEY. Even all the way back to part 1 of the Online Assessment, I didn't solve the 2nd question but I communicated what I was trying to do in the comments. Real engineers read your code, its not just some machine so if you can't solve the problem, don't just leave a broken program, write what you are trying to do. In the interview, I communicated my ideas very well, even the interviewer was impressed. But I didn't just talk, I wrote down what I was thinking on the code screen. As I ran through examples, I wrote all my variables on the side and changed their values as I ran through my program to simulate exactly what was going on in the code. I believe it was things like these that got me hired. Amazon doesn't provide feedback so I won't know for sure but communication was a theme I noticed emphasized in other threads and I really thrived at it during the interview process. Also, knowing the leadership principles is important. It is probably the easier part of the process. It is just reading and understanding what Amazon values in employees. As CS Majors that should be fairly easy for everyone. Again, with respect to Leetcode, you don't have to be a genius, just spend a good amount of time practising beforehand (particularly mediums as that is what they ask interns). Remember, Amazon isn't looking for interns to save the company. They are looking for interns who they can train and develop into strong full time candidates. So, if you show you are teachable, you think well, communicate well and are willing to learn, you have a great shot of getting hired.

I hope this information helps anyone along the way in searching for internships whether it be Amazon or some other company. If you have any questions feel free to ask! 

God bless 🙏"

Both internships are in Seattle. Both companies I think do very meaningful and interesting work, but I imagine the variance in team quality at Amazon would be higher.

Pros for Amazon are:

1. Higher pay. It isn't terribly important for me, but it is a non-trivial difference (53/hr vs 43/hr, not including Amazon's housing stipend)
2. Better name? Although Panopto I imagine is a fairly well known company as well.

Pros for Panopto are:

1. Support for hybrid work, so I can spend time with family and work remotely for small periods of time.
2. Smaller company, which might mean more individual attention/learning opportunities.
3. People at Panopto seem really smart and I like the company culture a lot.

I plan on getting a job after my MS program which aligns with my interest in ML, Distributed Systems, Blockchain. To give a brief introduction about myself, I did my undergraduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering but always wanted to study Computers. For spring I got admits from CMU ECE and Columbia CS. 

The average salary package for a graduate in MS CMU ECE and MS Columbia CS was around the same. I even checked out the destinations and seemed to be equally great.

The only difference seems to be the internship opportunity and the program length. In CMU I opted for applied advanced program which allows me to do my internship in the summer and is 4 semesters long(graduation in Dec 2023) while in Columbia it's 3 semesters long(graduation in May 2023) and I don't think I would be eligible for an internship in the summer.

Based on these factors, I felt CMU is a better option because I would be able to do an internship and complete more courses during my master's.

I wanted to know if my reasoning is correct, if I missed any factors and what you guys think would be a suitable program for me. 

Please note again: In CMU I have been admitted to ECE and not Computer Science.

ridtdt,297,2021-12-17,Just your typical mass-scale infection.,ZanaGB,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/ridtdt/just_your_typical_massscale_infection/,"I'll set up the scene as best as i can:

I was one of two people fielding helpdesk support for a very large client. They subcontracted their L1 support to our actual employer, a small call centre where generally everyone was forced to support a myriad of clients I was lucky enough to dedicate myself to one client only, but that was becaus we were a two-person team (me, and some intern that rotated every 3 months) to field all the calls, and receive all the support inquires for this said client. close to 2000 users on two main locations with about another 1000 in satellite locations all over the world. This basically mwans we were swaamped all the time, and we were on the hook 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. This means that whenever a large-scale outage happened, we would absolutely be destroyed. And since we were L1, and outsourced, we'd receive the blame for all the downtime, despite being largely unprepared to support this.

With this background information laid off, we can now look at the story, proper.

It all started one Monday morning. One of our problem users was having their usual problems, which usually involved six AD account resets in the span of 3 hours. However, this particular bit of information sparked some interest on me. They were getting filtered out by Google. So he couldn't google up his favorite newspaper, i mean, do important extranet business.

We, as lowly L1 minions, were very limited onto what we could do. But one of the things we could do is clear all of the internet browsing related items from Internet Options on Windows, then on any affected browsers. And ironically, that worked. the blockage issues stopped. Or so we thought.

I logged the ticket, appended a call transcript, assigned to ourselves, and closed the ticket. All was fine with the world.

Until it wasn't.

This user came back later, again with the same issue, seems like every time they restarted the machine the issue would persist. Since we were L1, we did not have access to adminsitrator-level accounts, so our hands were tied. we checked the computer, saw no abnormal processes going on, and we reset the cookies once more. Log ticket, set as duplicate from parent, close, solve with the same resolution.

Repeat this for Monday and Tuesday. Wednesday was starting to get a bit more suspicious, with the calls being more frecuent. Concurrently, the department this user came from were busy figuring something out with their mailboxes. By the end of the day, i suspect something must be going on with the network, or maybe there's a rogue device. I ping L2 about it by escalating the latest ticket on the saga with all the info about the parents.

Cue Thursday, and a telephonic ass-chewing from the head of IT for being innefective and being unable to find the root cause and to step it up and to stop doing the same fix again and again. I bring up with L2 we have no administrative rights. We can't do anything but things the user can do themselves. And clearly something is seriously wrong with that user. For the next 5 working days, the process is as follows: Get multiple calls of this user, field their respective tickets, merge them and send them to L2, Networking, or Security. Absolutely nothing gets done and our tickets get bounced back with snappy responses to just fix it. This continues until the end of the week, with me begging L2 and Neworking why is there a serious problem on that department network and if there's any reasons why their outbound IPs are getting flagged. With no luck.

The next week starts as the last one ended, taking care of that particular user for the totality of the day. However, something else starts to happen that piques my interest. Finally, something that is NOT the same issue over and over again. People are starting to get their mailboxes go awry, exchange takes forever to download new mail, and """"old mail"""" is being delivered again, because email is for chumps, these people talk amongst themselves about these old mails. Turns out this would be an interesting factor for later. We proceed by erasing these duplicate mails, fixing and compacting their OST's and PST's and life moves on. We are not really allowed to look at people's mail even while remoting, so we rely on our users to know what they want deleted before doing so. 

By Friday of week 2 we get the attention of L2... because we were doing absolutely nothng apparently, and these issues weren't getting solved. At this time, we start seeing other users getting the same error as our probem user had the week prior, they are starting to get blocked by google.

Finally, on Monday, our issues start to be taken seriously, and Networking is finally checking the problem out beause at last the outbound traffic is starting to get a tiny bit OUT OF control and they have to look at it. By around this time, we actually get a call about the mailboxes again, and the old mail again. Except, the user of this call doesn't have anyone to talk to nearby, so they opened the mail to find the title of the email, the body of the email, and the enclosed attachments were all different, but they were all named after things that were sent previously, except with a few more links formatted on the body text. we check the sender, and lo and behold, it's forged. We are getting a mixture of hyper-targetted attacks and clearly a breach of information, as at the very least mail is being read and contact lists are being exfiltrated. We ask the user not to open any attachments or click any links, and to contact us when they get more of these.

Turns out that, our little two man team is fielding so many calls about google blockages and emails that we are not doing other calls and users are complaining, and our metrics are falling! Awesome!. This of course gets L2 angry. We tell them we're escalating all of this to security since clearly something is not right. and to PLEASE look at it. The penny drops, to us, at least, that at the time where users get blocked by google, we find a lot of fake emails being sent to users of this department, and now out of it.

It's outright pandemonium. Finally, after lunch of Friday of week 3, all our tickets dissapear, and securrity is taking a good look at the issue. The issue is finally over, or so we thought.

Cue monday of week four. And early in the morning we start getting calls from an adjacent department mentioning all their shares are busy. We ask the user to reboot, and to our surprise, once they reboot, they can access their shares alright, but all the data is gone. Recent from our security scare, we ask if they opened any suspicious mail, and sure enough, they received an old mail, with an old excel, with a newer modified date, the user dutifully replaced the old file with the new one, on the network share, then opened it, and allowed macros. Next thing we know everything was gone. L2 finally took us seriously when we escalated the ticket, and, as far as we know, they had tape backups from Friday so all people lost was one day of work.

We never knew what was going on but the emails stopped and google lifted the blockages. From what I could piece together, this problem user at the beginning got infected by a hypertargeted malicious emaiil, that got over their address book and sent mails to everyone and their mother, alongside doing some outbound requests i'll never have enough info on. because this particular department was phone based, they didn't have much in the name of network shares, so the infection was mostly controlled. other than everyone on that department sending their address book more mails like that. The few emails that managed to escape out were either filtered, or removed by savvier users.

Honestly, the only takeaway i got from this story is that i was incredibly naive ( happened like a month onto my position ), and i could've perhaps looked onto that problem user's mail to see if anything was fishy. The other takeaway is that L2 didn't take us seriously at the time, and they just took us a little bit more seriously after the fact.

The takeaway i wish the users got would be to properly screen their email, and try to watch out for attachments and phising attempts.

End note: This happened around 2017. I've held up for this story for 4 years in hopes that my former client has fixed their issues already. Despite having worked there for 3 years, work there was traumatic enough that only really this one story remains somewhat intact on my memory, but details are fuzzier than i'd like, and i probably remember it due to the intense ass-chewing from L2 for trying to do our job to fix this thing. I am well aware i am overly verbose for something that can be summarized as ""Malignant Email goes Nyoom"".  However i do hope you enjoyed this regardless, and apologies for the length."
riehx1,18,2021-12-17,I hate my father because he's so fucking stupid - talking to him decreases my IQ points,Flashy-Disaster-6032,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/riehx1/i_hate_my_father_because_hes_so_fucking_stupid/,"For starters, he would make me do basic computer stuff like sending emails, printing files, etc. He's not even that old (late 40's), other people his age could do these stuff easily. He also had experience with a computer while he was still working in some office years ago - he should know these stuff. I would teach him how to do it but he will be ordering me again to do it for him - this time, I'll do it in front of him, teaching him (AGAIN) at the same time. And then the next time he will order me to do it again, the cycle goes on and I just gave up on teaching him.

He would also ask me questions he could just google. He's ALWAYS on his phone, it only takes few taps of his fingertips to get him the answer. But when it comes to important stuff like legal documents, he thinks I could just get a sample from the internet and change some stuff for him like it's magic. He gets mad at me when I wouldn't do it - WELL OF COURSE I WOULDN'T, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD, it's common sense. 

AAAAND wait for it..... HE FUCKING BELIEVES IN FAKE NEWS. He thinks COVID is a conspiracy, Metformin is bad for him so he doesn't take it (He is diabetic and it was prescribed by a doctor), He believes our country's years of dictatorship was the best years in history and the dictator was the best president our country had. He absorbs every shit piece of information from the internet and rebukes facts proved by experts. Educating him with the right information would just end up in a heated argument and he scolds me for debunking shit he believes. 

I'm a graduating college student with back subjects, working on my thesis and internship - I'm so stressed right now and he would always **ALWAYS** find a way to get on my nerves with his stupidity. I'm so tired of him and I can't wait to move out and forget about his existence."

rig4up,2,2021-12-17,So confused. Its a long post.,shamansam,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rig4up/so_confused_its_a_long_post/,"I've been working a construction company for a little over 4 years now. I manage the logistics for all 20+ jobsites. I wont go to far in to detail about the ins and outs of what I do. I've been pursuing higher education and I'm one semester away from a associates business. I work under the vice president of the company, who is where most of the problems occur from. When I asked about what it would take to grow further in my position I was told I needed to go to school for construction management. That I had reached the ceiling in my current position. (mind you this position did not exist and I created it.) So we had a conversation between myself the president and the vice president. The plan was (not in writing) that once I had a year of school under my belt they would begin to bring me in once a week to start learning estimation. Here's where it gets real tricky. That commitment was not honored and were 8 months past it. I've been working for 4 years as 1099, 50+ hours every week for years. There's no overtime, there are no benefits aside from gas for my vehicle. The vice president is very quick to point out the benefits of being 1099 how its better for me. (completely false). I suppose I'm just trying to get some clarity as I feel so lost. Everything has come to head yesterday evening. 

I went in to the presidents office, to have a conversation about some upcoming jobs and get some information together. Somehow we ended up on the conversation of school. I explained I was apprehensive to commit to another 2 years of construction management, as I was paying for all the schooling. The fact that none of the commitments had been honored was making me nervous about taking on any more financial burden. As soon as i brought up the commitments the president looked up at me and said ""Are you calling me a liar?"" I tried to explain to him that was not my intentions. He proceeded to repeat that about 7-8 times. Then threatened my job by saying i could replace you tomorrow. I didn't say a word, just sat there quietly. After a few minutes he calmed down and apologized for what he said. Then proceeded to explain how if i go into estimation that i would be paid to much as he only pays interns xyz. 

Some context for my confliction.
This president also owns the halfway houses that I lived in. I was a homeless heroin addict, and found myself in a rehab. After rehab i moved into the program he owns and founded. I began working for him as a mechanic, and out of seeing a need began building the position I'm in now. I am very grateful for everything he has done. The problem is now that I'm trying to further my career or my families future. Every time it comes up the conversation always comes back to I'm not being grateful or I'm delusional about what direction I'm going. 

I'm tired of feeling like I cant go any further because I'm stuck in this position. I've asked for opportunities to learn, without asking for more money. I've paid my way through school for a position that they have said requires it. I've haven't seen any motion in my career or had any of those commitments honored. I'm just trying to grow my families future and not have my son and wife in the same childhood I had. I don't feel like I'm asking a lot. I know this may sound a bit like a rant. That's just the encounters with the president. The vice president whom I deal with the most, is constantly reminding me and the staff under me that were replaceable, that we should be glad to be 1099. Amongst things like gossiping about his office staff, taking advantage of employees situations for his leverage. I could go on for a while. I guess I'm posting this here because I'm scared to death that I wont be able to provide for my family if I quit. I don't even know how to describe my position effectively for a resume. I don't even know where to begin. Were a one income family, and we've been kicked in the teeth (just like everyone else) by life lately. I just want to grow and provide for my family, and not be miserable all the time. I cant really talk about it to anyone because they are all connected in some way and I've watched them make someone quit when they find out there looking for other options, and I cant risk that for my family's sake."

 - APUSH Teacher: 10/10. I’m certain this one was excellent. Knew him since freshman year, advisor to clubs I’m really involved in. I see him as a mentor figure and he genuinely knows more about me than my own parents. He has a lot of faith in me and has expressed to me numerous times that he thinks I’ll be fine wherever I go. He has really helped me a lot throughout these past years.

 - English teacher: 8/10 I think. Relationship with him wasn’t as good as my APUSH teacher but he always spoke very very highly of me in my comments and report cards. He’s also an AMAZING writer so I wholeheartedly trust him.

brown video portfolio: pretty average, just talked to the camera while showcasing some of my artwork.

Essays

- My common app essay imo was very very strong. I had several former admissions officers look over them and they all agreed that it was fantastic, one even cried while reading it. Super proud of it as it really tied my narrative of being a politically active Asian girl together.
- Supplements weren’t as good as my common app but still pretty strong. Had counselors and former admissions officers look over them.

Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)

* Brown ED lmao 

Additional Information:
Just elaborated on the legislative project that got turned into a bill and other research projects I did in my additional info box.

I also submitted an art supplement to Brown which I think was strong considering I’m generally a very good artist. I’ve been drawing ever since I could pick up a pencil and it’s one of my greatest passions.

I don’t know why I got rejected, it truly came as a shock to me. I didn’t expect to get in but I thought I would at least get deferred. I’m not gonna lie I’m a bit angry and more than just a little confused. I would give anything to know why I got rejected lol. I’m not planning on changing anything about my app moving forward, I’m genuinely really proud of my accomplishments and am happy with how I presented myself."

I have completed my bachelor in GIS Engineering and it's been more than a year of me searching for a job. It's been really tough. It seems like no big company has a requirement for an entry level GIS guy, they all want experienced developers and engineers.
Now regarding smaller companies some have contacted me but the salary they are giving is just laughable like the ones you would get in an internship or even less than that.
Now, I can join any company regardless of how much salary is for the experience mainly but I want to join a good company which can give me a nice platform to start my career.
What are your views on this?"

Typing loosely on my phone so forgive any formatting inconsistencies.

• networking: this is a must for pretty much everyone - especially for those with backgrounds that get overlooked (sub 3.0 gpa, no related experience etc.). Actually have an interest in the person you’re speaking with, come prepared with questions and research their background before. Assuming the conversation goes well, these people will typically vouch for you when a seat opens.


• Experience: Lots of conflicting views on this, but don’t be afraid to take an unpaid internship in a field related to what you’re seeking. In some cases this may be the most practical way to gain experience 
    • Leverage: another level deeper as it relates to experience, be able to convey that you can use your past experiences when interviewing for the role you seek

• Know your story: I can’t tell you how many times I’ve asked people “Why IB/finance” that gave brutal answers. This requires self reflection. 

• technicals: yes, you need some sort of technical ability to hit the ground running/execute once you actually land the role, but this is not the end-all-be-all. Have familiarity with modeling (DCF, 3 statement, LBO etc), PPT/excel and know how to google/youtube what you don’t know. Take WSO/WS, udemy courses or whatever free resources help you learn best

• Interviews: there’s a lot to cover here, but I’ll leave one piece of advice..be genuine - we can sniff this out a million miles away. In some cases, have seen interviewees ruin their chances through email correspondence alone. Bankers (and a lot of sharp finance professionals) easily pick-up on demeanors and grammar/format errors in emails 

• also, have a polished resume on hand instead of having to fix it for 3-4 days..we could have already closed off resume drops by then and this is an unfortunate way to ruin your chances for a role

I’ve helped a ton of people land finance/ib roles and these are some of the bigger items that come to mind.

Hope this helps.

ril03e,6,2021-12-17,Left my Job of 5 Years Over Wanting to Work Evenings,[deleted],antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/ril03e/left_my_job_of_5_years_over_wanting_to_work/,"This happened two years ago but a conversation with my friend reminded me of it.

I worked at my provincial cell phone company for 5 years. It's a crown corporation which competes with other major telecommunications companies. I had moved into a steady position as what was called a ""coordinator"". Basically I got the same pay check as other people (union gig), but instead I was the go-to guy for troubleshooting weird scenarios (my house burned down, I got international data charges, etc.) and taking customer escalations to a manager. This job takes years to get to because of all of the unique situations one has to learn, all of the systems one has to learn, etc.

I really enjoyed the job but I felt like I was spinning my wheels there. I have an education degree and I wanted to give it a proper shot. I reached out to my old principal from my internship for a reference and he mentioned he knew of an opening. It was mine if I wanted it.

Keep in mind, I was considered ""casual"" at this job. So it wasn't like I was asking for a dramatic change in my position. 80% of the time, I was working evenings and weekends because of seniority. I told my manager about the new position and she raised the prospect of me working evenings and weekends (4 PM - 8:30 PM). Since this was the height of COVID, I was working from home at both jobs so I could immediately hop from one job to the other.

Director turns down my request flatly. He says that if I don't commit myself fully to the company he doesn't really want me there. Meanwhile, at the time, I was only getting about 20 hours anyway from them. So basically, we won't give you full hours, but don't go anywhere. The director knew me personally and I was discussed as a potential new manager on more than one occasion. The director essentially tried to play ""Chicken"" with my career.

Long story short, I'm on my 2nd year of teaching English and Creative Writing. It became incredibly clear to me that my expertise wasn't valued and that I was nothing more than a cog to this person. My request was very minimal and they ended up losing five years of experience and a motivated worker all for some weird power play.

Reasons I’m thinking about transferring after a year:

1. I want to join student organizations at my university and gain experience for my job. I’m a business major and want to get a good leadership position in a club by my senior year.

2. I want yo get an internship my sophomore or Junior year. I want to get an early internship to gain as much experience possible.

3. I feel like I’m missing out so much and being at home is boring. I want out and I’m tired of sitting back at home it literally sucks when I could’ve been going to football games and parties.

4. Home isn’t suitable for college student. I have a bunch of chores and tons of responsibilities at home physically and financially and it gets stressful especially on top of being a full time student and working a lot of hours.

5. I strongly believe I can get a large scholarship to university because I have high grades plus I saved a year of at community college I won’t be in the worst financial situation. Nothing on this path is guaranteed but gosh I wanna go off so bad.

Reason I’m thinking about staying another year at home

1. Money/ another guaranteed year of free college"

I am a senior in high school. Please be brutally honest, and tell me where I should apply as well!

DEMOGRAPHICS:

Gender- Male

Family income- 40K per year

Race- Mixed (Half Caucasian, Half Asian)

State-New York

Type of School- I go to a public high school

Hooks- Very fluent in Japanese and passion for addiction recovery 

STANDARDIZED TESTING:

SAT- 1550 (1560 Superscore)

SATII- 800 Biology E

GPA:

UW- 92.27 because my freshmen year was very rocky. I got an 80 first semester of freshmen year because my father’s alcoholism made my home environment very unstable, and him being suicidal affected me mentally.

COURSEWORK:

Only took 3 APs- AP World, APUSH, and AP JAPANESE. I am taking AP Psychology, AP Macroeconomics, AP STATS, and will take AP GOV and AP MICRO second semester. My school limits the number of APs you can take depending on your GPA, so my low GPA in freshmen year kept me from taking more APs.

AWARDS:

Two school records for track (4x200m and 4x100m)

2nd in speech contest for Japanese school

5th overall in school history for 55m

AP Scholar with Honor

Tasked with saying the graduation speech for Japanese school

EXTRACURRICULARS:

Track and Field- Captain of the team and member for 4 years. I also run a 23.00 200m, so if I work hard over the summer, I have the potential to hit low D2 or high D1 times.

Japanese school- I have been attending a Japanese weekend school every Saturday for 11 years. As a result, I can read, write, and speak Japanese.

Japanese school student body- I am the president of the student body in my Japanese school, and I was Vice President last year. I was able to create an Instagram for the student body, and I have started posting podcasts on there with students.

Addiction recovery organization- Ever since my father passed away due to alcoholism last November, I have been very involved in the addiction recovery community. I help facilitate “Teen and Young Adult” recovery meetings for this organization, and I have even appeared on their “Teen and Youth Program” videos. I have also wrote 2 blogs for them!

Internship at AIMS- AIMS is a lab internship where we research the science behind addiction. 

Fundraising project - I started a fundraising project this year for people in the entertainment industry undergoing addiction issues. My dad was in the entertainment industry himself (Professional DJ), so I started this project hoping I could assist people like him. We have earned $1500 so far

Tutoring organization- I am the president of my school’s chapter for a tutoring program where we tutor children aged 6-12 who are less fortunate than we are.

Translator-Working as a translator for a small Japanese company, posting English posts on Instagram for them to attract American customers.

DJing- this is more of a hobby but my dad taught me how to DJ, and I’ve been doing it for friend’s birthdays and whatnot.

ESSAYS: 

Wrote about my sneaker head father’s addiction and how I couldn’t sympathize with him for indulging in self-detrimental behavior, but how by helping in his recovery I put myself in his shoes and it helped me to destigmatize addiction and look at things from a different perspective

LORS: 

My guidance counselor absolutely loves me and gives me credit for what I have been through, so she definitely wrote a good letter for me.
My APUSH teacher and Physics teacher have also seen me at my worst (when my dad passed) and my best (growing for it and actively participating), so I’m sure they wrote good recs for me as well.

Schools:

Accepted: UAlbany

Rejected: Stanford

Plan to apply: Vanderbilt (ED II), Duke, USC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, and some Ivies

Thank you for your time and have a wonderful rest of the day."

I am studying CS at uni (2nd year). 
My goal is to one day become a software engineer. 

The compensation they are offering is, compared to the average compensations in tech internships in my country, surprisingly not satisfactory. Therefore, my question is: would I gain more knowledge that would help me in my desired career path than I would if I just focused on university and on personal projects? Furthermore, would my CV be boosted by the name of the company so heavily that it would make accepting this offer worth it?

I would greatly appreciate any opinions, especially from people who have started out in Support Engineering positions and switched over to Software Engineering.

Thanks!"

So I just got accepted to Boston Uni for Master of Science in Applied Data Analytics program , and I have two weeks to reply to them whether I want in or not. The program begins on January 20th next year. But I am also applying for Northeastern University Master in Data Science for Fall Quarter 2022, and so far I receive no reply yet from Northeastern. I am really debating whether to accept Boston Uni's offer or wait for NEU. Some pros and cons I can think of

\-NEU is cheaper at about 1700 per credit while BU cost about 1900.

\-NEU has a Coop program where you are guaranteed works and internships after graduation. BU does not have the same program

\-BU program is shorter, about 16 months, while NEU's program is 2-2.5 years. BU also begins this January while I will have to wait until next September for NEU if I go to NEU. I want to finish the program early and get onto the job market sooner before the job market is filled with those having a degree similar to mine.

\-BU has a better reputation in my home country and in my home country school brand is everything. Since the US job market is terrible, I plan to go back to my home country if thing goes South and I cannot find a job here

So, should I pick BU ? Or should I wait for NEU ?"

rirj4k,90,2021-12-17,AMA: First Year Johnson student who just finished IB recruitment,ScurtScurt,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/rirj4k/ama_first_year_johnson_student_who_just_finished/,"I was going to wait until January to post this but have been seeing a lot of ""Johnson vs X"" posts the last few days and thought it would be more timely to do now. Mods let me know if I need to verify in some way. I will check back in on this post several times in the next couple days and try to answer every question.

I just finished my first semester at Johnson and will be interning at an EB in their generalist program this summer. Before business school, I worked in PWM at a BB. For stats: I'm a white male, I went to a state school undergrad, had a 3.6 GPA and a 710 GMAT with a few ECs but nothing seriously impressive.

I'm aiming to be as transparent as possible and have provided a lot of information in this post. I am happy to answer questions about Johnson, IB recruitment, IB questions in general, Ithaca, etc. In terms of recruitment, I will not be able to speak too much to anything outside of IB, as the IB process is very separated from most of the others.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE IB PROCESS AT JOHNSON**

* **The finance club:** The process is run through the ""Old Ezra"" Finance club. This club also manages people interested in corporate finance, asset management, and investment management but those are separate verticals than IB and make up a small percent of the club in comparison. The club is run entirely by second years (as is almost the entire IB process) and has specific leadership positions for each vertical. It meets once a week and, for IB at least, provides details on what exactly needs to be done and what you should expect in the following week. 
* **The process itself (first part)**: The process starts in early/mid September and runs through early/mid December. It starts with presentations/events from the bank (some on campus, some on zoom still this year). After the presentation, some banks will do an initial blind resume cut while some will do an initial ""coffee chat"" before doing their resume cut. There are a couple iterations of this until Johnson's ""formal recruiting"" process begins in mid October.
* **The formal recruiting**: This is where things start to get fun. The length of this portion can vary from year to year but is typically 5-6 weeks. Every Monday morning, you will send out emails requesting to meet with banks that week. There are designated slots for Thurs/Fri and some banks stick to those while others do ad-hoc scheduling (thank you zoom) throughout the week. You then head to NYC usually Wednesday night and have a series of in-person interviews/events/etc. with the banks Thurs/Fri. This past year was very hybrid, some banks wanted in person and some stayed virtual the entire time. The banks then cut candidates weekly and reach out to those still in the process. You then repeat the following Monday with the banks you survived with.
* **Final rounds/offers:** Around the end of November formal first round or Superday invites begin going out. These then occur the first couple weeks of December and offers usually quickly follow. Johnson is unique in that it finishes most of its recruiting in December while other schools finish in mid/late January. There are pros and cons to this. It is great to have an offer going into the holidays, but occasionally some banks will place students on hold until January. This can put people in a tight spot - if they have an offer from Bank A in Dec but really want to go to Bank B, and Bank B wants them to wait until January it can be hard to ignore an offer in hand in hopes of one later. This isn't the norm though, most banks play nice and most offers (90%+) go out in Dec.
* **The banks**: Virtually almost every bank recruits at Johnson, and we usually send at least one person to the majority of them. I'll avoid listing out specific numbers but so far this year we have placed multiple interns at JPM, MS, BoA, Citi, Guggenheim, EVR, Moelis, Jefferies, WF, CS, RBC. We have other banks with one-off interns as well. Notable banks that don't really recruit here are Centerview (no presence) and Lazard (has a multi-school briefing, a few people had superdays there this year but is not a main bank here). PJT just started doing a more organized OCR this year. The Johnson alumni at banks push HARD to get more people to their bank each year and once you reach a certain part in the process with a bank the more recent alumni at the firm will actively help you and reach out to be a resource in most cases.
* **Unique aspects of Johnson**: The Johnson process is much, much more structured than what any of my friends at other schools are doing. They tell you what you have to do and by when. This includes what technicals to know by when, what types of questions to be prepared for by when, when to send emails, etc. This can be stressful but personally I liked the structure. Banks tend to give feedback that Johnson students are very polished and I think the structure of the process really builds that. Another thing to note is that Johnson gets into technicals much sooner than other schools. A lot of schools have the banks hold off on technicals until late in the process. At Johnson technicals are fair game early on, which can lead to some processes (especially some of the boutiques) requiring you to be consistently on top of your technicals week after week. 
* **Classmates**: I have zero negative things to say about my peers/classmates in the IB process. Everyone, including fellow students in my year, have gone out of their way to be helpful. Johnson IB promotes an atmosphere of comradery and it really shines through. At any time during the process I felt that I had 30+ people I could call and ask a favor from without hesitation. My class met up all the time to do technicals, talk about strategy, etc. Information sharing was also very common and encouraged. After getting destroyed in a tech screen a majority of classmates would immediately call whoever else they knew had that interview and tell them exactly what technicals were asked so they could prepare. I quickly became extremely close with a lot of my IB classmates and a lot of them are really good friends of mine now. You will get assigned a Career Working Group with two second years. The involvement of these CWG leaders varies, but mine were outstanding. I frequently called them as late as 1am on Sundays when bank cuts came through and they would chat with me for however long I needed to discuss strategy, how I was trending, etc. Multiple times they even shot a note to alumni associates they knew at a given bank to find out how I was trending/what I could do/etc. There's a lot of parts of the Johnson process you could be negative about but I personally don't think this is one of those.
* **Success rate**: The process is a grind, honestly it is likely more of a grind here than some other schools. From Sep to Dec I did 94 informationals/interviews across 17 banks, and took 3 to the final round. However, the success rate of those who complete the process is very high, with almost everyone except a few people getting an offer, and those people usually can find a smaller boutique bank in the spring semester. I say ""complete the process"" because a handful of people do drop out during it as they realize that IB isn't for them/they aren't doing well early on/etc. IB recruiting, at least at Johnson, requires you to be 100% all in on IB from the start, and if you aren't it catches up to you at some point. I would say the main factors of people who truly wanted IB and struck out are either people who did not follow the Johnson process or people who did not put in the required amount of work, either on technicals, deal pitches, or some other aspect.

**OVERALL JOHNSON/ITHACA** 

* An AMA I saw from a few years ago by a Johnson student said ""for better or worse you're stuck in Ithaca with your classmates"" and that's very true. The upside of this is you get to know your classmates very well very quickly and can establish some really great friendships, so if a close-knit community is a priority for you (it was for me) Ithaca almost forces you into that. There are enough bars to keep you entertained for two years, and hopping on party bus to do a winery tour is never a bad Saturday, but I won't lie and say it's an incredible place or anything. Having lived in major cities most of my life, it is a big adjustment. There's also an insane amount of hills, it feels like every direction is uphill.
* I don't have too much to say as of now about the broader Johnson community as the IB process feels **very** segregated during the first semester. You interact with almost solely other IB people. As for the classes, the first semester is two quarters of ""core classes"" that are, in my opinion, mainly aimed at people that are not from a business background. Personally these classes feel kind of irrelevant for IB recruits, as you are on an accelerated technical timeline, so by the time the finance class is learning what EV is you've been doing DCF technicals for weeks. They do allow you to test out of these before the semester, and if you are doing IB it is definitely worth testing out of at least 1. Johnson did recently implement a GND policy, so that can be help alleviate some stress during the recruiting process."

Open Curriculum: Talked about my experience in MUN and how I always looked at engineering problems through the eyes of both an engineer and politician. Transitioned to how a lot of schools don't offer Engineering+PoliSci programs, and then how I'd use the open curriculum to mesh these two disciplines. I think it's a lot better than how I just explained it. 8.5/10

I realized that the AOs really do evaluate admissions on a holistic basis. I wasn't outstanding in any area. I didn't have any national awards in any of my extracurriculars, didn't take APUSH, was an Asian-American male applying for a STEM major, and wasn't first-gen. However, in retrospect, I think I just tried to do a little bit of everything in high school and hoped for the best, which the AOs seemed to like. Glad it worked out. Can validate acceptance letter if you PM."

I told her I've actually been looking for some summer internships and I'm hoping I could put some of my knitting-code projects on my resume.

Turns out she works under her husband who's the CEO of a tech company so she gave me her husband's contact to reach out to him(I looked up his company, seems pretty cool ) and told me to keep in touch with her. 

I know this is considered networking and I knoe its important... but I don't know what to do? I guess my question is - what do I even email? Like ""Yo are you guys looking for an intern??"" How do I tell him I've met his wife without trying to make it seem too...ass kissy I guess? Or like I'm trying to use his wife for an opportunity?"

I’ve haven’t had any internships prior to this, so I want to do it. However, my friends are saying this would ruin my chances at IB in my upper years (I want to intern/work in AM/S&amp;T/IB). Still, it’s a very prestigious bank so I was thinking it could still leverage me somewhat.

Should I accept this offer? Thank you"

* Supps - they weren't the greatest, but far from the worst. I followed all of the Columbia Supp ""guidelines"" such as not mentioning NYC, focusing on activism, and omitting explicit music from my list prompts. I also think my reading list essays were solid, because I do enjoy reading for pleasure. Some of the books I listed were required books in Columbia's core.

**Interviews:**

I did not receive an interview for Columbia. My only interview this cycle was Georgetown, whose application I never ended up completing lmao.

* *Acceptances:* (list here): **Columbia University (CC '26!) Early Decision**
* *Waitlists:* (list here): **None**
* *Rejections:* (list here): **None:**

Withdrew applications from UMich, UCLA, UC Berkeley, CUNYs and SUNYs

**Additional Information:**

Looking back, I think it was definitively my writing that boosted my application. I'm happy with the results. I also think I stood out as a Pakistani male in a very STEM focused school. Most ppl at my school apply as STEM majors to Columbia Engineering. So that might've helped. I think my recommendations were also pretty solid. I genuinely adore both teachers and they have reciprocal feelings for me.

riuk0i,10,2021-12-17,Need advise on how to switch from a role in process development to bioinformatics/systems biology while working on a masters in bioinformatics,pmsingx365,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/riuk0i/need_advise_on_how_to_switch_from_a_role_in/,"I am a little over halfway through my masters in bioinformatics. I have been taking 2 classes a semester while working full time. I currently work in biotech in process development optimizing fermentation processes. I have 12 years of experience in the biotech industry including both industrial and Pharma, and I have generally done pretty well in my career. I would like to switch careers before finishing my masters where I can start getting some experience in bioinformatics/computational biology. The reason I want to switch before I finish the masters is because taking two classes while working full time with increased responsibilities has been really hard. I wanted to start implementing what I have learned in school at my current job (modeling bioprocesses), and get some experience that way, but I am too busy with just regular responsibilities to have extra time on top of doing school. I am hoping that if I am getting experience in the field I want to be in, I can maybe slow down, and take only one class a semester. Or if I am starting at a position that is less stressful because of decreased responsibilities, I can still take two classes without making my mental health issues worse. I can also not worry about the finishing my masters, and focus on moving up in my current role. However, I really do like bioinformatics, specifically systems biology, and I think I am good at it. 

I feel really lost, and not sure how to move forward. I don't want to slow down unless I am getting experience in the field as I am already in my mid-30s. Do you guys have any suggestions in terms of how to approach it? Is an internship a good idea at this point in my career?"

I am not concerned with the compensation of either offer - rather I am interested in people's understandings of both internships: which one is a better career step, pros/cons in culture of both, value of an internship at either. Any other information to keep in mind when deciding between the two is appreciated as well.

&amp;#x200B;

I also was fortunate to receive (n)on-sites at Jane Street and Facebook - is it advisable to go through with these? It is difficult to schedule around the holidays and I would rather not keep the other firms waiting + use the time for my own leisure."
riuxt4,9,2021-12-17,ED2 or take my chances RD?,Place_Then,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/riuxt4/ed2_or_take_my_chances_rd/,"I applied early action Harvard and was deferred. I am now worried that I will be rejected from the T20s in the RD round (I applied to almost all of them and some other targets/safeties). 

Demographics: Asian, Male, upper middle class, New York

Interests: Comp sci/history

Some of my awards/extracurriculars include for context: 

1. Regeneron ISEF 2nd place in category grand prize winner and special award (involved creating a grant-funded software that I pitched to NASA/government, no mentor)
2. 4th in United States at Academic World Quest Nationals 
3. Concord Review Publication (history journal with 5% acceptance rate)
4. Publication in edge computing journal (primary author) and presented at international conferences for a device I helped create with 4 other high schoolers
5. Publication in economics journal
6. Summer experiences: Boys' State, NASA internship...
7. Research grant
8. Writing Awards/newspaper publications 

Extracurricullars are kind of summarized above but I also created a history club with 100 members at my school where students participate in competitions my school has never been involved in before. I also had other tech-related projects. 99 average, 1550 SAT. I think my essays/recs are good.

So the ED2 options I am looking at are Hopkins, Vanderbilt, and WashU. Obviously, it is not guaranteed I get in ED2 either, but I think my chances will be higher. If I do not do ED2, I have applications ready to apply to all the ivies and many other T20s.

Any suggestions? ED2 (play it safe) or RD (take a risk)? Does Harvard defer and accept often (I am pretty pessimistic about this possbility tbh)? Do colleges value the research/awards I have mentioned as important--there seems to have been a shift twoards valuing community service more which I am weak in? I feel like it is going to be super competitive this year or maybe it is just me. 

Sorry if this is the wrong thread for this; I don't ever post here. Also, good luck to all applicants this year!"
rivs1u,1,2021-12-17,SWE Internship Decision Help (Atlassian vs Square/Block),Over-Hall6365,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rivs1u/swe_internship_decision_help_atlassian_vs/,"Hi! Just finished my recruitment for this cycle and having a tough time deciding between 2 main companies: Atlassian and Square (Block now) (both will be remote but can go to the SF offices for both). Definitely am happy with both of these options since both aren't too big, have good work/engineering culture overall, and seem to have pretty cool products to work on (think the project management and fintech space are both interesting). Wish I knew more about team/project but unfortunately none of them will be able to give any info until project matching starts. Think my main priority (since both seem like cool places to intern at) is which will help me out more in the future on internship searching (likely planning to recruit for internships one more cycle next year).

Main pros for each:

Atlassian:

\- decently higher pay (not that big of a factor for me tbh)

\- JIRA/Confluence products are pretty widely known so would be cool to work on

\- have friends who can vouch for the internship exp

&amp;#x200B;

Square/Block:

\- seems to be pivoted for growth (esp with the new change to Block and fintech on the rise, but not fluent in that space at all so not sure)

\- slightly larger brand name?

\- said that interns that go to other internships in the following year can still come back to Square full-time much more easily

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like both options are great, but right now I'm leaning just slightly more towards Square since I think it could be a cool place to potentially return full-time and may help slightly more with landing internships next year (potentially with other fintech companies)? But also haven't had many talks with past employees/interns and don't know details like what fulltime TC in SF Bay Area would be. Any info appreciated!"

I'm a second year trying to look for summer internships while also working on a few projects in the meantime.  My question is, does it look bad to put a take-home coding assessment project, that a company asked me to do and put it on my resume? 

A few of the companies I applied for had me create a project (one of them was a ticket-viewer CLI app that connects to their API and produces a list of test support tickets) , and I wondered if it would be a bad idea to put those projects on my resume. Thank you!"

rixlh5,2,2021-12-17,Play It Safe or Take A Gamble?,DirtyMetis,AskNetsec,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNetsec/comments/rixlh5/play_it_safe_or_take_a_gamble/,"Hey all, recently left 25+ years of retail/small business ownership and went back to school for IT/web development to initiate a career change and I'm at a bit of a crossroads...

Currently finishing up a 6-month IT internship with a neighboring county.  A position opened up last week for a Help Desk role, basically what I've been doing for the extent of my internship.  Decent pay for the area (a good deal more than I've ever made before), solid benefits, friendly and welcoming team, nice cushy government position, and I'm very likely to be the applicant selected.  It's the safe choice.  That said, I don't ""love"" Help Desk - it's a bit too similar to the customer service/retailing that I'm trying to get away from.

Prior to that position opening, however, I was approached by a recruiter about a possible Cyber Security Analyst opportunity.  3+ month Boot Camp, followed by a 6-month obligation to the recruiting firm at a wage slightly below the help desk position and eventual placement with a Fortune 500 company at roughly 1.5x salary of the county position.  Gone through the preliminary application processes, and it seems likely that I'll be a selected candidate for the program.  Recruiter has made the health care company I'd be placed with sound pretty good, but that's sorta their job, right? ;) Super excited about the opportunity, especially considering how difficult it is to qualify for ""entry level"" Cyber/NetSec in the area.  But I'm also a middle-aged career changer and don't necessarily have the luxary of pivoting to a different career/aspect of IT if I find I don't love the role, so it's a bit of a gamble.

&amp;#x200B;

Guess I'm just looking for some feedback on what some of y'all with experience in the NetSec sector think before I have to make a decision in the next couple of weeks.  Safe and reliable gov't Help Desk or take my chances with the health care Cyber Analyst?"
rixwge,30,2021-12-17,Just signed a fulltime offer after countless rejections as a humanities major,quierosentirmebiennn,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rixwge/just_signed_a_fulltime_offer_after_countless/,"I'm a humanities major and just signed a fulltime job offer in a technical role making 100k

I came into my university as a cs major, late dropped my intro programming class when i realized i couldn't keep up with the material (math is my worst subject). i remember crying to my college advisor who told me that I wasn't cut out for cs if I couldn't handle an intro class.

I agreed. I changed my major to a humanities focused major, i pursued side projects and my passion landed me an internship every single summer. after my junior year internship, i loved the company i spent the summer at and i was so bummed to find out a return offer couldn't be made due to budget restrictions on the team.

going into my senior year this semester, i applied EVERYWHERE. I interviewed in over 20+ companies, made it to the final round with Google, Microsoft, other great companies for PM related roles and received endless rejections.

I was so close to giving up and towards the end of November I received my first offer for 80k in a fully remote role and 100k in a company i preferred with amazing benefits. 

I accepted the second offer and I start in the spring once I graduate. I'm so so happy. It finally feels like my hard work paid off. The imposter syndrome is still there and will probs still be there once I actually start working but the journey has def allowed me to grow. Anyways thank you for reading this and if there's anything you can take away as cheesy as it sounds rejection rly is redirection and the journey is what makes the outcome SO SO worth it :)"

I saw a post on here about companies that pay over $200k+ coming out. I know that’s obviously not realistic to shoot for, but what can I realistically expect to make coming out of college?

Fortunately, I am grateful to have some good connections in my life that I’m going to try to utilize as well.

riyx7c,2,2021-12-17,SWE vs Software Analyst (Entry Level),VNormalizer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/riyx7c/swe_vs_software_analyst_entry_level/,"I’m a (22M) student getting a B.S in Computer Science. Graduating in May 2022.

For a background on my education, I go to a school in Georgia that is notorious for partying. Because of this, I was thrilled by the idea of being a well rounded student; so I joined Greek Life. First semester I did terrible and quickly turned things around. It has been a battle since then and despite getting all A’s and B’s I haven’t managed to get it above a 3.0. My first summer I got an internship but every summer afterwards I spent doing summer classes to catch up. Fast forward to now and I’m in my 5th year because of some stupid mistakes I made early on. 

I started my job hunt in October applying to roughly 60 companies, interviewing with 12, and got denied by most. 

I’m not going to lie, it was a little upsetting considering all of my interviews held for engineering positions denied me from the next stage in their process. I started to think that I didn’t have the experience needed for an entry level SWE position. However, one company where I had an internal referral at interviewed me for a Software Analyst position. I had initially expressed interest in a software engineering position but the recruiter told me that the company didn’t need SWE’s as much as they needed Analysts. So I continue down the Analyst path. One phone screen, one recruitment interview, and two technical interviews later they extend me an offer (~79k). This was exciting!! I finally felt valued somewhere. But a few days roll by and I start to lose that sense of excitement as I begin to weigh the daily responsibilities of an Analyst. While sitting on the offer, the SVP of the company emails me saying that they were extremely impressed by my skills and experience and that if I had any questions to reach out. So I schedule a meeting with his assistant and began the wait. 

I get into a Google meet with him and I ask the questions I had prepared:

* How do SWE’s and Analysts differ in this company?

* What is the career trajectory like in the Analyst position opposed to the SWE?

He explained that the Analyst helps with the development and testing of many project implementations and custom additions for clients, and that the engineers worked on the base software that is used in the implementation for clients. He also said that Analysts are more technical than their consultants and generally more valuable for business long term. 

It’s still unclear to me what kind of work I would be doing every day. I really enjoy problem solving and programming, so I don’t want to move away from that. How much less would I be writing code as opposed to an engineering position? 

Did anyone else take an analyst position as their first entry level job? If so, does it help or hurt your chances of getting a job as an engineer in the future?

Also, with there being only one semester left before I graduate, I wanted to get the job hunt out of the way so I can focus on my few remaining classes which is why I signed the offer letter. Should I reach out to them and ask about other opportunities in SWE within their company? Should I continue to apply to other places for SWE roles? Or is this Analyst position good enough for me to get my foot in the door? 

(For reference this company is based in Atlanta)

Any and all advice is appreciated."

**Academics**

* GPA: UW - 4.0/4, W - 5.345/5
* Rank: 2

   * 1560 (780 RW, 780 M)

*Straight from Common App*

1. Work - Worked at a local restaurant since 7th grade.
2. School ""Website Advisor"" - I made this EC up. I had noticed the dearth of information in my school community, so I spoke with administration and started my own ""position,"" doing research on and then making and sharing posters and other materials about school activities or good-to-know information for students.

**Letters of Recommendation**

AP Seminar Teacher - I had a great relationship with her, and seeing as my school is decidedly not competitive, she was really supportive in my process. I think she expressed full support. 10/10

AP Chemistry Teacher - English is a second language for her, and I'm pretty sure she wrote like 5 letters it in a single day, so my hopes weren't too high. She did pressure us to take the Chemistry Olympiad, though, and I did place in the state competition, so I have that I guess. 5/10

Guidance Counselor - Counsellor number 5 in four years. (I love my school!) Barely knew her but I filled out a brag sheet? 1/10

**Interviews**

Princeton: I started shaking and the whole thing was not great. I don't think it positively impacted my application.

**Essays**

Overall, I spent hours and hours editing and revising and trying to cram as much meaning, intellect, and personality into each and every word (thank god for Princeton's 50–100 word buffers). My personal statement was about my experience working and, with my other supplements, intended to explain how my background motivates me to make the world a more economically equitable place with more opportunities for disadvantaged populations. I only got one friend to read them, but I'd say the countless hours I spent on them paid off. At the risk of sounding vain, I say 9/10.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Princeton University, Restrictive Early Action
* University of South Carolina - Columbia
* Clemson University
* UVA - Echols Scholar
* Williams College

*Rejections:*

* I got rejected from a few Fly-In programs and QuestBridge College Prep Scholar (btw apply if you think you might be considered low income), so my hopes on December 16th were NOT high. You never know I guess.

**Additional Information:**

I submitted an art supplement, but it probably didn't help much. I just wanted to show another side of my personality.

I read these posts religiously, so I hope this is helpful to someone else! Please please please don't compare directly though. I know I have subpar ECs, but I had an atypical context, and I crafted a narrative with the few experiences that I did have. Also, if you have weird circumstances like me, SAY SO IN ADDITIONAL INFO! The admissions officers literally cannot know what they don't see on your application, and context might just make mediocre ECs ivy material.

I'm still in shock from my results. Stay in there, you most ambitious group of kids in the world. We're going to do great things!"

I dislike where I currently live, and while I'm not from there, my parents are so they are staying, and while I know plenty of people where I'm from, it's frankly too expensive to move back there...",FromLuxorToEphesus,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/rj3ofe/how_do_you_network_somewhere_where_you_dont_know/," 

Hello, I'm having difficulties making connections outside of the state I currently live in. I grew up in the northeast and now live west of the Mississippi in the midwest. I go to college here because it's too expensive to go back home at this point for college and all my family lives here. My parents moved out to the northeast because of a job but once that job ended they moved back to their home but not mine since I wasn't really from there.

Anyways, as I traverse through college and make connections, and internships, etc. I'm finding it difficult to make connections that I actually want. Additionally, even though I still know a lot of people back home, it's frankly too expensive to move back there (the cheapest 1 Bdr are about 1300-1400 dollars).

I would like to maybe move to Chicago or Philadelphia. But, I just got introduced to a good internship...back where my parents live through my mom. And like...yeah I guess it looks good on a resume but doesn't really help at all with leaving this area. I'm not really in a bad position per se it's just very depressing that I really dislike where I currently live but I can't go back to where I'm actually from.

Like my life has been a blank-slate since I moved here right before high school. I haven't had any actually good experiences. Haven't made any real friends. It's just tough to live somewhere that's not actually home for you but it is for the rest of your family. I just feel completely disconnected because so many of them have very different life experiences (it isn't all bad though with them.)

I guess how do you network somewhere where you don't really have any work connections? I've asked family and professors and though they've tried to be helpful, they don't really know anyone in either Chicago or Philadelphia.

Thank you"

First, I had to give them my resume, a cover letter, explain why they should pick me, and random questions such as ""what's a professional you had that...""

Successful made it to the 2nd stage. I had a 1 hour technical interview with a Data Scientist (coding skills, and machine learning theoretical questions).

Hooray, made it to the 3rd stage : they sent me an open exercise to. It literally took me more than 15 hours (more than the while weekend), because I had to write a detailed report about it.

After they reviewed it, they invited me on-site for two 1-hour technical interviews.
First it was a regular OOP coding test about hashers (the interviewer was watching my screen and helping me).
The second one lasted more about 1hr30. I was standing by a blackboard and had to answer more complex machine learning and deep learning questions.

One of the two interviewers told me he was okay for me to get the position, but that they had to discuss between each other first.

Next day, I receive an email for a ""last round interview"" with the data science director. The interview was on Friday, it lasted 1hr30 and there was also a team data scientist.

I had behavioral questions, and then had to solve a ML problem sharing my screen.
In the end of the interview, they asked me to work more on the code so that it is more efficient, and then to implement it on the algorithm I did for the previous open exercise that took me the whole weekend.

Here I am, implementing it and sending it to them on Monday.

Please, make it stop.
But also the more stages I pass, the more I want to get hired. People working there come from literally the best possible schools in France, and their headquarters are very appealing. Also the company is very well reviewed on Glassdoor (4.6/5), and they give a lot of importance to work life balance and hour flexibility.

Has anyone ever gone through something like that ?
Even when I got my Amazon DS intern position last year, it wasn't that hard."
rj47w8,17,2021-12-18,Laid off - need to vent,Adagio-Unlikely,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rj47w8/laid_off_need_to_vent/,"I just want to vent and hear if anyone else has dealt with anything like this.

I was hired for a digital content role in June- I was 27 and it was my first paid graduate role that I could obtain. Everything prior was customer service and unpaid internships. The inclusion of a role like this was suggested by their third party marketer and I worked 3 days a week, under the condition that if I showed value (enquiries etc.) then I’d go full time. There were two bosses, husband and wife founders of the small company, for the most part, wife “managed” my role.

When I first started they ignored me and I had to ask them what they wanted me to do. Once I got started, this led to a series of contradictory management approaches, one minute telling me that my writing is “beautiful” and next minute saying that it’s too formal, too “this”, too “that”.  A few weeks in she micromanaged everything I did, berated me in front of everyone and made me do work to delete it or edit it chock full with grammar mistakes and poor sentence structure. She even tried to get others involved with critiquing me, and one time she told me to post on social media without her checking it and she’ll go “cry in a corner”. Around this time I had to come up with a blog post concept revolving around an SEO keyword, and even though it’s my job, she came up with one too. Then she got husband to choose between ours in front of everyone! He chose mine. 

Then it hit October. The berating and rudeness continued as per. I had to advertise a job on LinkedIn. It’s not exactly a difficult thing to do that requires extensive thought. But, as with them, it needed a deep review. Unbeknownst to me, the task was then given to someone else - he didn’t even know himself. Then he had a look at what I drafted up, and in front of everyone he said “what do they want me to do? There’s nothing wrong with this”. Then enters the manager who starts having a little rant about how she doesn’t like the fact that I’ve used the word “penchant”. 


I felt isolated, and it was unjust because I’m one of the more competent and educated people there. Fast forward to November and half my social media posts are being deleted, and she is being rude and storming up to me to have a go at me all the time. Then she blew and shouted at me for no reason, causing me to cry - but she didn’t apologise, pinning the blame on husband instead, she even told me I’m too thin skinned because I cried. A week later she was talking to me like I’ve just asked her the world’s stupidest question again so I started looking for jobs (unbeknownst to her). Honestly, there’s word limits here so this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to her…

Then, I found out the seating arrangement was going to be altered and I was going to be left in a corner on my own, which sounded dubious. Then it’s December, she’s deleting everything for no valid reason and husband is one minute saying he likes my photography and next minute deleting it. Every time I do work and have to go through their countless revisions, they’re closing the office door to discuss it in depth, even though there’s nothing wrong in the first place. Then, small parts of my job are being discussed in front of me and allocated to others, and colleagues are telling her that this is my role. Husband was ignoring me and even had a pop at me when someone chose to sleep in the kitchen and I needed to use the microwave to…erm…eat…how unreasonable of me…

I was being bullied and I sensed that my boss wanted my role from the go, so whatever I did, she was going to make it out to be “wrong”. Yesterday  my contract was terminated. She ended up lying about the results, telling me social media wasn’t even on the assisted conversion chart when it had actually gone upwards - in my opinion quite a feat when they were suffocating me and deleting everything. She also said I needed more “guidance” from them, meaning I take up too much time, and they made a mistake in thinking somebody like myself with “basic” writing skills would be enough. Yep, the sheer audacity to tell me I have basic writing skills when she can’t even spell…

If it wasn’t me going through it, it would probably be laughable, they were joke professionals. But all the bullying, gaslighting, lying and then to fob me off right before Christmas… she was literally smiling whilst she told me! 

I’m glad to escape a bully because I suspect this woman is some kind of narcissist, but I’m concerned with finding another job since they basically chose to diminish my value and not let me do anything."

Here's some skills I have from college...

1. Project Management (Agile) with a few teams i helped do well on a capstone project and other team based projects with planning, assigning of duties, and handling conflicts.

2. Systems Development (OS Kernel Development in C and Assembly) with projects like cpu scheduler, paging table, memory management unit, custom file system. Also wrote a interpreter in Java for a custom language. Missed out on compiler design. Also took Computer Architecture 

3. Web Development (Ruby on Rails, Php with Laravel, Jquery) with projects like a hangman game in rails, a real world project with php using laravel, and a small banking application in php for a cyber security course

4. Cyber Security (joined Cyber Security club and learned some kali Linux and such). I did more self study on this field since my course in it was very limited on content. Cyber security club had capture the flag but I didn't get to attend every meeting.

5. Mobile Applications (using Java) with a team made a mobile app game for Android using Google maps location data

6. Data Structures and Algorithms (mostly just learning time complexity and different algorithms and data structures to use in given problems) and I did enjoy this course.

7. Game Development (Unity using C#) and made projects with a teammate like small scale destructible environments, A.I. based path finding, and other computer graphics related projects

Outside of college, my time dropped off to do tech related projects. I just mainly messed around with DS &amp; Alg material,  python, React, Go, and Rust. 

I seem to fall into the systems or possibly Web Dev world I think. My passions seem to be in Compilers, Interpreters, OS, DS &amp; Alg, and more systems related stuff. I'm not good at front-end but okay at back end dev. If I can get into systems programming related work or work with possibly performance than I'd be ok i think. I have no clue where to start or what to do to get a feel for these fields as career and job prep.

I'm curious on what options I have since im no longer a recent grad and have very little professional experience (internship in 2012). Any suggestions on my field of interests on what I can pursue and a career path are great. Also what other things I should of focus on that could help, or if there's skills I need to learn to help increase opportunities. Thanks!"

—-[[Previous]](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/rhaivj/octhe_humanmagellanic_war/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)—-

I decided to walk down the streets of Cape Town one last time. My room already emptied of all my belongings and my luggage waiting, in a corner at the academy’s entrance.

I liked walking around the streets, I enjoyed experiencing Earth’s different cultures.

I loved it since the day I first arrived. I had never been on Earth before then, but somehow this planet felt familiar right away. It felt like a home from when I was too young to remember, yet remaining familiar despite not having any memory of it. Like something buried deep inside my subconscious.

 Now I was about to leave this new, ancient home behind for my first assignment. I knew I was going to miss Earth, just like I missed home, but the excitement was too strong.

I stopped in front of the beach one last time, and looked at the endless sea. We had a sea back home, but it paled compared to the ones here on Earth.

I was interrupted from my thoughts by the alarm on my pocketpad. It was time.

I swiped over to the unread messages, to the one that would tell me the name of my new home. I had received it months ago, but had decided not to read it until the moment arrived.

I wanted it to be as much of a surprise as possible. I of course knew it was an Argo-class Battleship and that it was going to be from a Garrison Force, just like every other cadet. Or so I thought as surprise swept me when I finally read my orders.

&gt;Cad Emma Oliveira
&gt;&gt;PN 60010110083002
&gt;&gt;&gt;BB Buchanan (B484)
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;32-1 Sqn
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;01/09/3021 - 1/07/3022

&gt; Centauri Naval Spacedocks 4
&gt;&gt;01/09/3021 1530

I was stunned.

The 32nd fleet was the reason I joined the Navy to begin with, I was extremely happy while also being extremely confused. A maneuver fleet? Normally cadets are assigned to garrisons during their first tour of duty. Why then? I surely wanted to know, but above all, I was euphoric, jumping like I was a little girl once again.

The departure ceremony was unusually short. Perhaps to underline that this was not a graduation ceremony and that we were still cadets, about to embark in a glorified internship. We quickly boarded the shuttles, leaving Earth behind to reach our assigned postings.

In a few hours I found myself staring at the busy space around Proxima B. The shuttle soon turned away from the civilian lanes and made for the naval docks. The giant Centauri yards visible in the distance.

Thanks to MilMaps I managed not to get lost once I boarded the station and reached my gate safely, only to find it deserted.

Did I miss my movement? Was the first thought that came to my mind.

Then the gate’s door opened, and an officer came out. I immediately stood at attention, I didn’t need to know the rank to know I was outranked, I was a cadet after all. When I finally recognized the rank, I saluted.

“Good afternoon Captain.”

“Good afternoon Cadet.” He replied, sharply returning the salute. He then glanced at his watch before adding:

“You are on time, good. Now follow me.”

I quickly grabbed my luggage and tried to catch up with the fast walking officer.

“I hope you didn’t wait too long out there Cadet, we are busy preparing to get underway. Il’l show you to your quarters and let you settle in.” He explains without turning, keeping up the cadence.

“Aye sir!” I reply.

“Perfect, you will be assigned to the night shift at the beginning. Be ready at your quarters at 2045, someone will come by and pick you up.”

I reply “Aye sir!” once again, and followed Captain speed demon to the sleeping quarters, where he stopped in front of a door that had my name on it.

“Chow time at 2000 Cadet. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have deadlines to meet.”

I barely managed to salute before he was gone and I was left alone in the empty passageway.

When I entered the room I was surprised to find that the room was identical to the one at the academy, minus the window. With nothing else to do for the rest of the afternoon, I started to unpack my belongings.

rjhnik,8,2021-12-18,Coinbase vs. Uber Internship,apquestion,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rjhnik/coinbase_vs_uber_internship/,"Need help and wanted to hear thoughts from others on the two companies. No crazy developed interest in either industry, but I think I would find both equally interesting over the summer. Both basically pay the same over the summer. Optimizing for learning this summer not pay or even fulltime tbh since I have another summer for that.

I think pros with Uber internship is that I get placed on a team based on my own preferences, which I would want to try leveraging for a potential ML - SWE role if possible. With Coinbase I think I'd be secluded to something purely backend, which I wouldn't hate it's just that I would never end up trying an ML internship after this summer.

Anyone who interned at either that can speak to team placement / project / overall experience in the summer? "

\-----

*It had started with the darkness of* ***nothing***, and sometimes, that’s all one needs. Nothingness is greater a motivator than death itself in the pursuit to become something ***more.***

\- *Entry seven of the Primordial Tablets.*

\*\*

**\[Error #1617826 has been quarantined to locally affected area. Perish.\]**

Unmoving, the words hung before him, seeming to mock the man as he read them over and over again, hoping that his eyes were deceiving him. If they weren’t, he wouldn’t just be alone, he’d be caged, trapped within the sprawling crucible of the city, bound to war with beasts and unable to escape the dangers. Never truly. *No way...*

It was a vague memory, but Brock recalled the mention of **Error #1617826** during his time within the cosmos, though among the other rapid notifications and the general terror of the situation, he hadn’t paid much attention to it or anything else contained in the floating texts. But now, it was clear to him. *He* was **Error #1617826.**

And the System didn’t particularly seem to want him to leave.

Numbly, Brock entertained the idea that his odd phasing issue originated from the fact he was now deemed as an Error. The quest prompt had said he was trapped in a ‘fluctuating state of being’, which looking back at the apparent certainty of which he had died during the inception of the System, probably meant he was fluctuating *between* life and death, the System unsure of which to deem him.

""Oi...""

If he knew how he would have made the window reappear, but no matter what he said, thought or willed, the quest would not return to his vision. Collecting ‘the Original Life from the Source’ was the quest’s main and only objective, and Brock briefly recalled it stating that doing so would stabilise his fluctuations. While it didn’t exactly specify whether stabilisation would lead to life or death, he knew that failure would mean a certain passing, or at least an approximation of it.

Wiping the budding tears from his eyes, Brock shakily got to his feet and gave the barrier one last spiteful flick, “…Why is my life *so* bloody hard?”

Even an attempt to alleviate his inner turmoil through lonely banter fell short, and all he could feel was how confused, scared and in pain he was. He was quite frankly over it, but he had an inkling of understanding that to be stabilised would mean his status as an ‘Error’ should be nulled, granting him free reign to leave.

At least he hoped it would. *I'll die anyway if I don't find the Source.*

Currently, Brock’s life was a bumbling mess, with one outcome, or the other, or the one other than that leading to certain death, potential death, or a month-long incarceration before – you guessed it – death. There were no good options here, only chances. But if there was anything Brock was familiar with, it was chances.

He wasn’t a gambling addict. Really.

""Keep it together man,"" giving himself a light smack on the cheek and earning only a pained wince, Brock forced himself to remain clear-headed for the time being and began right back in the direction whence he came. Optimistically, he put himself under the impression that the System, as much as it seemed to be an ass, wouldn’t have given him a quest it didn’t think he could complete. Meaning somewhere within this barrier, was the Source.

Once again, hopefully.

The question to ponder on was what it actually looked like. *Green and glowing's a safe bet, but I doubt life's gonna be that easy for me.* Brock doubted that a place that housed such a nonsensical energy, the energy that seemed to be what transformed the entirety of the cityscape around him, would be so simple.

While he was feeling a bit of pressure on his shoulders to find the place, he didn’t let himself stress over it, as he was still left with an entire month to search. And, while the location wouldn’t be obvious, it also wouldn’t be anything but grand. Not when it was as important as it seemed to be.

And so began the mind-numbingly boring trek back. Sure, the sights were lovely and filled with a strange sense of mysticism, but they lost their original charm the second time. Still, his surroundings at least offered him something to occupy himself with, and he pressed onward. *What now...?*

Inwardly, Brock began to form a plan. He would return to the office, albeit remaining careful and keeping an eye out for roving Pontiacs, and scrap together a slew of supplies: some sort of pack, water, food, a weapon, bandages, that sort of stuff. Then, once it was all done, he’d set out on his search for the Source, hopefully locating it before the month ended. It was a solid plan, in Brock’s opinion.

*Now let’s just hope those assholes still aren’t around…*

A bit under a quarter of a day later, Brock was prowling low through the streets, eying each building with an insane man's suspicion, ready to detect any sort of movement or sign of prior activity. Soon, he happened upon the Subway where breakfast had served itself to him, and mutely, he gazed to the corpse on the ground.

From what he could tell, it was in the same spot it had been when he’d left, though he couldn’t be sure. The various wounds upon it had long dried up, leaving it to look like a mangled mess of crusted red. Brock gagged at the sight, and promptly left, marking the Subway as a potential food supply when he finally grabbed a backpack or something. *If there's one good thing going on lately, it's Subway.*

On the way back to the office, he did see a few signs of beast activity in the way of ruined storefronts and dried gobs of drool on the asphalt. Judging from the state of the drool, it had seemed to have occurred a while ago, potentially during his walk to the barrier, or even the trek they took to arrive at the Subway, though he was sure he’d have heard the racket.

""Finally,"" soon though, he laid his eyes upon the familiar structure of the firm he’d worked at for the past two years. Quickly, he stiffened. The front of it, while only sporting a shattered sliding door before, was in utter ruins, an ocean of sharded glass strewn across the immediate area outside of it, the steel frames that once held them twisted and chomped.

Brock shuddered at the mere thought of those steel rending jaws clamping down on his arm instead of the claws. If they had, he probably wouldn’t have those limbs anymore. *Lucky...*

Taking a second to breathe in and out, Brock cautiously crept into the building and looked around, feeling satisfied as he spotted nothing out of the ordinary, compared to the destroyed state of the building’s lower exterior. Shoulders sagging in relief, he accessed the stock room behind the counter, convinced by sight that the beasts hadn’t truly been inside.

Within, he found a variety of stationery; paper and the lot. Though, nestled in between it all, he located an old leather messenger’s bag, the one their intern had used a few months back to deliver the office workers their work-related mail. It wasn’t all that big, but it would do. Brock hung the sash over his neck and began to make his way up.

The top floor, aka the ‘party’ floor, was known on a normal day as simply the ‘break’ floor. There was a reason Brock had stuck to an office job, despite having wanted to do more with his life. While normal businesses had a break room, they were given an entire *floor*, courtesy of their boss, Michael. The man was a living legend, and it was easily agreed upon that he was the greatest boss to walk planet Earth.

They had even gotten him a mug to officialise it. *Wonder what he's doing now?*

That aside, Brock entered the place through the stairway and walked over to the kitchenette, arming himself with the only cooking knife in the drawer. For safety reasons, it wasn’t sharp, much unlike the glass shard he had used previously, but it wouldn’t injure him with every use, and it’d get the job done. Promptly, he dropped it into the bag, only to freeze a second later as he caught movement from the corner of his eye.

*...Uhhh.*

Slowly, he craned his neck in the direction of the movement, his eyes widening in horror as his gaze settled upon the familiar form of a canine, the beast standing guard to the entrance of the stairway. It studied him curiously, before tilting its head to the side, a quadrio of crimson eyes tracking his every move, regarding him with an idle hunger. Its jaws cranked open, revealing two rows of dagger-like fangs.

""Shit!""

Pre-emptively, Brock dove to the side, barely avoiding the pounce he knew was coming. He slammed into the ground a few meters away, the bulky form of the Pontiac crashing into the kitchenette and rendering it to nothing more than a mass of mere splinters and loose cutlery.

Before it had even recovered from its own crash landing, Brock was already up and bolting toward the door, intent on escaping quickly lest any other pack members came searching too. His fingers barely managed to brush the handle as he was thrown to the ground, claws goring his shoulders while the beast pushed him down with its weight.

""Hagh!""

Sprawled upon the floor and hissing with pain, Brock glanced over desperately at the kitchen knife poking out of his bag and reached out for it. Above him, he felt the heated breath of the Pontiac cling to his neck, the beast looming over him hungrily, ready to devour him whole.

Straining his arm to the very farthest it could go, Brock finally managed to grasp onto the knife’s simple handle and began stabbing blindly over his shoulder, feeling physically ill as he felt the blade savage the flesh of the beast. Whimpering in pain, the monster jumped away and fled from its position on his back.

It was caught by surprise, however, as Brock‘s free arm shot out and grasped tightly onto its back leg, causing it to slip and land sideways, smashing a few beer bottles underneath its frame. Brock was presented with a chance to kill the beast and escape and he wasn’t going to let it pass him by no matter what.

“...Sorry, mate.” While Brock had always had a sweet spot for dogs, the beast would kill him if he didn’t do it first.

Pushing himself from the floor to over the beast, Brock brought down the blade into its neck again and again and again, watching sorrowfully as it spasm and whined, until it finally became limp, rewarding the man with nothing but a surge of fear and guilt. Taking several deep breaths and thanking God that his fresh wounds didn’t seem to be as bad as they felt, Brock slumped over the corpse and cried, unable to allow himself to do anything else.

\*\*

It was a good five minutes of bawling his eyes out before Brock finally felt fit to move once more. He admitted that afterwards, he felt refreshed, as though it had allowed him to expel all his fears and uncertainties in liquid form. The experience was oddly cathartic, in a sad sort of way.

""I feel... like shit..."" sighing as he felt the new stains of blood on his ruined suit, Brock stood and wiped the crimson clinging to his blade on his already filthy pant leg, before stowing it away once more in his bag. Even after the decisive victory the fight ended in, he didn’t dare let himself feel relieved, as he wasn’t out of the woods yet. The scuffle between him and the Pontiac had created quite an amount of noise.

Silently, the bloody man snuck over to the vertical windows overlooking the city below, squinting his eyes as he tried to see past the vines and clumps of moss. Surveying the outside area the best he could, he soon became satisfied as he spotted no oncoming beasts prowling the streets below.

Until seconds later, when he was no longer satisfied, a furry black figure streaking past the window and forcing Brock to scramble back in fear. His eyes stayed peeled to the windows for almost thirty seconds before he slowly rose to his feet and looked out the windows once more.

""What... the...""

His mouth was left gaping while he looked down in horror, a disfigured mess of black fur and crimson gore smeared across both the pavement and road alike. It took him only seconds to remember where the unfortunate creature had come from, and he began to back away, glancing up at the roof mutely.

*There was three left… that means the last one is-*

Brock wasn’t even given the time to finish his thought as the ceiling began to tremble above him, straining against a series of pounding blows. Without hesitation, the injured man skittered out of the way, watching on grimly as the concrete ceiling slowly caved in, showering the room with dust and revealing a snow-white coat between the widening cracks. *I... I don't even know how to react at this point.*

Then, with one final shudder, the roof collapsed, exploding in an impenetrable cloud of grey and reducing Brock’s visibility to hardly a meter ahead of him. A cold sweat traced a path down his forehead, a familiar weight beginning to settle over the area and subtly push him to the ground.

As the curtains of debris finally fell, Brock set his eyes upon the snarling form of the clear alpha of the wolf pack. Its fangs were barred, stringy clumps of drool spraying from the sides of its mouth and slopping onto the small hill of rubble it stood upon. Contrary to its ivory coat, the monster’s teeth were a sickly yellow.

Six glowing red eyes studied his every movement with the same idle hunger as its lesser counterparts, its wetted nose twitching ceaselessly as it scented both the blood of Brock and that of its own. With its hulking form, the creature just barely fit in the bounds of the building, its bristling fur brushing up against where the ceiling had once been. *Ohhhhhh... shiiiiiiit...*

Shivering with dread, Brock glanced to the claws on the beast’s monstrous paws, each one longer than his knife and far sharper too. He had no illusions about coming out alive if one of them so much as grazed him with their obscenely dangerous edge. In fact, just in general, Brock was convinced his life was soon coming to an end.

It appeared to be almost lazy as it cranked open its gigantic maw, barring a triad of teeth rows and the blackened interior of its mouth, the flesh seeming to have begun to rot away and slough off. Brock gagged, able to smell the stench of it from even half a dozen meters away.

Not daring to meet the beast in the eyes, Brock stepped back and focused his attention on the name hovering above it, obscured by a series of question marks. It let him neither glean the level or title of his killer, even in death.

For now, he’d just simply call it the Alpha.

“Nice… nice doggy…” Brock’s voice was beyond shaky as he tried his best to placate the car-sized beast with his hands. He gradually took a few more steps back, attempting to put some distance between them. Even so, he knew it would end up being futil-

Brock wasn’t even granted the time to react as he was slammed by an incredible force. The vivid sensation of jagged fangs sinking into his torso imbued him with pain so blinding he almost didn’t notice the wind slapping across his face as they began to plummet toward the ground, the inherent power in the beast’s jump enough to shatter through the few walls separating them from the outside. *Oh... wow...*

Blood oozed from Brock’s mouth in sputters as the wind buffeted his matted hair. Defiantly, he spent his final moments gazing into the eyes of the beast that had spelled his demise, to which it responded by narrowing them in disdain. It was faint, but within Brock could see the spark of intelligence hidden in its own gaze.

However, it seemed fate had other plans than for today to be Brock’s last.

The office worker’s eyes widened as his body began to flicker in sparks of reds and blacks, his body slowly beginning the pass through the wolf, the monster being far heavier and falling far quicker. It spun around in the air and snarled at him in fury, raking its claws through his incorporeal form to no avail.

*I'm... phasing? Now?!* He could almost laugh.

That clawed strike was the last move the creature ever made before its body smacked into the street below and exploded into a gruesome puddle of guts and fur. Brock, however, fell right past, phasing deep into the earth before finally shooting back out as he regained solidity, landing on the ground painfully and soaking himself in the monster’s viscera. *Hah... hahahaha...*

Limp, he simply lay there, his own blood pooling beneath him and merging with that of the Alpha's. His neck struggled as it tilted upward and let him look at his torso. He didn’t even have the energy to gag at the sight, only grimace lightly. His organs were strung out the sides of his body, his midsection brutally torn open, stray pieces of flesh and his spine the only things keeping him as one whole. By now, the once blinding pain had been reduced to a distant ache.

*So, this is it huh?* Brock let his head fall back into the pile of gore and he stared up at the big blue sky above him, the sun beginning to show the signs of dusk. *I never got around to finishing The Office…*

As his vision slowly started to close in at the edges, a violet glow to the side of him caught his sparsely remaining attention, and he looked over, almost instinctually. His eyes laid upon the sight of a small purple crystal cradled amidst a clump of fur and muscle, no bigger than his fist. It pulsated lightly, illuminating the immediate surrounding in gentle radiance. A thin fracture ran through the centre of it, a luminous red fluid oozing out from within.

Just by looking at it, even as the edges of his sight became progressively more and more corrupted by the blackness of death, Brock could sense the immense, unadulterated power contained within the crimson liquid. It felt akin to the echoes in the void, though it was also different. One was a tempting promise, while this was a dangerous opportunity. *It's... pretty...*

Shakily, Brock reached his arm out and grasped the crystal, the ambient pulses of energy roaring through his muscles from merely the contact and reinforcing the limb to a peak he had never thought possible before. Beyond even the level of what he deemed human.

It was a sorry affair, but Brock managed to bring his arm above his head, letting him study the crystal and its contents in better detail. The crystal felt thin and brittle in his hand, and even as weakened as he was, he already felt the strange item flexing with tension at his pathetic grip. To him, it seemed like an egg, eager to be cracked open and have him devour what was within.

*If I'm... gonna die anyway...*

Left with no better idea as his life slowly faded from his body, Brock brought the item close to his mouth and squeezed. Instantly, he was rewarded as the crystal shattered to pieces and his mouth was set aflame with powerful energies as the fluid splashed inside and slid down his throat.

**\[Shard of Awakening used: 1/1\]**

**\[Welcome to the System, User: Brock Carter.\]**

**…**

A set of blurred words floating in his remaining vision and the shine of golden mist was the last thing Brock saw before darkness finally consumed him."

rjk49j,0,2021-12-18,Where do I go from here? New Job opportunities during COVID-19 Pandemic.,Melbester9,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rjk49j/where_do_i_go_from_here_new_job_opportunities/,"Hey everyone. It's Melvin here. Just posting my first here. So I'm recently on the verge of starting my second job and it's my first full time job. I was working at Cosi for two years until my company closed and then the pandemic happened. At that time, I was working part time. 

I had a pretty bad guidance when it comes to the job market. I finished college but in times where you need experience to get a job, but had no idea that I had to devote to internships to get experience. 

But anyway, it worked out for me. I have an Associates from my local CC. I went a year on unemployment during COVID-19 and my Dominican 🇩🇴 Career Specialist from my local college that I graduated from back in 2016, helped me out a ton with navigating jobs. 

My resume updated after I lost my job and she helped me out with more job opportunities. I got references from my manager and assistant managers from Cosi along with her. She reccomended me a website for nonprofit finding jobs and it helped me a ton. 

Having an easier time applying to jobs like I used to and Indeed with other job sites are so saturated with people applying that it makes it difficult to find work. Plus I networked a bit during my time working at Cosi that I had a few recruiters hooking me up with other job opportunities such as Store Staff, etc. 

But they went with someone else so I stayed at Cosi, my company was great with food and I learned a lot from my first time working but they had financial trouble and couldn't give everyone I worked with including myself hours. So they quit and found other jobs. I stayed until they closed, same with a few other coworkers I had.

Also I had a Spiritual Awakening late 2019 before the pandemic and it has completely shifted my life in a different direction. I'm a completely new person spiritually, closer to god. I'm Spiritual and it was a Twin Flame situation I had with a False Twin Flame Narcisssist from my country the Dominican Republic 🇩🇴. 

My life went well during the pandemic and the COVID-19 madness that I'm extremely grateful because a lot of people's lives got destroyed by this bad virus. Hope you guys and your loved ones are well and safe.

So with the non profit website that my former local college alumni career specialist helped me with for finding jobs for non profits. I used it for a couple months and had better luck applying to jobs than I did prior to my first job with my resume updated. 

First one I applied to was for a Church Organizer position for 50-55K and I had the interview with the director of the church here in NYC for CUFFH, a non profit. Went well but there was three rounds of interviews. I never got far after that. Shockingly. 

Second job applied to, Case Manager for Riseboro, recruitment coordinator contacted me for a phone interview. She asked if I was ok with the position and salary for 42K to then 52K. I said yes and that I needed at least one dose of the MRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna. Then I said I was waiting for the Novavax vaccine to be approved by end of year as it's protein traditional vaccines. Much safer and better than MRNA vaccines which I wasn't comfortable with. 

So she helped me out and has the position ready for me and to contact her once the Novavax vaccine is available. I also was looking into buying the company's stock since it skyrocketed after the vaccines getting approved internationally in other countries and by WHO. 

The vaccine won't be approved until end of year by FDA and early next year it will be available. But basically I have the job and she said if I was working. I said yes until the pandemic. But yeah I have the job. Once Novavax is available early next year, I'll take the shot once and start working. 

So I told my local college specialist of the opportunity and other places as well. 2022 is looking to be a positive opportunity for me as it has been since the pandemic began. New job opportunities and so on.

If I take that Case Manager position, it would be a big boost to my resume already. I've long moved on from Cosi but it was a great experience working and my Spiritual Awakening with the pandemic really got my life going. The position would offer great opportunities in the future for other managerial positions and better pay. 

Non profit organizations with more opportunities for me to look into so that's the situation. 42K first year wouldn't be bad because I already saved up a year and a half of unemployment and my two years at Cosi. So saving my first year and then I make 52K after that. 

I'm almost at 100K in savings and I had a bad start to my career and working life but I'm still in my mid 20s. But this Case Manager position would really get my life and career going for the future and I'm more excited for post pandemic COVID-19 to end. Extremely optimistic and God really pulled through for me during the pandemic. 

A time where people's lives are in shambles but God was there for me and this Spiritual Awakening defines the odds. It's all continuing forward from there. 42K to 52K for a second job starting out wouldn't be bad. Way better than my first job working part time for two years. 

Thanks guys for reading. Anything to mention with stuff to make job opportunities better and smoother for me with my second job, feel free to post it here. I love Reddit and this platform has a lot of smart wise people with amazing experiences that has helped me a ton."

**Recs:** Obviously haven’t read them but if I had to guess: 9/10 from APUSH, 7.5-8/10 from AP Econ, 6/10 from Counselor, 7/10 from internship coordinator (not a clairvoyant though so this could be way off)

**EC’s:**
1. Internship at AG’s Office
2. Team leader for a Bike MS charity 
3. Helped with a volunteering service in India 
4. Volunteered at a local food pantry during the summer 
5. Head of the build team for my robotics league 
6. Helped tutor kids at my school’s chess league
7. Member of my school’s entrepreneurship club 
8. Extracurricular music lessons (7 years) 

**Awards** (probably my killer):
1. Some local school honors
2. A local university’s honors
3. AP Scholar with Honors

**Common App:** How I worked through a challenging piano piece and my motivations behind it. (8/10 imo)

**Financials:** cost isn’t an issue

I’ve seen kids with worse stats and EC’s get into NYU, but I’ve also seen kids with **way** better stats get rejected. Not quite sure if I want to spend my ED2 there especially given the fact that I’m not feeling too hot on any of my target schools and I don’t want to attend a university with the intention of transferring after a semester.

Also if feel free to reverse chance me if you think there are other schools that I could potentially apply to."

I'm an IoT student engineer. My study field is kind of new and there is few job opportunities for us in my country and the existing ones are low paid, i love what i'm doing and i'm so excited to work and learn more about IoT but the job market is discouraging me from choosing an Iot engineering career. Lately i got an offer to work in a web development company, i have some skills since i did freelancing in web development before.
The salaries are good and has a lot of job opportunities.
So if i accept the offer i will have to forget about all what i learned and worked on for years concerning Iot. So it's hard for me to decide at this point what road should i take."

rjnoqi,3,2021-12-18,"Feeling lost and invalidated. Struggles of getting diagnosed in France as a foreigner. Depression, anxiety and maybe ADHD-I, SCT, or just hopelessly dysfunctional?",oto379,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rjnoqi/feeling_lost_and_invalidated_struggles_of_getting/,"M,24. This should be very long but I will try to keep it as short as possible. I made so many edits though, it might not make sense anymore, so I apologize in advance.

I do not remember most of my past, but as I was told I was an active, sensitive, loving kid. What I remember is that I had troubles learning things at school, I struggled with math, learning things by heart, labeled lazy and so on, but I never really made trouble, always behaving and not causing a problem (now I am a huge people-pleaser who can’t say no and often gets taken advantage of, while being conscious about it). Looking back, I think I tick most of the boxes on Inattentive ADHD, since I am not really hyperactive, on the contrary even, 24/7 tired and fatigued, quite sluggish. But on top, I can’t get myself to do anything, other than lie around, overthink about this or just do nothing on the internet, have this small bursts of focus that fades and whatever I’ve read or seen is soon forgotten. Anything but doing something to make my situation any better. 

Long story short, I managed to high finish school, with major depressive episodes, anxiety, bullying, trauma + help from tutors and family. Somehow me complaining about not being able to study well, that my memory was horrible and slowly became an outsider and avoidant went unnoticed. Fast forward to university, it was okay, I was in the same group with my close friends from school. I had help from them in terms of note-taking (I can’t manage to do that and listen at the same time), group studies and so on. Ironically I was getting better scores than them, despite them doing most of the work and me cramming it in 1 day, because otherwise I would forget the material anyways. The thing is though, I feel like I do not learn anything, like almost nothing stays with me. Memories, details, friendships, even the relationships I have, it’s like these depth-deprived facts, barely. I sometimes feel super weird, like I don’t miss anyone or feel anything meaningful towards anyone. Especially now, when I am alone and far away from everyone, it’s nothing. Like, at some point, life became too much and I am numb since, on a survival mode, always anxious and in an out of depressive cycles. Mostly because I am bad at everything, with crappy memory, no social skills or any skills whatsoever. I can’t even work see myself working somewhere that requires focus, working brain and socialization. Sometimes I think that maybe I hit a brick wall in childhood and was not properly developed. Like I am aware of how bad I it all is, but that makes it all worse. I have really simple and short thought process and verbalization, low emotional reactivity and no motivation. 
I managed to get accepted to a highly rated French university with a scholarship in a scientific program. Me, who barely grasps anything complex, unaware of how life works, or how to be normal in social situations. I can’t even manage to cook or organize my room, get ready properly and on time. Constantly confused. 
From teenage years, every year I thought it would be it (periodic depressive episodes), like I couldn’t do it anymore and that was it, somehow I managed to go on. This research-oriented science program totally broke me though. I lasted a month until I broke down and dropped everything. I couldn’t listen to any lecture, had zero energy and motivation to study afterwards, had serious social anxiety during presentations. Forgot everything I knew before, felt like an imposter among young, motivated and thirsty-for-knowledge people. It got so bad I tried to end it, yet again, but failed because I am a coward. And while emotionally numb and not feeling much, I felt bad for my family and friends. I ended up in the psych hospital for 2 months, diagnosed straight away with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety. The only English speaking doctor (well, intern) here doesn’t specialize in learning disabilities or ADHD. She performed Connors test and DIVA 2.0, sent the results to the clinic that actually specializes in it, but got a response that they can’t help me due to the language barrier. They say it is likely, but can’t confirm or deny anything. My doctor here also said it is unlikely I have it because I am not hyperactive and my mother’s subjective evaluation of my childhood doesn’t meet the threshold… Now I feel lost. Most of my life I knew something was not right. Coming from a 3rd world country where there is a stigma around psychiatry and adult ADHD doesn’t exist, I thought I would figure it out here. What’s worse, I avoided and ghosted everyone, uni people, friends, family, but I do not know what to tell them, how to explain that I am a failure (2nd year in a row, btw). I basically don’t reply to people, disappeared. Not that I had many friendships and connections going. It is really hard to keep up with everything and even this small circle is overwhelming and too much sometimes. I can never understand how can people do so much at the same time. Like, study, have a social life, work and keep up with life. 
Apart from terrible memory, I struggle with paying attention, expressing feelings and emotions, expressing myself verbally, executive dysfunctions like planning and management, multitasking, focus and time-blindness, avoiding complex tasks and dropping everything, impulsive decisions, like buying unnecessary things online while basically broke or terrible sexual decisions and regrets; also mindlessly scrolling social media and watching stupid stuff to distract myself. 
I still struggle to accept my sexuality, eating disorder (my doc here also said that if I can control it myself and managed to mostly recover, ir was not and ED to begin with? WTF…) and low-self esteem.
At this point I don’t know if I am just lazy and dumb, or I need help. I know that people have it worse than me and somehow manage to “do life”, study and be successful. The thing is, I can’t and right now I feel hopeless. There is more to tell, but I rambled enough already. 
I just think that depression and anxiety only do not explain all my struggles. Or, they are so severe that cause such a high dysfunction and problems… 
As regards to medications, I am currently on Venlafaxine and Seresta, I do not see much change, apart from being less anxious. They even performed and MRI brain scan, since I was insisting it was not normal to be like this at my age, plus I had a history of several traumas and a seizure. The results were fine, my brain is just fine, lol.

Now I am avoiding to talk to my family and friends, I do not want to go back to my country, which is a toxic environment due to different complex reasons, also feel like I don’t belong… Currently messing up my future, getting in debt, but doing nothing, just laying around waiting for who knows what. I know I can’t manage to go back to my Grad program, at least like this. Likely never, I have too high of a gap in terms of knowledge and skills/motivation/ethics just to survive this level of education. The thing is, I do not know what else to do, I feel like I am just breathing lately. And it is getting worse, I feel like I have serious case of dementia at 24. I just don’t see the reason to even try and keep going at this point. I feel too broken mentally. I do not want to go back to my safe bubble, because my family won’t accept the true me, which I can’t even fully accept myself. I do want to live and be normal, but I can’t and can’t even force myself to actually get myself together and do something for a change. I just thought a diagnosis and maybe mix of therapy, medication and coping strategies would help, even acquired late. But I got nowhere, just lost months of my life to be told I am depressed and given medication that might be even making it all worse. 

I do not know why I wrote all this, just wanted to let it all out and maybe get some advice from people who can relate. Thanks in advance if you made it all through. Any advice or thoughts are highly welcome.

TLDR; is basically the title."

rjnrpl,18,2021-12-18,Does TA experience look good on a resume?,StoicallyGay,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rjnrpl/does_ta_experience_look_good_on_a_resume/,"I'm currently a junior TAing an intro to CS course. Next semester I'm debating on either TAing a DS&amp;A course, or an algorithms course, both of which I received an A in, and the latter I had under a fairly well known professor nationally. Although I'm not an algorithms God by any means, I just studied and aced the exams and homeworks.


I'm not sure how good my intro course TA experience looks, so I'm thinking I may TA again for one of those other two courses (and also TAing it generally low work and sort of fulfilling). 


This will supplement an internship at a medium/large company, some prior leadership experience, and a few personal projects that I find decent but not like ground-breakingly impressive at all. Thoughts? This will be in to either get a Fall/Winter internship before I graduate, or a new grad position after I graduate in Spring 2023."

rjp51o,2,2021-12-18,Help what do I do about my homeless mother with a neck injury?? I am sick and scared,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rjp51o/help_what_do_i_do_about_my_homeless_mother_with_a/,"My mother has been a drug addict for 13 years. Now she is homeless. A few days ago she went a couple states over and cracked the bones in her neck and several ribs. She has to wear a chest and neck brace for 3 months. 

Reasons Why I Am Stressed and Scared:
 
1) I just got out of a 3 month long unpaid internship and just started a new job where it is gonna take a while for me to build savings back up. 

2) Plus I have my own bills. So, I cannot financially afford to pay for a motel room every night. 

3) I also don't own my own house so I cannot say she can stay here for a long time, I rent from her brother, my uncle. 

4) I am scared to advocate for her to come here because I do not want to get kicked out on the streets myself (that probably wouldn't happen). I overthink though so for me it is possible in my head

5) It is getting extremely cold outside and that brace does make it hard to lay down. So I know she can't bundle up in a warm spot like normal

6) She has been crying and said she would die out on the streets like that and that text ""I will die out here"" really freaked me out.

7) the city she is in now is 40 minutes away and it is complicated dangerous city. I am in a small town that has no kind of buses or resources or where homelessness is legal. So to help her I have to do a lot of driving in a dangerous city and I am freaked out because I can only afford liability on my shitty car right now and can't buy new tires until Monday.

Idk what to do. I have been getting really really bad headaches every day. Yesterday I had a for real complete nervous breakdown where I was crying and gagging and couldn't think. I just wanted to go home. I have not talked to her for nearly 9 months and if she wasn't injured I would say she just has to be on the streets. 

But I am scared. She is injured this time. I am scared if she does die because I would forever feel guilty even though there is nothing I can really do and it is her own fault. Plus I am not ready for my mother to be dead. A small part of me is still holding out hope she can go back to the way she was. Idk how long she has been clean either, probably only a few days. She can't get into a shelter until Monday so Sunday she has to either make money for a room or I ask my uncle if she can spend Sunday night here and I will take her off Monday when I am off work.

Help what do I do? How do I survive a psychological break if she dies out there? If that happens honest to God I will need to be committed because I will be scared and feel guilty. For more context I am 25 years old, unmarried, no parents or grandparents left besides her. She has a husband out there with her, but I don't care about him."

rjrfl7,2,2021-12-19,I'm tired of fighting,marsyas90,Vent,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/rjrfl7/im_tired_of_fighting/,"Welp, never thought I'd be writing one of these. But I guess there's a time and a place for everything.

Honestly, I don't have it half bad. I mean, it can be worse. Regardless, I'm just tired of the situation I'm in. Perpetually single, struggeling to hold even a part time job (so structurally broke), and stuck with a fair amount of emotional baggage that makes me feel like an incompetent loser every now and then.

It could be worse. I have experienced relationships in the past, and the country I live in's social welfare makes sure I'm not struggeling to eat. I have some pretty great friends, and some awesome mental healthcare professionals standing besides me. I've been working hard towards recovery, and I've come a long long way.

But right now I'm just f-ing tired. I'm tired of working towards goals I'm barely reaching. I'm tired of living in a world that idolizes relationships when I can barely get a couple of hugs a year. I have great friends, but they have time for me -after- they arranged everything else that's important in their and their partners life. Which means I barely see them. I'm pretty much obsessed to go dating, but my own baggage is kind of a hurdle there.

I live in an anti-squad building, which is great cause it means I am not struggeling financially. But the constant threat of having to move last minute, and the lack of privacy is becoming more and more of a burden.

And even though I got the chance to study and be a mental healthcare professional myself, my internship is more than a struggle, and sometimes I wonder if I could ever hold a job in that field.

The last 6 years or so, I've been working my ass of. I fought of depression and even suicidal tendencies. I've dealt with a lot of baggage and there is a good chance I can make it out of the cesspool that's been my life for the last few years. I'm clean from drugs for a while now, barely drink, and feel that in the future I might be fit to go dating again.

But that being said, I'm tired now. And sick of holding out for the future. I've been working so hard, trying to be my best self, and now I'm just done. I'd like some instant gratification please. Maby just an effortless month, or someone to date for a short while. Do some cuddling on the couch while watching a shitty movie. Anything other than playing games or busting my ass for some future promise.

Even an ill advised ONS would be welcome at this point, just to feel that someone might be interested in me.

Ugh. It'll probably work out alright. I've come such a long way, feeling way more tired and hopeless than I do now, I'm sure I can do that last stretch as well.

If I can make it trough my internship, I might be able to make it into a job. If I can ship that, I get some sense of self worth, and maby even a proper room/house to live in. If I keep going at my therapy, maby one day I will know love again, although I'm not very hopefully there. But even if that won't work out, I'll manage.

Right now I'm just very done with working for it though. I need a vacation. Not having to worry about anything for a week, of crawling up to someone for a night. It'll pass 🤷🏻‍♀️

Anyway, thanks for letting me ramble. I guess I just needed to vent. Things will get better, I've already made them better. I'd just wish they'd get better faster 😂"

Now I have received some feedback that it is not so much development, but I feel is a good career experience, because it is still technical and it's Amazon. I have some software options but on the two I have I would have to ask to consider me again as the answer deadline passed (Palantir/Pinterest) and I feel my offers at Meta and Amazon where far harder to get. What's your opinion? Is it OK just to cancel the acceptance if I receive a ok from one of those two or a good Meta team (I still don't know the team at Meta)

I’m 31, a former Marine in my last year of pharmacy school, and I have 4 months left to go before I can graduate and take the licensing exam. I am married (almost 4 years) and I have a 11 year old boy, full custody from a previous marriage, and a 4 year old from my current marriage. We’ve been happily married for several years, and we never fight, but over the last couple of months my wife has changed, and has expressed her unhappiness, she even mentioned leaving but I begged her to stay. A couple of months go by and everything was okay until a couple of weeks ago, she started hiding throughout the day, acting shady. I had that terrible gut instinct and unfortunately tonight I found that she has been sending literal pornographic videos of her DP’ing herself with dildos in one video to an ex BF who lives across the country. I have no doubt she probably would have fucked him if he lived closer. We have the most amazing sex, but generally she’s not even a sexual person so I’m truly shocked and horrified.
I have been cheated on by every woman I’ve had a long term relationship with, including my ex wife.
My current wife is a stay at home mom, both kids are in school, and I am a full time student and pharmacist intern. I give all of my attention to my family when I am not studying/working. 
I cook, I clean, and I financially provide everything.
I’m fit, active, and attractive or so I’m told. My dick is above average. We don’t have money problems. I’m not perfect, but what the literal fuck? I give her everything I can and she still cheats?
She states she has no reason for what she’s done. She monotonely said she’s sorry and blocked the guy, but now I don’t think I’ll ever trust her again, and I truly just want to die. I can’t sleep now, and I don’t know what to do. This is one of the worst days of my life and I just want it all to end.

UPDATE: hate to say it, but most of you were right. I tried to work it out and everything was going wonderfully, but my mind couldn’t settle. Went through her phone last night and found out she was basically selling tit pics to my cousin for money for the past couple days. Again, no good reason. It’s time for me to change my beneficiaries and die so she doesn’t get the money.

TLDR; wife cheated, I want to die, but I have kids."

rk0p4v,0,2021-12-19,NYU LS or CAS for ED2?,edtekecysn7,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/rk0p4v/nyu_ls_or_cas_for_ed2/,"So I heard that both of these schools, despite offering (somewhat) similar programs, have wildly varying acceptances rates, with CAS being one of the hardest schools to apply into and LS being one of the easiest. I’m wondering with my stats, whether it would be smarter for me to apply LS or whether I should  take the risk and do CAS instead. As far as I’m concerned, I can’t really see any large differences between either of the two schools, the only major distinction being that LS offers smaller more discussion based classes (I like seminars so this isn’t a problem for me) compared to the more traditional structure of CAS. Can anyone give me a little more insight on what LS offers and if I should be applying there instead?

**Stats:**

**Major:** Econ

**GPA:** 4W (strong upward trend) (no rank)

**Coursework:** 8 AP’s, 13 Honors, 5 CP (mostly from electives like gym or art)

**SAT:** 1530

**Recs:** Obviously haven’t read them but if I had to guess: 9/10 from APUSH, 7.5-8/10 from AP Econ, 6/10 from Counselor, 7/10 from internship coordinator (not a clairvoyant though so this could be way off)

**EC’s:**
1. Internship at AG’s Office
2. Team leader for a Bike MS charity 
3. Helped with a volunteering service in India 
4. Volunteered at a local food pantry during the summer 
5. Head of the build team for my robotics league 
6. Helped tutor kids at my school’s chess league
7. Member of my school’s entrepreneurship club 
8. Extracurricular music lessons (7 years) 

**Awards** (probably my killer):
1. Some local school honors
2. A local university’s honors
3. AP Scholar with Honors

**Common App:** How I worked through a challenging piano piece and my motivations behind it. (8/10 imo)

**Financials:** cost isn’t an issue"

I understand that this point might just be bringing up the same topic over and over again on here and I'm ready to get yelled at on here or whatever lol but I genuinely need advice. No matter who I turn to: parents, friends, family, school advisors it's always the same story to stay on track to go to med school. But I genuinely have an interest in the finance world and investment banking. I'm not gonna run around like the others and be like ""oh no money isn't important"" it sure as hell is and I want a great paying career and I'm ready to work hard for med school or IB banking. I've applied to med school but getting rejected and will most likely have to take the MCAT again to get into a good school. But just like running around a ER helping patients, putting on a suit and sitting in a room talking to clients and business appeals to me as well. I understand that some of you might have a jaded view after doing it for a while but I hear the same from some doctors. I want a great career that pays well and gives me satisfaction in both and I see two routes here. I know its super hard to break into IB not from a Ivy or a finance major but thats part 2. Is it better to try to get an internship or should I shut up and go to med school and get an MBA and then break in that way? This is the route most of my friends, family, advisors are suggesting. Please give me your advice and views on whatever you can: work life balance, salary, job outlook, anything helps! I can't really focus on school or anything and just staying up late at night browsing these websites and obviously there is no definitive answer. Appreciate all the advice, thank you!"

I can solve most leetcode easy and some medium by myself(did 60 easy and 43 medium).

However, I realized that in the process of grinding leetcode, i need at least a few minutes to figure out how to approach the problem(at least like 10 + mins for medium), and while coding, sometimes at the middle shit happens like i realized i used the wrong approach and have to restart again. And at the end i might not pass some tests and have to redesign my algorithm.

Those things worries me and I assume the interviwer is not going to sit there and watch me spend at least 15 mins to have a wrong approach and have to restart again right? How can I solve this slowness problem? I eventually will figure out most solutions but the process is very slow.

TL:DR - Nu am treaba dpdv profesional cu programarea, iar maine am primul interviu pentru ceea ce cred ca va fi un internship. Angajatorul mi-a spus ca e o proba tehnica de 4 ore.

Salut. Am 24 de ani, sunt absolvent al facultatii de Inginerie Electrica din Cluj Napoca, insa dupa ce am terminat si am luat contact cu niste joburi ce aveau legatura cu domeniul in care am studiat, am hotarat ca as vrea sa fac o reconversie profesionala, insa fara sa mai incep o facultate. M-am orientat spre front-end development, dorind sa invat React. HTML si CSS stiu din liceu, am fost la matematica-informatica intensiv, si m-am apucat singur sa invat JS pe Udemy, prin diverse cursuri. Am tot aplicat pentru internship-uri pe care le-am vazut pe LinkedIn, iar in cele din urma, am fost sunat de catre departamentul de HR al unei companii, am discutat cu duduia, mi-a cerut un link de GitHub daca am, cu un proiect ca sa imi vada nivelul. Intamplarea facea sa am fix o aplicatie facuta de-a lungul unui curs, nimic spectaculos, un joc in care trebuie sa ghicesti numarul generat aleatoriu de catre program, el spunandu-ti doar daca numarul pe care l-ai introdus e mai mare sau mai mic decat cel generat. Dupa ce s-a uitat peste aplicatie, a revenit cu un telefon in care sa ma intrebe daca sunt disponibil in viitorul apropiat pentru o proba tehnica. Am raspuns afirmativ, si cand am inceput sa cer detalii vizavi de desfasurarea testului, mi-a spus ca va dura undeva la 4 ore, cu tot cu verificare. De aici si problema, e posibil sa aiba teste pentru interni de 4 ore? Sau e un test pentru un post de junior, eventual? Toate chestiile astea m-au facut sa sufar putin de Impostor Syndrome, si sa ma ingrijorez pentru ce o sa urmeze. Acum, cu o seara inainte, sunt anxios si reiau parti din cursurile Udemy pe care le-am facut acum ceva timp. Nelucrand constant pe proiecte cu limbajele de programare, am impresia ca am uitat multe chestii de sintaxa, chestii de baza. Din experienta voastra, cam cum se desfasoara o astfel de proba tehnica? O sa ma puna sa scriu ditai algoritmii? La urma urmei, 4 ore e ceva timp, nu stiu cum o sa fie si asta ma ingrijoreaza. De aia am si ales varianta unui internship, pentru ca imi place foarte mult domeniul si as vrea sa lucrez in cadrul unei companii cu proiecte mai mari, care sa ma ajute sa cimentez ce invat.

Mersi frumos!"

\*I seriously battled between Yale REA and Columbia ED.

Plus, where else can you cheaply live in NYC while receiving an Ivy League education? A student in my school hadn't attended an Ivy League in five or six years, I was seriously discouraged. Plus my school counselor tried to convince me not to apply because Columbia is so hard to get into. But believe in yourself!!!"

List of good ideas rcvd so far. 

* 1	Sources of income as a 1st year student / Sources of income in any year of undergraduation please.
* 2	How to search for internships? (Field specific advice)
* 3	How dependency on colleges is decreasing when it comes to computer science.
* 4	design education in india
* 5	Research output in India and how it relates to entrance examinations and the auxillary systems (like coaching classes).
* 6	How to excel in Indian law schools
* 7	Off the beaten path subjects like Materials Science , good colleges for this, scope of field
* 8	Mathematics and computing branch in Engineering and science.
* 9	Good Institutes in India for Linguistics, Archeology, etc. ie, courses not many people take, and job opportunities in India and Abroad
* 10	Careers in History and Geography. Courses offered and opportunities to work.
* 11	How to figure out what one wants from their career?Like I see a lot of students who want to do Engg or Medical and stuff and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that provided YOU are interested in the subject! I am a PCMB student and although I'm going to appear for JEE and probably NEET too next year I don't think my heart lies in either of those streams. And the thought of spending the rest of my life doing something I am not even interested in the first place, really disturbs me. But, again at this point I'm not sure what I actually want to do in life. So, yeah maybe I'm the only one but it would be of great great help if I could find a detailed article about this.
* 12	Everything you need to know to apply to foreign schools and how to estimate your chance of getting into one.
* 13	Why are JRFs forced to do a PhD?Is it just because the university wants save funds as it is cheaper to have a PhD candidate than a JRF? Or are there other motivations?

**Letters of Recommendation**

Had both teachers sophomore and junior year &amp; didn't have super close personal relationships. Both teachers wrote recs for students in previous years that also got into great schools.

English II/AP Lang teacher - 8/10? Kinda knew me in sophomore year because I'd participate here and there. I did well in her AP Lang class and she said I was one of her top students.

Chemistry H/AP Chemistry teacher - 7.5/10?? Tbh did not think he liked me back in sophomore year but the class was structured so there were opportunities for me to go above and beyond with projects. Did well in AP Chem and participated often online, this year I'm his TA.

Counselor - 6/10, didn't know her too well.

Additional rec: Biotech Professor - 9-10/10, I took her class summer after freshman year and interned under her beginning of senior year. She remembered how well I'd done academically despite being younger as well as the ECs I was involved in. Super dedicated to giving me a meaningful internship experience &amp; mentorship in terms of college &amp; my biosciences career.

**Interviews**

Bowdoin - 9/10, my first interview &amp; lasted about an hour. Was super nervous but my interviewer was so sweet (and also recently graduated). Turns out we had a super specific academic interest in common so that was awesome! Made me really love Bowdoin :')

Pomona - 7.5/10, my interviewer was so accomplished and professional so it was kind of intimidating ngl, still very insightful! Lasted a little over an hour.

MIT - 6/10, only giving it a 6 because my interviewer followed up &amp; said he was impressed by me after I got accepted. Barely asked me any of the quirky questions I expected and rather asked me to explain concepts in biology after I told him that was my major. Lasted about an hour.

Swarthmore - 10/10!!! My interviewer was so chill and throughout the interview, she kept emphasizing how great of a fit Swat was for me in all aspects. Laughed about a lot of things, discussed boba orders, and made me want to ED2 to Swarthmore. About 1.5 hours long.

**Essays**

Common app essay - 6-7/10, a pain to write because I felt like I had nothing to talk about, but I squeezed out an essay in Sept-Nov. Talked about personal growth/relationships with others, how my background has affected my dancing, and being involved with the school dance club. The writing was probably not the best but I guess the themes made it through? Got it revised by a teacher/school counselor, a few college friends, and mcneiladmissions through his rolling essay reviews, no other outside counselors.

Williams graded paper supplement - 10/10 from an academic perspective? It was a revised AP Lang rhetorical analysis essay and got a full score from my teacher, who grades somewhat harshly. 'twas about environmentalism so ig it fit with my secondary interests.

MIT essays - 8/10, might be a little generous of me but I'm proud of them &amp; had fun! Wrote most essays about my activities, k-drama for fun essay. Reused Explore Bowdoin &amp; DiscoSwat essays. Had to rewrite the challenge essay a lot but I guess it worked? Only got these revised by two college friends and I think their revisions really pulled them together; started 1.5 weeks before they were due lol.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Williams College ED - committed!!
* MIT EA (withdrawn)

*Waitlists/Rejections:*

* None

*Withdrawn:*

* UT Dallas, they're rolling but never gave me a decision SMH
* Northeastern EA
* UCs (UCLA, Berkeley, UCSD, UCI) and CSULB

*Would've applied RD:* Swarthmore (ED2), Pomona, Amherst, Bowdoin, Harvard, Cornell, Dartmouth, Stanford, Vanderbilt - in general, I really liked LACs and the opportunities/specialized attention I'd gain from attending one. Might've cut a few more schools had I done more research LOL

**Bonus - Fly-in Program Results!**

Being first-gen &amp; ORM, I was eligible to apply for fly-in programs and I'm glad I did - the people you meet are phenomenal and many people I know are already off to amazing schools. I guess they either boost your chances or it means you're already a competitive applicant. Even though I wasn't productive with college apps over the summer, I'm glad I still applied to these programs because they did give me a taste of what college apps would be like.

* UCSD Triton Summer Academy - idek if this counts as a fly-in but accepted with last minute essays + got free shirt.
* Windows on Williams - rejected with fee waiver &amp; phone call (best tier of rejection?), kinda sad because it was in-person. Used the same graded paper for my actual app.
* Discover Swarthmore - rejected, adapted my DiscoSwat essay for an MIT essay.
* Perspectives on Pomona - rejected, wrote my essays day of so not surprised lol
* MIT WISE - accepted! Essays were cringe af but maybe ECs/awards made up for it? Got lots of cool merch :) and also met cool people!
* WashU Preview - accepted, I don't think it was very selective. Got a free t-shirt!
* Explore Bowdoin I - accepted, also got a ton of cool merch and I really enjoyed this fly-in despite being online; didn't feel so dreary even on Zoom and it was super refreshing to hear unfiltered opinions from the student interns.

**Additional Information/Reflection:**

Submitted a research supp for Williams but not MIT. Funny thing, I got additional finaid document requests from both before decisions came out, with 1 week before for Williams. Still don't know if that was a good sign.

So glad I got accepted ED because I had barely started on RD essays and I would've been massively screwed + I didn't work on apps over the summer, I started in August (do not recommend. Please start early)! As for why I'd go to Williams over MIT - Williams was a better fit/vibes were better and I wanted more freedom to explore my academic interests.

I also don't know why I was accepted to either of these schools, but I guess moral of my story is to truly be passionate about what you enjoy?? Wouldn't have traded my volunteering experiences, dance lessons, sports competitions, etc for ANYTHING and they made my high school experience worthwhile. Perhaps I got my foot in the door with my stats, but I think my unique combo of ECs &amp; long-term commitment made me stand out, not necessarily my essays. I was also scared at the beginning of apps because I sucked at writing personal essays, but in the end, things went fine.

Anyways, if you're a minority, FG/LI, etc, PLEASE apply to fly-in programs!! And take advantage of all the resources available to you. Not saying you should be on A2C all day but the majority of what I learned about college apps came from there and I swear I wouldn't have even learned about Williams if not for A2C. Feeling very lucky &amp; excited to have made it this far as a first-gen kid, it's all still surreal! Good luck to everyone :)"

In order to get a proper/valuable diploma, I have to finish my school (2 years) and do +1 years at least. 

I already graduated from the 2 years college where I could learn many things about programming such as basics, common algorithms, databases, data-structures, common problems, UML, etc...

I did learn C/C++, Java, SQL, HTML/CSS, PHP and other most-common languages/techs, etc. in the college but I am a guy who literally enjoys coding (unlike most of the guys in my college) so I also did some small personal-projects and learned other languages, techs etc.

At the end of the 2-year college, I could find an internship in a mobile development company where I was an Android native intern. It was really enjoying to use Kotlin with Android framework. but the thing is I enjoy almost any thing I work on/with (did some Django, Vue.js, Android, Node.js apps, Cake PHP, C++ socket programming, etc.)

This year, I was going for +1 year college focused on mobile development but because I still didn't receive my work permit, I couldn't complete my inscription to the college and I eventually had to stop. I will be going to back to college next year (If I get my work permit hopefully).

It has been 3-4 months since I am unemployed, non-student, etc... In the meantime, I started to look for other options because even though I looked at many options (Web development, software dev., mobile dev., databases), I still have no idea about what I want to do and I want to spend this period as useful as possible to me/my career.

All my friends (most of them) did decide whatever they want to focus on and I am still here questioning what I like. There are many new technologies, new programming languages getting released or being popular. I can't learn all of them but I don't know what to chose neither. 

Every time I try something new, I lose my self to it. A few weeks ago I decided to make a Discord bot that works with voice commands and uses multiple APIs. I ended up spending most of my days/hours coding that bot, making it better, arranging things, getting it configurable easily, etc. I also felt the same enjoyment almost in any other project I worked on.

&amp;#x200B;

**How did you understand what It suits you best? or what you really want to do?** 

I am scared of regretting my choice in the future. I don't want to regret choosing mobile development instead of Web3 or some database related things or something else."

An example internship I am trying to apply for is the Processor &amp; Chip design internship summer 2022.

I'm wondering if this is an issue specific to me or this application, if I'm just unaware of another area, or if IBM does not take cover letters in general. The latter I would suspect is false but I wanted to ask before I submitted an application without a cover letter. Any help or advice would be appreciated, thanks."

It’s late and I have a headache, so I hope that this makes sense:

My last day of class for my Associates of Software Development is tomorrow. I currently have an internship where everyone likes working with me BUT they won’t keep me on as an intern(I’ve been there 3 months) unless I am enrolled in school. I am currently in the process of enrolling to WGU. I’d like to take to Computer Science degree because I think that it would help me out in the competitive job market. However, I won’t get an official start date until I pass a pre-Calculus test from Study.com. Should I go with the easier major at WGU, Software Development that would enroll me immediately even though I want to get a Computer Science degree. I haven’t taken any data structure courses. I would prefer to learn them in a more structured environment vs learning them on my own. I like my work environment and my team members; it’s also remote which I like a lot. Being remote also makes it easier for me to spend time with my partner who lives in another state. 

What would be the best move career wise? Major in Computer Science at the risk of loosing my internship? Secure my internship and major in Software Development. Quit my internship and look for a new remote one internship hopefully get a full time junior position after?"

I'm currently the president of the SAE Formula team at my University but this Fall semester I went to California to intern at Tesla. 

And I would've thought this wouldve answered more questions instead of creating more; but that didn't happen.

For one, automotive industry isn't something I'm interested in, rockets is what I'm into, but I was working on really cool stuff so it's hard to not come back to Tesla now, so I can't tell what I want to do career wise since I don't want to shoehorn myself into automotive industry.

Secondly, with me being gone this semester from the club has made me miss out on meeting with new members so when I come back I feel like Ill be the 3rd wheel on everything if that makes sense. .

I guess this thought has also made me feel distant from my friends at this club; I haven't felt the urge to talk to them recently because I feel out of place with them now, and at the same time the stuff I did at Tesla with the friends I made there, kinda made me realize that I meshed well with Tesla friends better thanthe friends I made at my University for some reason..basically the thoughts going my head is that the friends I made a few months ago aren't my friends any more even though that isn't probably true.

And I guess finally, there was a girl back at my University...But we stopped talking midway during my internship. I got over this my asking for more work (to the point where my manager noticed I was working too hard for an intern lol). But now I'm back, there's a good chance we'll bump into each other, and I'm still trying to forget about her; only bad part is where I can't ask for more work to distract myself...so that's been bothering me. 

So basically, working at Tesla threw me into this chaotic loop of not knowing what to do or think on multiple aspects of my life for first time in my life to this extent. And I need advice as to why I'm thinking and acting this toxic way now."

The thing is 3 months after I still feel lost, I can’t even set up my local pycharm workflow following the document they gave me, I get stuck every time and the other developers barely have any time since they’re working on other projects and they’re all in India and we’re 12h apart and at times they just leave me in read (I feel like they’re annoyed of me at this point since I can’t seem to solve things on my own).

rkhc9r,2,2021-12-20,Am I overloading myself?,TheOakTreeForest,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rkhc9r/am_i_overloading_myself/,"So I’m a 3rd year student. I recently secured a internship in a pretty big international tax consultant firm. It’s a remote internship and I expect to put in 20 hours a week on this position. My spring semester starts on the end of January and I’m taking 13 units(4 classes). Also classes are back in person so I would have to travel to campus which is like a 10 min drive. This position will run through my semester so I’m thinking of dropping two CS classes to focus on the internship. I also have a part time hybrid position as an IT support/ Software Engineer for a company local to me (I’m doing front end project for them now but will later have to do some backend in a couple of months once the project is compete). However this position is also remote and I work 12 hours a week and I could decrease to probably 8 hours a week since my boss is very flexible.

I know everyone is different but if you were in my position do you think you would be overloading yourself? I don’t really care much about grades as long as I get a C because I know internships are much more important. I’m just worried that I’m being too ambitious with my ability of juggling everything."

However, I’m not sure if my college would allow that. I need a summer internship to graduate in May spring 2023.

I took an Amazon OA part 1 and completely didn’t finished it today. I just wrote pseudo code if it didn’t work. I did notice that many of the coding interviews are from HackerRank. I usually go to Leetcode to practice.

  Well, if I can’t even get an unpaid internship then I might have to take one semester break so I’m still eligible to get internships by having at least one semester left requirement for most internships in companies (I think). I was even thinking of going to bootcamp before because I already have a bachelors degree which is Accounting but I heard a degree in cs is better than bootcamp. Well, I just hope I get any internship. It’s late at night now so goodnight to all of you who read this."

I  don't know If it belongs here or not, but please hear me out. Graduated  from Electrical Engineering in 2019, I was unable to find any job in  2020 because of my father's health condition and pandemic.

One  of my senior in college suggested to go in data science field so I did  Python(Data Analytics + IoT) boot-camp and internship from an  institution for 6 months (Jan to June 2021) and got opportunity working  for an AI startup as Junior Developer from July,2021.

My  work is to make AI Face model integrated GUI - Desktop AMS application  in python(tkinter), which the company wants to be distributed  commercially.

I joined this  company  because the hiring manager( left last month) told me that you  would do great data science projects but little did I know, I am finding  myself making GUI buttons for an attendance system in tkinter. I didn't  even had a clue about GUI programming learnt about framework by myself  which I feel now was a waste of time. For the past 6 months I spent  here, I have forgot what was the reason of my role is anymore, the  management is clueless and don't know what they even want.There is no  hierarchy in the company, the owner runs all things which is a sales guy  btw wants weekend working from all employees for free not even peanuts.

My  only co-worker who was supportive in all this left last Friday for  pursuing Masters. The current manager is on leave due to his wedding  vacation, is usually just bossing around and scolding me for no reason.

Here,  I am only one left in the team right now ,wondering what should I do.  Should I resign? but who will take care of the debts? Should I take a  break? Should I start preparing for any MNC aptitude test?

I  feel puzzled because this work is not something that motivates me or I  am passionate about. I have lost zeal to learn due to the stress and how  depressing is all this. I feel my career projection is falling down.

Should  I learn Django/Flask, or go for Data engineering course or should I  stay in AI, learn machine learning?. Whatever it will be I have to start  everything from scratch, but I don't know where to start. I need word  of advise or experienced professional's perspective on this. At the end  of the month ,I am just paying my bills, that I don't know for how  long.Please Help.

Thanks in advance."

My course is based on Cybersecurity and so far my GPA is about 3.0 ish. Since my course is IT related, I'll be sent to an IT related company. This is where the problem comes in. I'm ashamed to say that my IT skills such as programming is foundational at best. For example, even though I've been taught Python, it is still very hard for me to create something as simple as a page in a Flask application developed in Python

The only work skills that I'm actually confident in would be my interpersonal skills. My practical skills are pretty bad to the point where I'm very lost as how to even start.

Rn, I'm extremely worried as I know I'll surely mess up and I don't have much time to work on my practical skills before internship starts. Doing badly in this internship would definitely prevent me from entering into a local uni and I know that getting a 3.0 GPA (probably gonna drop even more) is all on me. Hence, I'd like some advice on how to be able to cope and adapt when internship comes as grades aside, I do not want to be a burden to the company I'm sent to and I actually want to learn, which may be difficult for me since I'm already struggling with even the most basic things"

My friends from the studies started working for the same company as interns too, at different location (still the same city though) three months after I joined the company. How is it that they get all the cool stuff like e. g. caps, mugs, glass bottles, tshirts backpacks, or go on cool business trips (fully sponsored by the company) basically to party and I can't even get a single PEN as a gift? I should also mention that I do all my best at work, everyone is really satisfied with me to the point that I started receiving my own projects to handle on my own. I sit there and work really hard trying to meet all the deadlines and I often have to stay overtime to finish all my work in time, while my friends tell me that they have to prepare 2 powerpoint slides (!) during their 8 hours long workday. Of course my salary and their salaries are the same. I asked my team leader if I could get any of those fancy items that my friends got. He said he will talk about it with our manager (it's been 3 weeks now and I still haven't got even that pen). In addition, during my personal meeting with my team leader he told me that he's really satiafied with my performance and he's constantly recommending me to our manager that the company should hire me, cause basically I do great job here. Few days after that meeting project manager asked my manager if I (intern) could help the other team (group of engineers with degrees) with the things I had alredy done at work and they had difficulties to do. What was my manager's response? He said that he hadn't know I existed lol. What's the point of me working there really hard, staying overtime if I get no recognition for my work?

So now I have 3-4 different opportunities and I am trying to decide which to take and how many I can handle. 2 different research projects under faculty at my university, 1 internship at a hospital, and a TA position. All part-time (5-10 hours per week). End goal most likely being applying to PhD programs at the end of my current program.

I am thinking about taking an internship and helping with the two research projects, putting the TA position off to another semester. And maybe taking 3 classes instead of 4. But would this still be too much?

Experience: I’ve been helping my friends who are currently applying, or who have applied during the early application cycle. Other editing/writing experience would be in copywriting for newsletters and social media for my internship, editing winning peer essays for competitions such as the John Locke Institute Essay Competition. In creative writing, I have also won 2 gold awards at the Commonwealth Essay Competition.

I'm still a undergrad and therefore am looking to apply to GSB, CBS, and Haas Early Admit programs, rather than direct admission. Really open to criticisms, areas of concern, &amp; improvement points as an applicant &amp; individual below:   


**Profile:**   
Demographics: 21 Male, ORM by race, 1st Gen, East Coast city, Working Class family background  
Education: Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering BSE @ Top 3 Public Uni \[""top"" 25th school nationwide\]   
*My university offers a T15 business MBA program but I prefer to have a diversified alumni network &amp; denser city location and I frankly don't want to return for another 2 years in the temporary area of stay*

**Experience** (i promise this isn't disingenuous): 

* Incoming PM coop @ Tesla/Rivian/EV company (2022)
* 2x PM coop @ Google/Apple/Consumer Electronics (2020-2021)
* 3x PM/SWE intern @ F250 energy-utility (2017-2019)
* At this moment, short of luck and no FT job lined up for Fall 2022 as of yet :/ — I'll be seeking FT new grad opportunities once the calendar year resets

**Extracurriculars (since I'm still in undergrad):** 

* 1st Gen College Students President 
* Foreign Country STEM Instructor, director, &amp; virtual STEM bootcamp founder
* Did pro-bono consulting with university, clubs, schoolwork &amp; independently 
* University Triathlon Athlete (recreation/semi competitive since there isn't collegiate NCAA D1 conferences)

**Stats (Ah, what i'm kinda eerie about)**

* 3.1 - 3.2 engineering GPA 
   * consistent upward trend from 2.9 freshman to 3.4 range senior year
   * I had difficulty with 1st year weeder courses but as a 2nd/3rd/4th year, I really enjoyed my coursework
* 314 GRE (153V, 161Q) 
   * Just took my 1st attempt at the GRE yesterday after studying for 2-3 days (which i don't advise lol)

**Letters of Reference:**

* Known recommending individuals for 4-5 years whom can share separate professional-technical side as well as academic-leadership-organizational reviews. 3 Revisions drafted &amp; reviewed so far so I'm pretty confident in supplementing my application! 

**MBA Motivations:**

* Short term development goal: develop my interpersonal, leadership, entrepreneurial skills
* Short term Career goal: continue to advance my career as a PM in tech
* Long term career goal: prepare myself for director/vp/c-suite executive leadership having held a stronghold in various engineering firms for the past 1/4 of my life 
* Long term Passion goal: immerse myself in Tech/Energy/Infrastructure industries &amp; passion projects
   * (I know this is fairly vague, but this connects with my interests &amp; work experience)

**Schools of intent**

* Stanford GSB (Deferred Enrollment) Round 2
* Columbia Business School (Deferred Enrollment Program) - April 15th deadline
* Berkeley Haas (Accelerated Access) - April 28th deadline  


**Current Strategy:**   
Apply for Stanford GSB deferred in Round 2 to hear decision by end of March &amp; re-evaluate options as needed. Not a big fan of HBS, Sloan, Yale, Darden by virtue of curriculum &amp; culture, Booth &amp; Kellog would only be of consideration if I pursued new grad life in Chicago - Only other program I'd maybe consider is UPenn Wharton Moelis Advanced Access Program, but I'm not as sold on it yet as the 3 mentioned above.   


**Advising Questions** 

* Is this too cookie cutter as an applicant? 
   * I acknowledge that many other deferred applicants are really highly qualified / accomplished - have I done my part enough to differentiate myself? What else can be specified/improved as  improveable factors? 
* Is it worth taking GRE to improve it? 
   * Even though i made the dumb decision to study for 2/3 days, 314, although weak, is hopefully a  good start imo.  I made the best out of the situation at hand - **would 2-3 months of additional prep drastically improve this score?** I'm expecting 60-70 hr work weeks &amp; 15hrs of half-time coursework &amp; odd jobs here and there next semester so preparing the GRE will be tough to fill in - I'd most likely use GregMat if I were to prepare again
* Am I likely to be dinged/disqualified for my sub-optimal GPA/GRE scores? Can my extensive early work experience/extracurricular/references provide sufficient justification for admission? 
   * Yeah, my stats aren't exactly killing it - i'm more of a doer than a standardized exam taker. GPA isn't malleable but GRE scores could def be a changing factor to reach 85th percentiles with more practice. 
* Does the narrative i tell make relative sense? 
   * I know MBA programs generally sell this ""product"" to enable and advance's candidates professional goals. This is mostly entails career changes, industry switch, or career advancements. I'm already at FAANG/Big Tech &amp; hold PM credentials so thus the story is not a niche as others. I didn't convey it fully in this post but in summary goal is to primarily to elevate to exec level years down the road and/or exit big tech to passion-based initiatives.   


Thanks for the insights in advance, and hope everyone enjoys the upcoming holidays! :)"

rkuq45,84,2021-12-20,I worked 3 weeks as an unpaid intern at a Swiss startup,loanbis,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rkuq45/i_worked_3_weeks_as_an_unpaid_intern_at_a_swiss/,"A little bit of context : 

I thought I was hired at a Swiss startup based in Geneva to work as a backend dev in Python. But when I arrived at the workplace on Monday 29th November, the hiring person who is also a member of the dev team announced me that my employment contract will only be established in mid-January because they said they were really busy for December (to me, it was just a lame excuse to not pay me at the end of the month).

Nonetheless, I accepted their offer to do a trial period because my goal was to be truly hired as an employer but also to gain experience in the CS field. In fact, I pretty much had no experience with the technologies they used so I needed to follow tutorials for 1 week. For the first week, my dev team also needed to order computer pieces at the workplace then build a desktop computer with Linux installed on it. But I think it's something they should have done before my hiring...

Anyway, I started to work one week later on web scraping/spiders, configuring Docker and my dev environment first and foremost. I had a discussion with them to talk about my salary because it was unclear, but they told me that it was not a trial period but an unpaid internship... so they lied to me in the first place and made me believe wrong (on the recrutment website and on the calling interview, it was NEVER mentioned that it was an unpaid internship). They said they absolutely needed to hire a backend dev and that they would consider to hire me in mid-January if I work hard and prove them I'm worth it. I was not guaranteed to be hired but I decided to continue the internship for the experience and have a chance to be hired.

So, I continue to work for them for 2 weeks full-time until the 17th December and pretty much finished my web scraper (so I added some value to the startup and consequently should be paid). On the previous day, I received a call from my unemployment advisor and informed her that I would NOT be paid at the end of the month and that it was an unpaid internship instead. She said me that it is illegal in Switzerland to work for free and advised me to leave the internship as soon as possible. She also asked me to give the startup's phone number to call them for illegality, which I did...

What happened after the call is that I informed a member of the dev team about it and soon after, they decided to end the internship and offer me a gift of 200 CHF (without taking the restaurant outing prices in consideration). But now, they could pay me way more because my unemployment advisor will call them and ask to make a contract for me. If it happens, then it would totally be deserved because of the fact that they lied to me in the first place and their dishonesty concerning the employment promise.

What do you think about my story ? Do you agree with me that they should pay me more for the work I've done ?"

What projects/areas of practice should they try to get staffed on at MBB?

My first impression would be 

Corp Strat/Operations -&gt; Strategy &amp; Ops for Tech

Marketing &amp; Sales -&gt; Biz Dev/Partnership/Marketing for tech

Any relevant practice for PM or would it be more just the generalist route?"

rkwo1q,2,2021-12-20,Chance me for UMASS Amherst (Computer Science) and Colgate University,PollenIsPlantSperm69,chanceme,https://www.reddit.com/r/chanceme/comments/rkwo1q/chance_me_for_umass_amherst_computer_science_and/,"I am a half Hispanic male

I have a 3.67 GPA
4.0 weighted
Though my last 2 years have been 4.0 each marking period
1310 SAT

I take the most challenging courses I can
(Mostly APs and honors)
This year for example I'm taking
ECE (unconn credit) english
AP Calculus
AP CSA
Honors International Relations (was ece but the course itself got changed)
Normal physics (that's all my school offers)
And a humanities credit I need

I believe I have strong letters of recommendation from my CS teacher I've had a class with since freshman year

And my AP calc teacher who was also my precalc teacher last year

I've done a lot of internships through my school
My school has its own small company in the summer that teaches kids to work with customers and create and design actual products 

I did Cybersecurity and IT departemnt for 2 years and did a combo Cyber/IT during the spring version last year.

I'm a member of NHS and a Teachers Assistant

I did cyberpatriot last year (national Cybersecurity competition)

I also did an internship with Pratt and Whitney over the summer where I worked on research for future workplace models.

rkx8i2,3,2021-12-20,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/20/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/rkx8i2/weekly_job_qa_thread_12202021/,"Hi all,

Here is the 103rd installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

rkxdx0,5,2021-12-20,What is enough to get these SWE jobs?,EEEanadigi,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rkxdx0/what_is_enough_to_get_these_swe_jobs/,"**TLDR: I have 1 year to know how to get an interview at FAANG/F100 and then learn enough to pass the interviews.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Q1)** What do I need to do to get an interview? This is my biggest worry. Can anyone here offer their experience with this? what kind of profile specifically are they looking for?

**Q1.1)** Will FAANG/F100 even be interested in an EEE for a SWE role?**Q2)** Is doing Leetcode + Data structures+algorithims theory enough to get onto one of these grad schemes?

&amp;#x200B;

**Background:**

* Study Electrical Engineering at Imperial.
* Have near perfect grades starting from high school.
* I have done 2 Internships:
   * **Internship 1:** Data consulting at a large bank, complete garbage, learned nothing got paid ridiculous amount of money to make PowerPoint slides.
   * **Internship 2:** Software Developer at a start up, did many many things that had a significant impact on the company and was a great experience.

# I HATE ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING.

**Motivation:** Just had to make that clear. After working as a SWE, I 100% want to go into software engineering. The issue is that I have an almost 80% interview rate for EEE jobs and somehow studying here has allowed me to get interviews at places like Tesla/Qualcomm/Mediatek/Intel Etc rather easily. I want to replicate some level of success for SWE roles.

**Objective:** The equivalent to these would be FAANG for a SWE role. I understand this might be a bit too ambitious but I would at least want to get a grad scheme at a f100-500 company as **I want a structured graduate programme so I could maximize my learning opportunities** , writing production code to then eventually make it into FAANG.

**What I have done:**

* I am proficient in Python and C++ and have done various projects in Computer vison, modern C++ etc. I have a good project portfolio.
* I am grinding Leetcode and data and algorithms 2-3 hours on weekdays and 5-6 on weekends on top of my degree which is slowly taking its toll so hoping this pays off.

I already have a decent internship that I’ve been doing for 6 months, and I’m fortunate to have an Amazon internship secured for the summer. Im currently a Junior, but will probably take an extra year to finish. 

At this point, I think “C’s get degrees” is the move. Im not saying I won’t try in the classes, but I think there is no point in killing myself trying to get A’s.

I think using that extra time to work on shit that interests me, leetcode, and just enjoying college is time better spent.

During my experience at university, u worked in many different projects in many different languages such as Java, HTML, CSS, JS, Python, C, Swift, Obj-C. I’ve made websites, mobile apps, created algorithms, designed interfaces to name a few, but now I have no confidence in my skills as I couldn’t get an internship during school due to needing to work to pay bills, and facing hardships that affected my GPA. 

I look at some entry level and junior developer roles and it’s a lot of these languages and programs that I have little to no experience in and the network of people I reach out to for jobs ask for more than these entry level positions that I myself judge as unqualified for. 

Im currently looking at touching up my Python and learning SQL to try and land a data scientist/analyst role while I work towards a Software Engineer role just so I cash stick my foot in the water with my degree if that’s even possible.

I recently got an offer for 60k per year with benefits from a big tech company as an operations analyst and would be working fully remote in a LCOL area (parent's house). The role and team is not something I am enthusiastic about since it doesn't seem interesting.

I also feel like this role will pigeonhole me and make it difficult to transition to PM/TPM. Everyone that I have met throughout my recruiting process has been tremendously encouraging, nice, and helpful to me from start to finish compared to other companies.

I have been thinking about going to grad school to get my MBA, especially if I don't get a good job by the time I graduate. I want to get into PM/TPM as well become an executive (C-suite, VP) one day so that's the main reason for the MBA. I have a 3.9 GPA and will be earning 2 bachelors degrees (computer science and business).

I have been in touch with a higher-up at a large company who tried to get me to join for an internship (had already accepted another offer) but is trying now to get me to join for new grad. They will be helping me get a TPM role after the holidays and have me meet another higher-up who will tell me exactly what I would be doing. This has me excited since the team does impressive work in technology. I feel I have a solid chance.

My question is, if you were in my shoes or those of you who have experience, should I take the operations analyst role or take another route? Thoughts?

rl1bqj,1,2021-12-20,Thinking about finishing my Bachelor's to make a career change into tech,ashcat2010,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rl1bqj/thinking_about_finishing_my_bachelors_to_make_a/,"**TLDR;** I'm already working in the career field I wanted without finishing my Bachelor's...but am having serious doubts. I've been wanting to finish my degree and am thinking about doing it so that I can get into another field. A computer science degree is on my radar.

Okay so here's my best effort to make the long story short...I had a lot of trouble in my first attempt at college that ended up with me dropping out to pursue a full-time internship in a church. I excelled in the position and loved the work so I decided to pursue ministry. Earlier this year moved to another state to take a job in another church.

The thing is that while I believe in what I do and love the work itself...I'm having a lot of doubts about a long-term career in ministry for MANY reasons. This job has amplified a lot of those doubts, even though the place I work at is amazing. I'm starting to wonder if I really want to do this for the long run. And whether maybe I want to do it as a career...but not right now.

On that note, I've been wanting to finish my Bachelor's degree for the last year and half. I now have a stable job that can support me and can do school part-time until I need to do an internship or something that would require me to work somewhere else. But with everything going on, I'm starting to wonder whether instead of just doing something somewhat related to Christian ministry, I should just go a different route altogether. Computer Science is one thing I've been thinking about.

I'm a really creative person. I enjoy writing, playing music, and love the arts in general. But I also enjoy being analytical. Before I left school I took a Computer Science I class and LOVED it. I enjoyed the work and even made projects outside what was required. Sometimes to actually help me learn and sometimes because I had an idea for something I thought was funny along too much time on my hands. Math isn't my favorite thing in the world, but I do enjoy it and can be pretty damn good at it when I put in the work (I aced Calc I &amp; II in high school). I like being strategic and solving problems. If I did go this route, I think I'd want to work in stuff related to the arts. For example, building applications or software that artists/musicians/writers/whoever use to do what they do.

So there's the story...any thoughts or advice? Things about getting the degree or working in the tech field that are worth thinking about?"
rl1ves,416,2021-12-20,An update on my results,getitoffyrchest,nus,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/rl1ves/an_update_on_my_results/,"A few months ago, I shared my grades and a small little reflection [https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/npgxpu/my\_results\_for\_the\_sem](https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/npgxpu/my_results_for_the_sem)

I told myself that I'm going to continue with the tradition of sharing my grades - good or bad. It's anonymous anyway. And my reason for doing so is so that others who are not doing so well academically know that they're not alone and can see a little hope. I also hope nobody sees this as a boastful post, because really, there's nothing to boast about my CAP.

My grades (3 core mods &amp; 1 CS/SU mod):

A-, B+, B-, CS

Cumulative CAP: 3.4

I was really happy because this is actually my FIRST EVER A in my entire university life (though it's an A-). I've sort of given up the hope of getting an A but I finally got my first ever A 'variant' and I'm really proud of myself. It's funny that at this point, I'm still doubting myself. But I did put in a lot of effort for the projects and revision so I really should give myself credit for it, no matter how 'easy' the module was.

Some reflections:

\- I made the decision of dropping a mod I knew I couldn't keep up with. It was not an easy decision because it meant that I'd have to take another extra module next semester. But knowing how challenging CS3230 is, I decided that was the right thing to do. A part of me also wanted to not drop it and just scrape by but I felt it was a waste and searched for another mod I'd actually be interested in as a replacement next sem

\- I scored a B- for my most clueless module, CS3230. I honestly thought that I was going to fail and I kept doubting myself as usual. But turns out, I was just overthinking. I still did my best and focused on trying to complete the module and I'm so happy with getting a B-

\- This sem, I surrounded myself with more friends. This was also probably why I felt less dead, AND IT REALLY HELPED. We discussed tutorials and cleared our doubts together. It also gave me a little confidence boost whenever our answers were the same, or when I managed to help my friends with the answers - the truth is, we are sometimes better than we think we are!

What's next?

My time in university is soon coming to an end, with one more semester left. I can't do much about my past grades and I'm not expecting a very drastic change in my CAP - it'll probably be around the 3.5 range if I'm lucky, but I've been focusing on enjoying the modules and I think it helped made the past few semesters more bearable. I say bearable because I'm not gonna to lie, I still struggled in the previous semester as I always do, but it definitely felt better.

I'm also still sourcing for an internship (with not much luck so far).

&amp;#x200B;

I hope your grades turned out to be a nice surprise for you. Otherwise, what matters is that you did your best and you're well rested for the next semester. Don't give up, and hit me up if you need a chat!

If you're struggling to decide whether to SU a B, damn, you're one smartie and I unfortunately can't relate, but remember to enjoy your holidays too!

Wishing you all the best in the coming semester!"

Hi all, I apologize for the rant I am just pretty nervous. 

I am completing a background check form for a company and had two major concerns. I have heard rumors that this company is very thorough on their background checks, and I am not trying to hide anything, but I don’t want them to get the wrong idea of me.

First for employment history, I have one internship (I am a recent grad) that I had put on my resume as being from May-August. I had guessed those days, but when HR told me the real dates it was actually from June 25 to August 08. It sounds bad, but I had a very foggy memory as I had C.diff (a type of illness) at the time, and had some serious brain fog. I did not really talk about this internship experience when interviewing for the job, but I am scared they think I was trying to boost my time at that position. Additionally, that particular internship was an ‘volunteer internship’ so I don’t even know if I should include it. 

Secondly, a part of the background check is a credit check. When first being a college student I had a bad habit of using my credit card and forgetting to pay it back (there was no autopay for my bank), but I always ended up paying it and was never contacted by any agency about paying those, I would just realize one day I forgot to do it. Furthermore I did once have a debt collector call me regarding 60 bucks for a CT scan. At the time I was new in the US and did not understand the healthcare system. I had an injury inside the doctor’s office and they ordered me a CT scan. I had told them I didn’t want one, but they insisted and indicated I would not have to pay, but I did (though I did not realize until contacted by the debt collector, and I immediately paid when they contacted me). 

I am just worried these events will get my offer rescinded and I just wanted some advice. Thank you in advance."

 IB English Teacher - (10/10). I got A’s in her class every quarter and stayed after to ask for help on outside writing work I had to do for my extracurriculars. She was impressed with my ECs, and probably mentioned them in her letter. She agreed to write me a letter despite saying she would not because she retired this school year after 40+ years of teaching. 
 
IB Math Teacher - (10/10). Great relationship, I was one of the (if not the only) student to get a 7 on the IB Exam. I got to know her well a lot, and she knew about my ECs as well. 

Counselor - 10/10. I got to know her early on while most students never even talked to her once (she’s the counselor for around 100 students I believe). I as invited to do an equity training with school administration because of my ECs, and we got to know each other well there. 

(Optional Letter): Local Board of Education Member: I worked for her for over a year (I still do but not as much), and we got to know each other well. I connected students to her and she connected me to policy-work. 

**Essays**

10/10. Hard to rate my own essay. My Common app was less than 500 words, it’s more about portraying you have the ability to write eloquently than anything else. The supplement, in my view, is really important and I spent a lot of time on it.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Cornell (ED)

If anybody wants detailed advice on any part of the process or for me to read their essays, I’m thinking about launching a little $5-$10 service thing where I can help people out. Every little bit counts for college, and I’m trying to save up; COVID has severely impacted my family’s financial situation, so really anything can help. MSG ME IF INTERESTED!"

&amp;#x200B;

I would likely have to delay my graduation by 6+ months (from spring to fall semester) and give up taking classes that I specifically want to take next fall. It could also make recruiting season more difficult in the fall, and I would also likely lose a potential FT return offer from my incoming summer internship (F/G, possibly converted to an intern return offer instead) and up to 6 months of salary and work experience from working full time compared to if I graduated on time.

&amp;#x200B;

The upside is gaining experience working at a unicorn company and likely getting another very competitive return offer (\~$200k/yr based off levels), though I would likely use this offer only for negotiation as TikTok seems to have a troubling reputation regarding WLB/culture.

&amp;#x200B;

Would like some input from others to help decide.

rl8rte,0,2021-12-21,I’m convinced that I’m never getting a job in CS at this point and it’s my fault,stplttp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rl8rte/im_convinced_that_im_never_getting_a_job_in_cs_at/,"I've been applying to a lot of SWE internships but every time I'm either ghosted or rejected. Surprisingly I've been getting interviews, a couple final rounds too, but I still never get anything
back. The fact that I'm struggling now to get an internship when I'm supposed
to graduate next December is not very
encouraging. I've been told many times
at this point that if I don't get an
internship that l'Il never get a job in CS,
and I feel like with my limited time, I'm
at a point of desperation.

Background: Currently a senior graduating in December. I fucked up my freshman year and majored in something that I hated, switched to CS, so I'm pretty behind than where should be in comparison to everyone else. I'm doing average in my coursework (A's and B's, 3.2 GPA) and have some experience with part-time jobs, including one in my college as a computer lab consultant (fancy way of saying I fix basic computer issues). I think a major downside is that, aside from my introverted personality/inability to stand out, I'm not very good at explaining myself, so even with what I have now, my approach is very lackluster and unconvincing and therefore hurts my chances in interviews. Although this can easily be fixed with practice, the fact that I'm running out of time makes the stress even more heavy.

This post may sound whiny and I should probably suck it up, but I genuinely believe that I screwed my life over by not knowing what I wanted to do earlier in life and just the fact that I've tirelessly applied to so many jobs with very little feedback. At one point I enjoyed CS too, but now I'm not as happy with my decision.

I guess I don't have a lot of questions as this is really me venting, but I would like to at least know if anyone's in a similar situation or if there's SOME chance even with my hopelessness."

So I’m a chemical engineering major with a minor in data, currently in my third year first semester. My grades have been tanking since second year first semester. I was teaching high school chemistry and math throughout my college years, which took up all of my weekend times to revise. And I started attending case competitions/ hackathons which I won some/ lost some. Started to lose interest in my studies and was unable to gain it back. Started last summer with a full time intern at a government based company doing Frontend. Which made me lose my interest in my major even more.Changing major is not an option for me. Basically my GPA is now at a pathetic 2.3, when my first year was above 3.5. It dropped so much in the 1.5 years. Should I take a semester to re-evaluate my choices, restudy the topics or just to self-study things that align with my passion a lot more? I’m very lost. Really searching for any advice!"

I learned my passions was more reports l, analyzing and computers. I lost my job recently and I opened up to unemployment about my passion and how my degree wasn’t something people are looking for these days. Unemployment agreed and told me to go to workforce and they helped me get back into school. I was unsure about getting started during a time like this but I decided to take a risk. I was happy and proud that I did. I made good grades, was invited to three honors club, and made the deans list. I invited my family to ceremony that honored me and my sister called me out loud in front of everyone right before the ceremony how I am wasting my time at school because I have a degree and said many other things. My family looked at me in agreement. My family makes jokes like I am a professional student. My other sister told me i am wasting my time because of my age. I thought my mom and father was proud of me until I met her coworkers and they were like oh you’re the professional student. Yesterday my father basically said that I am wasting my time on my degree. There was never any praise for being accepted to these programs, invitations to speak, participate in these projects and interns. I wasn’t wasting my time feeling sorry for myself during these times. I went to school and was working on starting a mini online business that started to thrive last month.

I was excited to walk until I realized that my family think what I was doing was worthless.

Edit: thank you for the words of encouragement I just had to walk away from my family because they decided to tear me into a new one on how i am wasting my time. I will be starting my last semester soon and I was feeling discouraged and almost believed them for a second"

**What I've done in the last 18 months:** FRM Part 1 (1,1,1,1) | waiting for FRM Part 2 results(confident about passing) and CFA L1 applicant for May 2022 | 1 internship in forex trading | numerous free online courses | 1-year exp trading in Equity (profitable) | 6 months forex exp ( profitable in forex but lost it in gold and silver trades) | 3-4 months exp in options trading (breakeven) | Proficient in Programming because of my Engineering background | Familiar with data analytics | Familiar with Financial modelling and Financial Statement analysis |

**My plans for the next 2 years:** I'm applying for Masters in Finance and MSc in Finance programs for Fall 2022 in North America ( most likely I will get at least one admit) | Planning to complete both CFA 2 and 3 during my Masters as a lot of the curriculum overlaps | I will have completed at least 1-2 internships in Finance as it is mandatory for graduating |

**My expected profile in Fall 2024 if things go according to plan:** 25YO Male | Bachelors in Engineering | Masters in Finance | CFA L3 cleared | FRM Part 2 Cleared | hopefully, many connections from cohorts, alumni networks, Social Media, and Communities such as the CFA society | 2-3 years of investing/trading exp | proficient in Python/R | 2-3 internships in Finance | Good grades, knowledge and skills in Finance (I'm fairly hardworking so confident about it) |

In the spring (provided this next semester doesn't go horribly wrong) I will graduate college with BA's in Computer Science and Economics. Im starting to narrow my career search into the field of software/financial engineering, but covid made it extremely hard to nail internships these last 2 years, so I have my part time service job that I kept from high school and a short internship in IT to show for my experience these past years. I know a big thing for SE is independent projects, but the ones I started were almost never finished, and the one I finished ended up being a super simplistic tip calculator script.

I've just started to grind through leetcode to refamiliarize myself with data structures concepts from freshman year and prepare for interviews, but how can I position myself to get those interviews with no industry experience?

rlpbhr,3,2021-12-21,Is it valid for me to be this afraid of new grad interviews?,throwawayAmino,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rlpbhr/is_it_valid_for_me_to_be_this_afraid_of_new_grad/,"I accepted an intern offer at Meta for 2022. I also received another FAANG offer for the same term and could not get them to move the internship to another term, so I will have to decline it

These are the first offers I have ever gotten at tech companies. Before this, I interned at small banks/insurance, making max $26/hr. I’m supposed to graduate in 2022.

But I am so worried about what will happen if I can’t get a return offer from this FAANG company, or what will happen if by some chance this internship is cancelled. I am okay at interviewing, but full-time interviews seem wayy more difficult than intern ones. So I was thinking, maybe it would be worth to keep searching for another internship as a safety backup and delay graduation a bit (even though job hunting with school is exhausting). 

Tbh sometimes I dread the worst case of having to return to one of the small banks/insurance companies for full-time :( My friends say I am worrying too much, but they're smarter than me and have done many big tech internships."

Please take my question seriously.

I am a high school senior. I have good grades and a decent sat of 1410 but I have ZERO ECs and NO experience with programming. I have done nothing outside of school. No hobbies, no nothing. That's because I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life until a few months ago. Now, I know that computer science is what I want to do.

I really wanted to try getting a good internship. Not just Google Step or Microsoft Explore. But maybe at other good places like other MAANG or mongodb or in similar tier. Of course I'll settle for something lesser but why wouldn't I want to aim high?

My plan is to get a computer for Christmas and a book to learn Java. I'm using Rutger's intro to CS book for Java since I'm going to Rutgers. I also want to brush up on my math skills, so I'm gonna practice calculus a lot. 

I'm a little worried about my chances of getting into those companies though, because I haven't done any programming as of now and I have no ECs at all. But like.... just in case... if I really grinded from now to fall 2022, what are my chances of getting such a prestigious internship?"

rlqqvi,27,2021-12-21,Starting to feel defeated,techgirl8,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/rlqqvi/starting_to_feel_defeated/,"So I'm a computer science student and I will graduate in December of 2022. I'm a late bloomer I'm 30 years old. I'll be 31 when I graduate. Feels weird I'm this old lol. Anyways, I really want to be a software developer. I work full time and go to college full time and I spend every waking hour that I can studying programming and learning as much as I can. 

I feel I have learned a lot and I should be able to get a entry level job or at least an internship. All I keep getting is rejection after rejection. I can't even make it far enough to even get selected for an assessment for most of them. 

Why is it so hard to get a job as a junior developer? And why do they want a junior developer to have at least 3 years of experience? I think that is not right because how do we get that first job? Noone wants us. I can't network with anyone because I don't know anyone that is a software developer in my area and there's no jobs where I live so I am mainly looking for remote jobs.

I work so hard at this and I have a passion for this but it sucks when nobody will even give you a chance even for an internship. It's crazy.

EDIT: I have a bunch of projects I made on github. Apparently they are not good enough. I just need more practice I guess."
rlqvw3,1,2021-12-21,Complicated situation: Contemplating on whether or not I should jump ship,quietstewie,dataengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/rlqvw3/complicated_situation_contemplating_on_whether_or/,"Background: BS in Math, MS in Business Analytics, 1 yoe as a data analyst (and full time job in general)

Work environment: Data team is basically me and my boss in a small media company. Boss is in charge of data science, and I’ve become in charge of data engineering.

Situation: We transitioned from manual excel labor to having our own database and automated data pipelines. I wrote a Python program from scratch and this transition would’ve been impossible without it. My boss doesn’t even dare to touch the backend because he knows nothing of it. Now I’m in charge of maintaining our database and data pipelines in AWS. I’ve mostly been learning from the engineer we contracted to set it up but he’s leaving soon. My boss has the same AWS knowledge as I do but he has other responsibilities so he’s putting me in charge of it. My review is coming up soon and he’s been hinting about me being the engineer but I’m not sure what kind of raise I should ask for.

Problem: If I try to ask for DE salary I’d be asking for at least a 60% raise. On top of that I only have 1 year of experience, maybe 2 if you count my intern days. Right now I don’t need sponsorship but I will need it in 2 years and I’m not sure if companies are willing to sponsor me in such a short time. I’m not against jumping ship but I have so much concern about it because I wouldn’t have as much leverage to ask for a sponsorship as I do in this company. Yet if I don’t leave, I’ll be getting severely underpaid. 

Questions: 

1. How much is appropriate for a raise? 

2. Do you think I can apply for DE positions with 1 year of experience? If yes, what’s the salary range should I expect? If not, what kind of jobs should I be applying for?

Thank you in advance and I welcome any sort of advice as well. I’m basically a fresh grad working in a company that doesn’t know what they’re doing. I’m given too many responsibilities and no one checks my work. I test and triple check my work myself every time and so far nothing has gone wrong yet but I don’t get paid enough for this. Not sure what to do :("
rlr3zm,5,2021-12-21,Offer Deadline extension,someRandomCSPerson,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rlr3zm/offer_deadline_extension/,"I received my very first offer for a summer internship a couple of days ago. I was so excited. They gave me the offer with an expiration deadline of two weeks(""extendable if you give us a really good reason"" they said). The day after I was given the offer, two other companies reached out and wanted to start interviewing with me. Both companies are FAANG level, so they are bigger with a better reputation. 

So, now my question(s) is, is wanting to interview with the other companies a valid enough reason for me to ask for an offer deadline extension? what would you do if you were me? would you just go with the one offer you got? ask for an extension? give it up on hope one of the new companies accept you? accept the offer and drop the new companies? accept the offer and continue with the interview anyway cause why not? etc...

Might sound weird, but ever since I was a child I wanted to be a teacher, I kept this dream and ended up going to Math college in hopes of becoming a teacher.
I’m a hardworker, so at my third semester of college I got myself an internship, here in Brazil there are a lot of internships for aspiring teachers in pre schools because of the way our college admission exams work. We are basically tutors.
I worked my ass off, but I was one of hundreds of tutors and had zero supervision, even tho I tried for other internships, I had a sense of loyalty and “hard work will earn me a promotion some day” and stayed in the same one. I was there for over 3 years until they laid off every single intern due to Covid in 2020.
Fast foward 6 months, found myself another internship, once again, no supervision, no one to tell me if I was doing a good or a bad job. No promotion or even a nod at my work.
Fast forward a year, im graduating and working as an intern at yet another place, still tutoring. The thing is: the place i’m working for right now does evaluate me and even has a tutor ranking. There I was able to see that not only I get about 3 times as much students than anyone, but I have perfect evaluations.
But finding out I was actually really good at my job was actually frustrating, because it just makes me more frustrated about the fact that I can’t ever even come close to a decent job.
The thing is, getting a good job in education in Brazil is mostly about nepotism, most of my employed friends have a job because they knew someone. The others work in public education, which can also take up years just so I can be nominated for a low paying job.
So everyday I wake up and do my current job, which I excel at, knowing fully well I won’t get promoted, doing tutoring (which is very different from actual teaching, and might I add my current job is online, so students basically treat me as a human calculator), getting paid just above minimum wage and seeing everyone around me go to cool places in their career while I feel stuck cause the job I love has awful opportunities.
I have recently signed up for computer science classes, thinking about just giving up education for a while and working IT until and if ever I can land a good job in education or maybe until the next public education exam comes out.
But until then, I feel like I’ll keep being miserable as an overqualified online tutor who can’t ever catch a break."

This April, I'll be graduating with my Bachelor's in Comp Sci (the remote possibility I fail a course aside). I failed to get an internship or any relevant work experience during my degree. I definitely wasn't making *zero* effort, though I'll admit I wasn't ever trying my hardest (it's a bit of a long story I won't get into here).

How hard will finding a job post-graduation be? I'm graduating from the University of Calgary, so if any are familiar with the local job market here your input's especially valuable, but I don't mind hearing general answers since I'm curious to know how tough it is for no-internship new grads to find work in general.

Thanks for your input."

My question is, does research at a university carry the same weight as gaining an internship or co-op? I really had my heart set on research but I want to exit university with a good foundation of real-world skills that will put me into a better salary bargaining position. I'm a non-traditional student, in my low 30's and feel like I need to catch up. I'd be grateful for any advice you can share.
 
Edit to add:
I'm going for mechE. Let's say the research is in the same field as the co-op would be. Would an employer view research done at university with similar weighting to an internship? I guess what my question boils down to, does research at university make an impact in the eyes of employers?"

I scored an 818, and began studying 2.5 weeks ago. 
I decided I was going to get this cert between semesters, and I put in ~6 hours of studying every week day, and a few hours over weekends. 

Studying habits and schedule went as follows:
Dion’s Udemy course, taking comprehensive notes on everything. I filled an entire notebook, front to back. This took up a good portion of my time, in hindsight. 
I felt like this gave me an okay understanding of the topics, and what was going to be covered. 
Next came Messer’s series. This solidified the knowledge for me. Frequently referencing the exam objectives, watching Messer’s videos, and ensuring I had a solid fundamental understanding of the concepts. Messer is unmatched in this regard. 
Throughout this entire time, I was doing a few PocketPrep quizzes each day. This kept the material fresh, and put the knowledge into a practical application. 
Dion’s exams were extremely useful. They were really close to the actual exam in my experience. I used Dion’s Udemy course containing 1 practice exam, and then bought Dion’s course containing 6 practice exams. 
My scores are as follows, in chronological order. (I only took each exam one time)
Exam 1: 84
Exam 2: 88
Exam 3: 88
Exam 4: 82
Exam 5: 88
Exam 6: 92
Exam 7: 89

I began taking the practice exams 12 days after the beginning of my studies, and I took my last practice exam the day before the real exam. 

I have roughly 8 months of internship experience dealing mostly with Desktop Tech responsibilities. No real networking experience apart from the usual configurations. 

Feel free to ask questions in the comments, I’d be more than happy to help anyone looking for tips!"

* 11th-grade social studies teacher. Super nice, I did well and participated a lot in his class. 
* Drama teacher who I had for 11th and 12th grade (I have drama for around 3-4 hours a day, so it's a big part of my time at school). She likes me a lot, I think this was my strongest letter.
* Guidance Counselor. Pretty standard I'm guessing, but she does know me on a name basis and talks to me a lot whenever I see her.

**Essays** 

Common app was pretty good, everyone who read it said it was original and well written. My topic was unique. 

I'm really proud of my UChicago essays, everyone who looked over them said they were good. I'm not an amazing writer, but I think they're funny, thoughtful, and well written. My Why Us essay was distinct and I didn't follow the traditional form at all for it. 

I'd say the strongest parts of my application were my test scores, rigorous courses, and common app/UChicago essays (in order of strength). I think the weakest part is probably my ECs, which while varied, there's nothing insane, and my LORs. Good luck to anyone applying to UChicago! ED is defiantly a huge boost for them."

However, I am worried about future prospects and whether I will have any shot at the bigger companies next year when I am looking for full-time jobs. I know comparison isn't wise but many of my peers seem to be landing internships at much larger companies that may not be FAANG but still have much more recognition.

I'm a recent poly grad so I'm in my early twenties. After working for about a year I realized I don't enjoy the career route I've chosen to study a diploma on (Chemistry/Chemical Engineering).

I heard from a colleague that he joined Skillsfuture and did a career change, but he was in his mid thirties and thus could participate in the mid-career switch programme.

I am looking to take up IT related courses that I can take so I would at least have a certificate to back me up when doing job hunting. However, the issue I'm running into is that skillsfuture only gives credit to Singaporeans aged 25 and above. I'm not old enough to get the credit and paying for the course upright is too expensive for me as I don't have an income anymore.

I read up online that Coursera and Udemy are good places to start if one is considering on picking up a new skill or a reliable cert. Coursera provides free courses while I've seen that Udemy can be 50/50 in terms of course quality. Along with the fact that bootcamps doesn't actually help if you're thinking of picking up IT related skills.

Is it better to go by Skillsfuture? Can I request for credit or some type of subsidy even though I'm not 25? I see on the website that they offer on job training through SGUnited Skills but I don't think I am eligible for it. Would it be smarter to just go back and get another diploma or try my luck with a private uni? (I don't think I'll be able to get into local Uni). A poly intern I worked with mentioned she could apply for skillsfuture diploma but the course will be 3 whole years instead of 1. I'm trying to look for something that's at most 1 year, like a specialist diploma if possible. I feel like I've already wasted a lot of my life studying with nothing to show for it.

Or should I just try and learn skills through Coursera free courses? I've never had any experience in IT so it'll be pretty much dipping my foot into the field for the first time ever. Someone recommended buying courses from Udemy but I'm not sure if its reliable. I'll want to be able to get a reliable cert too, as employers in Singapore tend to favor it.

Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated! I'm just trying my best to find a way and improve myself while I still have the time to do so."

For example, I took both one-year sequences of OOP Java/C++, which includes OOP methodologies, software design, data structures + algorithms in both C++ and Java but I took these classes two years ago and haven't developed any big projects with those languages. In Comparison, I took only 3 months of Python and MySQL but have been using these two every day for 1 year at a startup.

So what should I put in the resume's skill section in my case? I feel like people only put it in the resume when they use the language or are experts in it. Thank you"

I am currently studying for a B.S. in information technology. I’m more than halfway done. It’s about time to start looking for summer internships soon. 

The issue is, I haven’t decided which path I’d like to take; web/software dev, devop stuff, or sysadmin&gt;cybersecurity. 

If I get into devop stuff or cybersecurity, I understand my bachelors is quite relevant. However, if I was to get into software engineering, I see my major being an impediment to getting a software engineering internship, I am already starting to see the effects of it. (And I am still not a great coder/mathematical thinker) 

I’ve recently discovered my university offers an “align” MSCS program where after about a year of “bridge” classes meant to catch you up, you become a regular masters of computer science student. I’m estimating the cost for this would be like 50k. 

I guess I have a few questions.

-If I go the I.T. pathway and work an I. T. job that pays for education, would my employer be willing to pay for me getting an MSCS degree, or would they consider it irrelevant? I’d rather finance the degree in this way and other fields seem more attainable to me at this moment

-Would the MSCS be worth doing or should I do some coding projects, leetcode, secure a developer internship with my IT degree, and once I have the experience not worry about further education? Share your experience getting a dev/swe internship/co-op with an IT degree.

-What type of internship should I be seeking? Can you tell me your experience with the outlooks of DevOps, cybersecurity, Sysadmin/Development in the context of an IT degree and what you guys would choose if you were in my place? Share additional tips for what I should do this next few months to secure a lucrative career internship. 

I should mention I am ready to start making actual money now/start doing real things in the industry and not looking forward to more academia. I value the MSCS degree but would like to get to the workforce ASAP. I like programming due to my entrepreneurial leanings and the fact that making apps is a great tool for that."

Some background:  

I'm a CS grad, specialized in AI at that time (2019).

I've been working in 3 companies (2018 - present):

1. First Co.: I spent 2 years there, started as AI intern then pivoted to .NET backend dev because they required me to do so and I decided that I enjoyed it more than AI related work. I learned little to nothing related to industry best practices but I learn how to get stuff done on my own. I was actively looking for a new job because I did just move to a big city, hoping for a better salary and conditions.

2. Second Co,: I spent 1 year and a half in this company as .NET backend dev, everything was cool, we used Scrum, DDD, CQRS, tested... I learned a lot of new stuff but then management screw things up by hiring an unqualified PO that after half a year did not show any improvement at all. Tired of the situation I started to look for new jobs one more time.

3. Current Co.; I've been working here for 5 months as .NET backend dev. We are doing everything on ""our own (worse) way"", code is heavily coupled with third parties, it is copy-pasted across regions, not a single integration test, running db migrations manually... While I'm the least experienced dev I'm trying to introduce design patterns and refine our architecture but it is being a hell of a battle. Apart from this, our CTO has told me that he is going to be letting the backend dev team make architecture choices and he will be taking a passive role (We are 2 backend devs + CTO)

My current mood is to start looking for a new job one more time, but I'm not sure if I'm biased because of my recent delusion in a company where, at some point, everything was fancy but got ruined.

So, my questions are: 

Q1: Had you experienced something like this in the past? How did it end up?

Q2: In your opinion, is it a bad idea to start looking for a new job that soon (after 5 months) or I should force myself to stay a bit more?"

rm5s1h,182,2021-12-22,I am constantly baffled by Architects - Civil Engineering,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/rm5s1h/i_am_constantly_baffled_by_architects_civil/,"I am a civil engineer, I work in the concrete industry, and this has been a topic of conversation several times, and all though we all end up saying the usual ""not my responsibility, just get your part done"" excuse, some of the architects (and sometimes engineers) are straight up in competent, or are fielding dozens of minimum wage interns who have never worked a day in their life.

Lets start with a few things.

Designing buildings with ovals, rounded corners, circles, etc. This looks really cool! It is a nightmare to build. There are plenty of things that are standardized, but cutting together a half dozen radii and then calling it an oval doesn't make the fields work any easier. Its much easier to just make a square building, change my mind.

Then there is the autocad side of the equation. I work extensively with autocad on a daily basis trying to actually make this work, but its near impossible to get anything done on time when none of your lines intersect using the dimensions provided. I am sorry, but throw your 500 page doc in the shredder and start over if you can't find someone to go into cad and review this trash to make sure it actually lines up to what you claim it does.

Back to the oval/circle story, imagine being given a line with 47 (yes, 47) radii that need to intersect to create a coherent edge...except most of the circles never intersect. If it was 1/32"" of an inch, we won't care, but some of this crap is up to 6"" off, and its appalling that this got pushed into official docs.

You might tell me, just go and ask for the info, send an RFI, what ever. Right. 2 months later I get their own cad file. The architect is fuming and mad because he thinks I am incompetent. I proceed to look through his cad file, the lines don't add up. Nice! I redraw the whole thing from scratch using his own dimensions in the cad file. Same thing.

I am sorry, but I really think someone needs to get either fired, or go back to school, or something. Okay you want to build a fancy shmancy building with enough overhanging pools and decorations that I still have zero idea how its going to get shored to the ground some 40 floors down, fine, we will build it. JUST GIVE ME THE RIGHT DIMENSIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER.

Sometimes you really want to throw the contract right out the window simply for the fact that everything is late by weeks. I get it, we all have a ton of work to do, but for some reason I have the time to do my work, and redo the architects work for them as well.

Someone please explain to me what this fascination is with just drawing random stuff that doesn't work and expecting someone else to build it.

EDIT:

It is painfully obvious how many of you have zero experience in what I am talking about, and I get it, engineering is broad and deep and there are way too many fields here that my not know the civil side of things.

To clarify, and possibly condense, my rant, my issue with architects is there hands off approach of simply handing off an absurd idea to someone else and expecting them to figure it out for them. Sure, that may be my job, but I am only at liberty to do so much and take upon myself to make only certain changes that I am legally allowed to. I can't simply tell the architect, hey listen, I think this curved wall is too complicated so I am going to make it a square. Therefore my job is to find said information, and utilize it to the best of my abilities. It becomes extremely difficult to get anything done when the architects think they can draw a few lines and call it a day and go have a vacation. When shit needs to get done, I expect an architect to have the same work ethic as an engineer, to buckle down and figure out problems together, and if the ball is in their court, to not drag it out longer than needed instead of throwing it back and saying ""I don't know what this is, figure it out""."
rm7zic,80,2021-12-22,Make sure to pick the right electives early on.,fryingpannnnn,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rm7zic/make_sure_to_pick_the_right_electives_early_on/,"I'm nearing the end of my CS degree with two semesters left so I here's something I'd recommend regarding courses since I realized a lot of people weren't doing this.

Make sure to be careful when choosing your electives. Some of them might be quite practical and useful for specific job roles you're looking for. The earlier you take them, the more knowledge you'll have when comes time for your internships, both for the interview and on the job. Go through all the available courses your school has to find them, there's probably some webpage for that on your school's website.

For myself, I made sure to take electives related to both AI and web development to know which field I'd prefer more. I took the web development electives my school had as early as possible during my first year and that actually helped land my first internship. It's crazy how you could go through some CS programs without ever touching much practical coding experience in class. Usually the core courses are more theoretical but most unis have some kind of web development course which I'd recommend to take. There's usually some kind of project in those classes which you can use on your resume to demonstrate certain technologies/concepts.

I go over the courses I took this semester, artificial intelligence, web development, databases and operating systems, in this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgscYHK0SQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgscYHK0SQ) :)"

What’s a good place to start from the bottom that will get me any experience? I was looking on Indeed for any IT positions, but they all require you to have some experience with a lot of knowledge.

\[sorry for the ""backstory"" maybe will help with advice????\]

I am a Canadian high school junior very passionate about mathematics and would like to pursue it at university. I have only recently (for about six months, now) been this intensely interested in mathematics - actually, more than a year ago, I really hated it! Before then, I was really interested in wildlife and conservation - and co-created and did artwork for a free mobile game about bird conservation that has thousands of downloads globally!! Since the pandemic, I've gotten interested in machine learning, computer science, and other topics, which has lead me to spend a lot of time with math, and I have ended up really liking it. I now spend pretty much every spare moment studying math, and in this past (two) years, I've taught myself Python, calculus, linear algebra, machine learning (which lead me to do a summer machine learning internship at a startup), and more recently, I have been using textbooks to pursue pure maths on my own, and have recently gotten to some ""graduate-level"" mathematics. I hope to be able to get to do some real maths research at my local university before I get to Uni, perhaps this coming summer. 

I am Canadian, and normally, going to the states (or really, anywhere outside of Canada) would be super impossible due to cost. Luckily, I've been priveliged enough in the past year to have been awarded two ""full-ride"" scholarships to any university I'd like (mostly for some of my past work in wildlife conservation education, but also for some of this new math/machine learning stuff) - covering not just tuition but food, living costs, etc... so anything is on the table. 

I am also in the IB program (it pains me to say that), which might help with things. Im currently ""on track"" for a 7 in HL English (above 97%), a 7 in SL chemistry (above 96%), a 6, *maybe (probably not)* 7 in HL math (96% or above), and I don't know about the rest of my courses since they are next semester. 

My worry is my ACT. I got a 34 composite, which is pretty ok, but the breakdown was: 36 english, 36 reading, 34 science,  31 math, 11 (out of 12) on writing. The low math score makes sense - even though I love math, I'm not necessarily *fast* at it, (that's why, although I love competition problems, I don't really like the time limit), which can cause me to rush. I am also amazing at making the stupidest mistakes (none of the ACT problems are that mentally challenging, but 60 questions in an hour can cause me to do stupid things). Despite my recent obsession in math, it could be said that I'm more ""naturally"" an ""english person"". 

SO. Sorry for all of that. If I want a chance at pursuing math, even though my overall stats are ""pretty good"" for *perhaps maybe having a small chance at* getting in to a top US university (it seems ridiculously hard as a Canadian, or really any international), should I retake it? Are perhaps some math programs looking for more people with strong english backgounds (i hope ;)). Perhaps my ""most attainable"" of the ""very unattainable dream schools"" for me is Princeton, as my school seems to have a connection with them and seems to send one every year. Does that score pretty much rule out going to Princeton?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for all the texts, and my sincerest gratitude for anyone with the patience to go through all this and reply.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

rmawvm,2,2021-12-22,"Need your support, advice &amp; help please! Life is falling apart.",-seeker_,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/rmawvm/need_your_support_advice_help_please_life_is/,"Hello everyone,

My life is falling apart and I have to take action now.  I go to bed when most people wake up. And these days I stay in bed for the whole day today. Doing literally almost nothing on several days. I started with my internship in september, but had to quit 5 weeks ago because of mental &amp; physical health problems.

I am also thinking of quitting my study, for the 5th time!!!  
I find it really difficult to have a side job next to my study. When I am studying, all of my mental focus goes into that. Which drains my mental battery totally. One of the reasons that I want to quit, is that I can start to earn money and focus only on photography. Instead of getting deeper in debt, without knowing if this study is going to benefit me in the future.

\*\*A little background story (studies &amp; balance)\*\*  
I am a 27 years old, creative guy. Photography is my passion, as I am a visual person. In the past, I've quit my studies multiple times(4x).

I am now studying for the fifth time, but this time a creative study (multimedia design). During my 1st year I lived with family, so they did everything for me in the house. During the 2nd year, I moved on my own, just when the covid pandemic started. Studying from home made living on my own feel as if I am riding a bike with side wheels. Because I didn't have to go by train to the university, which saved me time and energy. With several other benefits. During the 3rd year, this year, things changed drastically... i started an internship and my bad focus gave me a hard time! I was forgetful too sometimes. I came also often too late. My life had no stability/balance anymore and I became very tired. There was also something going on with my physical health **(see side note)**. So I decided to quit my internship to focus on my physical and mental health.

It has been five weeks since I quit. Now I am thinking of quitting my study again and to follow my passion: photography. But.... I am doubting if this is the right decision.

**side note: TRT** In the 2nd year of my study I started TRT(testosterone replacement therapy) which gave me extra energy and I went to the gym a lot with the extra time I had, due studying at home. I lowered my dosage, because it had a negative impact on studying and because of side-effects. And eventually I quit TRT when I left my internship, because of these side-effects. So my testosterone is now being 'restarted'. Initially I didn't need TRT, but I was stubborn. Symptoms of ADHD could have been the reason that I thought that I had low testosterone symptoms.

**Therapy** In april 2021 I stopped after being 2 years in therapy (for my anxiety, emotion regulation and forming my own identity). During therapy I learned where my intense emotions arised from (scheme therapy) so that I could be more rational. Therapy helped me a lot, by giving me mental space and it made me mentally more stable.

**Diagnosis &amp; personality disorder interview** In my diagnosis it was mentioned that:-my attachment style is: anxious-ambivalent(in Dutch: onveilig (ambivalent) gehecht).-that i have traits in my personality from cluster B and C personality disorders, which also could be coming from ADHD.I have social anxiety and agora phobia.

I also had an interview to asses if I had a personality disorder. Only thing, this was with a woman and I am shy with women, so I held myself in during this interview... so no personality disorder and my psychologist told me one that I don't have one, because my problems are not that severe when compared to people with a personality disorder diagnosis.

\*\*ADHD(medication, research, childhood)\*\*  
In July/August this year, I went to my GP to ask for a new ADHD medicine, but he told me that I had to go to a psychiatrist. the appointment is scheduled halfway February(6months later).  
During the two years of therapy I wanted to start with adhd medication and insisted on having an adhd research, because in the past I used &amp; abused drugs and knew that amphetamine made me stable and gave me a calm feeling from within. I also was tired of my chaotic mind full of thoughts.

I had an adhd research done in 2019, but to an extent I think it wasn't done very well. As an adult I have symptoms of combined ADHD. However the diagnosis was 'delayed', because they were not sure if I had it as a child. My my mother told the psychologist that I was normal as a kid. But she also doesn't really buy the idea of ADHD and as I've known her, I think that she wasn't aware of the symptoms, because she doesn't and didn't know anything about ADHD...

During my last conversation with the adhd research psychologist, I tried to ask for some clarification and I didn't get much out of it. I also said that my report cards showed *only* good/excellent results. End of conversation. -.-

When I now look closely at my school report cards, from when I was 6-7 years, there are a couple of remarks mentioned about my behavior that could be related to adhd? I don't know for sure if that's the case, but I would love to hear from you guys what you think? So that I can help from a new psychologist and get a new research done.

elementary class 2 - **6 years old**  
*""repeating sentences of 4 words is difficult""(note that I emigrated to the Netherlands when I was 4)*  
*""LISTEN closely/carefully!""*  
*""Take your time!!!""*  
*""wants to quickly &gt; innacurate""*  
*""fails according to his own idea""*  
*""...thinks now before he speaks""*

elementary class 3 - **7 years old**  
*""sometimes he wants to do his best so much that he forgets to listen""*  
*""Should wait on your turn &amp; think before you speak""*  
*""should focus more on his work""*  
*""don't hesitate/doubt yourself!""*  
*""is interested in everything!""*

**School performance &amp; adolescence years at school**  
All my school reports and school performance afterwards were good/excellent. I liked school when I was a kid/teenager. Until when I was 15/16, everything went well. I chose a level halfway highschool that was somehow too difficult for me and subjects that were not in my interest, because I thought that I needed those subjects to become a doctor (lolz).. and I started drinking &amp; using drugs from age 16/17. From that point everything went downwards. I started neglecting my homework more(I think that I was inconsistent before neglecting it). Slept always late and came often too late. I also remember that I was the ""class clown"" and loved showing resistance towards some teachers that ""didn't like me"".

**ADHD medication**  
I tried ritalin (several brands) and also Vyvanse via the psychiatrist. The results were mixed. I could definitely sit still for a longer period of time and focus on 1 task. Without switching to 1000 other activities. My mind becomes quiet (sometimes). I also was very positive and told my psychologists one time when I took it: ""everything is fine, there are no problems in my life"". But retention of information during conversations(calling or whats app) wasn't always better, sometimes even worse.. I sometimes felt dumber on them. Also my creativity got worse sometimes and my ""photo editing"" skills were impacted, because I would be less detail oriented. So it really impacts me negatively visually..

As of now, I got my hands on ritalin (not prescribed). Just took 5mg half way this post, because I was switching to FB and insta constantly. I also experience the same as before: sitting still is way easier for me, I can focus on 1 task &amp; I have more patience. For example when watching tutorial videos. But it's not that I am focussed completely on everything what the guy in the tutorial says, only on the important stuff that I can apply. However sometimes at the beginning I feel rushed &amp; I sense a dopamine high and then after 30-40 minutes I can be chaotic/make more mistakes/ messy. &lt; *is this because I don't have adhd*? People say that the effect of medication is subtle.. Finally my way of thinking gets also blocked/disrupted (thinking deeply &amp; in a diverge way).

**ADHD symptoms?**  
*I am chaotic when I work &amp; talk. (but I can also be very orderly and detail oriented)*  
*Shy*  
often s*low*  
*I tend to forget what I said or should say during conversations*  
*I can ramble/talk a lot.*  
*Low frustation tolerance/ no patience.*  
*Intrusive thoughts.*  
*A very busy mind.*  
*Can't sit still too long with boring tasks.*  
*hyperfocus and I can read a lot when I am interested in /obsessed with something.*  
*Especially on Reddit...*  
*Procastinating until last minute*  
A*ddictive personality*

\*\*OCD or perhaps undiagnosed Borderline personality disorder?\*\*  
During this summer I experienced scary intrusive thoughts that really made me scared. So I started researching and found that it was related to OCD. I am 100% sure that I have OCD if I look at my behavior and thoughts... I also read that some of OCD symptoms could overlap with ADHD. And I also found out that some of borderline symptoms could overlap with ADHD. I also can find myself in some of the BPD symptoms. I also know that these disorders are not mutually exclusive, so they can be present in 1 person.

**Finally** I don't want to get a diagnosis from you guys, but I want some insights &amp; help. Also if you can relate to my problems and tell me your experience, that would really help me out.

**Questions:** \-Do you guys think that I might have adhd? Or am I too obsessed with getting a diagnosis?-Should I go back go former psychologist?  
\-Or should I search for another mental health institution with a different adhd research team?(I found one, but the waiting list is: 5-6 months again...)?  
\-Concerning adhd medication, have you also experienced the same effects? any similarities?  
\-If you have OCD or BPD (with/without adhd), could you share your story/experience/advice with me?

**TLDR:** I am looking for help, advice &amp; experiences.. I am unsure whether I have ADHD, OCD and/or BPD, which are causing problems in my life, especially at school/internship. I have quit several studies and I am thinking of quitting again. Because I find it really difficult to have a stable and balanced life. I have tried adhd medication with mixed result. I also share some remarks from my teachers during elementary school and also some symptoms that I have."

I only sold 3 item and I don't even think I can disclose anybody address and name without consent, and because they don't disclose any amount how much should I pay I don't even understand how should I send them money back.
I already Stopped selling a month ago that's why I don't understand this letter as it wasn't even a certificate mail not a cease and desist letter just a first class post from a legit lawfirm, however there was no seal and no lawyer signature or phone number only an email address and a lawyer helper email address and a Vodafone phone number, also I found out she only works there for one month and freshly finished school so maybe that's an intern work or something?
There was no extra envelope for answer there was no copy from the letter and it also asked to send everything back with the original letter. it really looked like a simple warning letter, they mentioned that I immediately have to stop selling these product but I don't even sell it since November 16th.
And as I said I only sold 3  olaplex sample bottle so its hard to believe that a big company want to get me for 30 pound
It's still scary and I don't know what to do as they only give me time since 28of December which has 4 Bank Holidays and 2 weekend day which takes 6 days from the 14 day waiting time.

I love working on personal projects, listening to and watching engineering related stuff in my free time, and I get way too excited talking about the domain towards my non-engineering friends, etc. etc. When I imagine my future career, I picture myself being very invested in my career, and excited about the work. I see myself looking forward to getting out of bed to face tough technical challenges, while collaborating with bright minds and similarly invested individuals.  

However, the past ""professional"" experiences I've had throughout my schooling (2 internships) have left me rather underwhelmed. I expected to be immersed in an environment filled with invested engineers running around, solving interesting problems, devoted to their job.... Instead it all seemed a bit... dull. A lot less flashy. More of a 9-5 then clock out type vibe (mainly due to my coworkers' behavior and comments). It's hard to put into words, but overall it felt much less exciting than I thought it would be. These feelings were in stark contrast with how I feel when working on my personal projects (passionate, easy to not see the hours go by, etc.). 

Now I'm aware that: 1) I was only an intern; 2) the companies were somewhat on the smaller side (company 1 \~ 30 people, company 2 \~ 120 people); 3) all company ambiances are different; 4) working on personal projects is of course not going to feel the same as working on a company project.

At the end of the day though, I'm still a bit anxious about finding a company environment that is even close to matching my expectations, which in turn worries me that I'll never feel fulfilled working as an engineer. I'm young, with very few commitments, and I guess I've just been betting a lot on being super invested in my career. If my idealization of being an engineer just that, an extreme idealization of reality, I'm not sure where to go from here.  

I've figured that I should try working at a much bigger company, and in general keep trying different places until I feel somewhat at home... although perhaps I'll never find where I belong due to these unrealistic expectations...

Anyway, I'd love to hear from you all about this. How do you feel about your work? Is it just a 9-5 for you? Is it your passion? Am I being unrealistic?"
rmfh2a,2,2021-12-22,Resume Help Request - Summer Finance / Consulting Internship Search,ShardenTrader,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/rmfh2a/resume_help_request_summer_finance_consulting/,"Hello all,

I am currently in the process of applying to a second wave of internships for the summer. I have landed a few interviews with companies but have received far more auto-rejections than interviews. To state the obvious, my GPA is not the best however it is above the threshold set by the internships I am applying to. I had a rough freshman year grades-wise, and have been steadily raising my GPA each semester. I expect to graduate with a 3.4 - 3.5 cumulative. My in-major GPA is 3.55 but I am unsure if I should include this in addition to my cumulative GPA.

One additional note is I am developing a solid portfolio of project experience, mainly centered around algorithmic trading and quantitative analysis of equities and derivatives using Python. I don't have much room on my resume, is it worth condensing other sections to add relevant projects?

Any help or constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

rmg9p1,3,2021-12-22,How do you deal with a lack of motivation?,arc_menace,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/rmg9p1/how_do_you_deal_with_a_lack_of_motivation/,"I'm not sure if this kind of question is allowed but here goes.

I'm a junior web developer and started programming for work in 2020 (initially as a summer intern at my current company) so I have always worked remotely. When I started work I could regularly get 5-7 productive hours of work out of my work day. Recently, I have been getting closer to 3-4 and sometimes less. I feel bad saying that because I'm really not trying to slack off. I just feel tired and unmotivated to really get into stuff and finding that burst of energy which could keep me focused on a problem for hours on end seems harder and harder to get.

Part of this may be a result of school. For the last 15 years I have always had around 2 semesters of school each year with a few months of summer break and a month of winter break. Now I have been working for 7 months which is honestly the longest I have done the same thing. 

It has been especially noticable the last 4 months as I have been working almost exclusively on the same website (frontens and backend).

Do you all go through periods where you feel unmotivated and unproductive? Does it just pass? How do you deal with it?"

rmhojc,93,2021-12-22,How I pursued art in an Asian family. (My Story),NovaUmbral,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/rmhojc/how_i_pursued_art_in_an_asian_family_my_story/,"Don't mind the new account, I don't use reddit, but I felt inclined to make an account and join this subreddit to post my story after browsing here and giving it some thought.  


You can consider me an artist, that's also my job right now. Strange isn't it? I'm the only artist in my entire family. One of my cousin was a photographer, parents shut her down on that front, she then wanted to be a dancer, shut her down on that front, now she studies economics. My other cousin used to draw a lot, but she was pressured to take Medical School. I am now the ONLY one in my entire family, who makes art for a living.  


Recently I was having dinner, my parents normally eat on the couch while watching TV, I sit alone on the table, every single time. I don't mind it, in fact I personally like it, I get to just browse pintrest or youtube, or sometimes even bring my sketchpad out and just draw while chowing on some rice. While eating, I heard my mother say to my father, ""Look at how much money you can make these days from these jobs, if only (my name) would pursue this!"" My parents like to blurb out a bunch of things in native tongue, I can understand it actually, I Just can't speak very well. But hearing my mother say this just gave me a huge flash back of memories. Memories of pain, struggle and depression.  


Like many others here, I too am Asian. I come from a full Asian household with very traditional values. ""Grow up, become a doctor, lawyer, scientists, whatever. Make millions, get an early marriage, have kids in my mid 20s and done."" At the moment, my entire family and relatives have this mindset and goal. Almost ALL my cousins that I grew up with are now married in their mid 20s and have kids.  
Back when I was in highschool, this was the goal, but it wasn't until around the end of grade 10 I'd say where things took a drastic turn. It was English class, I remember it so well. The teacher wanted us to write a few paragraphs on an image/photograph and how that picture made you feel, sort of like a mini essay? I guess?  


Whatever, point being, it was a simple assignment that we had to do, but if it wasn't for this assignment, I would have probably never became an artist and just worked a traditional 9-5 job at an office or studied my ass off to become a doctor or something. (And most likely ended up depressed, or more so than I am now)  


While browsing google, I came across this painting... it was beautiful. Colourful, bright, and ...just incredible. Words could not describe how beautiful it was, I sat there in class and stared at awe by this painting. Leonid Afremov was the artist, he makes gorgeous night scenes and landscape paintings. Whenever I look at his works, it gives me hope, love, ambition. It makes me feel at peace, its just so serene. All my stress and struggles just vanish into thin air. It made me really feel... at home. I ended up writing 4 pages, double the amount required and at the end I was nearly in tears, it was fucking beautiful, the amount of energy and emotion that his work gave off was just unreal, it was quite literally outer worldy. After class ended I carried on with my day as per usual, but in the back of my mind, his painting was there. It was just so beautiful I couldn't get my mind off it. A few days later I decided to look up more of his works. I couldn't get enough of it, it was too good. It was the first time I really felt something in my life, and the best part about it? It was real. It wasn't some fantasy or a fairy tale, his paintings were real. This feeling of purity was real. Is this what art is all about? Because if so, I want every single piece of it.  


So,  I end up downloading an old version of photoshop that was still available for free, and gave my shot at it....and as expected, it came out horrible. But I knew if I kept trying, it would eventually work out. I would be able to make art that is good enough, right?  


Well, remember, I'm Asian. My Mother and Father wouldn't have any of it. ""You can't make money!"" They said. ""No jobs!"" They said. But I didn't care, I just wanted to make art, I wanted to express my feelings and emotions onto a canvas, I wanted to make my fantasy and imagination into a reality, I wanted to experience bliss and peace. I craved it, I needed it. It was my biggest desire. It was all I wanted in my life. Art, and nothing else.  


For years all throughout high school, I had to fight with my parents (Not physically) constantly getting yelled at, getting belittled at all the time, lots of verbal abuse and neglect, constantly putting me down and comparing me to other kids. My mom would always go out of her way when my little brother was around and tell him, ""Don't be like your brother, focus hard and study well."" They broke me, tried to tear me down, did everything they could. But I knew this was my only shot at salvation, I wanted art so bad, I did everything I could. I couldn't stand the thought of studying math and science for 5 years in post secondary, I couldn't stand the thought of going to a boring office job 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week. I cried a lot. I even hurt myself a few times and came close to committing suicide, because the pain was so overwhelming. But the thought of me sitting in my room and drawing and making art was all that kept me going, I really wanted it, so badly.   


Ever since that day, when I first opened Photoshop, I studied my ass off, learning how to use the program, learning design and art fundamentals, drawing every single day, studying art in whichever way I can. I updated my sleep schedule, started reading more, woke up at 4 am and just studied and worked for this dream. Come grade 11 and grade 12, I started taking a bunch of art and design courses, staying after school to get more help and study time, because I knew at home it would be a disaster. I did everything I could, everything in the books. Sometimes my mom would come into my room and try to throw away the pieces of papers and sketchbooks, saying its just trash. My dad almost busted my computer as well.   


Come graduation and of course they expected me to get honours. I didn't get any. And I once again came home crying.   


Finally during Christmas that year I decided to make some graphic portraits of some family members and cool paintings, my cousins, aunts, uncles and grandma were in awe. They couldn't believe I made those, it was the first time my family appreciated what I did. But more importantly....my parents finally let me pursue my passion. After years and years of struggle and pain....I was finally able to pursue art.  


They finally let me enrol into a graphic design program that I was wanting to get into, I met a lot of nice people there, lots of passionate teachers and peers, I learned a lot, graduated top of my class, got a nice paid internship and now working at a local art firm while freelancing part time. But... at the very beginning of this post, why did my Mother say that? ""If only (my name) pursued this instead!""  


To be entirely honest.... I don't know. I know they are a lot more happier with me now than they were when I was in high school, but they still have that sense of regret, I guess old habits don't die. But I don't care. I don't care anymore. They can say whatever they want about me, or to me, and it wouldn't matter, I get to do what I love and that's all I care about. All that negativity and trauma has made me more resilient.   


  
Now you probably expect me to say, ""Work hard and you will get to where I am!"" Well the truth is, not everyone is like me, I got really lucky in the end, despite all that hard work, if my parents never approved of my career that Christmas, I wouldn't be here. When I read all the horror stories here, I feel it. I feel the pain, just know this, that your not alone. No matter how dark things may seem, you are never alone. There are people who love you for who you are, and appreciate you not for your grades or monetary value, but for you as a human being. &lt;3"

rmj1ea,2,2021-12-22,I want to change my major to CLAS but I'm already in my 4th semester. What do I do?,GarlicBread3243,ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/rmj1ea/i_want_to_change_my_major_to_clas_but_im_already/,"I am a Business major with 53 credits. Unfortunately, since I have taken zero of the critical tracking courses for CLAS, I am unable to change. I feel like CS is the only major that correlates with what I want to do in the future. Although I can get a minor, I think this will hinder my ability to land internships and decrease my chances of getting into tech. Note: If I were to change my major to computer science, I would minor in something business-related. Meaning, my current credits will have a purpose. In addition, I'm in pace and have not yet transitioned to campus. I've spoken to many advisors but have not been able to make a plan. They have only recommended doing one of the 2 options below.

I have two (maybe four) options:

* Stay in Business and get a minor in computer science (1 of 2)
* Drop out of UF and complete my associates at a CC and transfer back to UF (2 of 2)
   * This is not guaranteed and I am very worried about making the risk.
* maybe get a double major in both BA and CLAS (don't know if this is possible)
* Change to UFONLINE and take courses at my own pace and graduate in hopefully 4-5 years. (I don't think the advisors will let me change to CLAS anyway, which I don't understand if I am allowed to take courses at my own pace)

The major reason why advisors are not allowing the major switch is because they want me to graduate within 4 or 4.5 years at most. Is there any advice that you have for switching to computer science?"

rmk6od,0,2021-12-22,Advice about transitioning into a CS Career as a junior in college,pingponghelp,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rmk6od/advice_about_transitioning_into_a_cs_career_as_a/,"Hello I am currently a junior studying Biology. Originally I was set on the Premed track, but I have recently decided to transition into a CS career. Up until this point I have had very little CS experience. At this point in my academics, my only plan is to be able to graduate with a major in biology and a minor in computer science. I am interested in a career in game development, but since I already have 2.5 years of experience in various aspects of biology, it feels more realistic at this point to pursue a career in bioinformatics/computational biology.  I am looking for advice to build up a resume and possible options to look into after graduation. At this point my resume only consists of research and volunteer opportunities related to biology/premed. 

Some questions I had were: 

1. Should I pursue some kind of further education in CS after graduation? I am aware of masters programs geared towards people who did not do CS in undergrad. Would this be a good idea to pursue? 
2. In the next year and a half what extracurricular opportunities should I pursue?  I do not think I have the time/ability to pursue an internship at this time, but I do plan on getting involved in research related to CS at my university. 
3. What coding bootcamps options can help? I am currently enrolled in introductory classes related to CS.  I have already completed the majority of my biology major. Advisors have warned me against trying to cram as many CS classes as possible because they say this stuff takes time to ""settle"".  Are there any essential CS classes I should take? 
4. Is it plausible to be able find a job strictly in computer science in the next year? I am open to the idea of using my biology degree to find a job after college and build up my CS resume during that time. I do imagine it would be easier to find a job related to biology and CS with my previous experience. My main question is what the best use of my time is before and after college to find a job in CS. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

I was rejected from all of the ivies last year, although I think that a big reason was choosing to go test optional, so I didn't take the ACT or SAT. Although, I took it earlier this semester in case I decided to transfer.

Profile:

18, Male, Hispanic/Latino

High School GPA: Weighted 4.45/4, Unweighted: 4.0/4.0

College: 4.0/4.0

SAT: 1590, 800 Math, 790 Reading/Writing

Extracurriculars: Intern at Accounting Firm, Worked on Programming Project for the Accounting Firm which was then presented at a conference, 2 Honors Societies in High School, President of Engineering Team, Treasurer of Programming Team

Awards: National Merit Scholarship Finalist, Graduated with Honors from High School, received pretty prestigious scholarship at state school, won a scholarship competition, honors program at current school

I was also specifically wondering, how would be chances differ applying for computer science (very competitive program) at the ivies, vs applying for something a little less competitive such as mathematics. Any advice would be appreciated.

Specifically I am thinking of applying to:

\- Ivy League

\- MIT

\- Stanford

\- Cal Tech

\- UCLA, Berkley (Next year)"
rml4qq,1,2021-12-22,Suggested electives for front end dev?,ketaminefarts,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rml4qq/suggested_electives_for_front_end_dev/,"I’m currently working on my cs degree and am planning my courses for my senior year. I have taken the vast majority of the core courses and mostly just need electives. I feel fairly confident that when I complete my degree I will look for front end roles as I have done internships in embedded, full stack (but mostly back end oriented) and am now working part time for a midsize company doing front end work and I find it orders of magnitude more interesting as I’m more of a creative/visual person. I’m definitely taking front end oriented electives but I still have room in my schedule for a few others. The main two I’m deciding between is a course in statistical machine learning, and an intro to cyber security. Would either of these courses be more important for a front end engineer? Or is it really just whichever is more interested? 

Additionally, I would love suggestions on courses that front end devs should take that you wouldn’t normally think of.

Thanks!"

rmm5di,373,2021-12-22,The Ultimate List of Hardware Engineering Internship Interview Questions,vadbox,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/rmm5di/the_ultimate_list_of_hardware_engineering/,"Now that I should hopefully be done with internship interviews for the rest of my life, here's a mega list of almost every interview question I was asked from 150+  interviews at Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments, Northrop Grumman, SpaceX, Tesla, etc. This is going to be a massive step up from [""part 1""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/iwmpw7/technical_internship_interview_questions_at_big/) that I posted a while back now that I have more coursework, internships, and interviews under my belt.

This was originally going to be part of the Interviews chapter of my [internship search guide](https://montychoy.com/blog/how_to_land_an_electrical_engineering_internship_part_1_the_internship_mindset), but that post just got WAY too long so I decided to create a separate post just for this repository of questions. That post is still chock-full of interview advice and experiences, so check it out when it's ready! And before you get started, take a guess at how many questions this list has! (bonus points if you comment your guess because I'm also curious about your guesses!)

If you're reading this on Reddit (or not my website), [check this post out on my website](https://montychoy.com/blog/the_ultimate_list_of_hardware_engineering_internship_interview_questions)! You'll get this super cool table of contents bar that will make navigation much easier through this massive post. Any updates to this list will be reflected on my website, not this Reddit post or anything else. Also Reddit only allows posts up to 40,000 characters and my full list way exceeds that so you'll need to hop over to my website to get everything else. For some reason, Reddit has trouble recognizing my list so this Reddit post will have bullet points to identify questions, while my website has a BIG numbered list. And more importantly, you'll be giving me ad revenue! 

# Disclaimers and Notes
- These questions were for internships, but there's a lot of overlap with full-time (FT) interviews. In fact, I'm doing FT interviews at the time of writing this and they basically ask the same stuff, there are usually just more FT interviews so they have an opportunity to dive deeper and ask more questions I'd even say some of my internship interviews were harder/more in depth than my FT interviews. If the questions end up being super similar, I may just rename this post instead of making a new one lol.
- These questions are reflective of my skillset, strengths, and experiences. I'm doing my undergrad at Cal Poly SLO and did internships at Apple and Microsoft, so these questions are mostly focused on that experience in power electronics, embedded systems hardware, and board layout/design. I'm pretty trash at digital stuff, so those sections will be lacking in comparison.
- I take notes of almost every interview and every question they ask (which I'd recommend you do too!), so this post will just be a reflection of that content.
- I try to include every applicable question, no matter how dumb it may seem. What you might think is a dumb question may actually be a very good question for someone else to study. I'm just not going to include questions specific to me, like project- or experience-specific questions.
- I tried my best to organize questions by topic, but there's tons of overlap between each topic. For example, GPIO/output driver design and implementation can be asked in the context of analog electronics, embedded systems, transmission lines, and power electronics. Some of these questions have just been repeated with or without additional context to solidify the topic while others will just be refer to another section.
- I use a few acronyms in this, so aside from the obvious ones (I, V, R, L, C, Z, KVL/KCL, MOSFET, BJT,), there's an appendix that lists the acronyms.
- Some questions I get more than others, so the more common questions will be bolded.
- In case you're curious, I can only answer ~95% of these questions on the spot. I can answer ~4% of these questions with a bit of thinking, ~1% would need some refreshing online/my notes, and maybe like 2-3 I honestly have no idea how to answer.

# How Should You Use this List?
I understand that this is a GINORMOUS list and it's very difficult to get everything down. It can be super intimidating, but just focus on the basics and what you're good at and you'll be fine! For example, if you have no clue about PCB design and don't intend on going into PCB design, that section may as well be useless to you (for the sake of interview preparation). No interviewer is going to expect you to know all of this stuff.

I didn't make this list for you to memorize literally everything on it, it's more so a study guide. You remember in English/literature/history class where the teacher would give you a packet of questions to answer while you read the book? That's one way to use this list. As you're working on a project/internship, you can refer to this list on stuff you should learn while doing the project/internship.

Another way to use this list is as a last-minute study guide for interviews. If you have a power electronics interview coming up, it would be super helpful to brush over the power electronics section and make sure you have everything down. If not, this list will point you in the direction on stuff to study up on. I'd also recommend cross-listing this list with the job description. You can get a good idea of what to expect during an interview based on the job description and asking your recruiter/hiring manager. If the job description mentions embedded systems/microcontrollers, buck converters, and PCB design, you might want to brush up on those on this list!

Also if anyone has done a internship for Microsoft or Meta what was your experience? Did you get a return offer?"

Do you think it's worth going to Arizona for this internship (my location is in Arizona so I'll need to go out of state)? Is there a dress code?

I have recently been offered (what I believe is often referred to as an off-cycle) internship at Citi for the next 6 months. They have said that they would like to hire me and that they will send the contract soon. However, they also notified me that I will be subject to a background check in which a company called HireRight will contact me in early Janaury.

My situation is that I have worked as a student assistant (very common in Sweden - it is where you work part-time 15 hours a week) and as an intern for another company before. Most recently, I worked for a big 4 company (PwC) as a student assistant in the tax and legal department, however I did not feel very motivated towards the end and my employers could also tell, so they terminated my contract. I spoke to the HR lady afterwards who told me to obviously be honest to future employees if they ask me about my termination, but also tell them they ""I had a conversation with my managers at PwC and we could both feel that the tax &amp; legal department was not my cup of tea, so we ended my contract so I can apply for some positions within other fields which I feel is a better fit for my aspirations and also more in like with what I am studying towards (financial degree)"".

Prior to being terminated, I was also applying for other positions and had had some interviews, but I naturally sped up this process once I was terminated where I found the Citi internship and applied and was offered the contract. They never asked me why I was not with PwC anymore, and I just stated that I was looking to transition into a more financial role (also why I applied for the internship), which is also true.

My issue now is obviously related to the background check. I am worried that HireRight might contact PwC and they will say that I was not a very engaged employee or something like that. However, I also read that they will not contact current employees without your consent and I still had PwC as a current employee on my resume when I applied for Citi. Should I tell them no, if they ask whether they can contact them?

Generally I would like to know if anybody has any experience with HireRight background checks and what to expect and how to prepare. I would also love some input, advice and anything that might be relevant for my case. 

Feel free to ask me questions as well. Thank you very much everybody!"

rmoxm1,0,2021-12-23,[Rant] My experience applying for an MFA internship,Shadow3law,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/rmoxm1/rant_my_experience_applying_for_an_mfa_internship/,"Not too long ago, I attempted to apply for an MFA internship for the month of December. I started my application around the month of October, beginning first with filling up their application form - as per common practice. After 5 days, MFA wrote back to tell me that I had been selected for the interview round. So far, so good. The interview was to be conducted near the end of October, which was quite an inconvenient timing for me as it interrupted my studies for my A Levels (I am a J2 student). Nonetheless, soon, the interview was finished with as well. 

Next, came the long wait during the month of November. For close to a month, there was no reply from the MFA about the status of my application. This struck me as being a strangely long wait; hence, I emailed the MFA with an enquiry, and was told that the application was still being processed. A few more days passed. 

Here, it must be established that the internship round I had applied for was to start on 06 December. There were only a few days left to the starting date of the internship and I surmised that I had most probably not been selected. However, the disclaimer did state that dates were subject to change, so I emailed once more asking about my application status on 6 December itself, the day which the internship was supposed to start. Yet, I did not receive any reply for the day. Instead, I only received a response on the following day, 7 December. I was met with a computer generated email telling me I had been rejected.

For me, this raised some questions.

Firstly, why did the MFA decide to keep me in the dark for close to a month? At first, I had guessed that perhaps it was due to them not wanting to disturb us during our A Level examinations. This was fair enough, but does not seem to be the case as there should always be some buffer time between informing the candidates of the results and the actual internship day. I also guessed that the emerging Omicron variant had a role to play in their planning of the internship that delayed their response. Nevertheless, they could have easily followed up with an email to all candidates about their delay. Instead, they chose to keep me (and I suppose many other candidates) in the dark. Granted, some would point out that workers in MFA are overworked and that I should have some clemency on their late reply and one month of silence. Sure, I can sympathise with them, but this would certainly indicate to me that the MFA most probably does not have the resources to properly execute an internship since they don't even have the time to follow up with a prompt reply. So why are they even opening themselves up for applications in the first place?

After asking around, I realised that one of my friends who had received the PSC scholarship (early cycle) was confirmed to be interning in MFA during the month of December. This then raises my second question: was it because of the PSC scholars that MFA turned down other internship applications? This certainly seems pretty valid. Perhaps, they had planned to have more interns, but the forbidding circumstances of the Omicron variant had prevented them from doing so, and they chose the PSC scholars over us. But, such an explanation seems to reflect badly on the MFA. For one, it gives the impression of them being slightly elitist. Are the applicants who have gone through the arduous process of filling up a long application form, and sitting through an interview, of less value than PSC scholars? Of course, I concede that PSC scholars have 'proven their worth' by virtue of having qualified for the prestigious scholarship while new applicants have not. But, this certainly gives off the impression that we 'mere mortals' (non-PSC scholars) are treated as 'second-class citizens', and, to me at least, is unfair to applicants who have put in the effort to apply. 

Perhaps I am wrong. Perhaps, the MFA did not turn down an entire batch of candidates in favour of the PSC scholars. And, if anyone has indeed been selected, I would certainly like to hear your experience working there, since it was what I had signed up for.

But for now, this experience has left a bad impression of the MFA for me. Even if I were to disregard the possibility of them favouring the PSC scholars, their late reply and the equivalent of one entire month of silence seems to hint at poor planning and a silo mentality within MFA. Such a disappointing experience would certainly turn away many talents from joining the ministry. 

For an organisation involved in ensuring our homes stay warm, they strike me as being particularly cold. For an organisation involved in paying attention to foreign affairs, perhaps, they have not paid enough attention to the intricacies of engagement with a domestic audience. 

Perhaps, for juniors who are as starry-eyed as I once was, this would be a wake-up call to reality."

I just want to share  my internship experience with you because i am really depressed and i have nobody to talk to . 
 So im graduating college  soon with a bachelor degree in CS Engineering and before that i am required to do a 3 months internship at a company.Well i applied to some companies ,and i got invited to an interview and  it went so well that 10 min later after the interview the HR guy called me and said that they accepted me, i was so happy and i felt really confident because i have  some bad anxiety issues ,  depression( i took medication at some point ) ,social anxiety   low self-esteem since i was 12 , so getting acknowledged meant a great deal for. 
 The first day of the internship was one of the best days of my life ! everything was perfectly , the boss was very nice , the team as well, they welcomed me and the boss kept hinting that i would be hired after graduating.  I couldnt believe it  because i was never this lucky in my life .
 Then  all went downhill from there . I was given some tasks in java that were pretty easy and very repetitive , i did them and i always made sure they were done perfect, but everytime my boss reviews my code all i get is criticizing, like the Code quality is shit , or my OOP skills are bad and then he has to  change everything .I started feeling that the boss  is becoming gradually  really annoyed  with me ,  his desk is  right next to me and  i keep hearing him saying stuff like ""shit"" , ""oh god"" ,""pffff""  while reviewing my code ,it was FUCKING TORTURE to me. Even though i tried to be better but due to the  stress i always fuck up something and go through the whole cycle and eventually  he stopped giving me any tasks.Sitting there doing nothing while everyone is working  and feeling useless was hell to me.But the thing that destroyed me the most is that some old guy  (i dont know who he is , but he was surelly a manager or smth) came to our departement and my boss told him in front of me  that he will need an experienced software developper because he cant keep rewiritting code because he has no time (which means that  100% i wont be hired after graduating) .I cannot describe the feelling back then i felt like useless piece of shit and i went home that day questioning my skills and my intelligence the whole night. 

I still have 3 other months with the company as i am supposed to work on a project which i will base my bachelor thesis on.

I fucking love Programming and Computer Science in general, i have good grades, i manage to understand all concepts no matter how hard they are ,  but  now i am really thinking  abandonig all this crap and going back home  because its making me miserable.

I dont know what is happening to me right now, i am i stupid or just  unexperieced . What you guys think i should do , because i really need some advice right now."

Or taking a shitty one cuz it's kinda easy?,KaiBuTsu91493,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rmulut/which_is_better_waiting_for_a_better_job/,"I (28M) a doctor moved to Germany a couple of years ago, in March I should finish my language courses and acquire my work permit, I did an internship in a local small hospital in a somewhat shitty city to improve my language skills, and today my boss offered me a job at this hospital. 

He told me I can start here after I finish my courses and acquire my work permit, I told him to let me think about it.

The thing is, I really don't like this city, and if I had another opportunity I would have immediately said no thank you, but at the same time, I heard it requires around 6 months to land on a decent job, so I thought I should just accept it and try searching for a different place at the same time.

But tbh I am afraid of getting in my comfort zone and then refusing to get out, and I need to move out to a new place anyway so I am gonna have to move out again when I want to go somewhere else, and because I am totally alone here, got no friends, no family, I find it really difficult.

So should I accept his offer? And move to this shitty city, work for a couple of months, and hopefully I can find a better place after that? Or should I wait until I find somewhere I like?

Btw I am not too short on money, I can manage to survive these 6 months without a job until I find one, so money is not that big of a deal."
rmvg4h,13,2021-12-23,Learning Front-End and feeling hopeless,FeatheredDrake,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/rmvg4h/learning_frontend_and_feeling_hopeless/,"I'm currently working as an intern Front-End dev in a small company.
Coding stuff was exciting before I actually worked in the field, but now I find it dreadful. Here's why.

When I started learning web development, I started with a bootcamp that taught me the basics - vanilla HTML, vanilla CSS and vanilla JS. I liked it because it was simple and intuitive, all you needed to get started was a basic text editor, hell, you didn't even need to install anything in order to write code because even basic Notepad does the job (though it's difficult if you don't use an editor designed specifically for coding). What I'm trying to say is that you could just install Notepad++, VS Code or Sublime and there you go, you were all set. That's why I enjoyed writing code during that bootcamp, it didn't really have any prerequisites, all you needed was a bit of creativity and googling stuff when you didn't know how to do something specifically.

&amp;nbsp;

But now I'm starting to see the real face of Front-End. No one allows you to write vanilla stuff anymore. So you have to start installing a bunch of preprocessors, plugins, dependencies, etc. I am currrently overwhelmed by everything that's needed for me to just write a single line of code. For instance, I have to use Sass which is a pain (sometimes the Sass Live Compiler doesn't work properly and it makes me rage so I've tried to install Gulp which prompted me with another 3-4 dependencies that were needed in order for Gulp to work). I must have spent like 5 days just trying to get Gulp to work because I'm all new to installing packages with npm and Node so it all feels so alien to me. I really don't understand why all of this is even needeed. I'm also learning React and I'm also overwhelmed by the amount of work that took me just to install React and start a new project, let alone actually learn how to write React code. For everything I need to do I either need to install a dependency or read countless pages of documentation or watch tutorials. Then you gotta learn Bootstrap and Tailwind too. Then you have version control software like Git which isn't too difficult but it's also another extra that needs to be learned. You have json files that you need to know how to edit in order to make stuff work. I know all these tools were specifically made to increase productivity and efficiency but I feel like they're actually doing the opposite for me.

&amp;nbsp;

So **TL;DR:** I hate all the additional software and tools that I'm expected to work with. I liked it when it was just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but the other tools that I'm expected to work with are simply DRAINING all my motivation and energy. I spend more time configuring plugins and software than I spend for actually writing code, and by the time I'm done with setting up a new project, I'm already too mentally exhausted to write code anymore. It's like spending 20 hours to mod the shit out of a game but when you're done modding it, you don't feel like playing anymore. That's how I feel with webdev.

Is this just not for me? Should I just give up on Front End and Webdev altogether or does it eventually get better?"

I did get some good responses in that thread—some snarky, some curious, some appreciative, but I feel the overall message wasn't clear enough, which I hope this fixes. 

Again, I'm a 4th-year CS major with a physics minor, with an *extremely* low CAP of 2.9 before this semester (now 3.00 or so).

Here are my grades for *this* semester.

- CS4223: A–
- ES2660: A
- IS1103: C (S/Ued; yeah, I missed a quiz) 
- PC4248: B–
- CP3209: IP

Overall CAP: 3.04

Honestly, this is one of my better semesters. Compare to my disastrous Y1S2:

- CS2030: D+
- CS2100: F
- MA2104: D
- PC1143: B–
- PC1144: C

Once again, if you have a CAP of 3.85, or even 3.5, don't be disheartened—there's always schlubs like me. There's always the next semester to try again. If there isn't, then at least it's over, and work will (hopefully) start soon. Grades matter, yes (as you will see in the following paragraphs), but they're not worth getting *depressed* over. Pick yourself up, perhaps laugh at the noob whose CAP got as low as 1.5 (hey, I don't mind), and try again. 

I also understand that as a CS major, I have some privileges when it comes to low CAP that other majors don't, especially FASS. I can't help that, but I swear I wish I could. I like the arts, and am extremely passionate about linguistics, history, and music. Unfortunately, the place we live in loves to jump on bandwagons. 

One tip: take that CS1010 module seriously, put effort into it and try to understand it, even if you don't necessarily do that well in it. I've been telling everyone this now: programming is now as fundamental a skill as is arithmetic. Computers are everywhere, and it's good to try to understand them. 

___

In the previous thread, I was asked about internship applications and how my lousy grades affected them. I've sent out about 40 applications over the past 3 weeks to a variety of rather non-standard companies that fit my interests (BMW, Tesla, Daimler, VW, NVIDIA, AMD, Motional, Seagate, Dell, CERN, Nintendo, Intel), and a variety of more traditional software engineering companies (Apple, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, Shopee, ByteDance, GovTech).

I haven't received responses from most of them, and have gotten about 7 rejections so far—Shopee amongst them, given my transcript was asked for. I don't mind that much, given Shopee's rather lousy track record.

I plan to fill in another 30-40 applications over the rest of the December holidays, hopefully in companies similar to the first list. Maybe I'll update everyone about where I applied, which companies rejected me, which companies I was successful with, and to what extent. 

I like to be open about things. That is all.

P. S. I'm spending my December holidays implementing my UROP, playing Halo Infinite, and grinding Leetcode."

Can you guys also tell me would it be hard to get in this program if you have 1-2 internships and a TA experience with 3.2+ gpa? What extra-curricular can help?

What should a undergrad learn to be prepared for this program?

Thank you for your time :)"

First time posting here just asking for some advice:). I’m currently a sophomore in college and I had received two offers this past semester for internships. One being a data engineering role at a medium to large sized financial investments management and insurance company. And the second being a more traditional technology intern/SWE role at State Farm.

Compensation is about the same at both and not an issue. The State Farm internship I would be able to do hybrid while the other one would be fully virtual this summer.

So I’ve been having a tough time deciding between the two in terms of which would set me up better for future opportunities.

I feel like State Farm is a household name with an established intern program that would possibly look better on my resume. It would also fit under the more traditional SWE internship role. The exact role isn’t known as they said those come out closer to the internship.

On the other hand the other position is a data engineering position working a good amount with AWS. I do have an interest in big data/data engineering but also am worried if choosing this would hurt my prospects for future internships that could be more SWE focused.

Any advice would be helpful, thank you!

TLDR: Wondering if I should take a data engineering role at a mid-large sized financial management/insurance company vs taking a more traditional technology intern/SWE role at State Farm. I also have an interest in data but not sure how taking a data engineering role would impact my future opportunities. Which offer do y’all think will be better in setting me up for strong opportunities in the future?"

I did the BS track up until the end but i couldn’t pass intro physics, so i did all the BS stuff like 3 levels of calculus, linear algebra, machine learning, etc etc, just to get the BA which i don’t really mind.  I really don’t have that much work experience, but i’ve applied to internships every year and just never got a real one.  I did an unpaid kind of thing doing UI / UX design but that’s it.  I made a website for someone and i’m working on building an iOS app, but that’s the extent of my resume.  

Ive applied to over 100 jobs this year (i expected to graduate in may but good thing i didn’t cuz i still would have been unemployed) and i’ve only gotten 2 interviews and a couple additional coding challenges, with no hire.  I am great at interviewing and my resume looks as good as it can after workshopping it and workshopping it so im kind of just at the point where im like wtf can i even do.  Like i kinda just wanna give up even applying and do my app full time cuz i genuinely don’t think i’ll ever get hired.  I applied to 5 entry level software jobs at my sisters company and got rejected, applied to my dads company and got rejected, so obviously my connections aren’t doing anything.  My other connections are at facebook, apple, and microsoft but they kinda told me to not bother with it yet, which makes sense .

I do all the shit that everyone says to do but things just haven’t fallen my way.  My parents just keep bitching at me for costing too much money but it’s not my fault im unemployed im trying my best to get there but i just don’t know why no company wants me or even wanted me as a fresh 19 y/o.  I’m applying to jobs that i know will suck and i still don’t even get those.  

So like actually what does it take? i thought software jobs were in high demand but it seems that way only if u have like 10+ years of experience.  Idk what i even want to do at this point i just want financial stability.  Like the best thing i can do for myself at this point is to get experience but how tf can i even do that.  I try to believe that things will work out but i just don’t.  my peers who were “better” than me made it look straightforward , i know they worked hard for it but my friends had things just fall naturally into place.  I’m not asking for 6 figs doing cool shit, i just want something you know ? Someone please just be brutally honest with me and tell me what to do bc i’m just tired bruh ."
rn8k8r,2,2021-12-23,Won’t receive offer letter until my first day - is this normal?,likelyangel,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rn8k8r/wont_receive_offer_letter_until_my_first_day_is/,"posted in r/advice first

A bit of backstory.

I’m a college student and have been applying for internships - I got shortlisted for a Marketing and PR internship with a small marketing company. They start with a “Zoom interview,” which ended up being a Webinar. All i did was join the Zoom and listen to the CEO(?) talk about the company and how the hiring process will go. I had gotten ready for an interview, so this was a little frustrating. I also could not see how many other people were in the webinar.

Afterwards, I received an email about a phone interview. Great! I scheduled it, and I get the call. The phone “interview” was the same CEO that did the webinar just clarifying the experience I have on my resume, and then saying he was impressed and wanted to interview in person as soon as possible.

So far I had two “interviews” but neither were really interviews. So I was a bit confused, but said I was free to come up to their office the next morning. 

While there, I get interviewed by some kid not much older than me, who I assume is in a position only one step higher than me. The interview was normal, but as he explains the job duties more, it feels more like a sales job. Completely commission based. Online, pay was advertised at $16/hour.

I then am left alone to fill out a short questionnaire on paper. It asks basically quiz questions on their company and how I would tackle the responsibilities. It then asks for an exact start date. I put 12/27 since it was after Christmas, but I figured I could negotiate when receiving an actual offer.

The CEO guy then comes out to “interview” me - which is just him skimming my questionnaire, and asking if i had any questions for him. I clarify that I am interested in their Marketing and PR internship for $16/hour. He kinda hesitates, and says they don’t do hourly pay. It’s all commission based, and how the other employees all make about $150 a day since they get one “deal” a day.

They say they’ll contact me that evening with either a yes or no. I don’t get a call for 3 days. I get the job, and verbally accept.

No follow up for a week. Then another week. 12/27 is getting close, so I find their email on the job offer online, and ask about the offer letter, as well as when to come in, and since I am a student, when I can send them my schedule. They only reply with “You’ll get an offer letter when you come in on 12/27 at 10:30.” No signature, nothing.

This is all really strange but it’s a small company and I’m just a college intern. Is this normal?

UPDATE:

Finally I got an email today of what to expect on my first day. I’ll copy and paste some here: 

“Our agenda for your orientation day will be to complete all of the following:

Sign off all new hire paperwork
Have an expectations meeting with management
Our agenda for your first day will be all of the following:

Meet your trainer
Take a tour of the office
Receive introductory training
Shadow your coach/mentor on the job
Have a wrap-up meeting ideally with a senior manage”

Sooo I guess i’ll walk in and review the paperwork first thing and decide then and there. Kind of stressful. Would it be inappropriate to ask for the paperwork emailed ahead of time?

FINAL UPDATE:

Based on feedback here was well as people I know irl in HR and friends and family, I decided to give the company a call and decline the position. I’ll never find out truly if it was a bait and switch, but if it was the job I was looking for, then I’m sure i’ll find one better that isn’t commission based."

\---

It hadn't at least been an awkward disaster, mused Marielinnill, as she worked on translating the Stationtown census report that the Mayor insisted on sending every so often to the resident Witness. Today had been ""Take Your Wives To Work Day,"" sponsored by the Baron and the other Hfez ""ritual duelling"" traditionalist champions, in the hope that at least some ""modernist"" Hfez males would experience an entire cycle's ""authentic Hfez"" life, and maybe even be attracted to the duelling scene.  Since the Hfez were about a third of the population of Stationtown, the timid Tsi'revet'puroch Mayor had accepted the proposal, never wanting to alienate prominent members of the Hfez electorate.

The problem was that most Hfez women had jobs of their own and were not about to give up an *entire day* riding around watching their husbands approve planning applications or whatever.  This didn't affect Marielinnill's own office that much --- Witness Relations, which had two other Nekvarash and a Resothortho secretary --- but she did get a bit of amusement passing by Hpahulh from Accounting, one of the Hfez males who actually tried, processing street maintenance expense reports while two of his four wives sat desultorily on his back scrolling their tablets. (Spouses and sundry mates from other species were also technically welcome to participate, but none did.)

Marielinnill completed the translation of the census report and sent it to the Witness Relations manager, a Nekvarash named Kemetavet, for final approval and transmission to the Witness.  She idly wondered whether the Witness ever actually looked at the report and what it would even do with the information.  She then started work on an application by a pair of minor Resothortho clans for the Witness to observe the formalities of their merger.  Sometimes the Witness even agreed to this kind of request, and the ceremony was held on a tower platform built by the Stationtowners next to the vast window of the Witness' laboratory.

\---

The late-cycle afterparty of ""Take Your Wives To Work Day"" was a different story. Even the most modern, progressive male Hfez would never attend a social occasion without being covered in his harem, and the Mayor's Office Hfez men ran home and came back with as many spouses as they could collect.  Marielinnill helped put out snacks and drinks in the foyer where the party was held.  When all the colleagues had reassembled, she made a beeline to a Resothortho Grandmother named Q'qak Faza and a young male Hfez named Hyelilhu.  The latter had only two wives, and they were stretched out scandalously lengthwise on his back and peering over his shoulders.  The four of them had recently been conscripted by lottery into the Witness' detector inspection detail and had completed the first of their three trips, joining a special siblinghood to which Marielinnill also belonged.

Q'qak Faza was not that much older than Marielinnill, but Resothortho had significantly shorter lifespans than Nekvarash, and the Grandmother title referred to her blue horns, signifying her as one of the rare Resothortho to possess a true eidetic memory. She also worked in Accounting. Hyelilhu had barely gotten out of an internship in city procurement, and both his wives worked for a private computing support consultancy.

Marielinnill asked them how their first jaunt went. ""Initially terrifying,"" replied Second-Wife-of-Hyelilhu over his shoulder, something that would have never happened in the Baron's traditionalist entourage. ""But somehow we quickly got used to it.""

Q'qak Faza added, ""I found it somewhat disappointing. I thought we'd actually get to interact with the Witness, but everything is managed by a system of indicators.""

""Anything interesting happen?"" asked Marielinnill quietly, already suspecting the answer.

""Not much,"" said Hyelilhu, ""other than replacing about seven filament tubes.""

Evidently Hyelilhu hadn't been paying attention to the background information part of the pre-inspection training, but Q'qak Faza turned another considering eyestalk towards Marielinnill.

\---

Marielinnill's own third and last trip had taken place well over a hundred and fifty cycles -- or two inspections -- ago along with Baron Ihjordhalho and his plethora of wives and a slightly different team under the staggered lottery approach to array unit inspection conscription.  The Baron had been as talkative as before on the trip there and back, but that time instead of braggadocio, it had been full of complaints and offended pride. ""That cockblocking cretin!"" he raged.  The wives no longer glared at her if she stopped paying attention to their man.

Marielinnill had learned a lot about her new Hfez friends now that, outside of work, she was an impromptu member of the Baron's entourage, and some of it was a bit mind-boggling to her prosaic Nekvarash self. One thing that hadn't surprised her had been that the Baron's new wife that he had won from his prize fight with Lihonhalhea, the ""Killah from Yhmyllha"", did not automatically reconcile herself to her new status.  Oh, the newly minted Eighteenth-Wife-of-Baron-Ihjordhalho had very quickly forgotten Lihonhalhea and his harem, but she had fallen to bickering and trying to play petty divide-and-rule politics with the Baron's wives right on his back.

Eventually, things came to a head in the Fourteenth Viceregency, the Hfez bar where the Baron held court (and likely owned).  Eighteenth-Wife had slid off the Baron's back in a huff -- and then immediately climbed onto the back of the Baron's diminutive business manager, Highi, automatically making herself Sixth-Wife-of-Highi alongside his three other currently fertile women, since apparently male Hfez had no say in the matter.

This is where Marielinnill's brain had stopped functioning, because under the stress, apparently the new Sixth-Wife had gone into œstrus there and then, and Highi excused himself hurriedly to go to the ... ""Emergency Conjugal Chamber"" that Marielinnill learned at that moment all Hfez-run establishments had as a matter of course.  The Baron, who might have been secretly relieved at that point to be rid of the troublemaker in his harem, went at that point yellow with rage and hadn't spoken directly to Highi since.  But, tellingly, he hadn't fired Highi.

The next day, they were called by the Witness to see to another randomly-selected array unit.  Marielinnill once again filled out the maintenance report.  Once again, an anomalous eight filament tubes had burnt out, close to the tether end of the unit, which she dutifully filed when they returned. It took cycles after that for the Baron to calm down about his wounded masculinity.

\---

Zakir Park filed his third maintenance anomaly report in a week, through the relay link to the Bureau of Extra-Galactic Observation.  After the first, he got the response that they had decided the anomaly was a statistical fluke, among the thousands of array stations with hundreds of units.  After the second, he was told to stand by for further analysis and continue routine inspections.

\---

The Witness' laboratory could be seen from essentially any point in Stationtown, so whenever it was not in its underworld, to which it disappeared for anywhere from two to twenty cycles, the Witness was a constant presence in the life of every Stationtowner.  For half a cycle, the Witness had stood close to the glass, towering over Stationtown's city centre, its vast, single-pupil eyes moving gradually across the Stationtown landscape.

Marielinnill strolled down the streets of Stationtown under its gaze, knowing more deeply than most Stationtowners that the Witness was not just a huge, ancient monstrosity made real, but an actual person with a language, thoughts, and feelings.  Eventually, she reached the outskirts of the residential town, and turned down a cul-de-sac.  At the end of it was a very large Hfez house, a mansion, really, with a yard in front and a whole field in the back.  She went around the back and entered the open gate.

The huge back yard of the Baron's home was the practice and exercise yard for the Baron and his entourage, including coaches and protegés.  In one corner, Highi and his wives sat in front of a portable console on a small (for Hfez) table, designing advertising posters and writing dramatic trash talk insults for the next round of public ""ritual duels"".  The new Sixth-Wife-of-Highi was still among them.

The yard was divided into several areas.  In the middle, the Baron was seemingly pulverizing a novice, although Marielinnill noticed not a scratch on the young man.  The Baron paused with the novice pinned underneath him and waved cheerily at her. ""The day is complete! We have our Nekvarash friend with us!  How did the special day go?""

""I guess some of your people tried, a little,"" replied Marielinnill.

The Baron laughed. ""With luck, enough enjoyed the day that we'll see a few more novices here, like this promising fellow."" He bounced a little, causing a little whistle of air to escape from the novice's mandibles.

Since she joined the entourage, despite knowing almost nothing about Hfez ritual fighting, Marielinnill found herself regularly consulted by coaches as to her ""unbiased opinion"" on the performance of the lesser fighters.  Once she answered, ""Well, honestly, it looks like a lot of flailing legs bashing carapace segments,"" which was at least initially true of how she saw *all* Hfez fighting, but the coach seemed to think her critique was meaningful and started admonishing the trainee.

During all of this, all the fighter's wives were offloaded, and they took the opportunity to mill about and socialize in the corners of the yard.  Marielinnill knew lots of Hfez females, but not in this particular company, and as a non-Hfez and female she held an odd intermediate place in the entourage, sometimes engaged in conversation with the wives (to whom she was much larger), sometimes with the husbands (to whom she was much smaller). She glanced with a newly suspicious eye at the empty shed in the corner of the yard.

During one conversation with the wives (speculation about the Sixth-Wife-of-Highi scandal), she felt a polite, gentle pull on one of her pincer-legs.   She turned around, and an unfamiliar Hfez female introduced herself as Second-Wife-of-Baron-Ihjordhalho and invited her into the mansion.

\---

The back entry door was rather narrow for Marielinnill as was the corridor behind it, and Marielinnill wondered how the Baron got into his own house, until she shortly entered a large long central chamber with tall, wide lift doors at the front and back of the house, resembling nothing so much as a fire station's mobile water tank drone garage. It was then that she realized that the Baron essentially lived, ate, and slept literally ""parked"" in this single room. There was even a hose and drains for his wives to wash him down.

The rest of the mansion was constructed entirely for his wives, including post-fertile wives who still resided with him but no longer took up real estate on his back, like Second-Wife. Second-Wife led Marielinnill across the central chamber into a larger corridor. They went past a private incubator with three Hfez female eggs and a sandpit crèche were four first-molt Hfez girls played.  Finally, they entered a well-appointed receiving room.

On a long couch lay Seventh-Wife on her side, her lower thorax distended, the under-plate oddly soft-looking and glistening with ointments.  Marielinnill had seen enough pregnant Hfez that she knew that Seventh-Wife-of-Baron-Ihjordhalho was carrying a male egg, that it had only grown to a fraction of its ""delivery"" size, and that Seventh-Wife had probably gotten pregnant on the second trip back from the array unit.

\---

As the artificial daylight in Stationtown began to dim on its approximately 40-minute cycle, Zakir turned away from the glass and started his next task, spinning up the manufacturing process for more detector filament tubes.  Until he got an answer back from Central Control, he had no reason to believe that his helpers wouldn't need to replace more tubes at a much higher rate than expected.

The hyper-entangled exotic matter filament tubes had to be manufactured on-station in pairs, because they couldn't be brought via FTL transport without tainting their response characteristics.  That meant that each array station had to have a complete manufacturing process on-site.  Zakir was responsible for managing the most dangerous part of the process, which was the anti-matter reactor and accelerator ring that pulled the exotic matter out of higher-dimensional hyperspace and spun it into filaments.  These filaments were then extruded in a final tube-assembly facility in Stationtown by specialists trained in the Stationtown College.

The process was technically dangerous, but there were thousands of stations, and accidents were vanishingly rare, given the failsafes involved.  The antimatter shielding was powered by the station's fission reactor as well as by multiple banks of constantly recharged batteries; take the reactor offline and there were days of power to the shielding.  If that failed, the shielding also protected the exotic matter filament signal concentrator that resonated with the array units.  The artificial gravity (powered by a separate system) would cause the tiny amount of antimatter to fall into the signal concentrator, and the interaction with the exotic matter would send most of the blast's energy into hyperspace while destroying the containment unit and the signal concentrator.

It was the Stationtowners' job to inspect and maintain the small parts (via conduits leading from the Stationtown maintenance facilities), and the resident human's job to do the overall inspection and the large-scale part maintenance, as well as run the routine diagnostics and man the controls for starting up the accelerator.  Zakir went through all the basic checks, then sat down at the manufacturing console to begin the process.

\---

It was a bit of a stereotype, Seventh-Wife began, after greetings were exchanged and refreshments were served, that traditionalist Hfez women spent all their time doing nothing but lolling about on their husbands' backs, crunching fructose crystals and painting each others' carapaces.  That was pretty nice, actually, but was not something one could do for one's entire life, especially since female Hfez had a limited fertile lifespan, whereafter they would have to give up their area on their husbands' exoskeletons.  Seventh-Wife had been up on Ihjordhalho's back for quite a long time without ever getting pregnant, a sign in Hfez biology that she would bear a male egg or none at all, and as everyone could see, the former fortunately held true.

But female Hfez laid only one egg if it was male, and then became post-fertile anyway and lost the mating drive thereafter.  Seventh-Wife had anyway to look to her own future, even if she could still reside in the Baron's house like Second-Wife.  As the clock ticked down to post-fertility, she had taken up a long part-time apprenticeship in Exterior Monitoring, which she attended for two decicycles every three cycles.  ""Oh, believe me, people don't always immediately notice how many women are on Ihjie's back.""

Exterior Monitoring took care of maintenance and inspection of the main body of the station itself, directing repair drones and occasional live EVA teams -- while the array station was in deep extra-galactic space, the very existence of a living ecosystem of sapient beings on the station meant that there was always going to be ""leakage"" and exterior wear and replacement needs for parts best accessed externally.  Exterior Monitoring also handled the twice-in-a-lifetime docking of the great Witness vessel that carried out the exchange of both the resident Witness and Stationtown migrants in both directions.

Seventh-Wife's most recent trainee role had been operating the near-space object detectors, which essentially always turned up nothing of significance, but were regularly run as a matter of route.  In one run, she got a reading of a large object accelerating towards them.  Even now, at its current acceleration, it was still a number of cycles away.

It was also enormous, and almost certainly artificial, by its still vague shape and mass.  After Seventh-Wife's observation, Exterior Monitoring did a full diagnostic of the detector, but still found the same.  The Witness transport and any off-schedule deliveries always came with notification well in advance, but this time there was no notice.  Furthermore, transports typically emerged from warp less than a cycle's worth of travel at a safe acceleration away from the station -- this one was much further out.

The External Monitoring director, the only Ti-Ifl in Stationtown, notified the Mayor's office, with a suggestion that an inquiry be made to the Witness.  The reply came directly from Mayor Eti'demer'tavann saying that it was clearly business of the ""Great Old Ones"" (some Tsi'revet'puroch essentially worshiped the Witnesses after the legendary Great Admonition of the Starlike Witness), and if the Mayor's office had not already been notified of a transport, then it was not the people's business.

\---

""... but I had seen with my own eyes,"" finished Seventh-Wife, ""that there have been odd things going on with the array units starting with our last two duty trips. We Hfez have a suspicious and territorial culture, and I could not get it out of my mind that these were no coincidence.  I told Ihjie and Highi, and they said I should talk to you, because of all the people in Ihjie's entourage, you'd be the most likely to know what to do.""

\---

After giving her farewells and best-wishes on the delivery, Marielinnill left Baron's mansion again through the ladies' backyard exit.  The crowd had largely dispersed as the practice session was over, and the Baron sat with a handful of stragglers talking about the traditionalists' latest fashion, ancient Hfez epic poetry.

Both Highi and the Baron looked at her, and the Baron said, ""I trust you had a nice chat with my Seventh?""

""It was thought-provoking,"" replied Marielinnill.

""Good,"" said the Baron, and he lumbered off into his indoor parking garage to be groomed and cosseted by his harem.

\---

Marielinnill woke up at home in the morning of the next cycle and went to work in Witness relations, as usual.  There were maintenance reports and notices *from* the Remembering Witness to be translated and delivered to mission-related facilities in Stationtown's industrial quarter.  And the end of the normal work period, her manager Kemetavet stepped out of his office.

""Finished yet?"" he asked Marielinnill.

""Not quite,"" she responded, ""There's a lot of reactor data and accelerated filament tube manufacturing procedures to be translated.  I should have it completed in the morning..""

""Great,"" said Kemetavet. ""Let me know if you need support from the College."" Then he left the building to go home -- leaving his office door slightly ajar.

Once she felt that the Witness Relations director was well clear of the office, Marielinnill took a look outside at the Witness' laboratory.  The Witness was there, seated at a console several times taller than the Mayor's Office building itself, a perfectly still, living colossus.

She went back inside and entered Kemetavet's open office.  She had seen him make the final transmissions of messages to the Witness before, from a special console in the corner of his office.  It was logged in; hardly anyone in the Mayor's Office ever logged themselves out.  She selected ""New message"", and wrote for the first time an original, untranslated sentence in the Language of Witness,

*QUERY. ARRIVING TRANSPORT EXPECTED BECAUSE OF BURNT DETECTOR TUBES?*

And then she selected ""Send"".

I’m a university student (small, liberal arts college) fairly unfamiliar with the large tech scene and could use some help. 

I’ve been applying to internships spanning from late August - mid November (taking a break till now for the holiday season). For large tech/engineering companies (NVIDIA, Tesla, Amazon, etc.), would my applications have gone down the drain by now? In other words, without a response in 2-3 months, what are the odds that the company hasn’t found a candidate for the role? If so, is this typical? 

I’m 40 applications in with no response. Is this just the nature of competitiveness in the field? My resume? 

Early thanks for the responses!"

I finished my undergrad at a good school with a good GPA. I started my MS degree last September focusing on robotics and control. I have been applying to internships for summer 2022 and getting interviews. However, most jobs require C/C++ knowledge which is expected. Even though, I have some experience with them from undergrad courses and projects, I don't believe I have the depth of knowledge they want as far as I understand from my experiences with coding challenges they sent. How can I go about learning the details of C/C++ (or in general software skills) that they are looking for? I mean, I know a lot less than a CS/EE major as a ME major but I want to improve my software skills. What would be the best way to do that? Just following tutorials for projects online?

Any advice is appreciated and sorry if doesn't make much sense."

For context, I'm a 17 year old high school senior. I want to major in Computer Science. I honestly didn't know what I wanted to do in life until this summer in July, so i have a nonexistent high school resume. Literally nothing. No ECs or hobbies or activities outside of school. I have good grades (top 5%) and a decent SAT (1410), but I go to a pretty lousy high school. I've taken 6 AP classes including the two I'm in right now, and I've failed the past four AP exams.

I am going to be attending Rutgers University. Decent school I guess.

I haven't had the time to self-teach myself computer science, but... I found CS50 and TheOdinProject online, which everyone online claims to be absolutely amazing for beginners. I plan on finishing BOTH of them in 9 months. Which will be extremely hard, I already know. But I do plan on grinding as hard as possible to finish them.

My goal is to get a freshman internship. At Google Step or Microsoft Explore. Or something in that tier.

But the thing is, don't millions of people do both CS50 and TheOdinProject anyways? How am I gonna stand out if I haven't done anything for high school? 

IF getting an internship at a MAANG isn't possible, what types of companies should I try to get a freshman internship for? Can someone tell me some advice? Thank you."

I was sooooo excited initially, until I learned what the job actually was from reddit. 

My end goal is consulting and I’m really disappointed to discover that there is not a lot of flexibility in switching service areas. My question is if it’s possible to at least switch over to a different team in risk and financial advisory during my internship or if there is any way I can sell IT audit as not what it is when recruiting for FT consulting in 2023? Would my recruiter be offended if I ask to switch teams before my internship starts? 

I wish they would have provided a clear job description for the role and explained what type of work you’d be doing. I was so excited and now I find myself regretting applying. I just feel disappointed in myself. 

Anyone have advice for what I can do to get closer to my end goal (consulting) or at least help change my mindset?"

It's been increasing term by term, I'm getting a better idea of how to study for these kinds of courses since I had no idea of what coding even was before I even started. 

But recently, a lot of my friends have started applying for internships and research projects and I've just been getting really overwhelmed because my WAM is still terrible and I know absolutely nothing about internships or how to apply and whether or not they'll even accept someone with a low credit WAM. 

I just feel like I'm getting left behind, and I want to do something but I have no idea where to even start or how to turn this situation around :(( 

Does anyone have any advice on how I can maybe improve at coding or just any advice in general?

**The 1st was a research/team-match interview:(3 Dec)**  I think I did good in this interview, as the interviewer seemed happy and told me at the end I learned a lot from you and I wish you luck...etc, so he seemed happy and the conversation was very nice. This was mainly about my research and future work.

**2nd coding interview (6 Dec):** which I did good in and the interviewer told me I will give you a positive review. I was asked 2 medium questions with follow-ups and I managed to solve all optimally.

To my surprise, the recruiter told me we will schedule a follow-up interview which will also be a research/team match.

**3rd interview follow-up research/team match: (16 Dec)** Sadly this one was not good, I was more prepared than my other research interview, but the interviewer was not happy I could tell he is not convinced with my answers (it was research-oriented mainly why I did things in a certain way). I don't think he will give me a positive review, I am not even sure why I had this follow-up round.

Also, I felt that the first team match/research interview was a better fit for me, I wish I could say that to my recruiter but I don't think it will make any difference, maybe the interviewer gave me a positive review but didn't find a good match on his team and maybe that's why they scheduled a follow-up.

I still didn't hear from my recruiter (I sent a follow-up after 1 week but got no reply, IDK if they are on end of year holidays but I didn't get an automated reply either) but it would be such a shame that it ends this way, I did my absolute best! but the 3rd follow-up was one of my least nice interview experiences, I was wondering since it is a follow up will it be the decision-maker? or will the feedback from 3-interviews be taken into consideration?   


I read many posts that recruiters are engaged in the conversation when we stand a chance, after the first 2 interviews my recruiter kept me in the loop like 'the team is preparing debriefs, I will get back to you before the end of the week,... etc'"

rnkitx,407,2021-12-24,Pressured to hire an under-qualified candidate,temp_phd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/rnkitx/pressured_to_hire_an_underqualified_candidate/,"So I'm an engineer in a medium sized company (around 30 employees). Soon we will have some end of studies interns start working with us. Usually they are in their last year of engineering studies. The company has multiple departments including AI, electronic engineering, software development and others. Obviously the most 'over-hyped' one of these is the AI department which is basically three people and I'm one of them. This year will be the first year I supervise an intern. I was waiting for the HR to pass me the CV of candidates. I know we had over 800 applications for 20 positions. Today the company CEO told us that an influential person asked him to hire his daughter for one of the positions that I will supervise. That was the first red flag, being pressured to hire someone because of their connections. Then we tried to contact her to plan a meeting today in the afternoon only for her to say that she is busy and want to postpone the meeting to January 17th (three weeks from now). This was the second red flag she is clearly an entitled person who only cares about what she wants. After we convinced her to come to the meeting I got to look at her CV. She has 0 experience in AI (more specifically computer vision) yet she want to take a position for a hard computer vision task that is crucial to the company. That is the third red flag, she clearly just wants to take the position because AI is an 'over-hyped' field that she has no knowledge of.

I'm not sure of this the correct subreddit to ask this in but I wanted to know has anyone here been in this position before and if yes how did they handle it. What do you think I should do.  


**Edit**: just wanted to say thanks to everyone for their ideas and suggestions. I think I'm done reading and replying to comments for now (I won't delete the post maybe someone in the future will be in my position and will find the answer they needs in the comments here). As for me I will express my concerns to the CEO so that we can set the correct exceptions and then I'll offer her the position. I'll try my best as a supervisor and hopefully I'm wrong and she'll be able to learn quickly and actually create something of value (not just for me or the company but mainly for her). I wanted to address a few points:

&amp;#x200B;

**My expectations from an intern are too high** : setting exceptions low enough for her to pass would mean having NO expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why would I care if she is forced on me by the admin they'll assume responsibility:** I could say here that I'm afraid that I'll be held responsible for a slow project advancement but honestly my biggest issue is the dozens of more qualified candidates who won't have a chance because of this. As I've said in a comment I didn't even read their CVs cause what's the point if I'm not considering them. Even as a student I always hated the fact that some people just get ""*steal*"" opportunities from more qualified people just because of connections.

&amp;#x200B;

**This is normal in companies:** maybe I did not know this because it is my first time supervising but honestly I hope I'll never get used to this cause it's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**My future with the company:** As soon as I get another opportunity I'm leaving. This issue is not the only reason but the main one."
rnm5k2,268,2021-12-24,"Found out I am the lowest paid in my department, asked for a raise and got ignored, what should I do?",CorporateRatBurned,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/rnm5k2/found_out_i_am_the_lowest_paid_in_my_department/,"I did my graduate internship at a very large company and after that I got offered a very good position.
I didn't have any previous experience but all my supervisors were very happy with my performance and even the VP of the company congratulated me on the job offer. I am 23 years old and my position is Junior Manager.

When I got offered the job it was in the middle of Covid and I didn't negotiate my salary, just accepted what they gave me.
After 1 year I decided to talk to my supervisor, I had already received a personal email from the VP of the department and my Area Director congratulating me for the great performance I was having and I had found out that previous people with my position used to get paid 5k more than I am currently getting paid.

I also found out that people in the same department but with different (less important) job functions (where I did my internship) where getting paid around 2/3k more than I was.

My next position in the rat race would be manager, and the only difference really is the title. Apparently before Junior were managing only 2 accounts, and there weren't really big or important accounts, yet still they were getting paid 5k more.
When they hired me I guess due to staffing shortage they gave me the same workload as the managers, I have been managing 5 accounts 3 of them big and important and I have been doing an excellent job. The same number of accounts and with an overall similar portfolio value than the people with the manager position are managing. 
Take into account that managers are making minimum 8/9k more than I currently make.

Knowing all this and that my results were very good I went to ask my supervisor for a raise.
My strategy was the following, instead of directly asking for a raise, I asked him what did he thought I could improve in order to get the promotion.

He admitted that I have been doing an awesome job and that the job I have been doing is the exact same as of the managers so he sees me already as one, but that due to my age I may need to wait a bit longer to get that promotion.
I said okay I understand and I am not trying to be pushy but in anyway I would like a salary increase, I told him look I know I am being underpaid and I love this company  I am not trying to leave or anything but I am scared that given that I already started with a below the average salary even if I get a promotion next year I am always earning behind what the range for the position is, in order to reduce this risk and because as you said I have been doing the same work as the managers I would like a 5k increase.

He said that he would talk with my direct boss but that maybe it's better to wait a bit longer before asking and that I shouldn't ask him because he will talk to him (they are personal friends).
Now my supervisor is leaving, and I don't know what to do, should I just go talk to the area director and ask him for the raise? I like the company and my colleagues but I am getting very burned out knowing that they are basically taking me for an idiot and not paying me what I deserve, I mean there are fucking morons that are doing shit that are getting paid more than me, while me on the other hand I can't even move out of my parents house with the money they pay me"

rnp8x5,4,2021-12-24,CS Careers and Depression,robotobio,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnp8x5/cs_careers_and_depression/,"Anyone who has had depression and/or anxiety, how did you start a CS career?

I've had clinical depression and anxiety since my teen years, which basically means I am in a constant state of despair with lots of crying, feelings of hopelessness, intense exhaustion, cognitive dysfunction, concertation problems, and just inability to do things because of absolute fear. 

I graduated this year with a software engineering degree with a B, but during those 5 years (The normal length of the program), and I've pretty much cried my way through the entire thing. 

The thing is, I only have one internship, a low key research position my professor had offered me. I applied to others, but at the beginning companies didn't accept me, and later on they stopped really accepting anyone because of the pandemic. Many people mention needing a passion for CS to get a graduate degree in it or a good job, but I have anhedonia and a passion for nothing; I just need a job to leave my country, and tech seems to be the most feasible route, even though it's proving to be really tough.

I'm not looking for a cure (I've tried multiple therapists and many different medications), but I want to know if anyone else has had to struggle with mental illness and was able to have a successful career despite it. What did you do to get around it? (For example, how did you go around the emotional overload, concentration issues, physical lethargy, psychosomatic pain, etc.) I don't think I can power my way through getting and maintain a job the way I did through university. And what career are you in now? 

TL;DR: If you struggle with depression and anxiety but still have a career in tech, what did you do?"

Advice for beginners.",Justanotherguy2022,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/rnpwik/i_started_self_learning_data_science_2_years_ago/,"Compensation-wise: about 30% more than I was being paid before I started. I actually have what most high achieving people would consider, a good job. I was already at a fairly good job before if you’re wondering why only 30% increase.

Future-outlook: A lot better. I certainly feel more respected at work, and more confident in my career. The industry is still at it’s birth, so if you study the right things, there are a lot of opportunities to accomplish what you want compared to most fields/industries.

Advice for beginners: the first 3-6 months are the hardest. You’re really new in the space, opportunities will not come easily then. Just keep LEARNING. Consider applying to other jobs that are easier to get but have the opportunities to interact with data people. Like internships, data entry jobs, volunteer work, etc. Heck, I’ve interacted frequently at work with people from customer support, sales, product management, etc. whom we were able to get setup with their own data environment because they were interested in learning and pulling the data they need. If you’re not sure where to start, there are great blogs, quora posts, cheap online platforms, etc. It may seem like an endless amount of information, but I’ve found that most information is useful and can lead you to other information."
rnqd17,12,2021-12-24,About to quit my underpaid job.,[deleted],antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rnqd17/about_to_quit_my_underpaid_job/,"So I've been about a year at an IT consulting firm, took the job initially because I was a little anxious and desperate so I accepted some low pay.

I think what really woke me up was when I saw intern postings in the same company which to no surprise just had a slightly less salary than mine, yet I was expected to be on full time while they were half time, even a few days a little OT. The work assigned was boring as well and I don't know if it was a combination of personal circumstances and work but I got depressed, not officially but I don't enjoy doing many of my favorite things on my free time and would occasionally just sleep to pass the time.

One of the guys I've been working with is a nice guy, understanding but he delusional. He basically told to work even OT and eventually the higher ups would notice and offer a higher salary. I thought they're just going to give you more work and that's it. I've interviewed with another company which recently gave me a verbal offer and judging by the holidays the written offer by January hopefully.

The new job pays almost 4 times as much and way better benefits! And it's for fresh college graduates like me. I really want to quit on Monday 27 but since I don't have the written offer I'm afraid but I can't stand the work anymore and my personal ""depression"", I feel like I just need a a few weeks off and just hope they don't rescind my offer to start fresh at this new company, I don't want to continue here until the new one starts.

Should I just quit straight away?"

How can I secure my place in this industry?,Streethawk57,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnqsu1/miraculously_got_a_great_dev_job_without_majoring/,"I'm a recent grad from a well-known school majoring in Econ and minoring in CS. I've been interested in technology since a young age but never felt like I had the chops nor the passion to do programming. I picked up a CS minor in my senior year, and only because I thought it'd help my career pursuits in economics. But as I learned more about the tech industry, I decided to pursue a career in CS instead. Through an amazing tech fellowship, I got my first SWE internship directly after graduating, and soon after I landed a remote, full-time position that pays well over six-figures, with equity, sign-on, benefits, and great WLB.

Needless to say, I feel extraordinarily lucky to have made it this far with just an Econ degree. My minor covered the basics (DS&amp;A, OOP, operating systems, software engineering, lin alg, web design) but I feel weaker in the more theoretical side of CS. I want to secure my place in this industry, and I don't want to be passed over someone with a CS major. I've been thinking of doing OMSCS, but it'd likely take me 3 years to finish and I'd have little free time. But I've also heard that experience trumps all, and since I already broke into tech, all I have to do is stay there and rack up my YOE.  So what should I do?

**TLDR:** Econ major who broke into tech with a CS minor, should I do a masters or just rack up experience?"

rnuge6,75,2021-12-24,Anybody else just not care anymore?,AlisonPOD,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rnuge6/anybody_else_just_not_care_anymore/,"I've been working since my Freshman year of high school when I was 13 years old. I always had some type of internship, program, or job. I've always worked and I grew up believing that if you worked hard and made the right connections, you'll be fine in life. Now that all just feels like bs.

My last job I had, I literally just walked out. I've never done that before and I'm still in shock about it. I feel like I just snapped. The pay wasn't too bad, $18.50 an hour, but for the amount of work I did, I should've been making AT LEAST $20 an hour. 

I busted my ass at this job too. Did overtime most weeks, picked up shifts, and was great on the phone with guests. But it seemed my reward for work was just more hard work. No raises, bonuses, or anything like that. Just toxic appreciation while we buss our ass dealing with complaints all day, while the executives have luxury pool parties at the expense of employees and guests (literally happened and I was very vocal about my dissatisfaction about taking noise complaints for a fucking executive pool party!) 

I just started getting depressed at this job, just being abused on the phone all day for things out of my control.

The state of work in this country is fucking ridiculous. It's demoralizing, dehumanizing, and uninspiring. I wish I didn't have to work. I wanna spend all day enjoying my time with my family in a global pandemic, cherishing my moments, not slaving away for some rich executive asshole.

I don't know what to do anymore, but something has got to change. I'm just done. No more overtime, no picking up shifts, no working when I don't have to. I'm tired of going above and beyond at work and getting nothing for it. I'm doing the bare minimum from now on. I'm working for the check, and that's it!"
rnux3y,1,2021-12-24,Internship at 15?,aphrim1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rnux3y/internship_at_15/,"So currently, I am a 14 year old with quite a bit of coding experience. I was wondering if it would be possible to get a coding or swe internship over the summer, and if it were to be possible, how I would go around doing so. I feel my skills are capable of industry with C/C++, Linux, React and Node, etc, so I do not think that would be much of an issue. I have looked at the career postings of numerous tech companies in my area, but did not see any internship offerings, although I know full well that they do have internships, so where am I supposed to find them? 

Questions:
Is it even possible?
How should I go around doing it?
Are my skills good enough?

Any answers would be greatly appreciated."

* Senior Year Course Load: 2 of my schools most difficult math classes (one of which is multi, other is a college-level algorithms course), no science bc i finished the hardest physics class the previous year, 2 major-related classes, an elective that relates to my spike. basically same rigor as before

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

1. did enviro-sci research with NASA (went through a rly specific path) during summer 21. submitted my abstract to columbia. first author of paper that was published as preprint w/doi (not peer-review, but still had to get accepted), presented @ national conference, expected to present @ int'l conference, presented w q-and-a at large symposium, an article i wrote about my research got published on an official NASA-owned site, research poster displayed in a uni's research center. had a leadership role (led the team that actually did the research). 15 hours/week for 10 weeks. had a LoR from my mentor. really important to me and a good half of my awards were from there
2. research-based internship at t20 (i think???) robotics lab, no awards but my project is fun and probably sounded quite interesting to whoever was reading :\], 8 hours/week
3. captain of my school's physics team, 3.5 hours/week, grades 10-12
4. very selective computational physics research-based internship, 8 hours/week, grade 12
5. founder/prez of a fun little club at my school. we organized some online schoolwide events, 2? hours/week, grades 11-12
6. niche sport, 4 hours/week, ever since i was 8 but colleges only see 'grades 9-12' :/
7. editor/webmaster at my school's litmag, 2 hours/week, grades 9-12
8. covid / machine learning research program at a local uni, submitted my abstract to columbia (they accept 2). no LoR but i think this research was conventionally impressive xD, grade 12, 24 hours/week for 4 weeks
9. one of columbia's summer programs. LoR from my mentor (engineering prof.) + put one of the projects i did in maker portfolio. my ""why columbia"" essay also mentioned this and how it led to me being interested in the school. grade 10, 35 hours/week for 3 weeks
10. co-writing a book with an engineering org based in a t10 (not columbia). won a statewide award related to this

**Awards/Honors**

1. nat'l enviro-sci/engineering award for research i did in grade 10 (not in EC list bc i couldnt fit it, but i put it in add'l info and in my maker portfolio)
2. state engineering/applied math award for research i did in grade 9 (extremely important to me, more in add'l info, related to an out-of-school passion project i've been doing since i was in 5th grade and also the topic of my common app essay)
3. t20% of int'l physics comp
4. statewide engineering award
5. put one of my ec#1 honors in there, shoved the rest in add'l info

**Letters of Recommendation**

physics teacher - 4/10, i did really well in the class and participated more than anyone else, but he barely got to know me because of COVID and he's just not that social lol

spanish teacher - 7/10, she doesnt know me super well but she knows i have a pen pal i practice with and that her class got me re-invested in retaining my own mother tongue from another side of the world :\] i think it was average

counselor rec - 5/10, she likes me but i suspect that this was a resume recap type letter

\+ the 2 additional letters of rec that i talked about before

**Interviews**

columbia - went really well despite incessant technical issues. i could tell that my interviewer was genuinely rooting for me. we talked more about columbia and the stuff i find interesting/questions than myself and my own achievements. the interviewer said that i'm good at articulating what i want to say

mit - my interviewer generally focused more on my achievements than the story behind them, but one of my research projects was coincidentally a similar topic to one of his which gave bonus points for me probably. he also really liked my passion project (more on that later)

**Essays**

my main essay was about my passion project and how i've been researching a really specific thing since i was 9 and how in freshman year i did research on it and won an award but then in 11th grade i was like, ""wait, this is all wrong, this whole conclusion is a bad approximation"" which led me to do even more research + write a book out of it! i had a really creative metaphor in the end. this specific essay was in the works since february 2021 but i started the rest of them in august/september '21

in my common app, i used add'l info to mention some writing-related things, more details about research, etc. i also used the 'how did covid affect you' optional prompt to talk about how research opportunities got disrupted but it led me to pursue covid research. i think i wrote it creatively

my columbia supplementals were pretty good, they mentioned how i was more than an engineer and i was also really invested in writing, world language and literature. advice: your lists are important in characterizing you!!!! my lists were full of books and other media related to poetry, nonfiction, classics, activism and a bunch of other things. i also accidentally put in a nonfiction book published by a columbia prof and didnt realize it until long after my app was submitted xD. my mit supplements were good too, i'm just not a good fit there

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

accepted to Columbia ED (plus actually decent finaid thank god) and Embry-Riddle (rolling apps). deferred from MIT EA (very expected and kind of happy because i wouldn't have fit well). withdrew the rest upon my ED acceptance

**Additional Information:**

i submitted research, maker portfolio, and writing sample to columbia. my strategy was to submit as many parts of myself as possible so they would at least get attached to me as an applicant. i recently got a handwritten note from the person i read my application and she said that my research was what was particularly impressive, so what i'm trying to say is: columbia values your research!! submit it!!! xD

if you know me from school, this is embarrassing, but hi!!! hope youre having a good day :\]"

rnw39q,10,2021-12-24,what I was paid as programmer in upstate NY/benefits to help others demand what they are worth,Infected_Valley,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rnw39q/what_i_was_paid_as_programmer_in_upstate/,"Sharing my pay as a programmer and some of how I was treated in upstate NY. To help any programmers out there negotiate pay and to give people in general a incite into programmer compensation. The parts with bold are the pay/benefits the rest is some of my personal story/how I was treated (note I have talked to many programmers who are/where treated way worse then me especially one of my former coworker's job in game dev and I acknowledge I had it much better than a vast majority of workers)

for my education I had multiple therapists paid for by the state to help with my speech impediment as a child and my sever dyslexia, as well as in classroom aid. I bridged during high school from to take classes at my local community college, and then got my AS in comp sci in 3 semester after graduating high school, and a state 4 year comp sci BS no minor or college debt.

Even though under the law as a kid you are entitled to things like speech therapists my dad had to study in his off time in a law library to learn the rights of him, brother and I to advocate for us. Even though I still am horrible at spelling despite many many more hours spent on it then most people math/logic has always came easy to me.... I am real glad I was born after spell checkers and that programmers get paid well.

Because my dad's 1 person company had some bad years (he's fine now) TAP, PELL, and a NSF funded scholarship paid for all my college schooling so I had no college debt at graduation. Graduated and started my first job in December because of getting my BS in a total of 7 semesters due to bridge credits. I never went to a graduation for either college. I also never did an internship but if I had it would have been **$20** at most places including IBM 7+ years ago

&amp;#x200B;

**first job out of college:**

* **pay**: 63k
* **Benefits**: covered most of health insurance costs, paid into retirement
* **vacation**: 2 weeks vacation starting year 2 with no rollover, and a few paid sick days
* **schedule**: was 8 working hours and 1 lunch hour Monday-Friday 8-5. Some employees had to go to clients in the city/whatnot and had to stay in hotels but all travel expenses where covered... I was too weird so they didn't bring me to clients which I was okay with since I slept in my own bed

&amp;#x200B;

One of my coworkers had a masters in computer science from a good private school with lots of student loans and had done internship they also got 63k a year.

First raise after a delayed annual review went to 67k.

Gave my first job 4 weeks notice because of how important I was at the time to several projects and I canceled my plans for a music festival I was going to go to that was the same as the start week of my new job (wish I had gone to that festival, didn't end up going to any music festivals until the summer of this year)... note by the time I left my first job even if it was only 40 hours a week I was burned out partially for personal/physical health reasons partially because when you really push yourself as a programmer it is the mental equivalent of cramming for a math final 40 hours a week... also as mentioned I was important to several projects or to put it another way 20 hours each to different projects/mangers. One was being the database admin/lead architect/lead dev/person the support people went to/devops for a website used by thousands of people daily for their job. You see I made the mistake a few months into the job asking who was going to take over publishing the site when someone left. The other project was 20 hours a week doing contracted work on a project for a large company where I created a SQL script to generate SQL scripts in a couple days that was supposed to take my company 100's of man hours to do by hand only reason the company made the deadline after I left...all this less than 2 years out of college, it was some of my best quality work, with the highest level of responsibilities/work load and the work I was paid the least for

While I was waiting for my 2nd annual review which was overdue I got my second job

&amp;#x200B;

**second job:**

* **pay**: 75K
* **Benefits**: about same + the ability to work form home as needed (they did give you shit if you did it ""too much"" more so after they bought a building), 2 annual bonuses. One of the bonus was for none sales people and based on the number of sales and was funded via a tiny commission for every sale over the year and one bonus was for everyone.
* **vacation**: 3 weeks starting year 1 on accrual with rollover + a few other days
* **schedule**: 40 hours a week with flexible start time, wasn't a huge deal but they wanted to you keep a somewhat regular schedule week to week

&amp;#x200B;

forget what I got as an annual raise there was decent, but not great. Manger gave me flack a few times about being more professional, and using too much work from home, but otherwise decent. A few months before I got my next job I asked and was approved to work 4 days a week at 4/5ths pay should have stayed there longer recovering from my burnout from job number 1.

&amp;#x200B;

**third job (like 5 years out of college):**

* **pay**: 95k plus
* **Benefits**: similar benefits of the previous job + dental, but no fixed annual bonuses (at least none I remember was only there for about 10 months). Think they might have given everyone a 20 dollar gift card and a bottle of bubbly or something for Christmas.
* **vacation**: 3 weeks starting year 1 on accrual with rollover + a few other days
* **schedule**:  40 hours a week pretty flexible

&amp;#x200B;

Went remote for covid then quit late last year due to burnout I never dealt with and the mental strain of Covid/lock down. I had been obsessing over Covid when china was still the only country with cases. I had enough money to pay my parent rent and other expensive. My parents only charge me 400 a month (plus some chores) they don't have any mortgage otherwise I would be paying more. By the time I quit I was probably only putting in 2 hours of work a day, and my only regret there is not switching to 1 and waiting to be fired instead of quitting. I have less money saved up then I should have, but enough to carry me another year if needed without touching my retirement accounts. The reasons I didn't have more where helping a few friends out over the years, but mostly trying to spend my way out of burnout.

&amp;#x200B;

**fourth job:** no idea yet, but applying to places after the new year. Want at least 90k a year, but would settle for like 80k if they had really good other things like vacation... going to be applying for remote positions

**Paid holidays:** all my jobs had 7-10 paid holidays as well... I think one of jobs a couple of the days where floating, but it is hard to remember with my shitty memory

&amp;#x200B;

Got my first job because the company came to my school, got the 2nd and 3rd because of headhunters contracting me on linkdin and asking me to interview. All 3 companies used a Microsoft stack which I didn't love, I am big into the free software and the open software movements and my 4 year state school used GNU/Linux computer labs for the computer science department.

I have struggled with my weight since middle school and gained a lot of weight at my first job after losing some in college, my 2nd year in January I got sick and had a fever that maxed at 103 for 2 weeks and had to use most of my vacation time for year 2 at the job that had no vacation year 1.  I was also abusing alcohol a lot at this time both by myself in my room and at a local bar where I would buy the bartenders drinks and talk their ear off. At least I tipped a lot haha. My last job before graduating that I did instead of an internship was a barback aka back staff for the bar I have tipped a lot ever since. Found out later they would debate who served me because I tipped so much. I would switch to abusing weed and my alcohol abuse switched to mainly the weekends. Weed while not as harmful physically I still wasn't dealing with my mental/physical health well. My 2nd year at my first job after my fever and during my 2nd job I did start taking some steps on my physical health, going to a gym, and I started seeing a doctor after I had after I had gotten the fever. I was diagnosed with sleep apena and hypothyroidism (I am actually overdue to get my thyroid levels checked, and to meet with my sleep doctor but no job right now so no insurance). I haven't done as much as I wanted with weight loss and working out since quitting, but I didn't realize how mentally burned out I was or how long recovery would take... I am just starting to get there now after not working for over a year. I wish everyone could take time off without massive worries like I was able to (had some like postponing until my next job some health check ups, but nothing major)

I noticed as a programmer... people who worked harder than me got paid less, sometimes a lot less, and the more I was burned out and the less productive I was the more money people kept handing me... we live in a broken system broken in so many ways. While I definitely have complaints about all 3 jobs/some mangers, none treated me horribly. The last job did fire 10 people at the start of Covid to ensure a higher profit for the quarter, so that is horrible but that plus under paying non software devs was the worst thing any of the 3 companies did to employees while I was there. My first company's vacation policy did contribute to my burnout, but more so was me pushing myself way too hard to give them everything I had because I thought that is what you are supposed to do... it isn't"

In the fall semester I was majoring for biology but I quickly realized that is not what I wanted to do so I decided to change major to cs from spring. I have no prior programming experience but ever since I begun to have interest on cs, I begun to learn python. Currently, it is winter break and since I got a good grasp on how to code in python I am learning how to make a game in pygame. I chose to do this because I’ve heard that when learning to program, there is no one right way of learning it and you should just learn by doing projects that interest you. But in process of learning pygame I became more worried if this is the right thing to do and if there is a better way to spend this free time that I get. I really want a summer internship and I currently have nothing to put on the resume.

So my question is this:

What is the most optimal way for me right now to get a summer internship?

What should I do in school to make a good resume?   (should I join clubs or should I devote the time to self-study?)

I am willing to put in the work but I just have no idea what I am supposed to do because there is just so much information. I want to have a certain goal (like getting some kind of certificate, finishing some project …etc) because right now I feel like I’m heading no where. My dream is to work at faang and it might seem it‘s too big of a dream but I just want to set my goal high and don’t want my family in the future (if I ever get one…) to worry about money."

Overall GPA: 3.92; BU GPA: 3.87; ECON major GPA: 3.87

Internship: So far, I have two internships and a course assistant role: First, I have been an operation intern at one of the largest tech companies (19 on fortune 50list) for 10 months. Second, I have been a Credit Analyst Intern at a Chinese top financial service company. One course assistant role at BU. Seeking another internship in summer 2022. 

Recommendation letter: Mostly from my BU professor, including some professor that knows me very well, which I assume that 2/4 professors will give me a strong recommendation, and I assume my employer will also give me an above-average recommendation.

Courses: Most common Econ courses, Math, and IR. Computer science intro-level courses like Java, R, and Python.

ro3z2o,1,2021-12-25,Step mother changing my dad’s and my dynamic,avenirlight,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ro3z2o/step_mother_changing_my_dads_and_my_dynamic/,"For some background, I’m 22f, and my parents split when I was about five. They got divorced for a variety of reasons, but one being that my dad had been having an affair with this woman since I was in the womb. I was oblivious to this as a young child, but found out when I was about 12. I’d never heard of this woman until she moved in with my father, and they then moved into a house together. Since day one, she’s had absolutely zero respect for my boundaries and no apparent interest in making me more comfortable around her. Since that time, my dad has constantly been on my case about how she doesn’t feel “accepted”. I’ve never been rude, I’ve just tried to make it clear to my dad when I’m uncomfortable with her level of involvement in my life. When I was in middle school I’d be doing homework with the door closed, and she’d let herself in and sit and wait for me to drop what I was doing and start up a conversation. I’ve always been polite and engaging, even when I’ve wanted to slam the door on her. I’m fairly passive, which is something I’m working on, but I mention it so it’s clear I’m never rude or snarky to her. I literally don’t have the guts to be, nor do I have any desire to behave that way. 

Recently things have gone sharply downhill. My dad has had problems with alcohol since I can remember, and although he quit for a long time, they started drinking again together. It’s gotten to the point that when I’ve had dinner with him and had friends there, they’ve all commented on how much he drinks. His doctor has told him he needs to stop, but she constantly comes home with liquor and kind of pressures him into drinking, which leads him back into this viscous cycle. 

More recently, I think around 2019, I wrote and 12 page research paper for a biomedical engineering class, turned it in and got an A. I was so proud and sent it to my dad. I got no response from him, but apparently he’d forwarded it to her and she responded to me, acknowledging that I’d gotten an A, but added three paragraphs of “corrections”. I kindly told my father how uncomfortable and belittling it was, and he threatened to cut me off for “disrespecting her”. In subtle ways, she’s always had a slight superiority complex towards my family. She always wants me to talk to her family members about the things I’m interested in pursuing, while I have blood relatives who are in those fields already (which she knows). She complained the other day about “never spending my birthday with me”, which set me off (in my head, not vocally) because it didn’t feel fair for her to be guilting me about who I spend MY birthday with. My dad then complained that while he’s here for Christmas morning, she’s at home “stewing”. Keep in mind - she willingly had an affair with him for 15 years, and they then tied the knot last summer. 

The cherry on top- apparently she’s lied to her adult children about how long she’s been with my dad up to this day. He always, and I mean ALWAYS puts her first, often when it means sacrificing his relationships with his family. To be blunt, they don’t know their mother knowingly engaged in an affair.

Just to continue venting about boundary violations - last summer she had to borrow my car for its trunk space, just had to put a piece of furniture in it. When she brought it back, she’d taken everything out of my center console, glove compartment, and both doors and left it on the passenger seat. It sounds silly but it felt like she was trying to find something on me that would get my dad’s attention. 

Lastly, I’ve been working my tail off for the last year studying for the LSAT and getting a competitive internship. My dad had pushed me really hard about both of them, but I was invested so I was happy to be doing it. Lately, nearly every time I bring up something I’m proud of, she interrupts me and talks about her kids. That has correlated with my dad completely ignoring me when I try to show him that I’m proud of something. At this point, it feels like he mostly pays attention to me to remind me that I have to graduate on time so he no longer needs to be legally financially responsible for me or because he has a question about something. He’s absolutely more than fine financially, so it’s not anxiety around that driving this. 

I’m frustrated that the thing keeping me from talking to him about it is that everything goes through his wife, and she heavily controls his responses, so he does things like threatening to cut me off or screaming at my mother and I over the phone. My mom cannot on her own support me, as I have extensive medical expenses and am still in school full-time. 

I care deeply about my dad, and I’ve been able to cope for a long time, but it’s getting so much worse. He’s only responsible for me financially, and I don’t ask for much of his attention. It feels like he can’t wait to not be my dad anymore or like I’m some ball and chain that they both want to get rid of. 

Nothing gets to him without her finding out, so having a private conversation is nearly impossible. Regardless, a conversation needs to happen. How can I stage it so he’s least likely to storm out? He can be unpredictable and has been pretty volatile recently, so I worry about it not being productive. If I’m too critical of my step mom he’ll just fight me, so I want to prevent coming off that way. 

Also, is there a way for me to hold my stepmom accountable for her behavior? Including being honest with her kids about the affair?

TLDR: my step mom, who my dad had an affair with, is driving a massive wedge between my father and I. I’m trying to figure out why she’s so hell bent on doing it and if it’s my fault."

I am ambitious and want to work at biggest companies in the world. I would love to do MBA from top schools as well (if I can afford). But those schools (say HBS, Stanford) almost never intake someone my profile, a South Asian male. Also, these big companies (say Apple, Amazon, Google) don't have operations in my country so can't apply for internships. When I even apply for internships abroad (even tho I'm working full time at one of the biggest IT companies in my country with headquarters in US), I always get rejected. I don't know why because it looks liks I'm enough or more qualified for some if not most of them. I haven't been even called for one interview.

Does it boils down to where I am from and can't bridge the gap(because I can only apply for internships while doing Masters)? As I don't have access to these big companies, I can't get in them? How much qualified I have to be to even make it for interview or is it the case they'll not invite foreigners for internships? I can't get into good schools because I'm not a manager at FAANG, can't even get internship. Should I just give up trying to target internships and focus on my career in my country instead?

**NASA Pros**

* It's literally NASA
* Better option financially (can knock out some loans early)

**NASA Cons**

* Virtual for both spring and summer
* Little-no chance of return offer

**Study Abroad/Aero Pros**

* 5 months in Scotland for spring semester, costs slightly less than home college

**The 1st was a research/team-match interview:(3 Dec)** I think I did good in this interview, as the interviewer seemed happy and told me at the end I learned a lot from you and I wish you luck...etc, so he seemed happy and the conversation was very nice. This was mainly about my research and future work.

**2nd coding interview (6 Dec):** which I did good in and the interviewer told me I will give you a positive review. I was asked 2 medium questions with follow-ups and I managed to solve all optimally.

To my surprise, the recruiter told me we will schedule a follow-up interview which will also be a research/team match.

**3rd interview follow-up research/team match: (16 Dec)** Sadly this one was not good, I was more prepared than my other research interview, but the interviewer was not happy I could tell he is not convinced with my answers (it was research-oriented mainly why I did things in a certain way) Although my paper that he mainly focused one is published in a top tier journal but he just didn't seem convinced. I don't think he will give me a positive review, I am not even sure why I had this follow-up round.

Also, I felt that the first team match/research interview was a better fit for me, I wish I could say that to my recruiter but I don't think it will make any difference, maybe the interviewer gave me a positive review but didn't find a good match on his team and maybe that's why they scheduled a follow-up.

I still didn't hear from my recruiter (I sent a follow-up after 1 week but got no reply, IDK if they are on end of year holidays but I didn't get an automated reply either) but it would be such a shame that it ends this way, I did my absolute best! but the 3rd follow-up was one of my least nice interview experiences, I was wondering since it is a follow up will it be the decision-maker? or will the feedback from 3-interviews be taken into consideration?

I read many posts that recruiters are offer-driven and engaged in the conversation when we stand a chance, After the first 2 interviews, my recruiter kept me in the loop like 'the team is preparing debriefs, I will get back to you before the end of the week,... etc' but after the follow-up I got nothing from my recuiter."

The low salaries that researchers make in academics are honestly demotivating for the amount of effort that you have to do. In addition, where you work in academia depends strongly on the university you get the MS/PhD from what I heard, and I am not betting on my chances of getting into an ivy league.

I would like to work in the industry because:

1-much higher salary especially in managerial positions

2-There are global companies where you get to travel which is really nice

3-I would like to start a family sooner than later, and PhD would take 6 years minimum.

However, I have little to no internship experience (1 week actually ), and what I have done throughout the four years is directed towards research. I have tried applying for jobs, but I got no response, and I think it's because my work is directed towards research.

What Can I do to make myself more acceptable to the industry? Does anybody have a similar experience? Should I just apply to graduate school?"

I've had two recruiters from very large companies reach out to me this past month, but I bombed both coding interviews. 

I'm feeling discouraged and don't know exactly what my next step should be at this point. I've been trying to practice LC/Project Euler/etc daily, but I struggle with the medium-harder problems. 

Is there something I'm missing? Should I try to find a bootcamp to polish fundamentals? Or should I just keep attempting the problems? How do I make sure I actually learn something from them as I do them? 

This was a long post, but thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks for all the helpful advice so far, I've been insecure in my programming/technical skills since I started CS so late, and was worried I was missing some fundamentals that are needed for an SDE role. I found the Cracking the Coding Interview book so I'm going to start there."

I feel like it’s not impossible to get these type of jobs if you know the material and can demonstrate that but without a degree it’s impossible to even get your foot in the door.
I’m sure everyone has seen the anonymous post about the hiring manager who chooses (based on his own personal biases) who to give more difficult questions. Also, the current google lawsuits on the discrimination that happens with hiring and just in the workplace against black people, particularly women. This type of discrimination / biases undoubtedly affect the ability to get hired or even get in the door for certain people and (unlike these rare cases with proof) are often explained away as not enough experience or not being a good ‘fit’.  These are all concerns for me because as a Black woman myself I don’t want to give anyone (especially those already against me) opportunity to say I don’t have the credentials or the knowledge to pursue a career.  

So, I am on the brink of graduating from undergrad with a not so great degree in Biological Sciences. I choose not to attend/apply for Medical School and in the past year I have become more interested in computer science and have decided to learn more and transition into pursuing it as a career. I have been learning everything I can teach myself in the past year but I am realizing that’s not enough. My two options right now are going back for a one year masters in computer science (I would have to take a few classes to qualify but I think I can get in) or pursing the non traditional way and teaching myself/ using bootcamps. I wanted to ask the opinion of people who have actually had experience with the field and getting hired.. especially people of color. 

Will I ever get a job (or even an internship) without having real (university) credentials?"

I’ve been feeling like I don’t know what else I am actually interested in and not sure whether that’s burn out or general disinterest. I’m looking for topics to look into this winter break but don’t feel very motivated or interested in learning about them anymore.

However when I first started learning it was like I wanted to learn everything and I spent so much personal time coding personal projects and learning new technologies like Flutter and GraphQL. It felt more fun doing this as well. I grinded getting internships and managed to get the second one at Amazon. I also grinded and definitely burnt out working on multiple startups, once I was working on two at the same time. I’d say I’m competent when it comes to full stack development with multiple stacks and have also done cross platform mobile development. I’ve also worked with AWS and other cloud computing platforms and briefly explored machine learning and AI before. The thought of just learning a new language just for the sake of learning it, like making a basic CRUD app I’ve made multiple times, is definitely not interesting to me unless there is a good amount of new concepts I’d learn instead of it just being a new way of implementing something i already know how to do in multiple ways.

I’ve looked at other technologies and niches like crypto and cybersecurity, which I’ve been exposed to in school, but again I just don’t feel motivated to really dive deep into learning about this stuff right now. I had also started making a Udemy course on AWS CDK a while back, a technology I heavily used in my internship at Amazon but I am not too excited to continue working on this. I could just be burnt out since I did just finish a term of 4 computer science classes and many of them were quite heavy. However I think I’ve been feeling this way for some time this year. Is it possible for burn out to drag on this much if say I did not take enough of a break and the initial burn out was bad? I just don’t want to lose my interest and passion for coding and technology. Any advice?"

its fucking with my memory. 
it’s making me hate being sober. im this close to quitting and just drinking.

but i hate drinking. i hate being drunk. feels good for an hour and then i just feel like shit. my alcohol issue in high school was so fucking bad. i got a handle on that and then when i left high school i started smoking a little every month. got married, started my career (currently doing a paid internship before i become a fully licensed psychologist.) and i’ve been so happy. other than covid this year has been pretty alright- and then i started smoking every night because of the physical pain i was in from working long hours.

husband sees it as an issue but still smokes with me.

now im just. depressed i think. when i smoke i feel amazing. all the shit i pent up just doesn’t exist when i’m high and i feel amazing. i don’t smoke TOO much when i do smoke but i’ll do it almost every night. it’s numbing my brain . i have diagnosed short term memory loss (its minor) and weed just makes it worse. im forgetting things at work and i cant do that- i cant afford to lose this internship.

I have a buddy of mine visiting for new years and i have some weed and it will be his first time smoking and im so excited to just chill with him. so far i haven’t smoked since the 22nd or 23rd (i cant remember) and i was going to smoke some of my kief tonight and go to bed but fuck man i just wish i didn’t want to.

during the day it’s fine but at night i get cravings and it’s horrible.

I saw this IITM online BSc in DS and Programming and it caught my eye because I am interested in programming and always wanted to double major in physics and computer science but that isn't possible in India.

So this will allow me to pursue two majors in a way.

I'm wondering how good this course is, I like that all the quizzes and exams are offline (which is how it should be), and there are live doubt sessions (although the lectures are pre-recorded, these things would be really helpful). I want to pursue a phd in physics in the future, but I'm not sure how that might go, or if I would really want to continue in academia, and I'm interested in quantum computing so I thought that would be something I could pursue later on so I wanted to do this course. This is the only course right now, which gives you an entire degree in data science and programming (you get sooo many courses and the syllabus is fun and interesting), along with your on-campus degree.

I do not care about ""placements"" and not clearing JEE and all for this. I just wanna know how helpful this will be when I'll be applying for a master's abroad, given that this program is quite rigorous (according to 4-5 people who I've talked to in this program). Also they have to maintain a certain level of rigour since they have that brand name. Will this help if I apply for a master's in physics (along with research internships I'm gonna do). I know how useful data science is, especially in fields like astrophysics and there's also software engineering and machine learning in the course so that's also pretty useful. What if I go for a master's in Data science or something similar?

I'm also planning to do some competitive programming later on, and pursuing research internships (I was looking into quantum computing internships  - there's this princeton program in collaboration with IBM -  but I'm not sure yet) during semester breaks.

I'm currently a CS student and will be graduating in the Spring. I have been applying to grad schools for the Fall, and I'm currently trying to figure out what I will do for employment over the Summer. For the past two years, I have worked at a small, local, embedded software development company, but I'm hoping to branch out a bit and get some experience at a different, possibly larger company that specializes in a different area. As such, I have been trying to find summer internships at other places. However, while looking for these internships, it seems that most of them have the requirement that the applicant, after the internship is over, has an additional semester of school left prior to graduation; otherwise, it appears that you are expected to apply to a full-time position. Also, these internships appear to be divided into undergraduate and graduate levels. At the undergraduate level, you must be currently enrolled and have at least one semester left before graduating by the time that your internship ends. For graduate-level internships, you must be currently enrolled in grad school. Since I will be graduating with my B.S. in the Spring, it seems that I would not get accepted into either internship position because I will not have an additional semester left of undergrad after my internship and I will not be enrolled in grad school during my internship (since I would start in the Fall). Also, with respect to full-time positions, as I'm currently planning to attend grad school in the Fall, I would not available to work for very long (only May-August), and I get the impression that this would not make me a good candidate for this kind of position either. At the moment, I have applied to several internships but haven't gotten an interview, so I suspect that this might be due to my graduation date (since this is explicitly listed as a prerequisite for many of these positions). I have not applied to full-time positions yet because I'm concerned about how short of a period that I would be available to work. I have had people suggest that I take the summer off, but I don't believe that I'm in a financial situation that would permit that. As a result, I thought I should ask for advice here. For someone in my position, would I want to continue applying to (undergraduate or graduate level) internships in spite of these prerequisites, apply to full-time positions instead, or would there be something else that I should be doing in this situation?

1. A paid summer internship with a company that teaches various programming languages to people. This company takes free 7 day workshops to spark students' interest in programming. I took multiple online classes and doubt sessions during these workshops there, teaching over 800 students from across the world over the course of three months. I was also a head coordinator, helping to manage all these workshops.

2. I presented a simple game I made in c in front of a class of freshmen at a fairly reputable engineering college close to my city. And I also helped as a teaching assistant at a two day seminar there during the course of which I was given the opportunity to present the above

I also have a few awards that I think might be worth something ( dunno for sure )

1. I secured an all India rank 2782 in a national talent exam. This is fairly decent because a huge number of people take this test.

2. I was awarded ""high commendation"" at a school MUN. There were supposed to be more but the pandemic brought them to a halt and so I could attend only one

3. I secured an all India rank of 650 in technothlon, which is a national mental aptitude test conducted by IIT Guwahati which is one of the top Universities in my country.

I'm also planning on taking a few AP courses, i got to know about them this year, because my school does not offer them and I will have to take them seperately.

I am most likely doing a masters afterwards, meaning I wont be finished until summer 2024. 

It seems so exiciting and worth it to work in the US while you’re young, but I am not sure if I could settle down there. Ideally I would work in the US right after my studies and until my early thirties, before returning home to Norway.

I have been doing some research and read others experiences, and it seems pretty difficult for a foreigner to obtain a working permit/green card.

I’ve heard it is possible to get a transfer through large international firms, but there aren’t that many international firms operating in Norway that I can think of other than Microsoft and oil &amp; gas companies

I might exchange on my first year of my masters and im considering exchanging to the US. However it is very costly, so I was wondering if it would help with getting a job there after my studies?

I have a decent GPA, and 1 internship, plus another one in the coming summer.

What would be the most realistic way for me to move over to the US and work for a little under a decade, given my situation?"

This might get lost in the posts but here goes nothing.  


I am a third year engineering student, Computer engineering, I am prepping for my GRE which I am planning to give in the next 6 months. My programming skills are amateur-ish and I don't know what I wanna do my Masters in.

At this point in time I don't know if I should learn new things for internships, which require me to learn somethings to apply to them or study for my GRE wholeheartedly and get a good score. All of my friends are doing an internship in something. Should I apply for internships which are not in my field eg: Marketing? I honestly don't know what I should do now.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, Thank you if you have read this far.

- Served as the class prefect for one year during the high school.
- 2nd Position in National Olympiad in Geography.
- 2 Internships
- Was the managing head of an event conducted by school (writing week).

I arrived in Canada on solely an eTA, without a visitor visa or Study Permit because we are allowed to do so. However, I have long-term plans in Canada (including a desire to eventually migrate here after I graduate), and I would like to try my hand on getting a summer internship in Calgary.

Can I get some advice on what is the process / prerequisites required for doing so? I picture myself having to do the following (in this order):  
1. Apply for a work permit in Canada (not sure how difficult is this process)  
2. Get an exit permit approved from Singapore (should not be too hard as I am in the SAF's IHL such that I will not be called back for ICT before I graduate)  
3. Secure an Software Engineering internship offer for 3 months in Calgary  
4. Find a suitable place for accommodation

Is there any tips for me from people who have done this before? And should I be doing the above in that order, or is there a better method? Any points of failure?

If this has been discussed before in a separate post, a link to it will be great too! :D"

I have no CCA, barely any friends, stayed in RC but didn't join any programmes or even any interest groups. I have no personal projects, aside from orbital and CS2103T projects. I feel like my portfolio is completely blank, and although I vowed to at least fill it up with some BS over the winter holidays, I didn't because I'm utterly useless.

I feel like most people have already started applying for summer internships, or at least created their resume, but I haven't. I don't even have friends to apply with so I'm also completely clueless about the process or what I should even write in my resume. I heard that many startups start recruiting around Janurary or February, so I'm really just banking on those right now, but after listening to a bit about other people talking about their applications, I'm starting to doubt if I can even get an internship.

I'm hoping to gain some insight from anyone else who is/was in the same position as me (empty portfolio), and whether you were able to secure an internship. And if you were, I want to know why you think you were able to secure one (good interviewing skills? High cap?) Btw if it matters, my CAP right now is around 4.3. Also, is it actually really essential that I get an internship for y2 summer? I had the impression that it was, or that most people would land an internship by y2. Is there anyone that didn't manage to get one in y2, but still managed in y3? Or maybe you did something else productive during the holidays? My mental health is kind of at an all time low right now so I will be greatly thankful for any sort of constructive advice 🙏"

I am 3rd year of my engineering from a Tier 3 college. I started doing machine learning from first year of engineering (influenced by all the buzzword, etc) and did courses from Coursera, Udemy,etc. 
I have done two internship in ML and several projects for image recognition  and data analytics for stocks.

But, now i find it more maths intensive and job prospects are low. On campus placements are mostly WITCH and some product companies for developer profile so, want to move to software development.

 I have previously made projects like fetching data from bse website,do some calculations and store it in a excel sheet. Voice assistant for opening apps, sending mails,etc.

I know these projects are not enough for getting an internship or job next year so, I want to start learning MERN stack or Java Spring.

My 6th sem will be starting soon, so I'll have to manage doing leetcode and learning new Technology in few months. I need some suggestions to be job ready in few months. 

Thank you."

Over the past week I've been trying to get into programming more seriously for the sake of interest as well as building up my profile for the internship applications next year (I have experience with basic web, some competitive programming and ML) and as such I dived deep into different career paths I could take as an upcoming SWE.

&amp;#x200B;

Going into this, I already had a feeling of what i like about CS:

&amp;#x200B;

\- i've always adored learning about and trying out different OS's on phones, laptops, tables

\- the user experience (I always think about the little quirks apps on my phone have and how I would have done sth differently)

\- i really like the pure CS theory (algorithms, data structures, learning different programming languages)

\- somewhat of a visual guy, but want my fair share of logic in my code (probably wouldn't like front end that much)

\- would prefer a role which has a broader overview of the product I'm working on (design and functionality)

&amp;#x200B;

Now for my current views and thoughts about different career paths/SWE roles that seemed the most to my liking:

\- Front-end: it is visual, but I think i would be unsatisfied with the amount of functionality building; the job market seems over-saturated)

\- Back-end: might not be the most visual, but entails a lot of building the functionality of the websites

\- **Mobile:** I love mobile apps and OS's (as mentioned above). I can image myself working on my personal app projects as well. Not sure about this, but it seems it connects both the backend and the front-end in a sense? (design and the functionality/features). Seems like this is a great filed for the future; Some mentioned that mobile development is very limiting compared to the freedom you have on web?

\-**Operating systems:** If I had to work in this field, I would certainly work on either MacOs or IOS. Seems very interesting, visual and discrete at the same time (is this true?)

\- **AR (specifically on mobile/glasses and stuff, not desktop games):** i got the feeling that this is a booming field of the future...I love the idea of a AR rich future. I like 3D maths as well. The jobs I'm thinking about are working at Apple, Google, Facebook ( which do not primarily focus on gamefying AR); AR developers have a good pay (like other SWEs at BIGNs. **BUT I HAVE ONE CONCERN WITH THIS FIELD:** I personally do not see myself primarily working with 3D rendering softwares or game engines. I got the impression that AR is basically game dev, which I don't like per say. How much **actual** programming is done in AR (that is the part that I would primarily like to be doing)?

\-**ML/AI:** interesting, will only rise in popularity in the future, but not enough visuals I guess.

\- Data science and cybersecurity: both seem dry; you are not building anything

(I would probably want end up in a engineering manager or product manager role just to get a bit more of an overhead view over a product)

&amp;#x200B;

I would greatly appreciate you sharing you thoughts and experiences in the AR, Mobile, web , AI fields, preferably addressing my points, debunking them if they are wrong, and giving advice on how to choose a field to try now based on my interests—a brief roadmap/steps to take greatly appreciated as well!

I am an 29 year and 2 days old guy. went to small public college for BS Computer Science.

Junior year of college, I landed an internship job as a software engineer intern. However, it really was an automation test developer job. I never stopped working at that company.After graduation, accepted offer from the same company as a Verification and Validation Engineer.. doing automation, manual, CI/CD jobs.

After 4 years (2018,19,20,21), I worked super hard for the company with helping out CI/CD and automation framework. However, when my company went through hard time I was discouraged and I did not motivated myself doing more coding...

Super lazy and with lack of confident that I will land a job successfully, I never attempted to look for other opportunities that will potentially boost my financial and technical billability. Now I have h1b (work visa) secured. I really think I should take a move even though the company is started to sponsoring my green card. I shouldn't and can't be lazy as I am right now.

I currently make little over $70k a year with good benefits. But, I want more now.

Personally, I am aiming to make progress everyday big or small. What I can think of are:

1. Invest time on solving leetcode problems before anything.
2. be active on an open source to get motivation in coding and as a portfolio? this was what I wanted to do but I was lazy again
3. Just start turning resume around.

Any other suggestions? I would appreciate harsh and realistic advices from you!

Thank you!"

It's been a while since the events of that autumn. Time plays tricks on your mind. It makes you examine things under the cold lens of logic, makes you sure you were losing your mind. When Marina visited me in jail, she talked about our experiences enough to comfort me. To let me know it wasn't insanity, or at the very least, a shared delusion.

I woke up back in Columbus, like I had never left. I was in my cousins' yard, cold frosty grass beneath my face. I peeled myself off the frozen lawn, alone. Marina was no where in sight. I had gone inside, ignoring Ron and Caitlin's concerned attention. The first thing I did was call the police and report myself, a fugitive who had been on the run for almost three months.

I was picked up and transported back home on a bus, cuffed and escorted by two officers. After hours of questioning at the station, they put me in a cell and I was allowed to see my first visitor. It was my mother. She was in tears, angry tears. I hadn't contacted her since I left, not wanting to get her involved in my crime. I sat there while she oscillated between sobbing and yelling, holding my hand and clutching me through the bars. I faced up to her disappointment, something I had been avoiding since I drove off on that fiery autumn day.

Tony was really dead. He died in prison just as Marina had told me. My lawyer said that was better for our case, which made me want to punch the guy. I restrained myself. Tony was the only witness to my involvement in the initial crime. Of course, I had dug myself a deeper hole by fleeing from the cops.

I sat in my cell those first couple nights. I was half waiting for another spirit visitation, for the cycle to start again with Mercury. Everything was quiet. No voices, no presences, no sudden burst of knowing. I grieved quietly for my friend Tony. Part of me wondered if the haunting had killed him, if it was somehow my fault for visiting a dilapidated Planetarium off the highway. Everything I heard about it, from his sister Jill, from my lawyer, they all said that he ran his mouth to the wrong people and it cost him his life. I knew Tony; that checked out.

Marina came to see me after six long days in jail. She was sitting at one of the visitor tables, her blonde hair loose around her shoulders. I made my way over to her in my orange jumpsuit and she gave me a small smile. ""Hi, Johnny."" 

""Hi, Mar.""

""It's so good to see you. I miss you.""

""Yeah. Me too."" All of it, all of it had been for her. So I could be with her. But that had been selfish. The only way was to own up to all of it. To come clean, so that we could have a real life someday. I wasn't sure she'd take me back after all this, but now at least she was free.

""So, I tracked down the lady from the Planetarium."" Her voice was low as she leaned a little closer across the table.

""What? How?""

""They sold the building. I talked to the new owner and he got me in touch with her. At first, she was completely unhelpful. Told me exactly what you said at first, that it was just an act to freak people out. A gimmick.""

""Right.""

""I told her no way. Not after the things we saw. No way in hell."" Marina's lips turned into an impish smile, something in her eyes distant as she remembered. ""I kept after her. Pestered her. Called her a few times and finally she cracked.""

""Good job,"" I said, wanting to reach out and take her in my arms. Something passed between us, a recognition of this desire.

""She doesn't know where the spirits came from. There was a huge fire there years ago and apparently eight people died. She thinks that has something to do with it. They initially followed her and her husband home, annoy them, turn off lights and give them nightmares, but nothing too over the top. Eventually they followed a customer out and the lady went completely crazy from the torment. She returned to the Planetarium and refused to leave until she got help. She said they were giving her visions of her child who died years before. Weirdly enough, there were no planetary personas then. They just showed up in succession, but without all the theatrics.

""The couple there brought in a specialist, a paranormal researcher. He succeeded in helping the woman free herself from the spirits, but then they followed *him* home. The researcher eventually figured out that a certain chemical compound would keep the spirits locked inside a space. I guess it took years to come up with that, and a bunch of people got tracked by them in the meantime. The woman said they tend to like 'complicated' characters. People with issues.""

""Makes sense,"" I said, glancing around me and giving Marina a nod of encouragement. 

""Yeah, well... finally they brought the latest victim into that red hall and got the spirits locked in there. They would act up, throw stuff around and give the lady and her husband visions of opening the door whenever they went to sleep, closed their eyes, whatever. So they gave them the tape to watch, to listen to.""

""This is crazy,"" I said, but not in a way of shutting her down. Just a simple acknowledgment.

""The tape of the show seemed to placate the spirits, but after a few years they began to almost meld with it. They took on characteristics of the cartoon planets. The lady dreamed about them, that's how she knew. Anyway, they just kept the red hall locked like that for over a decade. When the Planetarium was about to close, they were worried about what they were going to do. She couldn't, in good conscience, leave the next owners to deal with this problem. She was trying to figure out what to do with them, but her husband didn't care. He wanted them gone. I guess he decided that we were as good as anyone. He could tell we weren't locals. She was so pissed at him after that."" Marina shook her head, looked down. 

""So what happened? They're gone,"" I said. ""It's been normal for over a week. Well... as normal as can be expected."" 

""She doesn't know. She says she doesn't think they're all evil. Some are worse than others. They feed on guilt, fear, stuff like that.""

A feeling of deja vu swept over me. Guilt... fear... I remembered being deep beneath the beach with the figure in the black cloak. It had said something similar.

""I turned myself in,"" I said. ""I faced up to the guilt. They help those who help themselves.""

""What?""

""Just something one of them said to me.""

I ended up receiving a three year sentence, only one year for the initial break-in and then two years for evadement. Marina visited me weekly. She was doing so well. Her internship at the recording studio turned into a gig as a session vocalist, and she eventually laid down backing vocals for a couple bigger name artists. I spent my time studying woodworking. All my free hours were put into construction, making shelves and tables and everything else under the sun. I began to envision my life outside. I had dreams of someday opening up a furniture shop. I wanted to marry Marina, to have a family with her.

At times I'd think about the spirits. I had a job working in the library, filing books, cleaning up, things like that. One day I hopped on a computer and looked up the Planetarium. There was very little online about it (clearly the old folks who owned it didn't know much about having a web presence), but with a little research I found a short news blurb about the fire that had decimated the building that had been in its place many years before.

""Nine killed in brutal fire..."" I skimmed the article, looking for pertinent information. ""Eight members of a secret society were meeting on June 6th when a fire broke out accidentally. Authorities believe the blaze can be traced back to a single fallen candle. A passerby saw the flames and tried to rescue those trapped inside, but failed and also succumbed to the fire. Firefighters arrived on the scene shortly after and were unable to save any of the victims. The building was reduced to ash. A memorial has been set up at the site to honor the ten fallen community members. The group was known simply as the Sky Society, and it is believed to have been astronomy related. However, all pertinent documents and information were also destroyed on that night.""

On the day of my release, Marina came to pick me up. She leaped into my arms in the warm spring sun, and I held her close to me. I would be staying with her at her downtown apartment. I found a job that was on the up and up this time, assisting a well-respected contractor. 

Things were good.

One thing still puzzled me.

Nine died in the fire. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto... we had met all of them. All eight of them. Who was the ninth?

Had the ninth member been spared, because they weren't part of the secret society? Maybe that was enough to keep them from being trapped as an eternal spirit on this plane. Or maybe the selfless act of trying to rescue the others ensured that they wouldn't be stuck here.

I bring all of this up, this whole story, because of a dream I had a couple weeks back. It's been years since I was released from jail. Marina and I were married a couple summers back, and she's currently pregnant with our first child, a girl. She's due on New Year's Day, actually.

We couldn't be happier. I'm set to open my new carpentry shop this spring. I'll be spending the winter working from home, making inventory and doing sporadic contractor jobs to support the family. I just finished building a crib for our baby.

Most days, I don't think about what happened to us back then. But this dream... it made me realize that this story deserves to be shared.

In it, I'm on Venice Beach. It's the dark of night and I just dragged myself up that long flight of steps. I'm winded, exhausted, and the sea breeze feels refreshing on my clammy skin. I see them, silhouetted on the shore in overt black. Eight figures. Mercury, wiry and jumpy. Venus, hourglass shaped and sashaying across the sand. Mars, wielding a knife. Jupiter, large and holding a skinny-stemmed martini glass. Saturn, an old, hobbling man with a three-foot long beard. Uranus, a character who keeps disappearing and showing up in another place. Neptune, pooling up into a puddle and then growing out of it again. And Pluto, the cloaked figure, continuing to point across the landscape.

And then, there she is. The ninth. She moves across the beach, flowers growing out of her hair. She smells like fresh grass and rain. I watch as she approaches, and she extends her hands. The waves stop, the stairs close up until there is nothing there but a wall. The movements of the eight cease, and with a sweep of her hands she pulls them all forward until they become the rushing wind. She draws them into her and then turns. She bows to me, arms full of bouquets of wildflowers. She drops some at my feet. She gathers up each of the others in turn and begins to walk across the beach, leaving bare footsteps in the sand.

I watch as she disappears into the rising sun, coming up over the eastern horizon.

When I awake, it feels more like a distant memory and less like a dream. Like something that happened to me long ago, something I witnessed with all five senses engaged. I turn to Marina and she is sleeping soundly beside me. 

We forgot to blow out the candle on the bedside table before drifting off to sleep. I reach over and extinguish it with my breath. Then, the smell of wildflowers."

I'll be happy to edit/delete/post elsewhere, thank you!

I've got an interview lined up for a game dev unpaid internship, part-time, where I'd be writing an educational K-12 program in C#. My experience with C# is limited but I'd brush up beforehand and learn as I go, which I know isn't the smartest, but it's an internship, which from what I understand, and correct me if I'm wrong please, is about learning more about day-to-day life in a CS career and getting some hands-on experience. 

They're offering college credit and a letter of recommendation as payment, and I'm not sure of how my code will be used just yet. I'm hoping I'll retain the rights to it after I've left, but I'll ask in the interview itself.

Should I take the position if I get it? (I know I'm probably putting the cart before the horse here, lol) I'd be attending classes at the same time and I think it would be a little difficult to make time, but I really want to get some hands-on experience outside of the classroom and programming exercises. I'm currently a second-year.

I had a couple of internships prior to graduating that gave me some decent development experience, but I've always considered myself to be an average software developer.

Due to graduating during the pandemic and also not being super confident in my abilities I was excited to have a job offer before graduating and jumped at it without really considering too many other options. It's a decent job, fortune 500 company, work life balance is good, and I think I've learned a lot in time there. It's at an insurance company so a fair amount of gross antiquated proprietary frameworks. I've been getting to do some microservice integrations using Kotlin, Spring Boot, and OpenShift lately which I think are pretty relevant skills that could translate well to other industries.

I'm in the Midwest so it's quite low COL. Hearing some of the salaries thrown out on this sub for new grads often blows my mind. Some of the coastal tech hubs sound like an alternate universe. My base salary is ≈ 63k. I know this is shit compared to a lot of others here, but I honestly feel like I'm living pretty high on the hog with what I currently make so I haven't questioned it lol. I'm pretty content. The rat race of changing jobs all the time to maximize pay doesn't sound like fun. As long as I can live comfortably, am not overworked, and am also challenged and able to continue developing my skills I am happy.

I guess I'm wondering If I should be looking around for other opportunities? I don't want to get pigeon holed into insurance for the rest of my life. I'm also wondering if my pay is reasonable for my experience and location? Any thoughts would be appreciated."

rpgigf,5,2021-12-27,Improving how I make career-related decisions,ikindalikelatex,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/rpgigf/improving_how_i_make_careerrelated_decisions/,"Hello. Been working at a VLSI manufacturer/designer for 2 years, started as an intern and a year later I began as an engineer. I mainly do Pre-Sillicon Validation with mixed-signal.

On my 'journey' I've made some assignments on Structural Design, some digital-focused Validation and even Mask Design. I've found both things I liked and disliked there, but I always liked the fact I was learning new things of the ASIC flow.

This leads me to an issue where I tend to like most of the parts and that I'm willing to learn/accept new challenges. 

Last year my manager agreed to 'lend' me to another close team to do digital validation. Thing consists on me still doing my main job but assigning some of my worktime to the other team(s) and deliver stuff there too. Luckily, I've not missed a deadline/deliverable in any of them and have been recognized for my job/contributions in both sides. Sometimes it gets rough, but I keep learning a lot. This has been going for over a year.

I still feel young and inexperienced, the VLSI world is huge and requires a lot of time to develop some expertise. 

Due to this, I feel like I should be learning and developing skills until I find something I deeply like/feel that I can 'settle' on. Lately, I saw some open positions of areas I have some interest in (EDA tools, RTL design). In both cases, I talked with my manager expressing my desire and also talking with the hiring managers to know what the activities are like. Of course, this has sparkled some concern/bitterness with my current team, since they don't want me to leave and the other managers express interest on me applying/moving to their teams.

I want to keep growing and learning, while difficult, I have some ways to arrange/manage my times so I'm able to deliver and achieve my objectives. However, I don't want to shoot myself and put my job at risk/poison the relationship with my manager/team.

For them it may seem like I'm young and I might not be 'thinking it enough', but it's not like I have an impulse/emotion to leave, I want to develop a career that I like and that allows me to earn a living.

About me: Course in NUS computing and part of an RC prog. Pulled up my GPA from 4.0 (2 graded mods) in Y1S1 to [4.55 in Y4S1](https://imgur.com/a/oAg4LIT). Honestly, I’m of average intelligence and not that hard working. Most definitely an average coder. 

The past 3 and a ½ years in university have been insanely hard. Through the process, I learnt and internalised a number of strategies via trial and error and decided to pen them down to spare some of the trial and error. Had some [f**king](https://imgur.com/a/J2AaME6) [crazy](https://imgur.com/a/dzfGkDL) semesters implementing this so I can assure you they are somewhat tried-and-tested ;)

The principles here are relevant if:
1. GPA is important to you as your target industry is highly competitive and any CV without ≥ 4.3 is rejected
2. You started out with a crappy GPA but you want to do better
3. You’re “average” and despite working hard, sacrificing weekends and applying study tips, still average a B+  (There’s a whole discussion on whether a B+ is good, let's not go there today)

A note on “strategy VS tactics”. In short, tactics are things you “do” on a day-to-day basis. For example, the following concepts would be considered tactics to me
1. Using flashcards and an anki system for memory-intensive modules
2. Making sure that no modules is untouched for &gt; 7 days
3. Always skimming through lecture notes before a class

Tips are great. Tips are helpful for students. However, I think there’s a huge under-emphasis on the concept of _strategies_ -- leaving a lot of people underachieving. I want to change that. Hence, we’re going to be more focused on strategies today!

Now that we have that out of the way, let’s jump right in!

---

## Strat 1 - Planning and Preparation  
*“He who plans to fail, fails to plan” - Winston Churchill*
It is crazy how little some of the people around me plan their academic journey and no, I’m not just referring to a 4Y module plan. I mean a plan of attack. Here are some questions and topics that have helped to focus my energies

* What’s the purpose of the semester? 
   * To pull up your GPA, to maintain it, to just “survive” because you’re doing a part-time internship and juggling full-time job applications? Think about what you want out of the next 4 months and work backwards
* Where to you want to go and how to get there
   * Let’s say you’re at 3.8 now and gunning for a 4.05 -- how are you getting there? Which semester do you want to end with a 4.0? Which modules are you aiming to get an A for? What about those technical modules that you know you’re likely capped at B+? 
   * Model your grades. There’s this concept in finance called “sensitivity analysis” -- this can be applied almost anywhere in life. Create a sheet and plug in some numbers. For example, if you’ve been average B’s the past 2 years, it might be a lil impossible to get straight A’s for the next 2 years. This modelling exercise helps to keep things in perspective and lets you know how difficult it is to get to where you want to go.
* [Assessment Criterias](https://imgur.com/a/ScUyWwA) - Updating your plan as you go along
   * Let’s try an analogy - if you’re running your 2.4km ippt and it’s 6 rounds around the stadium. Would you be checking your timing every round or only do it at the end once you’re done? Naturally, it’s important to systematically update the progress you’ve made in the middle of a semester.  
Have a sheet &amp; regularly input the results of what you think you’ve obtained (Make sure to be pessimistic) and results day will be much less of a surprise. You will also be much clearer on where you stand and can be planning on what to focus on for the last 4 weeks.
   * Furthermore, don’t just “input” an assignment grade and be done with it! Use the model to play around with your goals. For example, if you have component A and B done, you will have a much better sense of how much effort to place into component C to get your target grade.

## Strat 2 - Relationship Building  
*“Thinking that working hard is enough is a fool’s errand” -* /u/BroskiUnited
Let’s be honest. Humans have feelings. People often equate relationship building to sucking up when it is actually a lot more nuanced. Surprise! It’s possible to not be a suck up yet still build a relationship with someone. 

* Professors are humans too and want to be appreciated
   * Humans have feelings - focus on connecting with your professor on a genuine level. Genuinely engage via consultations, post-class questions and demonstrating a willingness to learn. It’s much easier for a professor to provide meaningful help or advice for a project/assignment if they remember you. 
   * Also, do not “just do this” because of a class participation criteria. You never know what a relationship with a professor might bring. For example, if a professor has a positive impression of you from class A, it’s much easier for you to excel in class B, if its also being taught by the same person.
* Seniors are like advanced characters that have already progressed through a dungeon
   * Imagine if you’re playing maplestory as a newb, isn’t it a no-brainer to either form a party with higher levelled characters or at least watch how characters have cleared a dungeon previously and get tips from them? 

I would like to reiterate that there is a nuanced difference from outright sucking up as opposed to forming a connection. Also, think about what you have to give? Everyone can be a “nice guy”. If you’re a loser that no one wants to connect with, what can you do about that?

## Strat 3 - Focus on your strengths  
*Would a bodybuilder participate in a marathon?*
Let’s be honest, not all of us are geniuses. I have seen this firsthand in coding modules: A problem that might take me half a week, 2 consults with the TA and a stackoverflow post was a quick 30 minutes for the person sitting beside me. I have been **crushed** in coding modules despite giving it my all. Why choose a place where you don’t have the high ground? (Anakin reference -- I hate that I needed to point that out)

* What are your strengths?
   * Are you an extrovert? Good at speaking and presenting? People person? Isn’t it then a no brainer to optimise for classes with significant class participation in the assessment criteria?
* What do you already know?
   * Are you a computer science major? Have you already taken 8 programming classes? What’s stopping you from taking an entry level analytics module (eg. DAO1k) and cracking the bell curve in return for 2-4 hours of work a week?

Focus on classes that will allow you to demonstrate your strengths, why start a fight when you’re already disadvantaged? Of course, there are some classes that you HAVE TO take to graduate - my only advice is this: (4 + 5)/2 = 4.5.

## Strat 4 - Learn to cut your losses  
I have no idea where the saying “Don’t take a class just to SU it” - I absolutely disagree with it. 

* A choice: To invest 10h of your time into a paper that is 5% of your grade or focus that time on an individual assignment worth 20% for another module?
   * Learn to recognise that despite all the planning and preparation you’ve done, you will hit week 11 and realised that you’re fucked. Imagine the following:  
It’s Sunday night and you have a deadline for 2 modules on Tuesday afternoon. One is a paper for a 4k module you’ve been struggling with while the other is a simple MCQ test for an economics 1k module. You’ve been doing relatively well for the 1k mod while the 4k mod has been a disaster and despite your best efforts, your past few papers consistently average B.   
Of course, things will rarely be so clear-cut but this is an example of learning to prioritise and focusing on what is likely to move the needle.
* Choose things that are worth your time
   * An A in a 4k coding mod is most likely A LOT harder to achieve compared to an A in “Intro to accounting”. Plan accordingly. 
* It’s fine to drop classes
   * The consequences and when to do it  
Drop a class before week 2: it does not appear on your transcript
Drop a class before week 7: it appears on your transcript as a W and your GPA is unaffected
Drop a class after week 7: you get a fail grade and your GPA is affected

For some reason, people are terrified of dropping classes in Singapore. Trust me - no one cares about that “w” grade on your transcript and in some cases, it has even helped to demonstrate my willingness to experiment and fail during interviews. 

## Strat 5 - You can’t have your cake and eat it too
You have 168 hours a week. That can’t change. You have to make certain sacrifices. Some people sacrifice sleep (although that affects your productivity down the road). Others sacrifice a social life and trade parties for +0.2 on their GPA. It is important to realise that *pulling up* your GPA is **fucking difficult.** Decide on what you are willing to sacrifice and plan accordingly.

---
# Important Note - Strategies do not always apply
A very important caveat is that some of the above strategies imply a number of things. For example

* GPA is insanely important (to you)
* Grades are (almost) everything (to you)
* You would rather prioritise GPA as opposed to learning
* You would rather take modules where you learn nothing to get good grades as opposed to taking modules for actually learning (altho imo you can have some of each)

I am fairly confident there will be a number of such comments on how a lot of the strategies mentioned are “incorrect” or subjective. Well, they ain’t wrong. I’ve come to realise that people come to university chasing different things. Some want to be on the dean’s list. Others would want to grow. Another could be focused on optimising for the highest compensation upon graduation. 
My point is - before jumping right into the strategies, it is very important to be conscious of how you would like to play this game! 

# Thanks for reading!

Welp - I hope this has been a helpful read for you - I noticed there’s quite a number of study tips lying around, be it on Instagram or /r/sgexams and youtube, but imo there’s so much more to university and getting a good GPA then just studying. In closing, here’s some of the source material that have been very helpful for me:

Need Advice.,exuberant_coochi,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/rpgw91/is_committing_to_a_new_internship_along_with/,"I (23) STEM background, recently got an internship which starts around 1st week of Jan. I have to relocate to that place for the same. The deadlines for my Masters colleges are also 15th Jan and I have yet to submit/ prepare my SOP for the same (done with GRE - 325 and IELTS - 8.0). Feeling quite tensed with this decision. I don't want to give up on this internship as It will be my first Internship at a corporate office as I have only done one research internship and lack work experience . Since, I have been struggling with my applications , and I took 6 months off from another research internship to prepare for GRE and IELTS, my family are looking towards my admission abroad .Also that's what I convinced them of before to give me time to figure things out. Will it be feasible to handle them together? My family wants me to drop the internship for my application. Should I drop this internship or drop the idea of pursuing masters this years and apply next year? Please Help"

I applied to internships all semester and while I probably didn’t have as high of a volume as a I should have, I’m still getting pretty discouraged that I haven’t received hardly anything in return. I’ve been sent only four OAs and had one (product management) interview for a startup that I completely bombed. 

As a junior, this next summer is absolutely crucial for my career and the thought of not having an offer this summer is beginning to depress me to the point where I'm rather depressed and it’s ruined my holidays. Literally all of my friends have offers (most are big name companies, which I’m not looking for anyways) and while I’m happy for them because they’re my friends, it’s starting to make me isolate myself from them because mentally I can’t take another second of hearing them talking about their jobs, finding housing in the bay, etc.

So at this point, I haven’t sent out an application in a month because of final exams, being kinda depressed, and not thinking it would even make a difference because I just feel like there’s something wrong with my approach. That said, where would I look to improve? Go over my resume (again)? Tweak my website?  I even know people who are in the same position I'm in (no prior SWE experience, just switched majors) and they still were able to find an offer with a major company before Christmas. I’m honestly lost and it’s beginning to look like I’m just not enough, on top of the fact that it’s probably too late to find an internship anyways. I know that the tone of this post is kind of dramatic but I’m seriously at my wits end and may or may not be crying as I type this. I just want it to end.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: Also just wanted to mention the fact that regardless of this I believe that switching to CS is still one of the best decisions I've ever made, I finally feel like I'm learning something valuable and the course content is interesting to me. Trying to make it apparent that I actually am passionate about the field and am not trying to be a crybaby asking for a job without having any passion for it lol."

This was my first job and I had worked for about 2.5 years (since high school) and had learned many things from this job such as customer service, cleaning, and stress management when it is busy. The reason why I'm leaving is that I want to diversify my work experience and search for something related to the major (information technology) I am doing (ex. internships). 

I was tired and bored of doing the same thing with no career advancement after 1.5 years of working there (since school was more of a priority than becoming an assistant manager, which required more time). I had been applying for many internships/jobs, but have been rejected lots of times without any interviews and mess-ups with job interviews (companies fault). I took a break from working my barista and got accepted to work at an ""internship"" summer camp this summer. 

I thought I was going to officially leave the barista job that time, but when I came back home the other jobs that wanted to interview me were already taken and another one never called back. Back to square one applying to more internships/jobs. This time was a bit better I had at least two or three job interviews, but I still was not accepted and had networked with people at career fairs. I was almost about to give up applying, but I'm glad I did not. I got accepted to work as an audio and video technician (which is not exactly an internship, but very close to what I am studying based on the job description to be good for job experience) and start next week (amazing start to 2022 right?).

As repetitive as my barista job is I still can't believe that I am leaving now for good this time after seeing lots of people/managers coming in and leaving the job. I will miss my discount on drinks/food, experimenting with drinks to make something new/off-menu, talking to my usual customers, and meeting new people/staff. However, I  know this new job will be a good opportunity for me and it pays a bit more (if you do not count the tips I make as a barista). I also even told myself when I first started my barista job that this will not be a permanent job eventually I will move on. My co-workers and general manager wished me luck on my journey when I told them this. Good things come to an end eventually for a better opportunity. So long old job. 

Thanks for hearing my leaving a job story."

rpltva,35,2021-12-27,how long can i continue be an imposter for?,cs_throwaway6969,csMajors,https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/rpltva/how_long_can_i_continue_be_an_imposter_for/,"context: i'm a computer science major about to graduate in april. i'm at a school that is fortunate to have a great internship program, so i was essentially gifted 6 internships in software engineering, including my most recent one being in the bay area.

to many of you, it may sound like i've had a pretty blessed college experience full of opportunity, and it might appear as though i'm in a pretty good position to succeed in my career. however these past 4 years have actually been a never-ending intermittent struggle. this is because of 2 reasons:

1. i don't enjoy computer science: i chose to study computer science because math was my strongest subject and i really didn't like any other subject in high school. when i got to university i quickly realized that i just didn't have the desire to go to hackathons, build side projects, or spend anytime outside of school coding, despite many of my peers doing so. i gave those things honest tries but i never learned to enjoyed them. i tried to spark a passion for coding in various ways but they never worked. i struggled with dealing with this reality for a while, this reality of being a cs student who just doesn't have a passion for it. i never had the will to do anything beyond my studies, i just wanted to pass my courses and spend my time having fun with friends and have a college experience. naturally though, i was often worried that going down this path of complacency would set me up for doom in the future. but eventually after my 3rd internship, i got fed up found a way to lay those worries to rest. i read enough posts on here about how you don't need to be passionate about your work to succeed, how it's normal to not like your job because work is work and that's just how it be. i never enjoyed my work at any of my internships, but it slowly stopped bothering me when i realized i could derive so much meaning and purpose outside of work. besides, my internships were all short lived, after 4 months i was guaranteed to be outta there. i didn't have to worry about being stuck in a job i hated **forever**. by the end of all my 4 month internships, i became burnt out by the dread of having to go to work every day, eagerly ready to return back to school.
2. i'm not good at computer science: it's one thing to not enjoy something, but to also not be good at it and still do it feels manic to me at times. i wouldn't say i'm stupid. i've always been an average student, i've never failed any courses, and to be on the verge of graduating with a computer science degree feels like an accomplishment worth celebrating (even though i cheated on most of my assignments). when it comes to actual software engineering work however, i am undoubtedly painfully below average. after 6 internships, i should be a lot better at coding than i am now, but i'm not. my technical knowledge is very limited, i struggle with learning new languages, frameworks, or any technically challenging concepts for that matter. the only tickets that i've been able to complete involve building buttons or text fields that i copied from other parts of the codebase. i wish i was exaggerating here. any work that involves anything apis, databases, servers, kubernetes, etc - i've never been able to do (even though i've tried). i've chosen to specialize in frontend to try and minimize the amount of challenging concepts that i can run into, but nonetheless my general inability to learn and problem solve still inhibit me greatly. i know that i can remedy this by asking for a lot of help. most of what i accomplish gets done with the help of others either through pair programming or getting very detailed step-by-step by instructions. basically, i need to get my handheld (i guess that's why i perform better in school). but in the end of the day, i know i can't get my hand held forever and it is quite demoralizing knowing that even in my 6th internship i still need extensive help to get through even simple bug fixes. maybe i'm just a really slow learner, and eventually things will click. i usually do learn a thing or 2 from each of my internships about how to debug things, how to ask for help from my managers, or how to use git better, but technical things never really tend to stick. at the end of most of my internships i usually receive feedback that I've done ""ok"" or i did a ""pretty good job"", but that i didn't deliver as much as they hoped (especially compared to other interns). for 2 of my internships i've even been met with quite a bit of anger/disappointment from my manager, who really questioned my passion for the work. i've never once received a return offer to any company i've worked for.

so here i am now after floating through my college years, feeling perplexed about what to do with my life going forward. like i mentioned earlier, i eventually settled on trying to get a full time software engineer job, and buying time to figure out/pursue my real passions. i have other things i enjoy, although i haven't explored any of those things enough yet to say any of them are passions, or at least  enough to have a desire to make a career out of them. in the end of the day, i really value independence and financial freedom, and a full time swe job sounds like exactly what i need. i absolutely can't stand the idea of living at home with my family. i'm going to have a degree in computer science, and have had 6 internships worth of experience in the field, so it kind of only makes sense in my head to continue down this path. i feel like i've made it too far now to give up, i've already managed to con my way into the bay area. there's no other discipline that really interests me either.

i went through the new grad recruiting season the past few months. i got a few interviews, but failed all of them. anytime i got to a system design interview, i completely flunked because i have 0 understanding of systems or any related concepts (probs because i've never worked with anything very technical at work). i also failed a frontend technical screen because i have 0 react knowledge, that was pretty demoralizing. the only thing i've been able to put my effort to has been grinding leetcode, i've done about 100 questions to this point. but it feels like most of the questions i get asked in coding challenges/interviews are just general coding exercises that i can't really prepare for and won't end up doing well in anyways.

heading into the new year, i feel like i'm on the verge of giving up. idk generally when new grad recruiting season ends, but it feels like its basically over. it feels like landing a full time job is almost impossible at this point - having to land an interview, having the luck to get an easy leetcode question or one that i've seen before, and somehow being able to assemble enough knowledge to pass a system design round from nothing.

i'm running out of motivation to continue. i don't even know if it makes sense anymore to continue. i feel like i'm trapped in this never ending cycle of ""i don't wanna do this"" -&gt; ""oh but i have to because i need to move out of my house and have a life"" and i don't know how to break out.

a lot of advice out there is to find what you really love and figure out a way to make it your career and what not. but there's also a lot of advice to just screw passion and pursue financial freedom/stability. i've always leaned towards the latter, just pushing through it and hoping things will work out eventually. they honestly have so far - each one of my internships has brought me to different places and bought me time and resources that have helped me grow as a person in so many ways (outside my swe career). but maybe this isn't the best advice for someone who's not very competent in their job and will sooner or later hit a brick wall. *how long can i continue be an imposter for after all?* or maybe it is good advice, but I just need to find a way to shut down this constant tug of war going on in my head about me wanting to give up on cs and me not wanting to give up the stability.

if you've made it this far - thank you, i really appreciate you taking the time to read this wall of text. it was quite therapeutic just to put this together, and i imagined it might be (or might not be) therapeutic to read advice that any of you kind souls might be able to offer in this situation. i'm kinda scared of the harsh truths that may arise.

tl;dr: soon to be cs grad, hates cs and sucks at it, but doesn't want to give up the career stability."

I am a CS major and have some internship experience in data analysis and ML, but personally do not have any experience regarding finance but am highly interested in it. 

So it's hard to choose which entry role would be the best for me in later on career prospects and growth.

&lt;Details&gt;

Amazon

* Pay: 60K (Not including RSU)
* Role: BI Engineer in Finance Team (so think of regular FR&amp;A to writing SQL)

PwC

* Pay (Including bonus):
   * 1 yoe: 55k =&gt;2 yoe: 65k\~70k =&gt; 3 yoe: 65k\~70k =&gt; 4 year: 70\~80k? (Speculating)
* Role: I have an offer from both Consulting and Deals.
   * Deals: I've heard PwC recently started training new-entry as generalists, so the role can vary (BRS, FDD, PMI, etc.)
   * Consulting: Just regular Management Consulting Role

Both are located in Tokyo Office.

To sum up, I have 3 things looking for later in my career.

1. Global (I want to move out of Japan one day and live in some other countries or do lots of overseas projects)
2. Growth (Obviously I don't have any finance experience so growth is very important)
3. Exit Ops (Both would have decent exit ops but I don't have a clear idea of it)

Thank you.

rpn8ye,24,2021-12-27,A STEM Industry Tale of Caution,NecessaryEffective,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rpn8ye/a_stem_industry_tale_of_caution/,"Hello everyone,

I recently came across this sub and was inspired to share my story. It shows how any industry, no matter how auspicious or reputable, can still be full of exactly the sort of things this subreddit is against.

Background info: after 10 years of education, including an honours B.Sc, a M.Sc, and research assistant work, I was eager to get the hell out of academia and into the private industry or outside workforce. Unfortunately, Canada's STEM industries and economy range from average to terrible, and most of our private science industry either left a long time ago or exists in the form of glorified head offices for marketing, accounting, and sales. It's pretty common for people to either leave the sector altogether, or move away to places where there are actual hiring opportunities. However, it is still possible to find ""diamonds in the rough"" with enough determination and searching. In my case, the ""diamond"" was a job as a research scientist at a medical device manufacturer located in the nation's capital, Ottawa. There was a solid 5 or 6 years of job hunting and over 3500 applications submitted before being contacted by the company's temp agency (🚩 1) because they were hiring.

The interview process took over 4 months and consisted of 4 or 5 interviews both over-the-phone and in-person, initially with the temp agency and later with the R&amp;D department leads themselves. When they finally made an offer, it was a temporary contract for 1 year with a 4 month probationary period and a salary of $65K CAD. Not very good for an experienced M.Sc, but such is the state of the nation in Canada for any form of research science. Additionally, they required me to begin working 2 weeks from when the offer was made should I choose to accept it. The problem is that I didn't live anywhere near Ottawa and both the company and temp agency knew that (🚩 2). I was over a 6 hour drive away, but was aware of this and happy to relocate. However, I thought they would give a bare minimum of 4 weeks to find a place and move in. Nope, 2 weeks or they would move onto the next candidate. I explained the situation to the temp agency and asked if they could extend the start date at all. They gave me one extra week and said if I couldn't make it work then they would move onto the next candidate (🚩 3). After so little luck for so many years job hunting, I accepted the offer and got to work finding a place to live. Miraculously found one 9 days before my start date that was not quite within my budget, but it was doable and the only thing available on such short notice. However, there was a guarantor clause in the lease for the first 8 months.

The on boarding process was awful. Yes, Covid made it difficult to have in-person orientations and training, but the whole thing was basically a tour of the facility, a 30-minute explanation of the devices we would be developing, and two weeks of reading (no exaggeration) 500+ pages of training documents on our own. The company was in a hurry to get everyone back on site (despite the fact that 95% of the job could be done from home, which they never indicated and was 🚩 number 4) and they implemented an alternating schedule where we were on-site one week and WFH the next week. The work was interesting but management, expectations, and communication were a shit show (🚩 5). The department head of R&amp;D was pretty much running 120+ people by themselves and there was virtually no middle-management and maybe 4 or 5 team leads, who weren't actually team leads in title, just in practice. Sort of. They expected you to know how to do everything perfectly and didn't seem to fond of clarification questions being asked. The leads and department heads were snobbish and totally out of touch with the situations most of their staff were in (🚩 6). One of them spent 5 minutes of a meeting complaining about how much work was going on at their property because their husband was installing a walkable trail through the woods around their land. Must be nice. The employees who had already worked there for 2-5 years were more helpful and accommodating to the new hires than anyone else (🚩 7). Project details, report style and content, protocol contents, and diagnostics all had to be constantly clarified and the systems being used were poorly organized and outdated. I'm talking terabytes worth of research files with the most obtuse and counterintuitive file organization, and tracking software so old and convoluted that you'd think you were working with a system developed on Windows 95 (🚩 8). The difficulty in communicating with higher ups, along with an obvious ""high school clique/favouritism"" work culture (🚩 9) made it incredibly difficult to keep morale up and get work done while adjusting to living alone in a new city.

About 3-ish months into the job, I got a call on a Tuesday evening from the temp agency while I am leaving the site. Apparently, the company had decided to terminate my contract and had ended their employment agreement with me effective immediately. No warning. No meetings with anyone. No employee evaluations of any kind. No hints that they were dissatisfied with my performance. No indication this was coming in any way, shape, or form. Nothing from them (🚩 10). I was floored and heartbroken. As tough as things were, I was a scientist and working in research science, which was a big aspiration of mine. The temp agency, who had changed reps on me 3 times at this point (🚩 11) and forgotten multiple times that I relocated for the position (🚩 12), didn't fight for me, or anyone else laid off that week or in the coming months at all. Afterwards, I learned that the company had been doing cyclic layoffs for 2 or 3 years and even a top engineer was let go after 22 years with the company (🚩 13). All my savings got wiped out in the next few months as I could not find work anywhere and was stuck until the guarantor agreement in my lease was up.

Moved back home and decided to go back to school _again_ for something with better career prospects. Settled on Electrical Engineering and loving it so far. Coop and internships alone already have more opportunities than anything I ever got from science. I truly hate the education and career path I took with science. It crippled me financially (despite my best efforts otherwise), destroyed my self-esteem, played a factor in one of my relationships not working out with someone I deeply loved, and has overall done nothing to help me support myself. I deeply regret almost all of it. If I could go back and do it all over again, I'd probably be an electrician or a millwright but at this point I don't think my body has the longevity and durability needed for a trade. Nor am I interested in that line of work unless I've got no other choice.

Sorry for how long and rant-ish this became. The point is, even in STEM and a country like Canada, things are not as great as they seem.

Oh, and in the spirit of naming-and-shaming: fuck you Abbott Point of Care. You don't deserve the hard work your employees give you, nor the privilege of operating on Canadian soil."
rpndhe,10,2021-12-27,[UNI] SUSS Part-time degree Interview Advise (Business Analytics),Priyajingbang,SGExams,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/rpndhe/uni_suss_parttime_degree_interview_advise/,"Hi, I'm a 20 year old female.I'm a recent graduate from Nanyang polytechnic with a GPA of 3.55, from the course Infocomm and Security. 

Planned to enrol into SUSS Full-time Business Analytics with Minor since last year as I realised that I might a little interested in Analytical area (where I found it kinda interesting from my specialisation studies in poly). Hence applied for their July 2021 intake last year.

Made it to the 4 stages of Interviews in January 2021, was put on waiting list in March 2021 and finally got my rejection from SUSS Full-time course on 31 May, one day before their registration closure. Also, I tried applying for NUS Business Analytics and SMU Analytics, but got rejected too. Was only accepted in a mechanical engineering course in another university, but rejected it as it was out of my expertise skills and interest.

Even thought it was kinda of devastating as I put in a lot of effort and I was so to getting a place. But finally I decided to take a gap year working and exploring my passion/hobbies, before attempting for the full-time course again in July 2022.


Meanwhile, thankfully I attained a traineeship job offer that allow me to explore some basic analytics skills in, during my current gap year.

After much thinking and consideration, I decided that I'm more keen to try SUSS Part-time Business Analytics course instead of the Full-time one, mainly for these reasons:

1) I have really unstable financial issues at home. Hence having a full-time job will able to provide me a stable income (even if it is low) for me to support my expenses and my family

2) Researched that SUSS are mainly known and recognised for their Part-time course for years. And also have helped working adults to progress in their careers and flexibility of lessons (nigh online classes mainly).  Also, it's more ""popular"" their their full-time courses.

3) Checked that the part-time course costs relatively cheaper estimated $15k+++ , as compared to their full time course ($30k+++). Considering that I'm 21 years and above and have attained 2 years of full-time job experience OR currently working on a full-time basis.

4) with all the points mentioned above, I will be able to be slightly more financial stable as I will able to attain more salary from my job and lower tuition fees as a part-time student, as compared to earn much lesser by being an intern or part-time working and higher school fees while being a full-time student.

5) Only need to complete 130 credits (for Business Analytics course) for Part-time programme, compared to 20) credits for Full-time programme.

6) I will be able possibly network with some of the adult learners (co-classmates), who have way more experiences than myself😅.



However the possible downsides as being a part-time students are stated below.

1) can be really stressful to managing a day job and night classes, social live and rest/me time.

2) time management /prioritization of tasks/errands can be challenging. 

3) I could barely have a social life/networking and student life, as most of my time will be declared to studies and work. On the other hand, full time Uni students can experience student/social life here and there more.

4) I might need to spend a lot of time on work/school as I have learning disabilities (e.g ADHD, Dyslexia) and physical health conditions😪. Hence even more challenges for me.

5) It might take longer time to graduate (compared to a typical fours years of a full-time students), as I might only able to handle lesser modules. Hence in average it might take a part-time students to graduate in 4-5 years. If I happened to enrol in July 2022 Part time program, I will be 21 years old. I might only able to graduate around 25-27 years old (which is kinda old for me).

6) Sometimes it can be challenging to find great teammates for projects as most of the part-time students have many responsibilities, hence t can be really tough to have 100% involvement and efforts into school work, hence it might affect the other teammate's efforts.


I guess despite the challenges, I will give my best shots when I purse my part time degree. And make sure my years are utilized properly, earning me more educational learning and job experience during the next 4-5 years.


Hence I would love to hear more insights from past/current part-time/full-time students on your thoughts regarding my decision. Please feel free to share your experience and advises on how to manage school/work life and what new students can take note from studying in SUSS or in University in general. Also, how is it like to study in SUSS, how is the environment,student life, learning experience like too? Especially for fresh diploma graduate like me, what can I expect in adulting too?



Also, to PART-TIME STUDENTS OF SUSS and Business Analytics course, I would like to know how was the interview process like for the Part-time Programme? I believe that it is very different from the 4 stage interview process of the Full-time programme. Called SUSS Team, they didn't wanted to mentioned clearly what to be expected.

I would like to know what was the common questions asked during the part-time interview process? What should I expected to know about the programme or Business Analytics in general?

Also, tips/suggestion/advices can I stand out during the interview progress. It is going to be my second time applying to SUSS (First time to Part-time programme), hence I'm really eager to get shortlisted for the program. I heard that the part-time interview process is less stressful than the full-time one. But still NOT SURE WHAT TO EXPECT😭😭😭. PLEASE HELP🙏🙏

Also, I will be very glad to network/and make friends with current or incoming students to. FEE FREE TO HIT ME UP😊.

Thank you for your time and help. Appreciate in advance😊!!!"

I am 26, never even had a job (just an internship), only have one degree that I almost didn't finish, don't have friends, girlfriends, and never had.

I know that I am a heavy load for everyone, and I think that everybody won't be really sad for a long time if I am gone.

I had a cousin that died at 25 of cancer. He discovered that he had a tumor of the size of a lemon in his chest. In one week he just died, and that happened some 2 years ago, and not a lot of people even remember him.

We don't talk a lot about him, people don't care, and they just go on with their lifes. Not even I remember him a lot.

I know now that if I die, people just won't remember very much, and they will survive.

I only need courage to do the thing that most people are afraid of. I think that maybe it's not so creepy to kill myself as I thought before."

I tried to explain to them a bit last night about how bad it sometimes get but I really don’t feel like doing that too often as it makes me feel like crap and it makes me cry during the conversation.

My mental health was pretty bad before Covid and the pandemic just shattered any semblance of stability I had left. Long story short, I'm taking a year off from completing the last few classes for my Bachelors in physics.


I'm working low skill jobs right now to have an income, but obviously it would be advantageous in every way if I could get a job closer to my skill set.


However, when I was applying to jobs before my internships (as well as now) every single job requires a masters or PhD in order to apply. And every software job I've seen with the languages I know requires at least a Bachelors to apply.


Is there any ""entry level"" job for machine learning? Like, grunt work like data filtering or web scraping that someone would hire someone like me for?"

I hope this is the right sub to post this, if not please kindly refer to me to another! 

Just a little background, I still have a semester before I graduate but recently my ex manager from my previous internship approached me with a job offer. It wasn't offered to me exclusively, as she also asked if my peers are also interested to apply for it. While the job is interesting and a great opportunity to kick-start my career, I am having second thoughts about sending in my resume due to my past experience and current mental health. 

Initially I really wanted to apply for a job at that company after I graduate because it's a tech company which is what I am passionate about. I worked hard and managed to get a short internship there.

Although it was only a few months, I felt really drained and exhausted. Physically and mentally. I had to relocate for the internship which was stressful but it was still alright compared to my experiences working there. 

They basically gave me a fake project to work on as an intern, so I only had to report to my manager. My manager at the time (the same one who approached me with the job offer) was actually pretty friendly and helpful. Drove me around and tried to teach me the ropes. I thought it's going to be easy to adapt but it's actually harder than I anticipated.

Without getting too much into the details, I do design for the company. I really try to communicate and perform as best as I could but at times. Sometimes I feel like my responses annoys her judging by her replies. When I asked my partner about it who used to work at HR, she tells me why my manager might be feeling annoyed and corrects me. While I appreciate the help, I just feel so bad whenever my partner tells me that it could have been handled better. Performance wise, at one point my manager told me she was feeling a bit frustrated that I couldn't get it right even after a few times. It really affected my confidence because toward the end, we both know it wasn't a very good design. We had to finish it anyway due to my internship coming to an end. 

As you can imagine, I don't feel at ease working there which is so emotionally and physically draining because I felt so much pressure when speaking, trying to understand and reiterate appropriately according to her feedback. I literally spend 15 minutes everytime, considering every factors or if the message is appropriate before sending her a simple message. At some point, I even asked my partner check my messages before I send them. It doesn't help that my friends and family seem to brush off the problem when I talk to them about it. Is this the corporate culture? I don't know if I am cut out for this :(...

Even after the internship, coming home and being back in university, I haven't really recovered. It is difficult for me to perform like I did before the internship. My plan is to get some sleep and do nothing for some time after my graduation. While nothing is certain, but it is likely that I could get the job if I applied for it since my ex manager approached me about it. The new job is actually within the same field but different job title and responsibilities. I probably won't be doing any designing but rather what comes after the design. My ex manager was also promoted since I finished the internship. We would probably still work together but likely not as much as we did during my internship. 

I am not sure if I should send in my resume and see how it goes or just don't. As I mentioned, nothing is certain as my peers are also applying for it. Should I let my past experience affect my judgment or this is an opportunity for me to become better?..Do you guys have any advice please?

Thank you in advance!"

**Essays**

LMAO lowkey don't know how I matched because I wrote my essays the night they were due 💀. Prospective juniors please don't be like me and procrastinate, it was actually an awful experience

1. (Biographical) I talked about my multi-national upbringing and my struggle with maintaining both my African American and Puerto Rican culture when consistently told to ""Americanize"" myself
2. (Topical) I talked about my research experience studying the eating habits of Astronauts onboard the International Space Station. I related this to the Theory of Special relativity and humanities (potential) first trip to mars
3. Supplementals:
   1. Talked about how the open curriculum allowed for more interdisciplinary learning
   2. Talked about the innate privilege wealth and circumstances can grant certain people, and flipping the narrative to better explain rudimentary differences between certain communities in the US
   3. Talked about true multiculturalism, and how growing up in a diverse neighborhood took me around the world without ever leaving my city

***Acceptances:***

\*Now, for the big reveal...\****I MATCHED TO BROWN!!!***

**Additional Information:** Now, how was this a task failed successfully you might ask? Well, there's a loophole in a certain college's admissions policies that basically lets students know if they were accepted very early in the process. If you're applying to Columbia with a non-custodial parent waiver, they have a policy where they will not approve the waiver unless the student has been accepted into the University. (DM me for more info lmao cause I don't want to explain the whole thing here)

But basically, my Columbia non-custodial parent waiver was accepted nearly 2 weeks before I was set to receive a decision, and because of their admissions policies, I was convinced I was matched to Columbia.

Brown was my absolute dream school, so it was a real shocker when I opened my QB decision and matched to them instead. I was on cloud 9 for the rest of the week lmao"

rpu4a0,5,2021-12-27,What should my next career move be during/after my internship? (MSCS Student),Nintendo_Chemistry,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rpu4a0/what_should_my_next_career_move_be_duringafter_my/,"Hello fellow computer touchers,

Some info about me:

* 29 years old

* MS and BS in Chemistry (minored in Math during undergrad)

* currently employed full-time as a high school chemistry teacher, while completing a part-time MSCS.

* fortunate enough to have an internship lined up for Summer 2022. I'll be working on embedded software development for an aerospace company.

* completed coursework in DS&amp;A, computer architecture, networking, and operating systems

Here's the thing: I can't stand teaching teenagers anymore, and want out ASAP for a variety of reasons. The only thing keeping me going at the moment is the summer internship I'm looking forward to. I don't regret teaching, but I've had my share and am working very hard towards my new goal. Since I'm working full-time, I can only manage one course at a time for my MSCS (this puts me on track to finish in ~3 years). 

I'm weighing two options:

1) Take a summer class during my internship. This will ensure progress towards the completion of my MSCS.

2) Grind Leetcode on the side during my internship and apply for full-time entry level roles as soon as I have something to put on my resume from my internship. I already have a STEM degree with a decent amount of CS coursework, which is why I'm hopeful that having the internship on my resume will be enough for an entry-level SWE position.

Which option will serve me best? I wanted to make this a poll, but I didn't see an option. Thanks for reading."

rpw1tw,3,2021-12-27,"No degree, thoughts about Cognixia JUMP program?",RLGAsell,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rpw1tw/no_degree_thoughts_about_cognixia_jump_program/,"This is one of the programs that train you for 10 weeks and then help you look for a job at a fixed rate of 50k for two years. Most of the advice I see on this sub say that it’d be better to hold off for a better paying job.

The issue with this plan is that I don’t have a degree. I attended a school with a very prestigious CS and CE program as a CE major, and have about two years worth of credits. I also spent two summers at a very good internship program. But I feel my lack of degree will hold me back from finding a software engineering job at this point. If I find a job through the JUMP program, although I would be underpaid for two years, I’d get my foot in the door and get valuable experience. I don’t know if I can get a foot in the door otherwise.

Thoughts, advice?"
rpwkih,16,2021-12-27,Weekly Job Q&amp;A Thread (12/27/2021),EngrToday,ComputerEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerEngineering/comments/rpwkih/weekly_job_qa_thread_12272021/,"Hi all,

Here is the 104th installment of the weekly job Q&amp;A thread. Feel free to ask any questions related to computer engineering jobs here (they will no longer be allowed as individual posts).

I am more than happy to answer any direct questions (just tag me in a comment). My background is in GPU architecture, simulation, and modeling. I currently do performance engineering/debugging for ML accelerators.

**Common Questions (continuously expanding)**

* Why can't I find jobs titled ""Computer Engineer""?
   * Computer engineer is a fairly generic title. You will often have better luck looking for things like verification engineer or software engineer. If you have a specific area you would like to work in (e.g., embedded systems, storage, etc.) that can definitely help narrow things down.
* Do I need to have an internship to find a job?
   * No, but it can help. If you have a large body of work to show (such as open-source contributions), those can be more valuable (depending on the field).
* What programming languages should I learn?
   * That depends on what you are interested in! There are computer engineering jobs where you primarily work in assembly and C. There are others where you are mainly working with Python and databases. If you are new to programming, Python is a nice introductory language.
* Is becoming a PE worth it as a computer engineer?
   * Personally, I have never met anyone in this field that was a PE, and it definitely is not a common thing for people to pursue (in CE/CS).
* Do I need skill X/Y/Z as a computer engineer?
   * That depends completely on what job you are trying to get! Knowing an HDL like Verilog is unlikely to help you if you get a job writing simulator code in C or C++. The same can be said about being an expert in Python programming but trying to get a job writing Verilog. As always, read job descriptions.
* What software/tools should I learn?
   * Not all software is relevant to all positions. For example, the software/tools you'll use in software jobs will be very different than you will in hardware jobs. However, there are some common skills like using git, effective use of the command line, etc. that are useful in almost every role.
* How do I find computer engineering jobs?
   * If you have no idea what you want, I would suggest just searching a job board (indeed, google, linkedin, etc.) for computer engineering jobs. If you know of a company you would want to work for (e.g., AMD), you can go directly to their website and look at their open positions. You can also use the information you learn from that job board (job titles, requirements, skills, etc.) to refine your searches on other job boards.

All the best,

\--Nick

rpxlo6,7,2021-12-27,UNC KF ($$) vs Georgetown MSB ($) vs Rice Jones ($),ze-nith,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/rpxlo6/unc_kf_vs_georgetown_msb_vs_rice_jones/,"
Hi r/mba ,

I have admits from these schools in R1 and would appreciate some advice from this community. 

Some information about me:

GMAT - 740

Demographic Background - Indian Male, 29, International Applicant

Work Experience - Senior Engineer building Analytics Products for US clients at a boutique advanced analytics firm (6+ years total work experience)

Post MBA Goal - Move into Tech PM roles in Tech industry in the US. Backup options are Program/ Project Management roles in Tech industry.

I was dinged at Foster, Tepper, and Cornell and have been waitlisted at Marshall (Not too optimistic about converting, especially with $). 

I'm torn between UNC KF and Georgetown because I like them both and not really considering Rice (Should I?). I also have a few concerns outlined below.

I'm little concerned about KF since they lost their STEM status in 2020 temporarily and messed up the internship recruiting for internationals during 2020 by making the whole program virtual (which prevented internationals from interning). I understand that these things happened during peak COVID time but I'm concerned nevertheless. 

Georgetown is costly and is giving me a scholarship of around 1/3rd of what KF is giving. I'm considering negotiating with Georgetown but they are known to not give much in scholarships. I also have to take up electives to fulfill the STEM major offering at MSB whereas KF MBA is STEM by default. 

Neither schools are very renowned for placing many students in the Tech industry so I'm also thinking about PM roles in Finance/ FinTech as options. 

I'm looking for a school that best sets me up for fulfilling my goals and I'm looking for some advice/ POVs from this community regarding these schools.

Thanks!"

This is my first reddit post and I've checked the rules + previous posts to make sure this hasn't been posted about before so I hope it's revelant/okay! I've included a short form post for those that cba to read and longer post with added context!

(Content Warning: Mentions of depression, PASSIVE suicidal ideation, med trials)

Short Summary/TLDR -

I used to be highly motivated, worked SUPER hard and was a high achiever. Now I've gotten to second year at a top university, finally got my ADHD diagnosis and medication that works for me, I do nothing. 

I'm a term behind - just done 1st term of yr 2 - have a new term to prep for and can't bring myself to get out of bed to do anything besides eating/seeing family or friends and legitimately spend hours watching Youtube or scrolling on my phone. Have been like this for a few months.

I've always had struggles with 'depressive episodes' and this one has all the usual symptoms/severity BUT normally I work through everything and FEEL stress/worry. This time I just don't care and have lost all that drive and motivation. (I will try antidepressants soon but when I took them in the past, I had actual drive, so am not suee they'll work).

I want to get that drive back + want to know how to stop this perserveration with youtube/my phone (I believe the hours on my phone are a form of hyperfocus). --&gt; I've tried to watch motivational youtube vids; tell myself to ""just do 10mins""; sat with someone else working; journalling + reminders of my dreams etc; use habit trackers; used apps like forest + DND to prevent me using my phone... NONE of this is helping.

Advice on forcing myself to study, quit the obsessive youtube watching, and get my drive back would be much appreciated!!!!!

Full Post Details -

For context: I'm a working class woman, 20 years old, a second year at Oxford and was diagnosed in January with ADHD (during my 1st year, 2nd term). 

Meds info: I've been trialling meds since September and have cycled through 1. Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine); 2. Amoxetretine; 3. another stimulant; before settling on dexamphetamine (which I will finish a trial for soon and get as a regular prescription).
--&gt; It was a fucking tough trial, the Vyvanse made me feel focused and on it (I was mentally in a decent place when I started the trial), but I was manic, anxious, couldn't sleep AT ALL, didn't eat sometimes for a few days and had to stop that after heart attack type symptoms. Coming off them suddenly was ROUGH and the Amoxetretine made it worse sedating me, giving me hallucinations, serious suicidal ideation and worse (I only took them for 3 days but took over a week to recover). 3rd med type did fuck all. But, finally dexamphetamines are working and doing the good things Vyvanse did but with none of the side effects.

The problem: Something has kind of 'snapped' inside of me during the course of the last few months and I have no motivation or interest in 'real life' (i.e my degree, career prospects, internships, waking up). I have spent the last month and a bit only being interested in youtube videos and scrolling on my phone.

I used to be VERY motivated and hardworking. Pushed myself through GCSEs and A Levels with no support; did my uni application alone; worked in retail; applied for and successfully got onto multiple internships before uni started; had clear interest in academia and my career; volunteered; AND maintained a small but fine social life. This is probably why my ADHD went unnoticed for so long. 

However, I have been 'depressed' (low mood, appetite changes, sleeping for 12+ hours, passive suicidal ideation, crying spells, low self esteem, body image issues) on and off since 15. BUT no matter how severe it was, I could always push forward and kept going until it passed or things in my life that triggered these episodes calmed down. I also didn't have hobbies or interests besides listening to music, clothes and watching tv (my mum never had money for me to pursue things as a kid i.e music lessons, sports clubs + I grew up without a home computer or internet until 14/15).

I believe I'm currently going through one of those 'depressive episodes,' but this time it's different. This snap has completely changed me. I finally have medication and am not even making the most of it. I feel sparks of motivation and kind of want to actively get back to the hardworking person I was, but it all feels so empty and meaningless. This degree feels like the biggest mistake I ever made, pursuing a career seems pointless. Somewhere inside of me I think I still have high aspirations because I can't bring myself to drop out, but I can't find it or pull myself away from my phone. 

I'm thinking of trying anti-depressants in the new year to maybe elevate things, but this feels like something meds can't solve and honestly after my med trial I can't stand the idea of going through the adjustment process all over again. I also don't have time to waste another term as all my content from this year counts. 

My tutors are supportive and lovely, but that doesn't change the fact I have 7 essays from last term to do and next terms prep to do. I don't want to wake up and have tried watching motivation videos; setting routines; telling myself to just do 10mins of work; journalling my goals, why I do NEED this degree (uni has allowed me to discover myself in some ways, while seperating me from my working class identity/home/family/self = some peace but a huge identity crisis); putting my phone on Do not disturb and apps like Forest to stop me being able to use it... But nothing is materialising!!! I just can't bring myself to care and though it's nice to not be stressed for the first time in my life, I used to be SO highly stressed constantly that I'd use it to drive me. I feel almost numb. 

Thank you to anyone who's gotten this far! Any advice/support on how to force myself to focus on studying and stop my endless youtube scrolling is much appreciated!!!"

During the last 6 years, I've been doing office jobs that have to do with IT, albeit having 0 academic education on the subject. Most of these jobs were customer support basically. Some sucked. Some paid very well and had very good tools, but eventually I had to be let go for this reason or the other.  The most recent was COVID and been jobless since August 2021. 

However, long before I found that job, I was applying to HR positions consistently. Interns, assistants, recruitment, what have you. I just wanted to do something HR-related. 

I thought because I'm doing a master's in HR, then I should be a good candidate for this kind of positions, but alas, all I got were measly interviews followed by a rejection email. I got around 4 video interviews in the last semester.  

I've been applying every other week to job openings related to HR and it's really not going anywhere. Messing around on the site I use to hunt for jobs, I realized that I submitted 245 job applications in HR alone in the span of the last 2 years. I got maybe 5 interviews in total. 

And here I am wondering if I messed up my career by choosing HR or this is all normal and I'll finally land a good job. 

There were many interesting positions that I applied for and got interviews for. One was with a very good pharmaceutical company who wanted an IT consultant to develop HR IT tools. I was actually hyped for it and I thought the interview went smoothly, only to be slapped in the face back to reality with a rejection email. 

What do you guys advise I should do next? I started to feel like a lost case."
rpyrwz,6,2021-12-27,"I'm a (sorta) new grad and I need a job ASAP, which route would be the best to go with?",mintblue510,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rpyrwz/im_a_sorta_new_grad_and_i_need_a_job_asap_which/,"Hello. I graduated with my CS degree last December. I didn't have an internship, but worked for a coding summer camp and taught Java to preteens. I didn't start looking for a software role in earnest until I graduated. Over the last year I've interviewed on and off with lots of companies, but never seemed to be able to get past the technical round. Next month, I have to start paying student loans, and come May, I will need to move and my rent will likely double. My question is what would be a good way forward for me?

My current job I took when I went back to school. They worked with my school schedule, but the pay is terrible and I don't get along with half my coworkers. It's a dead end job where you basically just have to be a warm body and they'll hire you. 

I have a friend who works in sales for a start-up and he says he can help me get a role as a Sales Development Representative. This isn't something I want to do, but I think I would be a good fit. Before my degree, I worked for a successful and large retail firm. I was consistently one of the top sales people globally every year. I left that because I hated working holidays, inconsistent hours, and low pay. I had always wanted to work in a more technical role and went back to school. I do think my background and degree would benefit me in a software sales role, but I would just want to use this as a stepping stone until I get get a better job. I would essentially just want this role for the increased pay compared to my current job until I could figure out what to do next. 

I started the year applying to Full Stack SWE roles, and general SWE roles. I didn't get as many call-backs as I had hoped, so by summer I started applying to QA, SDET, and SRE roles since I heard they are easier to land. I have had more success with call backs for QA roles, but during the interview they frequently ask me about tools, technologies and techniques I was never exposed to during my degree. 

Since my graduation, I had only done one personal project, a full stack MERN app. I have been riding that and my degree over the last year hoping that would be enough. I don't think it is, and the project itself is starting to become dated on my resume. I started grinding leetcode the last month and I really think that would be beneficial to me. A lot of questions I've come across on LC I have seen in real interviews, I also think I should work on another project, but am not sure what it should be. I have been interested in learning more about Java Spring framework.

So I am wondering what advice you all have about how I should proceed? Should I take the sales role, until I figure out what to do? Would that hurt my jump into a SWE role? Should I continue to grind leetcode and keep applying for SWE/SDET/QA/SRE roles? Or should I keep applying to SWE roles and work on another side project in the mean time?

Thank you"

The company is large, stable, well-known and profitable. It is also out of state.

I have 3 interviews scheduled in January. Two are local and the other is in state about 3 hours drive.

Two of these companies are larger and one of them is better known than the one I received the internship offer from. All these 3 offer at least as good an opportunity as the one in hand if not better.

Can I accept the offer I have now and then reject it later?

During the interview, I was told that the offer is binding. I cannot find the word binding in the offer document.

Is it possible to have such a contract? What will the penalties be if I reject this offer later?"

I started grinding leetcode 2 days ago and I honestly feel like a failure.

If I am to solve a leetcode easy entirely on my own it takes me anywhere from 1-2 hours, and that’s without the garuntee I solve it with optimized runtime or memory. Mediums are even worse as I can just pass almost all test cases within two hours by myself but I fall short by minor details I overlooked and I end up just searching for the optimized answer online.

And don’t even get me started on optimizing runtime and memory. I can’t even comprehend the leetcode analysis where it explains the formula that gives the most optimizable runtime speeds. I feel like this is where my college has failed me as I am paying attention in classes, but things like hashing etc have never been brought up. Most of these things are what I’ve been trying to catch up on by myself over break.

rq2fzp,1,2021-12-27,Job Offer/Life Advice: Should I move across the country for a better job?,danielcoolidge,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rq2fzp/job_offerlife_advice_should_i_move_across_the/,"Hi, this will probably be a pretty long post as I try to divulge a lot of info/context.

I am a EE/CpE dual major and I work in software engineering. I graduated in late 2019 and started my first full-time post-graduation job at my current company in the southeast US late 2020 (pandemic made jobs hard to find for me). I should note that I had 2 years of full time internship experiences across 5 different companies. My career direction is embedded software engineering and embedded Linux. But I'm still junior level, especially with embedded Linux. However, I consider myself advanced in C and moderate advanced in C++. I'm good with Linux and it's 100% my preferred dev environment (I actively avoid jobs that develop on Windows).

My job is in defense and consequently I have security restrictions which I'd like to get out of by changing to a better job. My location also has a problem retaining and promoting SW talent. We SW devs pretty much openly talk about applying elsewhere because the work environment is tough (because of lack of devs knowledgeable about our product due to people leaving) and the benefits don't keep up too great with industry. To add on to this, I have essentially learned no new skills working here because so much of it is politics/process, the work I do isn't that great, and I've spend a lot of my time as a SW Level 1 helping the senior engineers on my team with their tasks/C/C++ skills and stuff.

The location is southeast US. I have been trying to get a job in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle specifically but Portland is acceptable too) for about 4 years but have yet been unable to. That's where I really really want to live for the weather/climate/nature. I really dislike where I live now because there's no mountains, it's hot (I hate hot weather and love cold weather), and the nature sucks.

Now, I just got a job offer in LA. I always said I would never move to LA because of the climate (too hot and desert-y for me), and because there are SO MANY PEOPLE (I'm originally from a rural area and LA is too crowded), and also the traffic (I hate cars and traffic). I am also trying to find a place to live that will let me live month-to-month for reasons I'll get to later.

The offer in terms of compensation will be not a great move financially. While the salary is roughly equivalent to what I make here after cost-of-living conversion, I'm about to receive my first bonus and raise in March time. Moving to LA now (the offer wants me to start in January and doesn't seem flexible to start later) means I give up my bonus (which could make a fairly big difference in my finances and is the first bonus I'll have received in the 1.3 years I've worked here). Also, the cost of housing in LA is crazy. Living on my own near work in LA basically starts at $3k for a studio, which btw they seem to be all unavailable too. According to statistics I saw the average rent there is over $3k. Now if I do this, then I'll be losing a significant amount of money overall moving to LA. So my plan would be to find a like-minded roommate and hopefully have a split rent around $1500 to make living there financially what I want. If I stay here, I will have a rent around the same or less by moving in with someone from work. The cost of moving across the country to LA is several thousand in expenses too at best.

Now to the job offer. It's with a startup that sounds really promising in a new technology that I do believe to be successful. The work I'd be doing is basically exactly what I want to be doing in my career and would be teaching me skills and perks my interest (I have no interest in anything I've done at my current job). The thought of this gets me really excited. But it's also the first job offer I've had in the last 12 ish months. And it's really not where I want to live. It's better in some ways than where I am now. And this is a large part of my indecisiveness about the job. I'm not sure when i'd be able to get another offer, and if it will be anywhere near as good a match as this one. Technically this is the best full-time offer I've had in my 2 years since graduating in terms of what I'd be working on and what I'll be learning. So who knows when i'll get another one, and who knows if I can even get one where I really want to go. It may be better to work there in LA for a few years until I get to senior level and good experience so that job hunting where I want to go is easier. But if I could just get a job where I want to go, I'd be even happier and not waste all that time in LA.

Bonuses come out in March/April time. \~4 months from now. So that would be my ideal start date.

Now for the final kicker. I've been want to go to grad school and really regret not doing it combined with BS. Especially since it took me a year to get a full-time job out of school because of the pandemic starting. So I've applied to a few schools (one is in Seattle where I'd like to go and none of them are in LA) and I won't get acceptance/rejection letters until the March/April time frame. This would be to start a MS program full time doing research in Fall 2022. I have no idea if I'll be accepted to any of them, and if I am accepted, if the research I'd be doing will be good enough for me to afford to go back to school. So I'm afraid of moving to this new job in LA, working there for 6 ish months and then leaving to go to grad school. Not only does that probably look pretty bad, but I'd have to move a 2nd time within a year which puts financial strain on me.

So I'm afraid of working at my current job continuing to waste my time here, but I'm afraid of both the expenses and location of the new offer even though I would enjoy the work and learn a lot, and have the concern of having to move again and start grad school in the Fall (or maybe I don't get accepted at all). So I'm trying to balance this triangle of enjoying my job vs location vs finances.

1st note: I told my current employer about the offer so that they might give me a better raise. (I'm underpaid compared to my responsibilities which is common of most of the software engineers here). I told them I didn't want to leave and I enjoy the job and that I was just looking out for my market value. I figure that if I don't take this new job I should at least use it to get better compensation at my current job. Sounds like it worked. I'm expecting a promotion, a raise, and a bonus in March/April time (I have really good performance reviews for this year).

2nd note: my apartment needs notice essentially by the 30th for me to leave in February otherwise I'll have a $5k fee even though I'm on a month to month lease (means I have to give at least 30 day move out notice).

3rd note: I still need to visit the job in LA to see how I feel about the area and was supposed to have a flight there this week. But with the cancelled flights and the cost of flights currently, I don't think I'll make it out there (flights are over $500 now).

Here's where my question to my fellow redditors and CS/CpE majors. What would you guys do in my situation? What advice or reassurance do you have to me?

Should I bite the bullet and take the offer and deal with the rest? Should I just suffer a few more months at my current job, take the bonus, and wait to find out if I'll be attending grad school in the fall while also looking for other jobs in case I don't get grad school?"

Explore your curiosity: 6/10 Liked my topic (breaking the status quo by following my passions), but it could’ve been better? Idk how to rate my own essays

Do you guys think i can make it ? Should I do Dsa/leetcode in spare time too? its hectic to study/internship/ leetcode all at once. Also i am not sure but i think my internship would be very long. Its already 8 months in so far. its paid though so no complaints."

Like I have research ideas in the field of computer science that is hard but their research sounds more real and scientific. Does anyone have advice on how to find such research projects on their own. I mean I do want to intern at a research project in a university but I still want to try to research on my own.

rq74oe,9,2021-12-27,I quit my “dream” job today and walked away from a potential seven-figure salary.,GoldenUnicorn00,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rq74oe/i_quit_my_dream_job_today_and_walked_away_from_a/,"Last year (2020), in May, after working my ass off to maintain amazing grades (4.2 GPA), along with attempting to be the “perfect”, role-model student by being involved in a host of on-campus organizations and student councils, I finally graduated from college - Summa Cum Laud, at that! 

As I reflected on my college career, I convinced myself that it didn’t matter that I was unable to experience/enjoy the idolized college partying lifestyle. It didn’t matter that I was unable to date girls or find a serious girlfriend like most of my friends; my girlfriend was the library and we spent many long, long nights together. I reiterated to myself that it was A-OKAY that I had driven myself into an insurmountable amount of debt, even though I had no concrete financial repayment plan mapped out. I forced myself to believe that the overwhelming thoughts of worry, doubt, fear and potential for failure that constantly loomed in the back of my mind were normal. 

The only thing that mattered was that I finally made it to graduation - a day I had been waiting on my literal entire life. Throughout college, I did everything to construct a resume so impressive that I would undoubtedly be a stand-out candidate and secure an employment position that would provide me with a successful, secure future. All of my hard work had finally paid off. I was ecstatic, elated, relieved, yet, nervous to tackle whatever curveballs life might throw at me, post-graduation - especially within such a competitive workforce market. I was so ready!!!

Senior year, I applied for an externship at a top partnership firm - an externship that was so highly lauded, there were reports of there being &gt; 300 applicants, even though only five…FIVE positions would be granted. If chosen for said externship, 2/5 candidates would be granted an [unpaid] summer internship at one of the largest, and most successful companies in the US. Propitiously, I was hand-selected for the externship, and knew I was exactly where I was supposed to be. I knew I had to prove myself as a viable candidate to be chosen for the internship, and I worked harder than I have ever worked in my life. I pushed myself so hard that I actually became physically ill, yet continued pushing myself in hopes of securing a position within the company.

When I was informed that I was 1/2 candidates chosen for the summer internship, any feelings of regret or anger for not being a “normal” college student almost immediately absolved. I knew that even if I wasn’t offered a position within the company, making it that far as a new grad spoke volumes. While the externship was intensely rigorous and difficult, meeting the expectations and constant demand of the internship were virtually impossible. There were many days and nights that I “worked” 18+ hours consecutively, with zero compensation and zero complaints. I was fully aware that I was mentally abusing and physically neglecting myself, but pushed myself to continue onward, knowing this would only be temporary. This was just another test I had to pass - albeit the most difficult and challenging test of my life. 

After an unimaginably grueling four month process, accompanied with a four month waiting period, the hard work, again, paid off and I was offered a position within the company March 1, 2021. How naive of me to believe that my work conditions would, in any way, improve. A typical work week consisted of roughly 70hrs/wk, older co-workers were legitimate bullies to me, and I was expected to pick up the slack, and complete the unfinished projects/tasks of others, because I was the “new guy”, and apparently me finishing these meticulous projects was a way of “training” and/or “teaching” me so that I could gain more experience. 

Today, I decided to stop and walk away from  the abuse. Christmas Day, I actually had to leave my family (who traveled to spend time with me during the holidays because I couldn’t get an adequate amount of time off work to travel) and got called into the office to finish the project of a senior co-worker’s, who was allotted the holiday off. Today at work, I was publicly reprimanded and criticized by one of our partners for failing to CC: one of the senior leads in a freakin email. After that happened, in front of our entire meeting, I literally said to this prick, “YOU’RE A LAZY FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT, YOUR BREATH ALWAYS SMELLS, AND I’VE BEEN FUCKING YOUR (22 y/o) DAUGHTER IN MY CAR.” I walked out immediately after saying that and didn’t get a chance to see anyone’s reaction. Everything minus the daughter part was true, but nobody knew that it wasn’t true.

I’m still pretty in shock that I walked out of a job that I fought so hard to get - especially knowing that if I would have stayed until March 1, 2022, my yearly salary would have increased to $750K/yr. No amount of money is worth losing my dignity and self respect. and I almost lost myself. Now I’m just hanging out at my super small apartment, still insanely in debt, jobless, unsure of how I’m going to pay rent, and questioning if all of the sacrifices that I’ve had to make to get a position that I competed for like an object, were even worth it? The answer is NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT! Big companies will use, abuse, and take advantage of you, if you allow them. Walking away today sucked, but finally standing up for myself felt so much better! After all, if you don’t stand for something, you’ll fall for anything!"

rq8xx2,4,2021-12-28,how long can i continue be an imposter for?,cs_throwaway6969,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rq8xx2/how_long_can_i_continue_be_an_imposter_for/,"context: i'm a computer science major about to graduate in april. i'm at a school that is fortunate to have a great internship program, so i was essentially gifted 6 internships in software engineering, including my most recent one being in the bay area.

to many of you, it may sound like i've had a pretty blessed college experience full of opportunity, and it might appear as though i'm in a pretty good position to succeed in my career. however these past 4 years have actually been a never-ending intermittent struggle. this is because of 2 reasons:

1. i don't enjoy computer science: i chose to study computer science because math was my strongest subject and i really didn't like any other subject in high school. when i got to university i quickly realized that i just didn't have the desire to go to hackathons, build side projects, or spend anytime outside of school coding, despite many of my peers doing so. i gave those things honest tries but i never learned to enjoyed them. i tried to spark a passion for coding in various ways but they never worked. i struggled with dealing with this reality for a while, this reality of being a cs student who just doesn't have a passion for it. i never had the will to do anything beyond my studies, i just wanted to pass my courses and spend my time having fun with friends and have a college experience. naturally though, i was often worried that going down this path of complacency would set me up for doom in the future. but eventually after my 3rd internship, i got fed up found a way to lay those worries to rest. i read enough posts on here about how you don't need to be passionate about your work to succeed, how it's normal to not like your job because work is work and that's just how it be. i never enjoyed my work at any of my internships, but it slowly stopped bothering me when i realized i could derive so much meaning and purpose outside of work. besides, my internships were all short lived, after 4 months i was guaranteed to be outta there. i didn't have to worry about being stuck in a job i hated **forever**. by the end of all my 4 month internships, i became burnt out by the dread of having to go to work every day, eagerly ready to return back to school.
2. i'm not good at computer science: it's one thing to not enjoy something, but to also not be good at it and still do it feels manic to me at times. i wouldn't say i'm stupid. i've always been an average student, i've never failed any courses, and to be on the verge of graduating with a computer science degree feels like an accomplishment worth celebrating (even though i cheated on most of my assignments). when it comes to actual software engineering work however, i am undoubtedly painfully below average. after 6 internships, i should be a lot better at coding than i am now, but i'm not. my technical knowledge is very limited, i struggle with learning new languages, frameworks, or any technically challenging concepts for that matter. the only tickets that i've been able to complete involve building buttons or text fields that i copied from other parts of the codebase. i wish i was exaggerating here. any work that involves anything apis, databases, servers, kubernetes, etc - i've never been able to do (even though i've tried). i've chosen to specialize in frontend to try and minimize the amount of challenging concepts that i can run into, but nonetheless my general inability to learn and problem solve still inhibit me greatly. i know that i can remedy this by asking for a lot of help. most of what i accomplish gets done with the help of others either through pair programming or getting very detailed step-by-step by instructions. basically, i need to get my handheld (i guess that's why i perform better in school). but in the end of the day, i know i can't get my hand held forever and it is quite demoralizing knowing that even in my 6th internship i still need extensive help to get through even simple bug fixes. maybe i'm just a really slow learner, and eventually things will click. i usually do learn a thing or 2 from each of my internships about how to debug things, how to ask for help from my managers, or how to use git better, but technical things never really tend to stick. at the end of most of my internships i usually receive feedback that I've done ""ok"" or i did a ""pretty good job"", but that i didn't deliver as much as they hoped (especially compared to other interns). for 2 of my internships i've even been met with quite a bit of anger/disappointment from my manager, who really questioned my passion for the work. i've never once received a return offer to any company i've worked for.

so here i am now after floating through my college years, feeling perplexed about what to do with my life going forward. like i mentioned earlier, i eventually settled on trying to get a full time software engineer job, and buying time to figure out/pursue my real passions. i have other things i enjoy, although i haven't explored any of those things enough yet to say any of them are passions, or at least enough to have a desire to make a career out of them. in the end of the day, i really value independence and financial freedom, and a full time swe job sounds like exactly what i need. i absolutely can't stand the idea of living at home with my family. i'm going to have a degree in computer science, and have had 6 internships worth of experience in the field, so it kind of only makes sense in my head to continue down this path. i feel like i've made it too far now to give up, i've already managed to con my way into the bay area. there's no other discipline that really interests me either.

i went through the new grad recruiting season the past few months. i got a few interviews, but failed all of them. anytime i got to a system design interview, i completely flunked because i have 0 understanding of systems or any related concepts (probs because i've never worked with anything very technical at work). i also failed a frontend technical screen because i have 0 react knowledge, that was pretty demoralizing. the only thing i've been able to put my effort to has been grinding leetcode, i've done about 100 questions to this point. but it feels like most of the questions i get asked in coding challenges/interviews are just general coding exercises that i can't really prepare for and won't end up doing well in anyways.

heading into the new year, i feel like i'm on the verge of giving up. idk generally when new grad recruiting season ends, but it feels like its basically over. it feels like landing a full time job is almost impossible at this point - having to land an interview, having the luck to get an easy leetcode question or one that i've seen before, and somehow being able to assemble enough knowledge to pass a system design round from nothing.

i'm running out of motivation to continue. i don't even know if it makes sense anymore to continue. i feel like i'm trapped in this never ending cycle of ""i don't wanna do this"" -&gt; ""oh but i have to because i need to move out of my house and have a life"" and i don't know how to break out.

a lot of advice out there is to find what you really love and figure out a way to make it your career and what not. but there's also a lot of advice to just screw passion and pursue financial freedom/stability. i've always leaned towards the latter, just pushing through it and hoping things will work out eventually. they honestly have so far - each one of my internships has brought me to different places and bought me time and resources that have helped me grow as a person in so many ways (outside my swe career). but maybe this isn't the best advice for someone who's not very competent in their job and will sooner or later hit a brick wall. *how long can i continue be an imposter for after all?* or maybe it is good advice, but I just need to find a way to shut down this constant tug of war going on in my head about me wanting to give up on cs and me not wanting to give up the stability.

if you've made it this far - thank you, i really appreciate you taking the time to read this wall of text. it was quite therapeutic just to put this together, and i imagined it might be (or might not be) therapeutic to read advice that any of you kind souls might be able to offer in this situation. i'm kinda scared of the harsh truths that may arise.

tl;dr: soon to be cs grad, hates cs and sucks at it, but doesn't want to give up the career stability."

rq9efi,56,2021-12-28,Would you choose passion or money?,Apprehensive-Tie-594,askSingapore,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/rq9efi/would_you_choose_passion_or_money/,"Some context:

I'm 19M studying and working in the tech industry. And I'm currently having a early life crisis. I can't decide what do I want to do with my future.

Money Path:

I'm currently interning as a data scientist for a company that most would call ""prestigious"". I have also received a return offer which is rather attractive. Previously since like 14 I liked programming, math, etc. I've also always aim for a path to obtain a cs degree, and work for a tier 1 company and earn 6 figures annual before 30. I genuinely believe I am definitely capable of doing so. However, I realised I don't enjoy what I am doing. Even before my intern, I was working as a Tech Assistant and Software Engineer I didn't enjoy what I was doing. Ever since I started programming professionally I realised I dislike it more and more. I am now considering being a PM in tech as it requires more people skills than coding but I'm also not sure if I will definitely enjoy it. Plus it's PM roles r extremely competitive.

Passion Path:

At the same time I'm also working part time during the weekend at an enrichment centre. Which I enjoy 100 times more than my intern. During the whole week I'm just think about the weekends when I'll be able to teach and see my students. Through this job I've realised I enjoy teaching, working with children and I wouldn't say ""physical work"" but I like to have physical interaction. However, considering my future career options with these in mind I don't think they will be able to meet my financial wants. 

From what I know a moe primary/secondary teacher have no work life balance and the starting salary is about 3k and I believe even like HOD is around 5k. 

A poly lecturer is also about 5k and so is a private programming instructor.

A uni prof is about 10k which is great but unlike poly lecturer which only requires a degree, a uni prof requires master or PhD and above. Which I can't take due to my current financial situation.

Being a preschool teacher is also impossible as I'm a guy plus they are being paid peanuts. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong if about any of the options above^

Why do I want money so badly? 

My parents have zero in retirement fund which means I will be the next sandwich generation. Don't get me wrong as much as I am grateful for what my parents have done, but as a child of parents who's retirement fund is me it has been extremely stressful. I've been thinking about how to make money since I was a kid. I've been planning, saving and investing way earlier than the majority. Hence, I want to break the sandwich generation so that I am not only able to provide for my parents and future kids but also have the ability to retire and be self reliant basically the goal is FIRE. 

What I want in life:

I would like to get married, live in a HDB, have 2 kids have a simple car. I know a car isn't necessary but its a want that I would like. Able to provide sufficient allowance to my parents and kids. Go on overseas trips annually during my future kids school holidays.
Basically I wouldn't want money to be a limiting factor to my kids of course not like billionaire-ish but like if they want to study overseas, enrichment, etc it would be something that I could afford for them. And able to save 3-4 million when I retire. I plan to do so by saving and investing using compound interest from a young age. 

I would like to earn 6 figures annual to live that life comfortably. And so that money won't be a stress point in my life.

So if you were me what would you do? Continue with the grind in the MNCs financial, tech industry career option and make big bucks but don't enjoy what I do. Or follow my passion and be a teacher and at least to me won't be earning enough. Or is there another way?

I know most will say I'm 19 and can take my time but as an INTJ I can't just go with the flow. I prefer to get my shit together and for the first time in my life I have no idea what I'm going to do."

This MBA program keeps emphasizing on having leadership potential, So, I was thinking about asking one of my former team members (I led a team of tutors at a university for the past 2 years) to perhaps describe my leadership potential since my professor will describe my academic one. Do you guys think it's a good idea, or should I just try to find some other professor? TIA"

As the title states I am burnt out at my current job.

I am 28 years old and live in the Chicago-land area. For the last 6 years I have worked in the medical field. First year as a nursing assistant and they last 4-5 in a cardiovascular surgical unit then ICU/Covid ICU. I've noticed I can only tolerate working on a particular unit for about 2 years before becoming burnt out and disenfranchised with my choice in profession. Upon switching, I feel excited but overwhelmed. I feel somewhat re-energized because there is so much to learn and learning/continuing my education has been one of the main drivers for my career pursuits.  Despite this positive aspect, I don't believe this is sustainable in the long run. Initially, I had lofty ambitions of going to medical school or becoming a CRNA; but I am just so burnt out on medicine that I've lost my love and have largely abandoned my dreams.

I have two BS degrees the first being BS in Human Physiology and Sports performance with the second obviously being a BS in nursing.

During my first degree, I completed about 3 years of internships at well known division 1 schools as an intern/assistant strength and conditioning coach. Additionally, I was employed in a student position at my university's police department.

After coming to the realization that the lifestyle is too volatile, unstable, and overall just not wanting to get a master's degree, I decided to pursue a career in law enforcement. During this time, I worked as a security guard and was promoted to a site manager at a corporate call center. I continued my pursuit for about a year and after sustaining an injury that impacted my ability to work as a law enforcement officer, I was prompted by my mom (who is a NP) to pursue nursing. Most of my family is in the medical career (Dad is MD, Mom is NP, Stepmom is a RN, Brother is  Nursing supervisor, and his wife being the head of critical care and a bunch of other cardiac and neuro stuff at our hospital. Everyone was supportive of my pursuit as they felt nursing is a good career and they are happy with their choice.

During my second degree, I was employed by the IT department at my local university.  We predominantly handled assisting professors with using various software, performing basic maintenance on school computers and other tech, helping set up AV equipment for school events, and helping run said events. I have no experience with coding or certifications in the field.

As previously stated after graduation, I pursued my career in nursing.

I've gotten to a breaking point where I feel I just can't continue. For some people it's having to deal with death on a near regular basis, for myself it's been the constant feeling of being on edge as critically ill patients (especially covid) are extremely labile and despite how hard I work I just feel my efforts are in vain. I've gone into a deep depression and feel trapped in my current career. I look at other nurses that are able to tolerate the job and veteran nursing that have been in the field for decades and it just makes me feel more like a failure.

The only time, I ever really enjoyed my job was when I was working in IT.

I've always loved computers and other (predominantly hardware and hands on work), and have always loved learning about how to modify, optimize, and just general tinkering. I've enjoyed learning about rudimentary concepts in tech from content creators like Anthony from LTT, Gamer's Nexus, and Der8auer.

As previously mentioned, I have no experience/certification in tech. As far as healthcare certifications, I have the basic BLS, ACLS, and PALS.

As for my current position, I work 12 hour night shifts (which are not a problem) in a hospital setting.

I am willing to attending more schooling (I am currently researching types of jobs you can get in tech with various degrees) and looking at taking some introduction classes at local community colleges.

I am okay with hands on work or office work. I am somewhat willing to travel, but in all honesty it would be very difficult for me as I have grown up with a great support system and struggle with some ""adulting"" type stuff.

I have no prior military experience nor do I have any disabilities.

The degree's I have begun looking into are electrical engineering, computer science (kind of scared of coding and don't think I would like it), and cyber security. I know these fields are so diverse and have many opportunities, but I am kind of in the paralysis by analysis situation.

Thank you to all those that read this post, and a special thank you to all those that comment/provide insight.

I apologize for the long page of text and if it is interpreted as just venting, I felt that some of the information provided was pertinent to the situation.

Hope your breaks are going well. So I applied to a few tech internships over the break and they sent out OAs which are due in like a week or so. I have already done one in the past which was FBU freshman. I have had some coding experience doing many projects and took a cs course so understanding the topic was not bad but actually solving them was an issue and I was only able to solve like 1.5/4 of the problems. I tried another a few days ago which was a practice from CodeSignal and did similarly. I also managed to solve 1 or 2 of the easy problems on Google Kickstart as more practice.

Anyone have an tips or suggestions for prepping in the short amount of time I have or tips for doing well on the actual OAs for CodeSignal (and possibly HackerRank)? I really want to do well, but at the same time I'm sort of lost on how to get started or what to focus on and want to take my time to understand the fundamentals clearly."

*Let me quickly talk a little bit about my background,* I am a commerce student, pursuing B Com at present, So last year I started learning Web Dev (Completely self taught through YouTube) during the pandemic and October this year I started looking for internships and luckily got one for one month in a start up which started this year only. Stipend they offered was 1500 INR (20 USD) for a month.

I was to make frontend for their service(product) which they will launch next year(2022) which I did and they say they liked my work which I did in past 1 month. Now they want me to continue with the internship for next 6 months and as soon as they get funding they will offer me job in their start up.

But the problem for me is that as I am from a commerce background, I had other plans in commerce field only

I did this this internship to only gain some work experience which I got.

And to make a career shift for me will be too risky (I think)

I want your opinion what should I do? should I go with the offer or reject it along with the explanation."

At first i only had the first opportunity ( the startup ) and i started working with them since september then after two weeks the second one came along ( i need to give them an answer in two weeks ).

I am confused because im not sure what i should choose : the company that i am working with right now ( the startup ) is a mess :

- no code review
- we waste our day in pointless meetings ( the daily lasts an hour and every day at 3pm we have to do a presentation of the progress that lasts an hour )
-  all the devs are juniors and there no mentorship
- i havent learned a single thing for 3 months 

also i believe that the code and app quality are mediocre at best and i am not very convinced of the product. 
But the pay is great ( i am working remotly for now ).
The converted salary in my local currency is very significant ( x4.5 the proposed salary from the local company ) and i always received my salary late ( after 3 weeks ) .

Besides the money it would great if i left my country for europe and then i can look for a new job there but there is travel restrictions right now due to covid and it risks to get harder to get visa sponsorship for europe in the next months.

As for the proposed salary of the local company its still good money in my country but very low compared to what i am making right now but i am sure that i would learn a lot with them.

What should i do , should i stick with the startup and hope they don't fail or they don't fire me ( since i've joined the ceo fired 5 people ) Or should i switch for the local company and look for a job in europe after i gain some experience ?"

rqgd7k,4,2021-12-28,Should I go LC/NC with my dad?,nutellacupcakesftw,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rqgd7k/should_i_go_lcnc_with_my_dad/,"Hello Redditors!  LONG post incoming:

My dad has always had an issue with my weight and physical appearance.  A few years ago, he actually kicked me out of the house and threatened to disown me, because I was too fat and didn't floss my teeth often enough (yeah, I know).

About a year ago, he gave me a whole speech about how he wants me to know that my physical appearance doesn't matter to him anymore, he just wants me to be happy.  I was sceptical about this change of heart, but I just went with it. Important to note that up until now, I was financially dependent on my parents to some extent, as a result of my job (described below).

2021 was an incredibly tough year for me (and for everybody else) and I was constantly unhappy.  I was stuck in a low paying job with a toxic work environment, but I had to work out my contract - kind of like an internship.  I started binge eating as a way of coping with my situation and my doctor also prescribed very mild antidepressants.  The meds honestly helped me survive the last few months of the internship and after the internship ended, the desire to binge has been absent.  I'm very positive about the future, my new job and the personal growth that I know I will experience.

Last night, my dad phoned me to tell me how disappointed he is in me for being overweight and for using antidepressants.  Part of his disappointment is, according to him, that I never asked him for help (not true, I did) and that he didn't even know the psychologist I was seeing, so he had no idea what advice she was giving me.

I can hear his own insecurities coming through in the things he says to me and I can hear his panic regarding me moving out from under his financial and emotional control.  I'm not even that mad about the things he said, but I am fed up with the following:

1. He is emotionally manipulative and gets upset if someone does not conform to his idea of the ideal standard.
2. He is racist and homophobic.
3. He phoned me last night just to hurt me - none of what was said was done ""out of love"".
4. His statement of just wanting me to be happy was a blatant lie.

If it were anyone else, I would just go NC and that would be the end of things.  However, I know that going NC with my dad will probably be more exhausting initially than just tolerating him.  For example, I'm pretty sure that if I cut him off, he will forbid me from seeing my mother as well (which I don't want).  I'm also planning on getting married in December 2022 and I don't want him to walk me down the aisle or do any of the other traditional father-daughter things.

So, Reddit: do I go NC and lose my mom as well?  Do I tolerate him and just set stricter boundaries?  Is there another option that I'm missing?"

Goal: Get some sort of internship after freshman year. Anything. I’d obviously want to go to MAANG the most, but I already know that’s a long shot.

I was thinking of picking one of three choices…

1) Harvard’s professional certificate in computer science for web development

2) Harvard’s professional certificate in computer science for artificial intelligence

3) CS50’s introduction to computer science (the on one EDx, i want a certificate) and TheOdinProject

I’m setting a deadline for the end of June, so six months, because I want to have some time for projects at the end of my learning. I was originally thinking of doing just CS50 or TheOdinProject, but I have no experience at all, so I wanted to do something additional that’ll prove that I have more than basic CS knowledge.

Thoughts? Thank you."

Upon browsing websites like LinkedIn, HandShake, etc. I noticed that all the internships are in STEM, marketing, finance, or nonprofit work, and let’s be honest internships translate to jobs. I’m not in Dyson or studying ORIE/stats/econ, so finance is kind of out of the question, and marketing and nonprofit work doesn’t pay too well. The areas I’m interested in, such as romance languages, psychology, and talent acquisition, simply don’t have internship opportunities, or are very low paying.

Upon browsing websites like LinkedIn, HandShake, etc. I noticed that all the internships are in STEM, marketing, finance, or nonprofit work, and let’s be honest internships translate to jobs. I’m not in Dyson or studying ORIE/stats/econ, so finance is kind of out of the question, and marketing and nonprofit work doesn’t pay too well. The areas I’m interested in, such as romance languages, psychology, and talent acquisition, simply don’t have internship opportunities, or are very low paying.

What am I doing wrong? I send a (what I think is) a good resume with various projects.

rqi1u5,0,2021-12-28,What's the best resource to pair with CS50 to get a freshman internship?,ArianaVentiButera,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rqi1u5/whats_the_best_resource_to_pair_with_cs50_to_get/,"God, I always make too much posts on r/csMajors, but I wanted to make one here because I might get a better answer here.

I'm a high school senior. Hardly exceptional at all. I have good grades (top 5%) and an average SAT (1410). I have absolutely zero extracurriculars, activities, or hobbies. NOTHING done outside of school. I have no experience programming besides a garbage high school intro to CS class. I haven't taken AP Computer Science. I'm going to Rutgers University (got accepted there).

My goal is to get ANY summer freshman internship. I obviously wish I could get a MAANG internship. I know it's obviously a long shot, most likely impossible, but I still want to try to get into MAANG or a company of a similar tier. BUT I still want any decent internship. A paid one. 

I have a 9-month deadline from January to maybe the middle of September to learn.

I was originally thinking of doing just CS50 for 4 months, but then I realize that EVERYONE already takes this course, so I doubt that completing this course will distinguish me from the other thousands of applicants. I was thinking of getting Harvard's professional certificate for either web programming or artificial intelligence, since the certification involves taking CS50 PLUS either CS50 web programming or CS50 intro to artificial intelligence.

The cost doesn't matter, since I really want the certificate, so I'm willing to pay for it. My question is, are the extra CS50 classes I listed gonna help me secure the freshman internship, or should I use an additional different resource on top of CS50? Thank you."

What can I do as a freshman in college to prepare?,LGm17,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rqirmz/how_does_applying_for_internships_work_what_can_i/,"Hello! With time off for the holiday season, I wanted to see what I can do to prepare for eventually getting a software engineer/dev internship. For some background, I’m a freshman computer science major at an ABET-accredited institution in the United States. I also already have knowledge in a variety of technologies before college and have two side-project which use them:

* React, JSX
* Nextjs
* HTML, CSS, SASS
* Tailwind CSS
* Prisma ORM
* NodeJS
* Java, Python
* ExpressJS
* Google Cloud, AWS, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare
* Github
* Postgres

Some have told me to apply for an internship now, but I feel like it might be too late and employers might dismiss me because of my age. Regardless, what would you suggest I do now to prepare? Are there any technologies, projects, or classes worth doing?

Thank you and happy holidays!!"

rqmpdn,43,2021-12-28,Advice on negotiating salary for promotion in academia,o-rka,bioinformatics,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/rqmpdn/advice_on_negotiating_salary_for_promotion_in/,"I've been at my institute for almost 6 years and I started as a Bioinformatics Analyst making $50k in San Diego, CA with a Master's degree in Bioinformatics. I've gotten yearly 3% raises and one side step raise where they changed my title to Bioinformatics Engineer to a pay bump of ~$62k. During this time, I've also been pursuing a PhD and the projects overlap with my duties at my institute so it's been a lot of algorithm development, data processing, writing papers, and contributing to grants. I'm in a unique position right now where 2 people have left the institute, one of those people I will be taking on all of their projects and the other (in an entirely different group) I will take on at least one of their projects. I just finished my dissertation, still need to defend, and expect this to be finished in the next few months. My advisor informed me that he wants to give me a promotion to a Staff Scientist position before that with a slight pay raise and then a larger raise after I get my PhD. They offered me $66k which, on GlassDoor, is the very extreme low end of this position. 

I understand it is difficult to give to pay raises in one calendar year and that I should be receiving a larger pay raise once I get my PhD but this is frustrating and I'd like some advice on how to negotiate this. 

A few points to consider: 
* I'm skipping a post doc position and going straight into a Staff Scientist position 
* I now have an intern
* My responsibilities for the past few years have essentially been what a Staff Scientist does with leading the analysis on research projects and writing the papers
* I'm getting another raise after I get my PhD but I'm worried they will try to low ball me twice in row. 
* I will be picking up all the projects from my colleague in Microbial Informatics and at least one project in Immunology. The latter of which, I know the PI has been looking for some time to hire someone to work on this project but hasn't found a suitable candidate. 
* If I left, it would be very difficult for them to find someone who can work on the diverse types of projects they put me on and if they do find one they would have to pay them a lot more than what they are paying me with this raise. Finding someone who can do machine learning, microbial ecology, epigenetics, and pipeline development isn’t easy in academia. 

How can I negotiate a salary increase with this promotion? Can I do this through e-mail or would I have to schedule a meeting about this?"

What the hell are you expecting from me man? I have to manage courseload and still find time to do personal projects? What the hell? No wonder no one in CS industry has a girlfriend or boyfriend or even proper social skills. And once we get a job they will make us work insane hours because management knows jackshit about the product.

The worst thing is, I am an international student in Canada. I do not want to go back to my home country. To get a Canadian PR, I need to do level 0 job which CS job basically is. Man I hate my life. If this is what life is like for a student, I have no hope for someone with a job. No wonder why most gen z wants to kill themselves."

The first opportunity is a Front-End Developer job. I would be involved in updating the front end of the company using already developed designs from figma to Angular as the framework. An advantage of this opportunity is that the company is a little more established and has more employees, and has some support if I need help.

The second opportunity is a Web Developer position. This job would be much more intensive, as I would be in charge of developing a whole new webapp from scratch. So this would mean designing the UI, frrontend, backend, and deployment. One little disadvantage of this job, is that this company is a little smaller, and I do not think I will have a lot of support. However, this would give me alot more experience.

I am really struggling with what to accept, and would love some advice. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated!"

My dad always told me that I need to go to college and get a good paying job. He would insult waiters and fast food workers. Shit on any job that wasn’t in the corporate world. 

So I listened. I listened too good. I went to business school, got 4 internship and became an alcoholic and stoner chasing someone else’s dream. Got two big sales jobs out of college. 

Then life hit me. I was struck with a series of mental breakdowns due to severe clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. While always having ADD. ( all diagnosed ) 

I was unemployed for 8 months because I convinced myself I can’t do basic tasks. I got a job as a cashier and struggled to not call out regularly. 

I’ve been in the hospital numerous times. Inpatient and outpatient. I had to apply for disability but was turned down while only making 1000 dollars a month.

People struggle, life is hard on us. Even the most basic of tasks can be daunting for someone like me. I just hate how my father viewed basic labor because now I show myself no compassion for myself in cashiering or retail work. Yet I’m proud of anyone who can hold a full time job. 

I’m not here just saying rich people have it hard too. I’m awake to the fact that the system I grew up in is insanely flawed. Corporate America has left me to my illness to sink."

I have been applying to Finance, FP&amp;A, and other analyst driven roles since I graduated, but only very diligently since mid August. I was a Non-traditional student (Age 27 at graduation), worked my way entirely through College working 2-3 jobs, I did not have time or did not qualify for most local internships. I did have little experience in a Student managed investment fund, but that is the extent.  


What I have ran into mostly is the dreaded, ""We're looking for a more experienced individuals."" Whether I make it to the interview or not.  


I'm currently waiting to hear back from 3 companies, who are obviously taking their time due to the Holidays. One of which I phone screened, and interviewed twice. Crossing my fingers for that one as it is the farthest I have gotten. It is a Research Analyst position where I would mostly be analyzing market trends, making predictions, and doing what I love most about Finance and Economics.  


If none of these land, I really want to know what helped other people get their foot in the door. I've exhausted almost all of my network connections, reached out to college peers, and my professors. I'm starting to see expections of proficiency or at least familiarity with certain coding languages (which, I was never required or offered any experience in ""coding"" outside of using Excel when I was in school). I'd like to create a porfolio demonstrating some skills, whether I need to learn them, already know them, or what. I also would like to pursue a certification in Microsoft excel.  


Would anyone be able to offer some advice on what I could practice, prepare into a portfolio of sorts (Videos, PDFs, Documents, etc), other skills I should be learning, and other certifications? I don't have much interest in pursuing a CPA, CFA, CFP at least in the short term. If any, those would be more long term goals. I'd prefer to get my foot in the door somewhere now short term, and then explore my options later of large Certifications."

*******

My best friend just died in an accident the day I got home for the holidays. I'm in college graduating this semester, and I have to go back to work on the 4th for a company that I interned over the summer with, then part timed in the fall, and will almost full time for the spring semester. I think they will hire me after I graduate. 

This is a person who was my first friend in high school and is the sister I never had. Due to the nature of the accident, she is being cremated.

Her mom was severely injured in the accident, and she won't be out of  phys rehab until after the new year, and the family doesn't want to do anything until then. I want to be there too.

The problem is, I have to go back to work on the 4th of January. My bosses are very understanding, and technically I'm an intern so there isn't much I can do anyways. I'm not gonna ask for anything too drastic, just to start back the next Monday (the 10th).

On one hand, I'm worried if I go back on the 4th that I will be a sad depressed mess. This was my best friend, after all, and I've had to help comfort her sister and husband who are struggling with grief, and I haven't had very much Time to deal with my own grief. I worry if I go back to that I won't deal with the grief in a healthy way, and I won't be around anyone because my roommates won't return until the semester starts back on the 13th. (I don't do well on my own, and I have diagnosed depression and anxiety).

On the other hand, I'm worried that this will harm their professional opinion of me. I mean, people die all the time, and my friend died almost 2 weeks back, suck it up right? 

******

TL;DR; My friend died on the 17th, in a bad accident. Due to some circumstances, her private service won't be held until the first full week of the year. I, a depressed college student working for a big company as an intern, want to ask for that week (which I go back to work) off to grieve, be there for this friends family, etc. 

BUT, I worry my bosses will think less of me and won't want to hire me after I graduate after this semester.
I'm at a loss of what to do. Any advice would be helpful."
rqshbd,10,2021-12-28,Looking for GIS work experience,hostilegriffin,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/rqshbd/looking_for_gis_work_experience/,"Hi all.... I am in the last little bit of a GIS certification program, and my last course is a work experience credit, somewhat like an informal internship. I was wondering if anyone here had a project they would like some support with. I already have a full time job, so I am looking to find an situation where I can work during off hours as a volunteer (I live on the West Coast of the USA). If anyone has a project, personal or professional, that they have been trying to get going but just need an extra person to work on it, let me know - I'm pretty good with python and basic web front end stuff, and our program is ESRI based, though I can happily dive into QGIS or another platform pretty quickly if that is your mode. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for approximately 60 hours of work between now and end of May 2022. If you have any interest, let me know - I can send you my linked in or contact info.   


Or, if someone else on here is in a similar situation, and you want to build a GIS related app with me, I have an idea that I have been thinking about and maybe we could sponsor each other and work together. I don't think these things have to be official, as long as actual GIS work is involved.

The problem is that I can't take both offers* at the same time. For Google, the earliest start date is in April and the latest is in October 2022 -- but I cannot do an internship during a semester, so I asked my recruiter about postponing it to spring 2023 and unfortunately he said that wasn't possible.

And the other company is even less flexible about start dates.

So here I am, thinking about rejecting Google and reapplying next year for the 2023 session. Which brings me to the following questions:

* Has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to re-interview / land an internship the following year?
* If so, did you have to go through the phone round again or did you move straight to project matching? Did you have to apply on the website again or did a recruiter reach out? (when?)

Would love to hear from people who went through a similar situation!

rqwp6q,10,2021-12-28,Should I Leave?,Personal_Current7405,AsianParentStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/rqwp6q/should_i_leave/,"Hello!

I (20F) am an only child of Chinese immigrant parents and I am uncertain about my life after college. To be truthful, I am thinking about leaving home, away from my Asian parents on the east coast, and settling down across the country on the west coast. There are two reasons for this motivation. First, my boyfriend lives on the west coast. Second, the relationship between me and my Asian parents has degraded throughout the years.

Growing up with my Asian parents has been difficult. We are immigrants, so there have been times when we were tight on money and worried about obtaining permanent residency in the United States. Despite all the hardships, my parents have always been able to put food on the table, provide shelter, ensure education, and all other basic necessities. They have also always given me the best things that they could afford monetarily such as computers, iPhones, iPad, AirPods, etc. While growing up, they also paid for my swimming lessons and volleyball practices (although I was a little bit forced into those things).

While I was materialistically fulfilled, growing up with my Asian parents has been hard nevertheless. I have been struggling with depression since late middle school and I am still dealing with these same problems in my junior year of college. My depression is derived from many things. One of them is trying to catch up in school when you don't know the language (English) and academic pressure in general. Throughout the years, I have been very accomplished academically, but it came with a cost of little sleep and free time. In high school, for 4 years, I would get 3-4 hours of sleep every night (cannot say that it is much better in college). For two years in high school, my commute to school was 1 hour. I sometimes felt the strong urge to fall asleep at the wheel. This all became very mentally straining. I told my parents that school is hard and I am struggling to maintain the schedule. They told me that it would have been worse if I were in China, so I should be grateful to be living the life that I have now. Also, they said that their childhood is much harder than mine. That they had to bike to school and farm the fields when they got back from school, that I am just ungrateful.

My dad has an impressively short temper and gets mad at the smallest things. For example, whenever he is doing a project and can't remember where he put his pencil, he starts yelling phrases along the lines of ""I'm going to find the manufacturer and shoot all their heads off"". When I was younger I used to bite my lips and he got mad whenever I did that. He said that I look like a pig, he would cut my lips off and pour hot pepper on the wound. We also have a dog. Whenever he barks, my dad will kick him hard in the stomach or shock him using a collar. He tells me that he has never beat me yet and I should be grateful for it. To me, my dad is such a scary figure and I tense up whenever he comes near me.

My mom is insane and her reasoning for everything defies any logic. She has no achievements in life and I have no idea what she does all day. Whenever anyone proposes to do anything, she shoots it down because there is always an excuse. For example, she says that she is allergic to the sun, so we can't go outside. It's so frustrating. Also, every little thing has to go her way, or else there is a huge explosion around it. The most frustrating part is that she is not the person who is fixing it to be her way, she forces someone else to do it for her. We have trees in our backyard that she lost her mind over during the summer. She kept on complaining that we're not using the right fertilizer, but no one is forcing any kind of fertilizer. If she wants a type of fertilizer, she should just go out to buy it and plant the trees herself. But she refuses to do so. I and my dad planted the trees for her. There was also apparently a bit of oil stain (that I genuinely couldn't see) on the marble counter and she lost her mind over that as well. Every little thing must be perfect and controlled by her. There is so much more that puts me off by my mom, but it's going to take me a decade to say everything.

My parents and I live under the same roof, but we don't do anything. We don't go out because my mom is allergic to the sun. There is nothing to do at home because my mom shoots all of those down. My parents refuse to let me drive other people or let other people drive me. They also refuse to let me go anywhere that is not the grocery store, a coffee shop like Starbucks, school, or the library. Whenever I am at home for a break, I literally feel like I am suffocated by the amount of control that they put on me.

There is also not much that I can do in terms of chores. Personally, I love doing chores because I find them relaxing. However, my mom always says that I am doing something wrong. She says that she will show me how to do it, like cooking or cleaning and proceed to just do the entire thing herself.

My mom also buys all my clothes for me. There are only two articles of clothing in my closet that I explicitly said that I wanted. Otherwise, my mom just bought the clothes for me and told me to wear them afterward.

I have no privacy. My mom hates it when I close my bedroom door. All hell breaks loose when I lock a door. There was this one time when I was taking an important call and I couldn't hear the other person speaking on the phone. I went to the bathroom without locking the door. My mom followed me to the bathroom and I guess the door jammed a little bit. But when I hung up, my mom gave me the silence treatment then proceeded to yell at me for locking the door. She said that I'm hiding things from her and that I hate her because I locked the door on her. But I never locked the door. She just didn't turn the handle hard enough.

My major in college was chosen by my parents as well. It was either Computer Science or nothing. I suggested Mechanical Engineering but my parents said that it is not a major for girls and that I would hate it. I then said Electrical Engineering, which ended in a huge fight between me and my parents.

My parents have told me that there is no relationship more important than family. That friendship doesn't matter because those people just come and go.

My parents kept on belittling any hobby that I used to like as a kid. Everything that did not pertain to school was a waste of time. I love to draw and sketch, and I am very talented at it. But my parents trashed my drawings when I was young. Whenever I was not studying, they said that I should be doing that instead. Now I am 20, without any passion. I have no idea what to do during my free time. I always feel like I am the least interesting person among my friends.

My dad also does not hesitate to express how much of a burden I am to him. He always says that once I graduate college, he will finally be free and that he will never financially support me ever again. My parents always attribute the cause of their immigration to me, things like ""We left our happy lives in China for you"" or ""We are suffering now because of you. We could have avoided all of this in China"".

My parents have this incredible ability to turn any situation, no matter how positive, into a negative one like getting a job promotion.

During my junior year of high school, I was at my lowest. I told my parents that I wanted to kill myself and I cut my wrists. My parents got mad at me and said that I am an ungrateful child, what about them, what about all the money and time they have put into me. That was the end of that conversation.

It's been a couple of years since then and I am still traumatized from those experiences. Whenever I think or mention my parents or home, I start having a mental breakdown in front of people. There was one night before the winter break where I felt a surge of emotions. One of my friends had to come rushing in to take care of me. He said that I was probably suffering from a panic attack. These episodes have been coming frequently throughout the years. I just did not know that they were panic attacks because I have been dealing with them alone in my room, so no one was there to point it out to me. Over the past decade, there has been probably more days where I have cried than where I have not

I am currently home during break and I have a network of friends who are mentally supporting me for the time being. To be honest, it has not been as bad as I have expected. Most bad situations are avoided because I have spoken to my parents around 3 times within these past 2 weeks.

With college almost coming to an end, I must make a decision on what I have to do with the rest of my life. Last month, I got an interview at Facebook (it is on the west coast and I did not get the job) and told my mom that if I were to get the internship, I would consider taking the offer. My mom went completely hysterical over me saying that. When I went home for Thanksgiving break, we got into this huge fight. Most of the talking was one-sided, where my mom said that there is no world in which she would ever understand why I would leave them. That there is no one to take care of them once I am gone, that my boyfriend and his family are going to throw me out once I go there, that I will have no one in this world. The argument basically boiled down to an ultimatum: I either stay on the East Coast for my parents or I leave for the West coast and they will never talk to me ever again.

This decision has been putting quite a lot of mental strain on me. I've lost my appetite and thrown up due to stress over the past few weeks. However, I think that I am coming to the conclusion that I want to leave.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 2.5 months. While it is not long, he has encouraged me to find my passions and has taught me the most basic life necessities to take care of myself (like cooking and cleaning). He also introduced me to his family remotely and it honestly feels so cozy and much more functional. While I know that it could just seem like that on the surface and every family has their problems, he can at least hold a conversation with his parents without worrying about a huge argument coming on. I am graduating in 1.5 years while he is graduating this spring, so we will be long-distance for a bit. If this relationship can last until I almost graduate, I am considering moving in with him to the west coast.

I feel like if I stay on the east coast, I will live in servitude to my parents my entire life. I don't think I can mentally sustain it. I am suffocating with their expectations and control over me. I am so desperate for independence and making my own mistakes. The west coast has so many amazing opportunities for a computer scientist and engineer like myself. I can also see myself in a good relationship with my boyfriend in the future.

I am so tired of life. I am so tired of mind games. I am so tired of walking on eggshells. I am so tired of being told that I can't make my own decisions. I am so tired of being told that I don't actually know what is good for me. I don't know how much longer I can endure this.

However, my parents are my parents after all.

What do you think of this situation? What should I do?"

I currently have two Ap computer science classes one concentrates on python whereas another on java. I was looking at internship and job opportunities on various websites and I saw various different requirements. Some data science internships required knowledge of SQL and AWS generally cloud computing and I really don't have any experience in such fields. Do data science major give all the required knowledge in these topics? Also, can you recommend websites college students use to find internships.

Thanks :)"

I used to be interested in investment banking, so I had an intern doing IB works this summer. However, I found that programming is also interesting for me, so I'm considering shifting to software engineering/data science.

Below are the pros and cons for investment banking and software engineer:

IB:

Pros:

1. Well-paid
2. Have prior experience
3. I know how to prepare (networking + 400 questions for interview)

Cons:

1. Too much networking
2. Hard to self-learn financial knowledge

Software engineer:

Pros:

1. It matches my majors
2. Daily tasks are simpler (only need to finish what’s been told)
3. More options in the future

Cons:

1. No prior internship experience
2. Don’t how to prepare for the interview

Also, if my ultimate goal is to be a trader at a hedge fund, which path is better (IB/CS)?

Thanks!"

My university course goes for 5 years. My course entails the typical 3 years of education, plus two 6 month (full time) internships, plus a year of honours study. 

I am confused as the first of these 6-month internships (full time) is supposed to span for the second half of 2022. Keep in mind I started this course at the beginning of 2021 so it has only been a year of inter-curricular study. 

From every job posting, I have been able to see, hiring for interns is targeted toward new grads or people in their penultimate year. Is this a case of employers marketing for the best but still accepting some applicants who don't meet this specific criteria or...?

**This question also applies to finding part-time or full-time work to do while studying at uni.**

I have an interview coming up for a Junior data engineer at IKEA. They have a data engineer accelerator program (see link below) and I have an interview coming up with their head of data. My background is quantitative finance (in the process of finishing my masters) and they know this, but I have decent python skills. I have an interview coming up and they asked me to show a project I worked on (I will be showing a script I wrote for my current internship which automated the requesting, via excel, and retrieval of data via ftp from a large financial data provider). What should I do to prepare for the technical questions? What kind of questions can I expect. Should I build something else from scratch to show them? If so, what?

Your assistance would be much appreciated! This is a big opportunity for me and I want to nail it!

I got the job, I’d be starting January the 9th, but they asked me to get a clearance from my previous job (a statement that says I’m no longer working with them). I ended my internship the month I interviewed with them (July 2021).

A little background. I have been in IT for a little over 2 years. 1 year as intern, 2nd year as Sys Admin. While being young in my IT career one of the most important things to me is career growth. My short term goal (5 years) is to shift to a Cyber Security role. I've been passively (mainly due to the holidays) studying for the OSCP but plan to ramp up after the new year. I already have Net+ and SSCP.

My current role as a Sys Admin is great. Work environment is amazing with a great mentor. However, my issue is the lack of growth opportunities. There is no internal security team to transition to, very little vertical movement to be had. The only growth opportunities is a change in title (System Admin -&gt; Sr. System Admin) but all our Sys Admins work on the same issues so the work would, for the most part, remain the same but my title could potentially change. Also, we don't have any cloud (Azure, AWS) presence so I feel that I am being left behind in that aspect.

I have an offer for a SOC Analyst 1 role. The offer is \~11% increase and has opportunity for career advancement. 

Would this be a good move for me? I understand that the SOC Analyst 1 role can be repetitive and mundane but it would be a stepping stone. Thoughts??"

rrfoie,282,2021-12-29,Predecessor?! - Part 1: The hiring,Chilled_IT,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/rrfoie/predecessor_part_1_the_hiring/,"This story will take you along with me through one of my craziest adventures in this field. Usually I wouldn't include the process of getting the job into a story, but here it is necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

As I was working for my previous employer, I had moved out of the city and into one of the most beautiful countrysides in this country, which caused me to drive 2.5 hours per day to get to work and back. Since it was right when the pandemic started, I thought this was the right timing to do the move as I could just work from home. Wrong! Boss wanted me to drive to work nontheless. I found that weird as I was the only employee raking in any profit for the small company. The rest was an intern, one in finance and that's it. So the support I provided to all our customers was our biggest income. Soooo I started looking for a job elsewhere because of this and other reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

I changed my status in one of those websites, where you can get recruited, to ""looking for an opportunity"". After a day my inbox was getting swarmed and I started to sort through the vacancies. One job caught my eye in particular. IT-company of a multi-billion holding, production sites all over the world, looking for a sysadmin in this beautiful but remote countryside. So I declared my curiosity and we got to talk.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first phone-call, I talked to the head of the IT-department. He told me the production sites in my area were getting bigger and bigger and could no longer be supported remotely from HQ which is a several hours drive away. He explained how this holding is structured, what we produce and how those things are later on processed/used by our customers, as we are also producing some kind of fabric among many many other things. He mentioned that every new worker can choose the brand of their company cell phone and laptop. The rest was normal chit-chat, getting a feeling of one another and we end the call agreeing to talk to each other again, but that time with one more person in the call.

&amp;#x200B;

During the second call, the other person in the call was someone who set up all the infrastructure decades ago and is still providing external support to the holding. This call was divided into 2 parts. First part was him explaining the whole structure to me and how all of it is connected, redundancies, backups, company-guidelines for hardware/software and much more. The second part was a test of my knowledge and procedures as I was being given potential scenarios and what I think the causes of those would be and how I'd go about solving the issues. Both parts took over an hour. As exhausting as this was, they seemed pleased and wanted to see me in person.

&amp;#x200B;

During that meeting there were 3 people present:

\- The CEO of the company (not of the holding!) where I would have my office at

\- The head of IT that I talked to during those 2 phone calls

\- The CIO of the holding and thus the boss of the head of IT

&amp;#x200B;

Again the conversation went great, we started talking about certain off-topic subjects and it turned out the CIO is a big anime-nerd like I am (met my wife at an anime forum) and his wife is Japanese. After talking about $$$ and seemingly found a number we both agreed upon, we take a tour through the factory. For someone like me who had only worked at small businesses before, this was huge. Really really huge. The main site is 35,000m² or about 377000 square feet, and I was told that the other 3 sites in that vicinity that I would potentially also be in charge of, would raise that to about 130,000m² or about 1.4 million square feet. Those other 3 sites are about half an hour drive away from the main site. We returned to the conference room and had some parting words as both sides declared ongoing interest. They mentioned they would meet the only other person still in the race in 2 days and then make their decision.

&amp;#x200B;

2 days later I get the call that they want me. I quit my job and signed the new contract. I had some weeks off inbetween my last day at the previous job and the start of the new one, so I could relax a bit, though I was clearly nervous. I used the time to decide which phone and laptop I want and sent that to my boss, but he somewhat evaded that topic, saying we can discuss that on my first day. Made me slightly suspicious.

&amp;#x200B;

So it was time, my first day at that new job, filled up with coffee and anxiety, I appeared at the gates and am welcomed by my boss and we went to the company's HR department .

(Note: This is NOT my HR, as this HR only handles issues of their workers. As someone employed by the IT-company that provides support to all other companies inside the holding, my HR is actually at HQ.)

The head of HR gave me a cellphone, some papers I should sign that I received certain items and points at laptop-case, saying that those belonged to my predecessor....uhm....my what?!...what????

Before I could recover from this shock she had to take an important phone call. I looked over to my boss who wouldn't make any eye-contact, knowing how I must feel and he seemed extremely embarrassed about this situation. As I was sitting there, head of HR still on the phone, I was contemplating what I should do. Just leave without a comment?! Understandable, yes. Reasonable, no, as I still had to pay my bills. Voice my anger/disappointment? Again understandable, but not reasonable as what good would that have done? As my thoughts were getting more and more structured after the initial shock, I decided to say nothing. I didn't know why they lied to me, but nothing I could have done seemed like it would have improved the already embarrassing and tense atmosphere. I decided to look for a different job while giving them a chance to redeem themselves with a good explanation which I would be slowly but surely be pushing for.

&amp;#x200B;

\*Spoiler alert\* I didn't need to wait long. ~~I will include the link to part 2 once I get the time to write it. Sadly with the recent cyber attacks towards our holding and the whole log4j-issue, I'm pretty much drowning in work. Part 2 will include why I was lied to and other iconic moments of him.~~

I  am currently a recent grad who is interested in finance, but discovered  this interest pretty late into college.  I am willing to self teach fundamental finance concepts and aiming to apply to entry level finance jobs. Here are some questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

\- What is the best possible starting point for me before pursuing a career in finance?

\- What kind of experience should I pursue? (I am open to MBA or MSF, but only after gaining entry level finance experience).

\- What kind of finance related careers can utilize a BS in Chemistry?

\- Is it even possible at this point if my internships/resume don't really relate to finance?

&amp;#x200B;

Below is a summary of my resume/skills:

\- B.S. of Chemistry (GPA: 3.9) from \~t50 school

\- Basic undergraduate biochem research for two summers

\- A couple internships for clinical related research

\- Hundreds of volunteer service hours in hospital and other organizations.

\- Leadership and management of a couple uni clubs

\- NO STRICT FINANCIAL EXPERIENCE/INTERNSHIPS

Transferable Skills (?)

\- Utilized Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint (and G Suite Equivalents) constantly throughout 4 years (not expert level though, probably more approx intermediate level).

\- Novice experience in IBM SPSS and R (am willing to learn python and SQL on my own time)

\- Strong interpersonal and leadership skills (demonstrated by club involvement and ECs; would consider myself somewhat extroverted if that matters at all)

\- Strong experience in creating laboratory reports and researching literature, interpreting scientific data (this was basically what I spent 7 semesters doing full time. don't know how transferable this is)

\-  Kind of strong presenting/public speaking skills (have done public speaking for club meetings and events + presenting projects for coursework. I would consider myself pretty comfortable presenting in front of people).

&amp;#x200B;

I am not even sure where to start regarding this transition. Personally, I'm interested in data analytics and even programming (which I am willing to self teach). But I feel like I've doomed myself by not gaining any kind of relevant internships or coursework related to finance. I know for sure I do not want to work in a lab though.

Though, the part from lab work that I did heavily enjoy was the data/stats/math part of it. I frankly loved using Excel to analyze data.

I am planning to learn the basics with a couple of intro to finance textbooks and Khan Academy. I'm even planning to learn python and hopefully get involved with some basic data entry with a current research internship I have atm.

I don't really want to go straight to a MBA or MSF program after undergrad though.  I would prefer to have an entry level finance job and then pursuing a masters after a few years of experience. 

Is this idea even possible? Can a BS in Chem be valued in finance? Do you have any other career paths you would recommend? I'm kind of at a road block in my life rn. 

Thanks so much!"

* My school makes it very hard to take AP classes-they require that you take the normal class and then take the AP. I also go to a Tech school for half a day, and they don't offer as many AP classes, but I have to take the computer science classes and AP Physics there because they aren't offered at my normal public school. Due to my school being small, and people's lack of interest in taking APs, most ap classes are only offered one class period, 2nd semester, which can make it insanely hard to fit in your schedule, especially if you want to take 2 APs, but they both happen to be offered at the same class time.
* Senior Year Course Load: My school does 1hr 30 min class-blocks each semester, which means four classes each semester
* Current classes: 1st semester: Internship at local tech company half day, 2nd half of the day accelerated Physics C and PLTW Cybersecurity, 2nd semester: health, AP Calc BC, AP Physics C Mechanics (school doesn't offer E&amp;M-disappointing), DE English

**Letters of Recommendation**

Computer Science teacher- (10/10), I had her sophomore and junior year for AP CS classes (ironic because she knows nothing CS and cannot code); she did robotics, cyber patriot, and worked with me at a tech company over the summer, she showed me the letter before she submitted it and I was shocked, it was also the first time that I had seen her write in complete sentences

Design and photography teacher (7/10)- I wrote a letter asking her to write me a letter, and she repeated what I wanted to do, I also think she only spelled my name wrong once or twice

Guidance Counselor (0/10)- I got mad my sophomore year of high school and walked out of a math class because the class was easy and my teacher refused to let me answer any questions, and then would go over everything over and over again, this ended with me going to the counselor and telling her I wanted to drop out of school, which in turn made her mad, the counselor also would get frustrated because I would ask to take AP classes and then want her to help me fit as many as possible in my schedule but apparently, her job is to ensure that I only take easy classes, anyway I really cannot imagine that she had anything positive to say about me

**Interviews**

MIT interview- It went okay, the interview started late and during that time my anxiety was building up and I got pretty nervous, I talked about coding and building a supercomputer and I think she was impressed, she was quickly unimpressed when she asked me about AP classes and I said I'm only taking five and seemed disappointed that AP Calc BC is the highest math class I'm taking (it's also the highest math class my school offers, and out of the three schools in the county, it's the only school that offers ANY AP math Calc classes), she asked a lot about COVID and I was virtual during that time, I talked about having to take a DE Chem test at a Panera because my house didn't have wifi-interviewer seemed to enjoy that

UMBC interview- so this was interesting, normally they don't do interviews, but I had an interview with the head IT person because my personal statement was about hacking and that seemed to concern them, overall it was pretty much just as an advertisement for the college, but the IT person seemed to think I would be a good fit for working in their IT department, which was weird to me, it sorta seemed like he was trying to hire me

**Essays**

Personal statement(4/10)- I wrote about how I got in trouble for hacking and now I do cybersecurity, it was original, but I honestly think I should have written about something else

Why this college? (8/10)-I wrote something pretty specific for each college related to their CS program, on one of them I wrote a little too much about my code and how I could improve a project (oops)

What do I like to do for fun? (9/10)-talked about dumpster diving and fixing computers

It seems like I wrote a ton about why I was passionate about CS or why I wanted to major in it (9/10)- I talked about how I like Tesla and want to work for them one day as a software developer

Diversity questions (0.001/10)- People tell me that ""oh you're a girl in a male-dominated field, write about that"", no. my gender doesn't affect my ability, Is it awkward to be the only girl in a CS class? Yes. Does it define who I am? No.

I submitted a maker portfolio to MIT- I showed my Face ID code, robot, and some machine learning code I wrote for self-driving cars (nothing particularly impressive)

Family/world I came from(5/10)- talked about how I came from a family of commercial fishermen, what it felt like to be out on the water at sunrise, and how my Dad inspired my work ethic (honestly I hate having to get up in the morning to check gill nets and fishing, but I made it seem like I wanted to do and it wasn't a chore)

I also submitted links to my Github and google sites page whenever I got a chance. My stats might suck, but here's some code!

I also probably should have refrained from talking about illegal activities like hacking and dumpster diving, but maybe it made me stand out?

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* Salisbury University RD(I think I got like 20k+ in scholarships so far, still planning on applying for more)
* UMBC: University of Maryland, Baltimore County (So far 15k+ in scholarships, I applied for some CS program scholarship that if I get I'll probably go there.)
* University of Maryland-got into the college of Letters and Science, not for Computer Science, kinda unfortunate but I guess I can transfer it
* Northeastern- NU Bound Program that I cannot afford, surprised that I got in and for this program considering that I put I didn't want to study abroad on my app
* Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (I got the Rensselear Medal, which was a sweet scholarship, I'm definitely considering)-aid came in clutch
* William &amp; Mary 

*Rejections:*

* Massachusetts Institute of Technology- Of course, it had to be my top pick, but maybe I'll be a janitor there and solve some complex proofs. A little disappointed, but I got bubble tea afterward and that made the majority of the pain go away.
* Caltech- probably good bc there's no way my parents are letting me good to California
* Cornell University 
* Johns Hopkins-kinda sucks, I wish I would have done ED but no I wanted to get into one of the most selective colleges instead

*Waitlisted:*

* Virginia Tech-okay so somehow I was the only person in my AP Physics class who didn't get in here? I'm boycotting. But I did accept my spot on the waitlist.
* Georgia Tech
* Carnegie Mellon University-really want to go here now for some reason, hoping I can manifest my way off the waitlist 

**Additional Information:**

I've just done what I loved and followed my dreams. I really like coding and computers, and just want to write code that helps people. I'm hoping that it works out for me. Sorry for the run-on sentences, ending sentences with prepositions, inconsistent capitalization, and everything I wrote."

I'm interested in pursuing a career in Computer Science, but currently at a bit of a crossroads. I would appreciate any and all feedback. 

I'm a high school senior who's on the tail end of college applications. I've been accepted into Harvard, but my dream school is Stanford. Amazing CS department with warm weather --  what more could I want? 

I'm applying to many scholarships, and I have no idea which ones I'll get *except* I have a pretty good feeling about one: The Stokes Educational Scholarship Program (I'm a semi-finalist and I already work with the Agency via a High School Work Study Program, so I don't think they'd reject me? I also do well with HireVue interviews, so I'm feeling pretty confident).

My family would have to pay 20k-30k without scholarships at one of these colleges, but if I got Stokes, it would totally pay my tuition all four years AND I'd receive a year-round salary.

Sounds like a pretty good deal, but I do have some apprehension. I'd be required to work for the NSA for 12 weeks every summer. I don't know if the summers are part-time or full-time, but if they're full-time (which I think they'll probably be), doesn't that mean I won't be able to do any other internships that I'm interested in? Internships that will probably give me much better experience? (I doubt I'd be able to maintain good grades and an internship if I did one during the school year).

I'm also required to work with the Agency for 1.5x the length of time it takes me to graduate AFTER graduation, which would probably be 6 years. (yikes!) That seems like a long time! I'd be 28. (And I'd rather not stay at my current location, but they might not let me transfer to another Agency center...even worse). If I leave early, I'll have to pay them back some tuition.

I hate, hate, HATE the idea of debt so this is an amazing opportunity. Receive an excellent education, not only debt free, but while receiving a stipend. But I'm essentially giving away my summers to them, having to pass up on other opportunities, and stuck with them for integral years after graduation.

My final worry is that the resume process for NSA employees SUCK. You basically can't mention anything you did in the NSA to outside employers because it's classified (I know from experience...my job description for college applications was bare bones and extremely lacking all vital information), and I'll have basically no meaningful internship experience under my belt. When I try to leave after the 6 years, will I even be able to find a job? If I get other scholarships, I'd obviously take those, but if Stokes is my only offer, should I even take it? I've read through a few threads on here about private vs public sector, and I think I'd love public a lot more...

PLEASE HELP

Thank you in advance!"
rrrdq7,4,2021-12-29,Advice on what to expect/how to act for first internship,dcfan105,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/rrrdq7/advice_on_what_to_expecthow_to_act_for_first/,"So I start a firmware test engineering co-op next week on January 4th.  I'm excited, as it's a subject I'm quite interested in and the manager who interviewed me, who will also be my boss seemed really nice and he was eager to hire me after hearing how enthusiastic I was about circuits, logic design, and programming.  I'm also nervous though, as this'll he my first internship and I'm not really sure what to expect in terms of on the job learning.  I was told I'll be assisting a senior engineer on my boss's team, who I presume will also be my mentor and that I'll be doing about 40% programming and 60% hardware stuff (I think primarily circuit testing using a function generator and oscilloscope, because he specifically asked in the interview if I had experience with an oscilloscope, but I'm not sure).  I'll also only be in the office sometimes, as it sounds like I'll be working remotely about half the time.  

Any advice?  I'm not so concerned about the actual learning itself, but just how to act as an intern in terms of when to ask questions, when to speak up if I have an idea, how much time to take trying to figure out stuff on my own before asking for help, etc.  

They said they treat interns as regular employees, but every company I interviewed with said that; is that actually true in practice of most engineering internships?  

I guess I'm just afraid I'll waste everyone's time because I won't know what I'm doing.  I mean, I know intellectually that interns aren't expected to come in already knowing everything and and I was perfectly honest with the manager about the knowledge and experience I have from my classes, but I'm still nervous it'll take me too long to figure stuff.  I guess a good question is, as an intern, how much of my time am I expected to spend researching and reading to teach myself relevant concepts and how much time actually doing work that benefits the company?  With school, I'm paying them so I do what most benefits me, but I'm for the internship getting paid and pretty good pay too, so it feels awkward."

i’m currently a senior in college studying cs. i just received an offer from a company for $100k/year in a new grad position that’s based near Silicon Valley, CA. i would need to relocate for this job because they want me to be onsite. (they said remote for now due to covid but i’d be afraid of not being near the site in case covid miraculously disappears).

im also currently working at a smaller startup as an intern. they have verbally offered to bring me on full time after graduation (however this hasn’t been put into writing yet as it was mentioned sort of in-passing and no salary was mentioned). with this company i wouldn’t need to relocate. 


i do have a few questions about all this:

1. could i accept the Silicon Valley offer now, continue interviewing with other companies, then accept an offer from one of the other companies and then rescind my acceptance from san jose?

2. should i even consider taking a chance with the small startup in a full time role (if the salary is similar to the san jose offer)? they already have paying customers and i do believe in their product. i also really enjoy working with their team

3. what are your initial thoughts on this? am i insane for not immediately wanting to accept the silicon valley offer? i feel a little weird accepting the Silicon Valley offer so early and not knowing how other potential interviews could go, and i’d be a little weary of having to move and having to live in an expensive place on $100k. i also don’t want to leave the startup “behind” (so to speak) by going with the Silicon Valley company since i do really like being a part of their team and who knows, they could take off majorly next year for all i know.

i do apologize in advance if i left out any important info; this is my first post here :) i do appreciate any and all replies so thank you in advance!!"

Precise question at the bottom above P.S

Background I am currently a final year student(M21) of Engineering in Computer Science in India. I have been a coding for past 6 years and currently work as a web developer in a startup. I have always been interested in finance and math is a strong point of mine.

My father is a stock trader so i am always surrounded by financial news and I also started trading in 2019.

Dilemma is I am planning a career shift from engineering to finance as I don't see myself as professional developer in coming 5-7 years. Although I am technically strong, I only like to think of it as a skill and not a future career. I hope some of you can relate.

I am learning about financial markets and portfolio management from coursera but I have realized I am still weak fundamentally.

I also tried preparing for CFA but quit very early after realizing the lack of scope without a masters degree for it in my country. So now i am planning for masters as well.

So my question is which route shall i take considering my engineering background to shift to finance? Masters (Msc Finance or MBA or some other degree) or should i look for ways to clear my fundamentals by myself and start hunting for internships.

P.S - Internships without degree is difficult in my country(India). For masters I can afford to explore global options. My mom's family is from Germany so that's a valid option although I personally prefer UK."

Here are the questions I have:

1) with my background, is APEX easy or difficult to pick up on?

2) from the interview they understood I didn't know a thing about APEX and thought that was fine, so are they expecting me to learn it before the internship or pick up on it when it starts? Idk if they want me to learn it from them the way they want me to know it? Or would they expect me to come in and hit the ground running? I'm trying to gauge their expectations, so maybe people with similar experiences would know? I'd ask the team, but they're on Christmas break.

3) For learning APEX, where should I start? Any recommendations or good resources? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks"

I've been very priveledged so far and have not had to work this much during school before, so I'm really nervous about completing 16 credit hours and working 20 hours on top of it.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m just writing here to share my thoughts, and hopefully, you can help me out a bit with your comments on what I should do with my life. I know that it is only my decision since it’s my life. Still, I wanna hear your opinion. So, feel free to share it in the comment section below.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that many of you work hard enough to achieve something in their life, especially to build up their career, and now I’m going to just blow off some nonsense in your face. The thing is that I have worked for one company for more than 10 years already. I started as an intern and got lucky when they offered me a contract. I was thrilled that they accepted me because I really worked hard. I spent a lot of sleepless nights in the office, even though it’s rare for an internship.

&amp;#x200B;

Apart from that, my parents insisted on studying finance and accounting. I did pretty well on my finals. But, on the opposite side of the coin, I never had friends at college since I spent the entire time studying in the library, like a typical nerd. While my roommate either was going to different parties or hosted them in our dorm. The last one is actually the reason I’ve spent so many nights sleeping in the library and hugging my textbooks or practicing calculus. Besides, my parents really encouraged me to become an overachiever. So, also that is another reason why I didn’t go party with the rest.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I’ve got sick from that life. I barely don’t even have a life. I don’t have friends, not even talking about family. I spent most of the time working in the company, where I was an intern. I saved some money, not like I’m filthy rich. Still, I wanna resign from my job and travel for a while and see the world. Besides, now it seems more possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Another issue is that I don’t wanna return back to my job. It’s kinda become my comfort zone. Also, I’m not sure how to write a letter of resignation. Surprisingly, I’ve never done it in my entire life. I found a few tips on writing a [letter of resignation](https://jobsandcareer.tips/letter-of-resignation-the-definitive-guide/). But I just dunno how to inform them that I would like to come back in a year or two? Can you suggest me something?"

I had no luck this sem in getting a summer internship in SDE role. Mostly I get a coding round(if Im not rejected beforehand which is 90% of time) it is usually one or two months after application. And the reject of that's round even took one or two months.

 Many of my classmates say that getting an internship is harder than getting a full time.

Is it true and how is that so? Does full time application screening process also take the same time as internship roles?

Thank you!"
rs7zvu,19,2021-12-30,My current boss thinks I'm being ridiculous for leaving for a new job offer,Spirited_Pianist_817,work,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/rs7zvu/my_current_boss_thinks_im_being_ridiculous_for/,"I  am a 2020 graduate in bachelors of business administration (specialized in Finance), after a friend recommended I applied to the company he works in for a junior level permanent position in the finance department and got hired as an Intern instead due to lack of experience.
I have worked there for exactly three weeks. The work load is tough due to a shortage of people in the department however it's interesting enough, I am learning technical skills so that's good.
 The pay is very minimal as it's an internship however the department is good (costing and budgeting)
I had applied to another company (one of the biggest private hospitals in my country) while job searching before I got this position,  for a healthcare innovation fellowship and I just received an offer from them today. The pay is alot better with benefits and it's a lucrative field in innovation and healthcare management (the first of it's kind in my country I feel).
I told my boss (HOD) that I have received the offer and I would like to go for it hence quit my internship.
He is trying to convince me that it has nothing to do with what I've studied or will study and it's not adding anything to my career. 

I know he's mainly saying that as the department really is understaffed, however it's making me waiver. Truthfully I don't know much about the fellowships actual responsibilities however since it's so new that is a given

Should I just quit as planned? Or should I give it another thought? Am I being selfish for quitting?"
rs83d4,1,2021-12-30,I think I really like a much older woman. Does this ever work out?,zinbra,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/rs83d4/i_think_i_really_like_a_much_older_woman_does/,"I (m27) work in logistics at a trucking company. Not an amazing career by international standards -- I'm not wearing a suit and tie and getting months of paid leave on a whim or anything -- but I make good money for the area, own a home, have paid off all my student loans, am on track for a good retirement in my 50s, etc. so I think I'm doing pretty good. I'm also an autistic literature nerd and I basically get paid $90k/yr to sit in an office and read books so that is really nice.

However, I am not doing awesome on the relationship end of life. I had a college GF I was very close to, but I went abroad to study for a year and in summary we kind of had miscommunication regarding it: she said it was OK and seemed happy for me, but she was actually quite resentful and upset and our relationship never recovered. I also accepted an internship -- the stay was supposed to be 7 months but I made it 13 and she said that was me betraying her. I understand in retrospect but I just never read the situation properly. I stayed with her 2 years after I returned but things were just never the same and we broke it off when I was 23.

No real relationship since. I have seen some girls, but nothing ever sticks. I am a tiny bit socially awkward and have always gotten along with people who are older. I still have college professors whom I go out for drinks with/visit at their homes...but have lost basically all of my contemporary friends. I really don't know why I'm like this but I feel more intimidated/offput by people my age or something.

**Well, here's what I come here for!:**

I have met a woman I like and I THINK she likes me. The problem(potentially) is that she is 49 years old. Just a few years younger than my mother. 22 years older than me. I know this is unusual, but I feel like I am old enough to admit I like the personalities of the generation before me. Is this too much of a difference? She has a son that is only 5 years younger than I am...

I met her through work, but we have seen each other at several events around town. Somehow I always end up talking to her. Her husband died several years ago while working. She's very upbeat and wise and I always feel great talking to her. My town is really small and has gatherings on the town square. I live close(maybe the closest house in town) so I always walk over to see when things happen and at least 3 times this year I have sparked a conversation with her that would last a very long time. I recently asked her if she wanted to get coffee to talk about something related to an interest of mine(niche local history, she was once a curator for the county museum and had a lot to say about it). 

That went amazingly. We talked for like 3 hours including leaving the coffee shop and walking around the nearby park. It felt like a date: but again she is 49 years old and I am 27 years old. What are the odds she sees this as I do? My town is small and kind of sucks, but she was a real highlight of my 2021. I don't want to risk not being able to talk to her so freely in the future, but I would also like to communicate that I like her. Is this too outrageous with the age difference?"
rs94zc,0,2021-12-30,It’s been 2 years and I’m still hurt,CinnaMANtoast,antiwork,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rs94zc/its_been_2_years_and_im_still_hurt/,"First off, obligatory “I’m on mobile” so please have mercy on me.

I worked for my Alma mater’s food provider doing photography and videography.  It filled my degree’s internship credit requirement as well as paying me more than my intramural volleyball job, plus I was getting more hours and they were during the day rather than losing my nights.  It genuinely start out like the gig of my dreams, but it turned into a nightmare after a year.

I started my senior year of college and after not getting any job, I asked if I could extend my internship with them as well as get a raise.  To my surprise, I actually got a raise from $9.50/hr to $11/hr if I can recall correctly.  I even got to go to LA for a creative conference that was paid for.  Again, sounds pretty great, right?  WRONG.

At this point, I started realizing I was well below the poverty line.  I had been asking for a few months if I could switch to full time.  I was nearing a year after graduating and I still wasn’t allowed more than 30 hrs a week, benefits, or full time hourly pay like my coworkers were getting.  I constantly brought up what I was bringing to the table, how I’ve improved our quality of our social media, and other facts that were heavily favorable for my argument.  I was constantly hearing “that’s not how we measure these things” blah blah blah.

Fast forward a few months and covid hits.  I’m “asked” if I can take a cut in my hours, I told them I’d prefer not since I don’t make enough as is but I wasn’t truly asked, they were telling me.  I went from struggling to now I wasn’t eating most weekends.  My job allowed me a free meal on campus every work day because I would work the required amount of hours.  I would tell me boss I couldn’t handle this and needed full time pay to make up for my loss of hours and was met with excuses galore.  Constantly being told that he either was trying or it wasn’t how things worked in the business.

During this time, my boss had a major flip.  I swear he was borderline bipolar as he genuinely would flip from being awesome to miserable.  Some days, I feel like I could get away with anything, other days I feel like I have to avoid eye contact so I don’t get in trouble for the smallest of things.  There was no in between and no telling what the day would bring.

The tipping point was during the last summer I worked there.  I couldn’t handle the depression, I was miserable and genuinely considering ending it because I saw no light.  Capitalism failed me, miserably.  I did everything I was supposed to do for a successful life and this is what I ended up in?  The only place that was open for food on campus was a Chick-fil-A, and if you ever hear someone tell you that they can eat CFA every day for their life… take it from me, no they cannot.

I had a heart to heart with my boss and told him my situation, at this point I was practically begging for something.  I was only eating that CFA every day, during the weekends I might be able to make some spaghetti or Mac and cheese to last me.  When I was denied, it was my breaking point that helped me sober up.  He didn’t care, this company didn’t care, and no matter how much my coworkers fought for me, nothing was changing.  I told him right then and there I was going to look for a new job and that I couldn’t believe how I was being treated.

I was way too communicative with them, I still gave a 2 weeks notice because I thought I had to.  The cherry on top was that I was told I have to do a month’s worth of work within 2 weeks AND they were offering full time with benefits for my position.  They said I could apply for the position if I wanted to, but I said I did for the last year.

I wasn’t offered an exit interview even though I was wanting one, so I didn’t get to tell anyone how miserable my life was and how my boss should no longer be in management.  Even though my boss was awful, I still thought we were in good terms.  I offered to sell him my PC once I built what I have now.  He was genuinely excited and told me to hit him up when it came time.  I called him twice, left messages, and texted him.  Ended up selling it to my coworker and his wife who have been using to life crazy and loving it.

Anyways, I’m honestly still hurt.  He ended up leaving a couple months afterwards after screwing over my coworker to go work at his cushy job.  He stunted my coworker from getting his position because she “wasn’t well equipped enough” even though she was more qualified than anyone, especially who’s in the position now.  I can’t believe someone could be so upset their own that you genuinely could look someone in the eyes and say that he’s not doing anything.  I’m not asking for anything malicious, but he doesn’t deserve his job after how he did me and my coworker so dirty and he couldn’t have cared less.  I wish I could find his supervisor and let them know everything he had done to me.  I doubt it would really affect him all that much but at least they’d know."

Me and my GF are a couple from Brazil just out of university and without formal work experience (only internships) thinking of moving abroad. We've both done pretty well at our internships, but the offers for our first jobs are mediocre at best and Brazil is heading to a high inflation setting that we'd like to avoid. 

Some main points to consider:
1. I have Portuguese dual citizenship (she doesn't yet)
2. I've got a side hustle in software dev for the past 2 years where I make ~2kUSD/mo remotely, but its unreliable and I'd like to find work quick in whatever country we go. 
3. I dont have a cs degree and, apart from my thesis in AI, I don't have anything to show as portfolio (also I feel like my knowledge is limited due to lack of formal studies, but I'm working on it)
4. We have around 100kEUR in equities that we built over the years.
5. We'd like to live in a safe place with good economy, where we could settle and plan our lives.

Which countries should we consider? Should we go for bachelors/masters or wait a bit longer so we have formal work experience?

Although I enjoy the projects and internships I've done in CS, my true passion is in the realm of education. Most people think of teachers or professors when they think of education, but I'm interested in a more administrative/analytic role. My goal is to increase high school graduation rates by making sure that schools are implementing curriculum and practices that keep students engaged and interested. To do this, I'd love to collect and analyze real student data to see which groups are struggling, why this is the case, and implement better curriculum and practices to help these student populations be engaged and stay in school.

At this point, I'm pretty deep into the Computer Science track.

rscgow,3,2021-12-30,Should I try and study abroad or study in my homeland and try to apply abroad after graduation?,z1xto,cscareerquestionsEU,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/rscgow/should_i_try_and_study_abroad_or_study_in_my/,"Hi everyone,

soon enough I will have to start applying for universities(CS bachelors) . Overall I know I'd love to work in better quality countries in the future. I can't decide what would be the better way in my place:

1. Study in my native country, and try to apply abroad after graduation.
2. Try and study in universities abroad.

In the first situation, I would have free accommodation, as I wouldn't need to worry about money for housing. But on the other hand, it would be harder to situate abroad after graduation.

In the second situation, I would have to get some kind of job to afford accommodation and I'm not sure if I would get one. On the other hand, I would possibly get a chance to intern in those countries, and it would be easier to get jobs there later.

As I'm a EU citizen, I should have free education in many EU countries. 

Countries I'd like to work in include: Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland.

Not including my national language, I can speak English, Russian. 

Perhaps someone was in a similar situation? What would you think would be a better choice in my situation?"

Im kind of stuck on the degree I want to get. Im staying with the same area of study though in Computer Science.

I finished my first semester with over 100% in all my classes. I am doing all my Gen Ed classes at a community College until fall next year which I will be transferring to university so I can get my minor in Japanese and study abroad (hopefully if covid doesn't screw anything up).

Thing is though, im not math savvy or no where near as smart enough to pass Calculus 2, which is a requirement for the Bachelors of Science in CS. I also don't know what specific CS job I want and I heard a Bachelors of Arts in CS is great if you don't know what you want to do for a career in CS.

And of course the Bachelors of Science in CS is a part of STEM and your pretty much guaranteed a job and paid internship. For the university I will be transferring to, 98% of those in BS in CS have a job after graduating, while 94% of those in BA in CS have a job after graduating. The starting and overall pay for a BS in CS is better than BA in CS.

So I've been thinking of changing my degree from a Bachelors of Science to a Bachelors of Arts. Is that in any way a bad idea besides being a slightly less possibility of getting a job or better pay?"

Anyways:

i wanna do bioinformatics and i've heard that a 
cmput sci major with a biol minor is the best best, however i like biol so i was considering a double major instead. could anyone lend me their mind and lemme know if pursuing a cmput/bio double major is a good idea? i was thinking i could possibly take advantage of my school's bio research classes during the school year + cmput sci internships (or bioinfo internships if they exist at the time) over the summer?

i'd like to think that the double major with experience opens up different avenues other than bioinformatics. i'd love to focus on cell biology in my biology major, and software for the cmput side. if this is false, could anyone let me know?

my school also offers a cell biology degree (different from the biology major) with my options as computer sci classes, and i'd love to do it but i feel like that'd be useless once i graduate.

lastly, does anyone know what types of courses courses would be best to take to pursue bioinformatics? I might take algorithms and database management for starters? Dunno. Anyways, like what focuses of computer science classes and biology classes? I’d love any suggestions but I also have two specific questions:

- are cell biology and software based classes generally the best too? since i was considering focusing on those
- how far should I go into chemistry? Should I do some biochem classes? They’d require me to take about four chem classes (two general, two organic) and then biochem. I don’t know how much to take and the biochem class prereqs are a lot so I dunno 🤷‍♂️

Sorry if these questions are a lot or confusing, im typing on my phone and I go through a lot of degree crisis’ but I tend to stick around the bio/bioinfo area lol!

If anyone has any other career suggestions or specific types of bioinfo suggestions, my interests are cell bio, neuropsych, anatomy, poli sci and bioanthropology.

* BS + MS in Chemistry with a minor in Math. Master's thesis project was in computational chemistry.
* 1 internship in embedded software development
* CS coursework so far: Data structures (C++), Algorithms (C++), Computer Architecture and Organization (Java, assembly), Computer Networks (python), Operating Systems (C, C++).
* Various side projects in different areas using different languages and tools. Nothing too impressive (web scraper using python libraries, hangman app using HTML/CSS/JS, small C++ scripts for work, etc.).

In the meantime, I'm working on another project that will tie together some embedded C programming with some higher-level Python stuff on the back-end. This will probably be my most involved side project, and the one I will be most proud of.

This dog is a White Flat-Coated Retriever and weights about 60lbs and is about the age of 7. I have fed her with my other 4 dogs and have made sure she is in good health while still trying to find her owners or possibly find her a new place/contact an animal shelter.

This morning, I got a notice from one of our neighbors across the street and it reads:

""If you don't get rid of the dog, I will personally get my shotgun and remake Lassie"" I am really appaulled at the end of that sentence, but even with that, when I came back from work, I found another notice taped to my mailbox with another warning.

So I try to call his bluff, and leave him a notice (I did not tape the notice to his mailbox, I just had it as a regular letter).

I wanted to get some different perspectives on an issue I had that’s really been strange to navigate.

Background on me: I’m a coding bootcamp graduate with no degree at all. When I decided to get into software engineering, I figured bootcamp was a good route as it was a lot faster than college. And although the schooling was a lot faster, the road to full time employment was a different story as I haven’t had a full time SWE job for over 2 years (barring some internships I was lucky enough to get).

I think over time too I started to feel pretty “naked” without a degree and this past semester I finished my first session of college ever! After going so long without a job I figured working towards a degree would be a really good idea. I don’t know why I was never able to get an offer, but I did okay on behavioral and technical portions. I was never perfect, but I did okay on them.

I’m not a “rockstar coder”, I’m not the smartest person in the room, and I usually have to work harder than others, but I really enjoy computer science and working as a SWE, and I can see myself in a career in tech.

So if I go pursue my degree, should I worry about applying to jobs? Especially if I’ve been so close in final rounds?

Thank you for reading, I know it was long :) I’ll try to put a TLDR or something down here. Please be candid but constructive!

TLDR: I graduated bootcamp with no degree. Have had many unsuccessful final rounders, and am now pursuing a CS Degree. Should I keep applying or just finish school? I’m guessing the tech jobs will always be there lol."

Don't actually have many ECs to write about for college, which I'm worried about. I'm a member in one club (do a little coding every week and that's it for the club), and I'm a part-time founding SWE at a small start-up made by some friends. Next sem I'll try to join a research group I was interested in, but my main concern is that I won't have time. Trying to take massive workloads (3 CS classes, real analysis, and probability next sem), so I can graduate early in case I don't transfer.

Also put a lot of time into recruiting past fall, so I managed to land a summer internship @ FAANG (normal SWE, not underclassmen-only position), as well as a fall internship @ top unicorn (recent IPO). Not sure how much these will matter though, since I've heard a lot of schools don't even look at resumes.

Mainly aiming for CMU (dream school in HS) but I know that's very unrealistic since it looks like they accept 1 or 2 max to SCS every year. Open to suggestions for other schools to consider. Also, since I'm doing an internship in the fall, I'll be looking to either spring transfer as a sophomore, or possibly junior transfer fall 2023. Would this affect the list I should apply to?

I'm also wondering if my reason to transfer is a bit weak? At the rate I'm taking classes rn, I can take upper-level cs classes in my sophomore year, but due to registration priority it's nearly impossible to get into any of these (especially the popular ones like OS and ML) as a sophomore. Also, even though my school has a very strong CS program, I've taken a look at open-source material from some of the classes and it's not as rigorous or theoretical as some schools like CMU."

**Letters of Recommendation**

Engineering Teacher (9/10) : They are the head of my magnet program and he sponsored the school's robotics team that I'm a captain of.  We have a really good relationship and he's known me since freshman year.

World Teacher (6/10) : Had him online, really nice guy, I had my camera on and participated in class most of the time.  Probably pretty mediocre tbh.

Counselor (8/10) : I really got to know him well over the summer and during my senior year, he called me personally to help someone who he thought I'd tutor well a couple months back so I think he thinks somewhat highly of me.

Supplemental Recs from both of my internship professors.  I saw one of them and it was really really good.  He talked about personal experiences with me and said I worked at the level of a grad student.   I can imagine the other professor wrote a good rec for me as well since they were pretty excited for me when I asked them to write me one, but who knows.

**Interviews**

MIT (7-8/10): Lasted a little over an hour.  We talked about my career aspirations, why I wanted to go to MIT, my passions.   He seemed pretty interested and engaged with me so overall I think it was alright.

Columbia (9/10): I thought this interview was incredible.  We talked for more than an hour about NYC, columbia engineering and why its so cool and unique, I talked about my link to NY with my family.  I ended up finding out her daughter was a part of the same club that I do my sport with.  Overall really great conversation.

**Essays**

My personal statement was about overcoming an injury and how it changed my outlook on life and led me to do all the things I have done.  It was pretty unique, definitely not a generic sports injury essay, didn't really focus on the injury, that was just the start.

MIT supplements: I think these were the best supplemental essays I wrote/have wrote for all my apps.

Columbia supplements: These were good, but I think my diversity essay was sketch because I wrote about being multiracial (but the problem is I'm the two most common races at columbia lol).

UChicago: My choice essay was fun to write and my friends all thought it was great.  The why Uchicago essay was kinda boring but I did write about specifics and personal connections.

Deferred:

* Columbia Engineering ED

rslyb6,0,2021-12-31,How much knowledge/experience do I need in order to get an internship as a high schooler?,XVI_ONYX,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rslyb6/how_much_knowledgeexperience_do_i_need_in_order/,"How many personal projects would you recommend? Is there any metric that would let me know if I sufficiently grasped the basics needed to land myself a software engineering internship (i.e. Leetcode)?

For context, I’m a high school junior in Miami (not the best tech city, lol) who took APCSP last year and is currently take APCSA (Java). I have most of the VERY basics of Java and Python down, along with a lil bit of Javascript. I obviously don’t currently have the skills to apply to one right now but I might start self-studying additional Java/Python concepts, grinding Leetcode, making some large and challenging projects I have been planning on making (i.e. workout app), etc.. I would say my greatest issue would be communication and being able to explain these concepts/terminologies in layman terms, so if y’all can help me with that I’ll appreciate it, as I’m sure that will be essential in the workplace

I would just like to know how to prepare for these future internships, if they are even attainable at my educational level. Any advice from fellow Miami residents would ve appreciated. Also, sorry if I seem ignorant on this subject since I only recently decided to take CS as my career path and as such am not well-versed in stuff like this, lol."

Regardless of anything, I’m really happy I got this opportunity and I can only hope to grow my experience even further to shoot my salary through the moon! Again, thank you all.

Since I'm on break, I've started learning programming with JavaScript so I could start making projects for a portfolio for my resumé. However, as I taking note to some of the project examples I see out on the internet, I feel like there's so much complexity to them that I might not be able to fully understand it or make something of equal caliber before I graduate. I've seen videos recommending project-based learning (as opposed to tutorial-based), which I tried out by trying to make a color-flipper, but I ended up copying the tutorial directly since I had *absolutely no idea* what to do. I know it'll take time to learn programming substantially, but to get enough internships under my belt before I graduate so I can get hired for a good software engineering position, I'm honestly not sure if I have enough time - which is why I ask what would be a rough estimate of what I should strive to know by the end of my four years in college."

**Extracurriculars/Activities**

vv scared of getting doxxed so sorry for how vague it is, but you can get the point that they weren't that significant

1. student board member for my school district: literally had only been doing it for 2 weeks at the time of writing application, lightly spoke about it in one supplemental. 1st person to serve this role in my district's history (was just introduced this year lol)
2. internship at state capitol: actually did this for a big chunk of 2021, talked about it a lot in essays
3. student gov vice president: never touched on it outside of ec's section in common app. i did stuff for it, but also never really learned much from it
4. NHS pres: \^
5. mathletes pres: \^\^ i am so bad at math lmfao this i will fully admit was a filler ec. it was more of a social club than a serious math comp club
6. tennis: only did frosh/soph, played varsity soph yr, was really bad, no team awards (mvp, captain) or actual competition wins lol

**Awards/Honors**

truly insignificant. 

1. state history day runner up
2. regional history day winner
3. ap scholar w/ distinction
4. school honor roll

**Letters of Recommendation**

frosh yr algebra 1 /now my ap calc ab+bc teacher: we have a very close relationship bc she is the advisor for mathletes, and we've continued to be close since i had her as a freshman. i think good rec?? i'm gonna be generous and say 8.3/10

ap lang teacher: had her over zoom last yr so not the closest, but to a degree, we definitely have a personal relationship and close connection. hypothetically...bc idk if this is legal or in good practice, but if hypothetically i were to be able to have read the rec she wrote for me, i'd say 8.5/10

internship manager/person who generally oversaw my work: i was the only intern for 5/8 months i was there, we had a pretty nice connection and had several non-work related deep chats. we got pretty personal at times, and i accidentally saw the letter bc she accidentally emailed it to me. **note tho: she wrote the letter, but had the politician pen it as their own letter** ***pls college gods don't let someone dox me and get my acceptance rescinded or something*** 7/10

**Interviews**

ehh.. could have been better, could have been worse. she lowkey tried to challenge me and told me she disagreed with my policy stances regarding school board stuff. i stood my ground, explained my thoughts to her, and i believe we ended by agreeing to think more about each other's perspectives. she also asked me what my ultimate goals were (i said some cliche thing about making a difference in my community through public policy) and she told me my goals were too unrealistic and naive/broad/unattainable (i agreed that it could use some restructuring, and that going to yale would help me lock down more achievable goals) 

**Essays**

i can fully admit my essays could have been better. when i read them over i realized i made several spelling + grammatical errors (i probably made several in this post too). i did my essays in somewhat of a rush, and submitted at like 10:30 pm on the due date. none of my essays were super quirky or unique, they also were not super tragic or hardship-esque either (bc i do not have those experiences but no hate to anyone who is able to write those types of essays). content wise, i would argue pretty good though. they had a very strong poli sci focus, and i spoke about some experiences that made me as passionate as i now am about public service.

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

*Acceptances:*

* yale (rea): accepted yay and committed
* sonoma state (rd, rolling): accepted lmao but withdrew 

not applying anywhere else, applied to two csu's beforehand, but i already withdrew them.

**Additional Information:**

writing out my stats is...well um, as you can see, my stats are pretty shit compared to all these other people lmao. i will admit that possibly if i was a little more detailed about some of my ec's or essays the acceptance would maybe make a little more sense. but looking at everything, i honestly think a good portion of what made my mediocre app seem better is the context of my school. my school has pretty bad resources and my most significant ec's/experiences were attained bc of my own searching/determination/luck/whatever you want to call it. all in all, live life, don't stress, and just try to do good in your own context! not the genius kid that goes to 70k/yr boarding school who's a 4-time legacy (i have met those exact ppl in the admitted students group no hate to them tho) :)))"

https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/rs5esh/top_bschools_latest_employment_outcomes/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

INSEAD

1. INSEAD is an absolute MONSTER for Consulting! It sends almost HALF the class to this industry, and over 75% of those grads end up at MBB! It is quite simply the best consulting school in the world, even excluding sponsored grads - called MckInsead for a reason! 

2. It’s middle of the road for Tech and Entrepreneurship outcomes, but is rather underwhelming for Finance and especially PE/VC. Not sure how much of this is due to the program structure (short duration with a lack of internship) or self selection (most people wanting to be consultants), but that 2% for PE/VC does stick out like a sore thumb. 

LBS

1. LBS does exceptionally well and is 2nd best in the world (ahead of all US schools) for consulting and MBB outcomes - 40% to Consulting out of which ~60% end up at MBB!

2. LBS shines in Tech also and sends the highest % of grads to Tech (joint 1st with GSB). It is the 2nd best among the top schools in terms of FAANG outcomes (Joint 2nd with Booth). 

3. LBS also has great Entrepreneurship outcomes and comes 3rd only behind GSB and HBS. It’s PE/VC outcomes are solid as well and are in line with non-HSW M7. Traditionally strong in Finance and with the above noted strengths, LBS is truly a Master of All Trades and NOT a master of none. 

Kellogg

1. Strongest amongst the US schools for Consulting and MBB outcomes, and 3rd best in the world after INSEAD and LBS. 

2. Kellogg’s strength in Tech in also noteworthy! It’s the 2nd best after LBS/GSB, and should be the school of choice if one is aiming for FAANG. 

3. Slightly lukewarm Finance numbers overall, but does very well in PE/VC in spite of that. 

4. It’s entrepreneurship numbers.. let’s not talk about that 😋

Booth

1. 2nd best in the US after Kellogg for Consulting and half of the consultants go to MBB. 

2. Very decent tech placement and has one of the best outcomes for FAANG recruitment. 

3. Best PE/VC numbers outside of HSW. Reasonably strong in Finance also. Booth’s strength is spread across all major industries very evenly, just like LBS’s - they are both true all-rounders. 

Columbia

1. Naturally strongest in Finance and sends the highest % to this industry (along with Wharton). If it’s Finance, it is HSWC! 

2. Great outcomes for Consulting also, with 33% going there. But slightly lower MBB numbers, so relatively more T2 outcomes than peers. 

3. Slightly light on Tech and Entrepreneurship outcomes. 

Sloan

1. Sloan is 3rd best after LBS/GSB and Kellogg for Tech outcomes. 

2. Over 60% of consultants go to MBB - this MBB/Consulting ratio is 2nd best after INSEAD. 

3. Decent in Finance, PE/VC, and Entrepreneurship - nothing to write home about, but nothing to scoff at either. 

4. Sloanies are also big on Healthcare opportunities (believe ~10% of the class) - this explains the relatively middle-of-the-road %s wrt the 3 major industries. 

HSW

1. GSB rules PE/VC, and Entrepreneurship, and is joint 1st for Tech with LBS. Only sends 15% to Consulting, but this is likely due to self-selection (just like it is for lower numbers for other schools at this level). 

2. HBS is 2nd best for PE/VC and Entrepreneurship. 

3. Wharton is tops for Finance and 3rd best for PE/VC. 

4. None of them provides employer-level details.

Essay 3: Pick one woman to talk to: TW!!! 
I spoke about an Indian immigrant woman who killed her husband in self defence due to domestic abuse and how she managed to overturn her murder conviction in the UK.

Advice: I feel like being from a school which is not very well known, having no hooks as well as my 9th and 10th gpa (i had few Bs in 9th and 10th grade)  made me very nervous! Further I didn’t take a science class till 11th grade, a foreign language class till S2 of 10th grade and a history class till 12 grade. I think my essays, certain test scores, letters of recommendation, and ECs made me stand out since I matched the vibe of my ED school!!

**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**

Accepted: 
- Barnard College of Columbia University ED (Attending!!!)


As someone who wanted to go to a small college with in a large community, have a HWC experience and also a co-Ed experience, and go to a HWC LAC and an Ivy- the experience of Barnard+ Columbia is perfect for me! I’m so excited this has been my dream school for so long and I couldn’t imagine myself anywhere else &lt;3"

Currently a college student doing CS/polisci interested in working with startups. I was wondering if there is a good spot to be searching for swe/web development/product internships at startups specifically. I feel like Linkedin is clogged with Fortune 500 job opportunities and was wondering if there was a platform more specifically for finding startup jobs for this summer. Let me know if any of you have had luck with specific platforms for searching for startup work! Thanks."
rt2k98,6,2021-12-31,"Having trouble finding a career path, to move away from job insecurity and low pay as a software engineer",Sea_Let_2036,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/rt2k98/having_trouble_finding_a_career_path_to_move_away/,"I might be one of the older people posting here, but I have 9 years of experience in software engineering, not counting the years of accumulated downtime from being unemployed and looking for work. In all, 13 years have actually passed from my first job as a software engineer to now. 4 years were me job hunting and unemployed.

Some have been be surprised that I am a software engineer with years of experience, but still having issues getting paid well or securing a job. And yes, I live in the US. Thing is, I went very much away the beaten path for what's expected of a software engineer. And that's causing a lot of problems with employers on how to best place me for a job. That's the conclusion other programmers came to when [I outlined my job history in a different post](https://old.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/rnzurd/ive_been_changing_jobs_regularly_but_i_still_feel/)

The normal, well-worn path is to get a CS degree, first full-time junior engineer job, get 1-2 job changes and promotions, moving to mid-level and senior, and working for bigger companies and interesting projects worth adding to your resume, and so forth.

My career has rarely been like that. I was self-taught as a programmer, found my first jobs on Craigslist with underpaid work, spent my years writing code exclusively in side gigs and contracts, but very few recruiters count those as good experiences. I never worked W2 so I don't qualify for unemployment benefits.

I'm not even that good at running my own freelance gig business, and I don't care to. I just want a normal full-time job because I'm almost 40 and I never technically worked a full-time W2 job.

So I want to move my career into a more familiar pattern to get into better jobs, and find something appropriate can be the ""bridge"" going from screwing around programming gigs without a clear career strategy, to having a safe, if still rather average, path to career security as a software engineer. I have considered 2 options

* Option 1 is going to school and getting a CS degree in 2-3 years. It's more guided and you also have opportunities for internships. I don't care how old I am I just want internship at big company to be on my bucket list so I can say I at least did a portion of a regular CS student experience.

* Option 2 is just looking for right job that can help me transition from clueless wanderer to a well-presented professional so I have something on my resume that is safe and familiar, and hopefully put all these terrible job hunting experiences behind me. It may take less than 3 years but it also feels more vague and intimidating, because the tricky part is that the company also has to be willing to hire me as-is, as I have no clue on what ""cures"" exist for very slow movers in software careers.

I will admit I might push back against doubts for option 1 because I think it's better to have tried a CS degree and failed to get much from it than regret not trying it at all. But I'd like to know what you would suggest, or add to my suggestions. Because I'm not finding any career-related jobs that seem very viable for someone with my job history."
rt2upg,6,2021-12-31,New grad advice - 1+ year out and struggling to find work,throwawayokay221,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/rt2upg/new_grad_advice_1_year_out_and_struggling_to_find/,"Hi all. I get my Bachelor's in Design with a minor in CS. I worked a year internship after graduating in 2020 doing UX Research and I hated it and ended up hanging out with the engineering team when I could.

I want to switch back to CS, which is the majority of what I did in undergrad (we had an impacted major so I couldn't switch into it, but all my electives were cs classes) but I don't really know which area of cs to go into and if I'll be able to find a job competing against people who got a major.

I considered signing with Revature just to get my foot in the door, but 1. Reading Reddit put me off it it, it seems scammy, and 2. After my interview with them, I was already advanced enough that they suggested I could teach the class if I aced the bootcamp.

JUMP HERE:
What tech stack do I need to learn to get hired? My strongest language is Java. I've heard of Spring. Should I learn that? What about a gui framework like Swing?
Second strongest language is C++. I dabbled a bit in python and did a computer vision elective. Would be interesting to self-learn neural network things.

Are there contacting agencies like Revature but less scammy who can help you get hired? I'd love to work through a contracting agency to have better chances and take the pressure off job hunting."

how are these viewed? Should I even include them on my CS resume? what can I do at my internship this summer to gear it more towards CS (i was thinking something along the lines of automation)?"

Is there a particular area of computer science where it is easier to get an internship than another? Ex. Is it easier to get a frontend internship as a freshman vs. a backend? Is it just too late to apply for internships at this stage in the game?

A little bit about my experience (Skip if you want)- I've applied to 75 internships, 8 of which sent back a HackerRank test (each of which I've failed). Since then, I've been spending time honing my skills on leetcode, but I feel like I might be jumping the gun too early. I've talked to my college career advisor about it and she recommended that I study more leetcode instead of making more projects since that is where I am the weakest. But I'm wondering if my projects are even valuable to the industry (as I have only developed a few games using Unity and Godot). It's also annoying to me as a beginner that I have to study leetcode along with being marketable in some other area of computer science, as leetcode seems to have very little to do with anything else.

It's winter break and I want to spend my time productively somehow. Should I spend it learning front-end and making projects? Should I spend it studying leetcode? Or is there something that I am completely missing?"

Similarly to the other thread, I'd appreciate hearing when you interned and what school year you are now (plus school type/ranking if you're willing to share), the team and location, and interviews/offers received after completing the internship. Would also love to hear your experience as well.

Thanks!"
